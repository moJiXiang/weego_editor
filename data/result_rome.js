Exhibits range from Egyptian mummies and Etruscan bronzes to Old Masters and modern paintings, but the main drawcards are the spectacular classical statuary and Michelangelo’s frescoes in the Sistine Chapel. Housing the museums are the lavishly decorated halls and galleries of the Palazzo Apostolico Vaticano. This vast 5.5-hectare complex consists of two palaces – the Vatican palace (nearer to St Peter’s) and Belvedere Palace – joined by two long galleries. On the inside are three courtyards: the Cortile della Pigna, the Cortile della Biblioteca and, to the south, the Cortile del Belvedere. You’ll never cover it all in one day – there are about 7km of exhibits – so it pays to be selective.On the whole, exhibits are not well labelled, so consider hiring an audioguide (€7) or buying the Guide to the Vatican Museums and City (€14) .The museums are well equipped for visitors with disabilities with suggested itineraries, lifts and specially fitted toilets. Wheelchairs are available free of charge from the Special Permits desk in the entrance hall, and can be reserved by emailing accoglienza.musei@scv.va. Parents with toddlers can take pushchairs into the museums.Pinacoteca Often overlooked by visitors, the papal picture gallery boasts Raphael’s last work, La Trasfigurazione (Transfiguration; 1517– 20), and paintings by Giotto, Bellini, Caravaggio, Fra Angelico, Filippo Lippi, Guido Reni, Van Dyck, Pietro da Cortona and Leonardo da Vinci, whose San Gerolamo (St Jerome; c 1480) was never finished.Museo Gregoriano Egizio (Egyptian Museum) Founded by Gregory XVI in 1839, this museum contains pieces taken from Egypt in Roman times. The collection is small but there are fascinating exhibits including the Trono di Rameses II , part of a statue of the seated king, vividly painted sarcophagi dating from around 1000 BC, and some macabre mummies.Museo Chiaromonti & Braccio Nuovo The Museo Chiaramonti is effectively the long corridor that runs down the lower east side of the Belvedere Palace. Its walls are lined with thousands of statues representing everything from immortal gods to playful cherubs and ugly Roman patricians. Near the end of the hall, off to the right, is the Braccio Nuovo (New Wing), which contains a famous sculpture of Augustus and a statue depicting the Nile as a reclining god covered by 16 babies.Museo Pio-Clementino This stunning museum contains some of the Vatican Museums’ finest classical statuary, including the peerless Apollo Belvedere and the 1st-century Laocoön , both in the Cortile Ottagono (Octagonal Courtyard). Before you go into the courtyard take a moment to admire the 1st-century Apoxyomenos, one of the earliest known sculptures to depict a figure with a raised arm.To the left as you enter the courtyard, the Apollo Belvedere is a 2nd-century Roman copy of a 4th-century-BC Greek bronze. A beautifully proportioned representation of the sun god Apollo, it’s considered one of the great masterpieces of classical sculpture. Nearby, the Laocoön depicts a muscular Trojan priest and his two sons in mortal struggle with two sea serpents.Back inside the museum, the Sala degli Animali is filled with all sorts of sculpted creatures and some magnificent 4th-century mosaics. Continuing through, you come to the Galleria delle Statue , which has several important classical pieces; the Sala delle Buste , which contains hundreds of Roman busts; and the Gabinetto delle Maschere , named after the floor mosaics of theatrical masks. To the east, the Sala delle Muse is centred on the Torso Belvedere , another of the museum’s must-sees. A fragment of a muscular Greek sculpture from the 1st century BC, it was used by Michelangelo as a model for his ignudi in the Sistine Chapel.The next room, the Sala Rotonda , contains a number of colossal statues, including the gilded-bronze figure of an odd-looking Ercole (Hercules) and an exquisite floor mosaic. The enormous basin in the centre of the room was found at Nero’s Domus Aurea and is made out of a single piece of red porphyry stone.Museo Gregoriano Etrusco On the upper level of the Belvedere Palace (off the 18th-century Simonetti staircase), the Museo Gregoriano Etrusco contains artefacts unearthed in the Etruscan tombs of northern Lazio, as well as a collection of Greek vases and Roman antiquities. Of particular interest is the Marte di Todi (Mars of Todi), a full-length bronze of a warrior dating from the 4th century BC.Galleria delle Carte Geografiche (Map Gallery) The last of three galleries – the other two are the Galleria dei Candelabri (Gallery of the Candelabra) and the Galleria degli Arazzi (Tapestry Gallery) – this 120m-long corridor is hung with 40 16th-century topographical maps of Italy.Stanze di Raffaello (Raphael Rooms) These four frescoed chambers were part of Pope Julius II’s private apartments. Raphael himself painted the Stanza della Segnatura (1508–11) and the Stanza d’Eliodoro (1512–14), while the Stanza dell’Incendio (1514–17) and Sala di Costantino (1517–24) were decorated by students following his designs.The first room you come to is the Sala di Costantino , which features a huge fresco depicting Constantine’s defeat of Maxentius at the battle of Milvian Bridge.The Stanza d’Eliodoro , which was used for private audiences, takes its name from the Cacciata d’Eliodoro (Expulsion of Heliodorus from the Temple), an allegorical work reflecting Pope Julius II’s policy of forcing foreign powers off Church lands. To its right, the Messa di Bolsena (Mass of Bolsena) shows Julius paying homage to the relic of a 13th-century miracle at the lakeside town of Bolsena. Next is the Incontro di Leone Magno con Attila (Encounter of Leo the Great with Attila) by Raphael and his school, and, on the fourth wall, the Liberazione di San Pietro (Liberation of St Peter), a brilliant work illustrating Raphael’s masterful ability to depict light.The Stanza della Segnatura , Julius’ study and library, was the first room that Raphael painted, and it’s here that you’ll find his great masterpiece, La Scuola di Atene (The School of Athens) featuring philosophers and scholars gathered around Plato and Aristotle. The seated figure in front of the steps is believed to be Michelangelo, while the figure of Plato is said to be a portrait of Leonardo da Vinci, and Euclide (the bald man bending over) is Bramante. Raphael also included a self-portrait in the lower right corner – he’s the second figure from the right.The most famous work in the Stanza dell’Incendio di Borgo is the Incendio di Borgo (Fire in the Borgo), which depicts Pope Leo IV extinguishing a fire by making the sign of the cross. The ceiling was painted by Raphael’s master, Perugino.Sistine Chapel (Capella Sistina) This is the one place in the Vatican Museums that everone wants to see, and on a busy day it can attract up to 20,000 people. Home to two of the world’s most famous works of art – Michelangelo’s ceiling frescoes and the Giudizio Universale (Last Judgment) – this 15th-century chapel also serves an important religious function as the place where the conclave meets to elect a new pope.The ceiling frescoes , which are best viewed from the chapel’s main entrance in the east wall (opposite the visitor entrance), are centred on nine panels depicting scenes from the Creation, the story of Adam and Eve, the Fall, and the plight of Noah.As you look up from the east wall, the first panel is the Drunkenness of Noah , followed by the Flood, and Noah’s Sacrifice . Next, the Temptation and Expulsion of Adam and Eve from the Garden of Eden famously depicts Adam and Eve being sent packing after accepting the forbidden fruit from Satan, represented by a snake with the body of a woman coiled around a tree. The Creation of Eve is then followed by the Creation of Adam . This, one of the most famous images in Western art, shows a bearded God pointing his finger at Adam, thus bringing him to life. Completing the sequence are the Separation of Land from Water ; the Creation of the Sun, Moon and Planets ; and God Separating Light from Darkness , featuring a fearsome God reaching out to touch the sun. Set around the central panels are 20 athletic male nudes, known as ignudi .Opposite, on the west wall is Michelangelo’s mesmeric Giudizio Universale , showing Christ – in the centre near the top – passing sentence over the souls of the dead as they are torn from their graves to face him. The saved get to stay up in heaven (in the upper right), the damned are sent down to face the demons in hell (in the bottom right).Near the bottom, on the right, you’ll see a man with donkey ears and a snake wrapped around him. This is Biagio de Cesena, the papal master of ceremonies, who was a fierce critic of Michelengelo’s composition. Another famous figure is St Bartholomew, just beneath Christ, holding his own flayed skin. The face in the skin is said to be a selfportrait of Michelangelo, its anguished look reflecting the artist’s tormented faith.The chapel’s walls also boast superb frescoes. Painted in 1481–82 by a crack team of Renaissance artists, including Botticelli, Ghirlandaio, Pinturicchio, Perugino and Luca Signorelli, they represent events in the lives of Moses (to the eft looking at the Giudizio Universale ) and Christ (to the right). Highlights include Botticelli’s Temptations of Christ and Perugino’s Christ Giving the Keys to St Peter ."},

Today, its impressive but badly labelled ruins give some hint of this but you'll still have to use your imagination to picture it as it once was. Landmark sights include the Arco di Settimia Severo and the nearby Curia, seat of the Roman senate.Originally an Etruscan burial ground, the Forum was first developed in the 7th century BC and expanded over subsequent centuries. Its importance declined after the 4th century until eventually it was used as pasture land. In the Middle Ages it was known as the Campo Vaccino (literally 'Cow Field') and extensively plundered for its stone and marble. The area was systematically excavated in the 18th and 19th centuries, and excavations continue to this day.Entering from Largo della Salara Vecchia (you can also enter directly from the Palatino) you'll see the Tempio di Antonino e Faustina, ahead to your left. Erected in AD 141 by the Senate and dedicated to the empress Faustina and later to the emperor Antoninus Pius, it was transformed into a church in the 8th century, so the soaring columns now frame the Chiesa di San Lorenzo in Miranda. To your right the Basilica Fulvia Aemilia, built in 179 BC, was a 100m-long public hall, with a two-storey porticoed facade lined by shops. Opposite the basilica stands the Tempio di Giulio Cesare (Temple of Julius Caesar) built by Augustus in 29 BC.At the end of the short path you come to the Via Sacra, which traverses the Forum from northwest to southeast. Head right up Via Sacra and you reach the Curia, the meeting place of the Roman Senate, which was rebuilt by Julius Caesar, Augustus, Domitian and Diocletian, before being converted into a church in the Middle Ages. What you see today is a 1937 reconstruction of Diocletian's Curia. The bronze doors are copies – the originals were used by Borromini for the Basilica di San Giovanni in Laterano.In front of the Curia, and hidden by scaffolding, is the Lapis Niger, a large piece of black marble that covered a sacred area said to be the tomb of Romulus.At the end of Via Sacra stands the 23m-high Arco di Settimio Severo (Arch of Septimius Severus). Dedicated to the eponymous emperor and his two sons, Caracalla and Geta, it was built in AD 203 to celebrate the Roman victory over the Parthians. Nearby, at the foot of the Tempio di Saturno, is the Millarium Aureum, which marked the centre of ancient Rome, from where distances to the city were measured.On your left are the remains of the Rostrum, an elaborate podium where Shakespeare had Mark Antony make his famous 'Friends, Romans, countrymen…' speech. In front of this, the Colonna di Foca (Column of Phocus) marks the centre of the Piazza del Foro, the Forum's main market and meeting place. The last monument erected in the Roman Forum, it was built in honour of the Eastern Roman Emperor Phocus.The eight granite columns that rise up behind the Colonna are all that remain of the 5th-century Tempio di Saturno (Temple of Saturn), one of Rome's most important temples and home to the state treasury. Behind the temple, backing onto the Capitoline Hill, are (north to south) the ruins of Tempio della Concordia (Temple of Concord), the remaining columns of Tempio di Vespasiano (Temple of Vespasian and Titus) and the Portico degli Dei Consenti.Passing over to the path that runs parallel to Via Sacra, you'll see the stubby ruins of the Basilica Giulia, which was begun by Julius Caesar and finished by Augustus. At the end of the basilica are the three Corinthian columns of the Tempio di Castore e Polluce (Temple of Castor and Pollux), built at the beginning of the 5th century BC to mark the defeat of the Etruscan Tarquins in 489 BC. South of the temple is the Chiesa di Santa Maria Antiqua, the oldest Christian church in the Forum.Back towards Via Sacra is the Casa delle Vestali (House of the Vestal Virgins), home of the virgins who tended the sacred flame in the adjoining Tempio di Vesta. The six priestesses were selected from patrician families when aged between six and 10 to serve in the temple for 30 years. If the flame in the temple went out the priestess responsible would be flogged, and if she lost her virginity she would be buried alive, since her blood couldn't be spilled. The offending man would be flogged to death.Continuing up Via Sacra, past the Tempio di Romolo (Temple of Romulus), you come to the Basilica di Massenzio, the largest building on the forum. Started by the Emperor Maxentius and finished by Constantine in 315 (it's also known as the Basilica di Costantino), it originally covered an area of approximately 100m by 65m. A colossal statue of Constantine, pieces of which are on display at the Capitoline Museums, was unearthed at the site in 1487.Beyond the basilica, you come to the Arco di Tito (Arch of Titus), built in AD 81 to celebrate Vespasian and Titus' victories against Jerusalem. In the past, Roman Jews would avoid passing under this arch, the historical symbol of the beginning of the Diaspora."},

A monument to centuries of artistic genius, it contains some spectacular works of art, including three of Italy’s most celebrated masterpieces: Michelangelo’s Pietà , his breathtaking dome, and Bernini’s baldachin (canopy) over the papal altar.It's also one of Rome's busiest tourist attractions, drawing up to 20,000 people on a busy day. So expect queues and remember to dress appropriately – no shorts, miniskirts or bare shoulders.The original basilica was commissioned by the emperor Constantine and built around 349 on the site where St Peter is said to have been buried between AD 64 and 67. But like many medieval churches, it eventually fell into disrepair and it wasn’t until the mid-15th century that efforts were made to restore it, first by Pope Nicholas V and then, rather more successfully, by Julius II.In 1506 Bramante came up with a design for a basilica based on a Greek-cross plan, with four equal arms and a huge central dome. But on Bramante’s death in 1514, construction work ground to a halt as architects, including Raphael and Antonio da Sangallo, tried to modify his original plans. Little progress was made and it wasn’t until Michelangelo took over in 1547 at the age of 72 that the situation changed. Michelangelo simplified Bramante’s plans and drew up designs for what was to become his greatest architectural achievement, the dome. He never lived to see it built, though, and it was left to Giacomo della Porta and Domenico Fontana to finish it in 1590.With the dome in place, Carlo Maderno inherited the project in 1605. He designed the monumental facade and lengthened the nave towards the piazza.Free English-language tours of the basilica are run from the Vatican tourist office, the Centro Servizi Pellegrini e Turisti, at 9.45am on Tuesday and Thursday and at 2.15pm every afternoon between Monday and Friday.The Facade Built between 1608 and 1612, Carlo Maderno’s immense facade is 48m high and 118.6m wide. Eight 27m-high columns support the upper attic on which 13 statues stand representing Christ the Redeemer, St John the Baptist and the 11 apostles. The central balcony is known as the Loggia della Benedizione , and it’s from here that the pope delivers his Urbi et Orbi blessing at Christmas and Easter.Interior The cavernous 187m-long interior covers more than 15,000 sq metres and contains many spectacular works of art, including Michelangelo's hauntingly beautiful Pietà at the head of the right nave. Sculpted when he was only 25, it is the only work he ever signed – his signature is etched into the sash across the Madonna's breast.Nearby, the red disc just inside the main door marks the spot where Charlemagne and later Holy Roman Emperors were crowned by the pope.Dominating the centre of the basilica is Bernini's 29m-high baldachin . Supported by four spiral columns and made with bronze taken from the Pantheon, it stands over the high altar, which itself sits on the site of St Peter's grave. The pope is the only priest permitted to serve at the high altar.Above, Michelangelo's dome soars to a height of 119m. Based on Brunelleschi's design for the Duomo in Florence, the towering cupola is supported by four solid stone piers, named after the saints whose statues adorn their Bernini-designed niches – Longinus, Helena, Veronica and Andrew.At the base of the Pier of St Longinus, to the right as you face the high altar, is a bronze statue of St Peter , believed to be a 13th-century work by Arnolfo di Cambio. It's a much-loved piece and its right foot has been worn down by centuries of pilgrims' kisses and caresses.Dome To climb the dome , the entrance is to the right of the basilica. A small lift takes you halfway up, but it's still a long climb to the top (320 steps). Press on, however, and you're rewarded with stunning views. It's well worth the effort, but bear in mind that it’s a long and tiring climb and not recommended for those who suffer from claustrophobia or vertigo.Museo Storico Artistico Accessed from the left nave, the Museo Storico Artistico sparkles with sacred relics and priceless artefacts, including a tabernacle by Donatello and the 6th-century Crux Vaticana , a jewel-studded cross that was a gift of the emperor Justinian II.Vatican Grottoes Extending beneath the basilica, the Vatican Grottoes were created as a burial place for popes. You’ll see the tombs and sarcophagi of many popes, as well as several huge columns from the original 4th-century basilica.Tomb of St Peter Excavations beneath the basilica have uncovered part of the original church and what the Vatican believes is the Tomb of St Peter . In 1942 the bones of an elderly, strongly built man were found in a box hidden behind a wall covered by pilgrims' graffiti. After more than 30 years of forensic examination, in 1976 Pope Paul VI declared the bones to be those of St Peter.The excavations can only be visited on a 90-minute guided tour.

It was here that Romulus supposedly founded the city in 753 BC and Rome's emperors lived in unabashed luxury. Highlights include the ruins of the main imperial palace and the grandstand views over the Roman Forum from the Orti Farnesiani.Roman myth holds that Romulus established Rome on the Palatino after he'd killed his twin Remus in a fit of anger. There's obviously no proof of this but archaeological evidence has dated human habitation on the Palatino to the 8th century BC.As the most central of Rome's seven hills (and because it was both close to and above the Roman Forum) the Palatino was the ancient city's most sought-after address. The emperor Augustus lived here all his life and successive emperors built increasingly opulent palaces. However, after Rome's decline it fell into disrepair, and in the Middle Ages churches and castles were built over the ruins. During the Renaissance, members of wealthy families established gardens on the hill.Most of the Palatino as it appears today is covered by the ruins of Emperor Domitian's vast complex, which served as the main imperial palace for 300 years. Divided into the Domus Flavia (imperial palace), Domus Augustana (the emperor's private residence) and a stadio (stadium), it was built in the 1st century AD.On entering the complex from Via di San Gregorio, head uphill until you come to the first recognisable construction, the stadio, probably used by the emperors for private games and events. Adjoining the stadium are the remains of the complex built by Septimius Severus, comprising baths (the Terme di Settimio Severo) and a palace (the Domus Severiana).On the other side of the stadio are the ruins of the huge Domus Augustana, the emperor's private residence. It was built on two levels, with rooms leading off a peristilio (peristyle or garden courtyard) on each floor. You can't get down to the lower level, but from above you can see the basin of a fountain and beyond it rooms that were paved with coloured marble. In 2007 a mosaic-covered vaulted cavern was discovered more than 15m beneath the Domus. Some believe this to be the Lupercale, a cave believed by ancient Romans to be where Romulus and Remus were suckled by a wolf.The grey building near the Domus Augustana houses the Museo Palatino and its collection of archaeological artefacts. Highlights include a beautiful 1st-century bronze, the Erma di Canefora, and a wonderful bust of Giovane Principessa, daughter of Nero's successor Marcus Aurelius.North of the museum is the Domus Flavia, the public part of the palace complex. This was centred on a grand columned peristyle – the grassy area you see with the base of an octagonal fountain – off which the main halls led. To the north was the emperor's throne room; to the west, a second big hall that the emperor used to meet his advisors; and to the south, a large banqueting hall, the triclinium.Among the best-preserved buildings on the Palatino is the Casa di Livia, northwest of the Domus Flavia. Home to Augustus' wife Livia, it was built around an atrium leading onto what were once reception rooms, decorated with frescoes of mythological scenes, landscapes, fruits and flowers. In front is the Casa di Augusto, Augustus' separate residence, which contains superb frescoes in vivid reds, yellows and blues.Behind the Casa di Augusto are the Capanne Romulee (Romulean Huts), where it is thought Romulus and Remus were brought up after their discovery by the shepherd Faustulus.Northeast of the Casa di Livia lies the criptoportico, a 128m tunnel where Caligula was thought to have been murdered, and which Nero later used to connect his Domus Aurea with the Palatino. Lit by a series of windows, it was once decorated by elaborate stucco. Nowadays it's used to stage temporary exhibitions.The area west of this was once Tiberius' palace, the Domus Tiberiana, but is now the site of the 16th-century Orti Farnesiani, one of Europe's earliest botanical gardens. Twin pavilions stand at the northern point of the garden, commanding breathtaking views over the Roman Forum."},

Originally known as the Flavian Amphitheatre, the 50,000-seat Colosseum (Colosseo) was inaugurated in AD 80 and used to stage spectacular gladiatorial games in front of baying, bloodthirsty crowds. Two thousand years on and it's Italy's top tourist attraction, drawing up to five million visitors a year.Built by the emperor Vespasian (r AD 69–79) in the grounds of Nero's palatial Domus Aurea, the Colosseum was completed in AD 80 after eight years' construction. To mark the occasion, Vespasian's son and successor Titus (r 79–81) held games that lasted 100 days and nights, during which some 5000 animals were slaughtered. Trajan (r 98–117) later topped this, holding a marathon 117-day killing spree involving 9000 gladiators and 10,000 animals.The 50,000-capacity arena was originally named the Flavian Amphitheatre after Vespasian's family name, and although it was Rome’s most fearful arena, it wasn’t the biggest – the Circo Massimo could hold up to 250,000 people. The name Colosseum, when introduced in medieval times, was not a reference to its size but to the Colosso di Nerone, a giant statue of Nero that stood nearby.The outer walls have three levels of arches, articulated by columns topped by capitals of the Ionic (at the bottom), Doric and Corinthian (at the top) orders. The external walls were originally covered in travertine, and marble statues once filled the niches on the 2nd and 3rd storeys. The upper level, punctuated with windows and slender Corinthian pilasters, had supports for 240 masts that held up a canvas awning over the arena, shielding the spectators from sun and rain. The 80 entrance arches, known as vomitoria, allowed the spectators to enter and be seated in a matter of minutes.The Colosseum's interior was divided into three parts: the arena, cavea and podium. The arena had a wooden floor covered in sand to prevent the combatants from slipping and to soak up the blood. Trapdoors led down to the underground chambers and passageways beneath the arena floor – the hypogeum. Animals in cages and sets for the various battles were hoisted onto the arena by a complicated system of pulleys. The cavea, for spectator seating, was divided into three tiers: knights sat in the lowest tier, wealthy citizens in the middle and the plebs in the highest tier. The podium, a broad terrace in front of the tiers of seats, was reserved for emperors, senators and VIPs.With the fall of the empire in the 6th century, the Colosseum was abandoned. In the Middle Ages, it became a fortress occupied by two of the city's warrior families: the Frangipani and the Annibaldi.Damaged several times by earthquakes, it was later used as a quarry for travertine and marble for Palazzo Venezia, Palazzo Barberini and Palazzo Cancelleria among other buildings. Pollution and vibrations caused by traffic and the metro have also taken their toll.The top tier and hypogeum are open to the public by guided tour only. Visits, which cost €8 on top of the normal Colosseum ticket, require advance booking."},

There's also an excellent picture gallery with masterpieces by the likes of Titian, Tintoretto, van Dyck, Rubens and Caravaggio.The entrance is in Palazzo dei Conservatori, where you'll find the original core of the sculptural collection on the 1st floor and the Pinacoteca (picture gallery) on the 2nd floor.Before you head upstairs, take a moment to admire the ancient masonry littered around the ground-floor courtyard, most notably a mammoth head, hand and foot. These all come from a 12m-high statue of Constantine that originally stood in the Basilica di Massenzio in the Roman Forum.Of the sculpture on the 1st floor, the Etruscan Lupa Capitolina (Capitoline Wolf) is the most famous. Donated to the Roman people by Pope Sixtus IV, the 5th-century-BC bronze wolf stands over her suckling wards Romulus and Remus, who were added in 1471. Other highlights include the Spinario , a delicate 1st-century-BC bronze of a boy removing a thorn from his foot, and Gian Lorenzo Bernini's Medusa . Also on this floor, in the modern Exedra of Marcus Aurelius, is the original of the equestrian statue that you see in the piazza.Upstairs, the Pinacoteca contains paintings by Titian, Tintoretto, Reni, Van Dyck, Rubens and Caravaggio. The Sala Santa Petronella boasts two important works by Caravaggio: La buona ventura (The Fortune Teller; 1595), which shows a gypsy pretending to read a young man's hand but actually stealing his ring; and San Giovanni Battista (St John the Baptist; 1602), a sensual and unusual depiction of the New Testament saint.A tunnel links Palazzo dei Conservatori to Palazzo Nuovo on the other side of the square via the Tabularium, ancient Rome's central archive, beneath Palazzo Senatorio.Palazzo Nuovo contains some real show-stoppers. Chief among them is the Galata morente (Dying Gaul), a Roman copy of a 3rd-century-BC Greek original that touchingly depicts the anguish of a dying Frenchman.

It's housed in the Casino Borghese, whose neoclassical look is the result of a 17th-century revamp of Scipione's original villa.The villa is divided into two parts: the ground-floor gallery, with its superb sculptures, intricate Roman floor mosaics and over-the-top frescoes; and the upstairs picture gallery.Things get off to a cracking start in the entrance hall, decorated with 4th-century floor mosaics of fighting gladiators and a gravity-defying bas-relief, Marco Curzio a Cavallo, of a horse and rider falling into the void, by Pietro Bernini (Gian Lorenzo's father).Sala I is centred on Antonio Canova's daring depiction of Napoleon's sister, Paolina Bonaparte Borghese, reclining topless as Venere vincitrice (Conquering Venus; 1805–08). Yet it's Gian Lorenzo Bernini's spectacular sculptures – flamboyant depictions of pagan myths – that really steal the show. Just look at Daphne's hands morphing into leaves in the swirling Apollo e Dafne (1622–25) in Sala III, or Pluto's hand pressing into the seemingly soft flesh of Persephone's thigh in the Ratto di Proserpina (Rape of Persephone; 1621–22) in Sala IV.Caravaggio dominates Sala VIII. There's a dissipated-looking Bacchus (1592–95), the strangely beautiful La Madonna dei Palafenieri (Madonna with Serpent; 1605–06) and San Giovanni Battista (St John the Baptist; 1609–10), probably Caravaggio's last work. Then there's the much-loved Ragazzo col Canestro di Frutta (Boy with a Basket of Fruit; 1593–95) and the dramatic Davide con la Testa di Golia (David with the Head of Goliath; 1609–10) – Goliath's severed head is said to be a self-portrait.Upstairs, the pinacoteca offers a wonderful snapshot of European Renaissance art. Don't miss Raphael's extraordinary La Deposizione di Cristo (The Deposition; 1507) in Sala IX, and his Dama con Liocorno (Lady with a Unicorn; 1506). In the same room is the superb Adorazione del Bambino (Adoration of the Christ Child; 1495) by Fra Bartolomeo and Perugino's Madonna con Bambino (Madonna and Child; first quarter of the 16th century).Other highlights include Correggio's erotic Danae (1530–31) in Sala X, Bernini's self-portraits in Sala XIV and Titian's early masterpiece, Amor Sacro e Amor Profano (Sacred and Profane Love; 1514) in Sala XX."},

In its current form it dates to around AD 120 when the emperor Hadrian built over Marcus Agrippa’s original 27 BC temple – note Agrippa's name inscribed on the pediment. The dome, considered the Romans’ greatest architectural achievement, is the largest unreinforced concrete dome ever built.Hadrian's temple was dedicated to the classical gods – hence the name Pantheon, a derivation of the Greek words pan (all) and theos (god) – but in AD 608 it was consecrated as a Christian church. During the Renaissance it was much studied (Brunelleschi used it as inspiration for his Duomo in Florence) and became an important burial chamber. Today you'll find the tomb of the artist Raphael, alongside those of kings Vittorio Emanuele II and Umberto I.However, the real fascination of the Pantheon lies in its massive dimensions and extraordinary dome. A tour de force of ancient engineering, it was the largest dome in the world until the 15th century and is still the largest unreinforced concrete dome in existence. Its harmonious appearance is due to a precisely calibrated symmetry – its diameter is exactly equal to the Pantheon's interior height of 43.3m. Light enters through the oculus, an 8.7m opening in the dome that also served as a symbolic connection between the temple and the gods. Rainwater enters but drains away through 22 almost-invisible holes in the sloping marble floor.Somewhat the worse for wear, the exterior is still imposing, with 16 Corinthian columns (each a single block of stone) supporting a triangular pediment. Rivets and holes in the brickwork indicate where the original marble-veneer panels were removed.Thanks to its consecration as a church in the 7th century, the building was spared the Christian neglect that left other structures to crumble, although it wasn't entirely safe from plundering hands. The gilded-bronze roof tiles were removed and Bernini used bronze from the portico for the baldachin at St Peter's Basilica. Thankfully, the original Roman bronze doors remain."},

Built over the ruins of the 1st-century Stadio di Domiziano (Domitian’s Stadium), it is centred on Bernini’s showy Fontana dei Quattro Fiumi (Fountain of the Four Rivers), representing the rivers Nile, Ganges, Danube and Plate.For almost 300 years from the time it was paved over in the 15th century, the piazza was home to Rome's main market. And while the market traders have long since gone the crowds continue to come to bask in its baroque beauty. Of the piazza's three fountains, Bernini's high-camp Fontana dei Quattro Fiumi dominates. Depicting personifications of four great rivers, it's festooned with a palm tree, lion and horse and topped by an obelisk. Legend has it that the figure of the Nile is shielding his eyes from the Chiesa di Sant'Agnese in Agone, designed by Bernini's bitter rival, Borromini. The truth, more boringly, is that Bernini completed his fountain two years before his contemporary started work on the facade and the gesture indicates that the source of the Nile was unknown at the time.At the northern end of the piazza is the 19th-century Fontana del Nettuno, while the Fontana del Moro to the south was designed in 1576. Bernini added the Moor holding a dolphin in the mid-17th century, and the surrounding Tritons are 19th-century copies. Piazza Navona's largest building is the 17th-century Palazzo Pamphilj, built for Pope Innocent X and now home to the Brazilian Embassy."},

It is still Rome’s official cathedral and the pope’s seat as the bishop of Rome.Surmounted by fifteen 7m-high statues – Christ with St John the Baptist, John the Evangelist and the 12 Apostles – Alessandro Galilei’s huge white facade is a mid-18th century example of late-baroque classicism. The central bronze doors were moved here from the Curia in the Roman Forum, while on the far right, the carved Holy Door is only opened in Jubilee years. The interior has been revamped on numerous occasions, although it owes much of its present look to Francesco Borromini who redecorated it for the 1650 Jubilee. It’s a breathtaking sight with a spectacular gilt ceiling, a beautiful 15th-century mosaic floor, and a wide central nave lined with 4.6m-high sculptures of the apostles. At the head of the nave, the Gothic baldachin over the papal altar is a dramatic work containing the relics of the heads of saints Peter and Paul. In front of the altar, a double staircase leads down to the confessio, which houses the Renaissance tomb of Pope Martin V.Behind the altar, the massive apse is decorated with sparkling mosaics, parts of which date to the 4th century, but most of which was added in the 19th century.On the first pilaster in the right-hand nave is an incomplete Giotto fresco. While admiring it, cock your ear towards the next pilaster, where a monument to Pope Sylvester II (r 999–1003) is said to sweat and creak when the death of a pope is imminent.

Particularly spectacular are the 5th-century mosaics in the triumphal arch and nave, depicting Old Testament scenes. Binoculars will come in handy. The central image in the apse, signed by Jacopo Torriti, dates from the 13th century and represents the coronation of the Virgin Mary.The baldachin over the high altar seethes with gilt cherubs; the altar itself is a porphyry sarcophagus, which is said to contain the relics of St Matthew and other martyrs.
