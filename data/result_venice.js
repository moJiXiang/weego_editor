The seat of Venice’s government for nearly seven centuries, this powerhouse stood the test of storms, crashes and conspiracies – only to be outwitted by Casanova, the notorious seducer who escaped from the attic prison.ExteriorAfter fire gutted the original palace in1577, Venice considered Palladio’s offer to build one of his signature neoclassical temples in its place. Instead, Antonio da Ponte won the commission to restore the palace's Gothic facade with white Istrian stone and Veronese pink marble. Da Ponte's Palazzo effortlessly mixes past with present and business with pleasure, capping a graceful colonnade with medieval capitals depicting key Venetian guilds. The loggia along the piazzetta (little square) may seem like a fanciful flourish, but it served a solemn purpose: death sentences were read between the ninth and 10th columns from the left. Facing the piazza, Zane and Bartolomeo Bon’s 1443 Porta della Carta (Paper Door) was an elegant point of entry for dignitaries, and served as a public bulletin board for government decrees.CourtyardEntering through the colonnaded courtyard you’ll spot Sansovino’s brawny statues of Apollo and Neptune flanking Antonio Rizzo’s Scala dei Giganti (Giants’ Staircase). Recent restorations have preserved charming cherubim propping up the pillars, though slippery incised-marble steps remain off-limits. On the east side of the courtyard arcade were the dreaded Poggi (Wells), where prisoners shivered below water level – but now a baggage deposit is installed in their place.First FloorClimb the Scala dei Censori (Stairs of the Censors) to the Doge’s Apartments , where the doge lived under 24-hour guard with a short commute to work up a secret staircase . Walk up a couple of steps and turn around to spot Titian’s painting of St Christopher wading across troubled lagoon waters over the archway. The 18 roaring lions decorating the doge's Sala degli Stucci are reminders that Venice's most powerful figurehead lived like a caged lion in his gilded suite, which he could not leave without permission. Still, consider the real estate: a terrace garden with private entry to the basilica, and a dozen salons with splendidly restored marble fireplaces carved by Tullio and Antonio Lombardo. The Sala del Scudo (Shield Room) is covered with world maps that reveal the extents of Venetian power (and the limits of its cartographers) c 1483 and 1762. The New World map places California near Terra Incognita d'Antropofagi (Unknown Land of the Maneaters), aka Canada, where Cuzco is apparently located.Second FloorHead up Sansovino’s 24-carat gilt stuccowork Scala d’Oro (Golden Staircase) and emerge into rooms covered with gorgeous propaganda. In Palladio-designed Sala delle Quattro Porte (Hall of the Four Doors), ambassadors awaited ducal audiences under a lavish display of Venice's virtues by Giovanni Cambi, whose over-the-top stuccowork earns him the nickname Bombarda. Other convincing shows of Venetian superiority include Titian’s 1576 Doge Antonio Grimani Kneeling Before Faith amid approving cherubs and Tiepolo’s 1740s Venice Receiving Gifts of the Sea from Neptune , where Venice is a gorgeous blonde casually leaning on a lion.Delegations waited in the Anticollegio (Council Antechamber), where Tintoretto drew parallels between Roman gods and Venetian government: Mercury and the Three Graces reward Venice’s industriousness with beauty, and Minerva Dismissing Mars is a Venetian triumph of savvy over brute force. The recently restored ceiling is Veronese’s 1577 Venice Distributing Honours , while on the walls is a vivid reminder of diplomatic behaviour to avoid: Veronese’s Rape of Europe .Few were granted an audience in the Palladio-designed Collegio (Council Room), where Veronese’s 1575–78 Virtues of the Republic ceiling shows Venice as a bewitching blonde waving her sceptre like a wand over Justice and Peace. Father-son team Jacopo and Domenico Tintoretto attempt similar flattery, showing Venice keeping company with Apollo, Mars and Mercury in their Triumph of Venice ceiling for the Sala del Senato (Senate Hall), but frolicking lagoon sea-monsters steal the scene.Government cover-ups were never so appealing as in the Sala Consiglio dei Dieci (Trial Chambers of the Council of Ten; Room 20), where Venice’s star chamber plotted under Veronese’s Juno Bestowing Her Gifts on Venice , a glowing goddess strewing gold ducats. Over the slot where anonymous treason accusations were slipped in in the Sala della Bussola (Compass Room; Room 21) is his St Mark in Glory ceiling.The cavernous 1419 Sala del Maggior Consiglio (Grand Council Hall) features the doge’s throne with a 22m-by-7m Paradise backdrop (by Tintoretto’s son Domenico) that’s more politically correct than pretty: heaven is crammed with 500 prominent Venetians, including several Tintoretto patrons. Veronese’s political posturing is more elegant in his oval Apotheosis of Venice ceiling, where gods marvel at Venice’s coronation by angels, with foreign dignitaries and Venetian blondes rubbernecking on the balcony below."},

Peggy's Palazzo Venier dei Leoni is a showcase for surrealism, futurism and abstract expressionism by some 200 breakthrough modern artists, including Peggy’s ex-husband Max Ernst and Jackson Pollock (among her many rumoured lovers).CollectionPeggy collected according to her own convictions rather than for prestige or style, so her collection includes inspired folk art and lesser-known artists alongside Kandinsky, Picasso, Man Ray, Rothko, Mondrian, Joseph Cornell and Dalí. Major modernists also contributed custom interior decor, including the Calder silver bedstead hanging in the former bedroom. In the corners of the main galleries, you’ll find photos of the rooms as they appeared when Peggy lived here, in fabulously eccentric style.For this champion of modern art who’d witnessed the dangers of censorship and party-line dictates, serious artwork deserved to be seen and judged on its merits. The Jewish American collector narrowly escaped Paris two days before the Nazis marched into the city, and arrived in Venice in 1948 to find the city’s historically buoyant spirits broken by war. More than a mere tastemaker, Peggy became a spirited advocate for contemporary Italian art, which had largely gone out of favour with the rise of Mussolini and the partisan politics of WWII. Peggy sparked renewed interest in postwar Italian art and resurrected the reputation of key Italian Futurists, whose dynamic style had been co-opted to make Fascism more visually palatable. Her support led to reappraisals of Umberto Boccioni, Giorgio Morandi, Giacomo Balla, Giuseppe Capogrossi and Giorgio de Chirico, and aided Venice’s own Emilio Vedova and Giuseppe Santomaso. Never afraid to make a splash, Peggy gave passing gondoliers an eyeful on her Grand Canal quay: Marino Marini’s 1948 Angel of the City , a bronze male nude on horseback visibly excited by the possibilities on the horizon.Garden & PavilionThe Palazzo Venier dei Leoni was never finished, but that didn’t stop Peggy Guggenheim from filling every available space indoors and out with art. Wander past bronzes by Moore, Giacometti and Brancusci, Yoko Ono’s Wish Tree and a shiny black-granite lump by Anish Kapoor in the sculpture garden , where the city of Venice granted Peggy an honorary dispensation to be buried beneath the Giacometti sculptures and alongside her dearly departed lapdogs in 1979. Through the gardens is a pavilion housing a sunny cafe, a bookshop, bathrooms, and temporary exhibits highlighting underappreciated modernist rebels. Around the corner from the museum on Fondamenta Venier dei Leoni is a larger museum shop , selling art books in several languages and replicas of Peggy’s signature glasses – winged, like the lion of San Marco."},

The former Santa Maria della Carità convent complex maintained its serene composure for centuries, but ever since Napoleon installed his haul of Venetian art trophies in 1807, there’s been nonstop visual drama inside these walls. Rooms 1-5To guide you through the ocular onslaught, the gallery layout is loosely organised by style and theme from the 14th to 18th centuries, though recent restorations and works on loan have shuffled around some masterpieces. The grand gallery you enter upstairs features vivid early works that show Venice's precocious flair for colour and drama. Case in point: Jacobello Alberegno's late-14th-century Apocalypse (Room 1) shows the whore of Babylon riding a hydra, babbling rivers of blood from her mouth. At the opposite end of the emotional spectrum is Paolo Veneziano’s 1553–59 Coronation of Mary (Room 1), where Jesus bestows the crown on his mother with a gentle pat on the head to the tune of an angelic orchestra. UFO arrivals seem imminent in the eerie, glowing skies of Carpaccio’s Crucifixion and Glorification of the Ten Thousand Martyrs of Mount Ararat (Room 2) – Harry’s Bar was apt in naming its shimmering, raw-beef dish after him. But Giovanni Bellini's Pala di San Giobbe (Room 2) shows hope on the horizon, in the form of a sweet-faced Madonna and Child emerging from a dark niche as angels tune their instruments. The martyrs surrounding them include St Roch and St Sebastian, suggesting that this luminous, uplifting work dates from the dark days of Venice's second plague in 1478.Lock eyes with fascinating strangers across portrait-filled Room 4. Hans Memling captures youthful stubble and angst with the exacting detail of a Freudian miniaturist in Portrait of a Young Man , while Giorgione's sad-eyed La Vecchia (Old Woman) points to herself as the words 'with time' unfurl ominously in the background.Rooms 6-10Venice's Renaissance awaits around the corner in Room 6, featuring Titian and Tintoretto. Tintoretto’s Creation of the Animals is a fantastical bestiary suggesting God put forth his best efforts inventing Venetian seafood (no argument here). Tintoretto's 1562 St Mark Saving a Saracen from Shipwreck is an action-packed blockbuster, with fearless Venetian merchants and an improbably muscular, long-armed saint rescuing a turbaned sailor. Titian’s 1576 Pietà was possibly finished posthumously by Palma il Giovane, but notice the smears of paint Titian applied with his bare hands and the column-base self-portrait, foreshadowing Titian's own funeral monument.Artistic triumph over censorship dominates Room 10: Paolo Veronese’s freshly restored Feast in the House of Levi , originally called Last Supper until Inquisition leaders condemned him for showing dogs, drunkards, dwarves, Muslims and Reformation-minded Germans cavorting with Apostles. He refused to change a thing, besides the title, and Venice stood by this act of defiance against Rome. Follow the exchanges, gestures and eye contact among the characters, and you’ll concede that not one Turkish trader, clumsy server, gambler or bright-eyed lapdog could have been painted over without losing an essential piece of the Venetian puzzle.Rooms 11-19Now that you've reached the halfway mark of Venice’s contributions to art history, you'll notice a lighter baroque touch and more down-to-earth subject matter. As you enter Room 11, you may feel observed by the gossipy Venetian socialties hanging over balconies in 1743–45 lunettes by Tiepolo. These charming ceiling details originally hung in the Scalzi Church, and were narrowly salvaged after 1915 Austrian bombings. Rooms 12-18 are currently undergoing restoration to showcase Canaletto’s sweeping views of Venice and Giorgione’s highly charged La Tempesta (The Storm). Art historians still debate the meaning of the mysterious nursing mother and passing soldier with a bolt of summer lightning: is this an expulsion from Eden, an allegory for alchemy, or a reference to Venice conquering Padua in the War of Cambria? Restored portrait galleries will feature larger-than-life Venetian characters: Lorenzo Lotto’s soul-searching Portrait of a Young Scholar ; Rosalba Carriera’s brutally honest self-portrait; Pietro Longhi’s lovestruck violinist watching a twirling debutante in The Dance Lesson ; and a saucy, fate-tempting socialite in Giambattista Piazzetta’s Fortune-Teller .Rooms 20-24Finales don't come any grander than the Accademia's final suite of rooms. Room 20 is currently undergoing restorations to accommodate Gentile Bellini and Vittore Carpaccio's Venetian versions of Miracles of the True Cross , thronged with multicultural merchant crowds. After careful restoration, the original convent chapel (Room 23) is a serene showstopper fronted by a Bellini altarpiece , with temporary shows in the center. Ornamental splendours were reserved for the Scuola della Carita's boardroom, the newly restored Sala dell’Albergo . Board meetings would not have been boring here, under a lavishly carved ceiling and facing Antonio Vivarini's wrap-around 1441–50 masterpiece, filled with fluffy-bearded saints keeping a watchful eye on boardroom proceedings. Titian closes the Accademia with his touching 1534–39 Presentation of the Virgin . Here, a young, tiny Madonna trudges up an intimidating staircase while a distinctly Venetian crowd of onlookers point to her example – yet few of the velvet- and pearl-clad merchants offer alms to the destitute mother, or even feed the begging dog."},

Baldassare Longhena's uplifting design is an engineering feat that defies simple logic, and in fact the church is said to have mystical curative properties. Titian eluded the plague until age 94, leaving a legacy of masterpieces now in Salute's sacristy.Longhena's marvel makes good on an official appeal by the Venetian Senate directly to the Madonna in 1630, after 80,000 Venetians had been killed by plague brought in by a carpenter working on Venice's quarantine island, the Lazzaretto Vecchio. The Senate promised the Madonna a church in exchange for her intervention on behalf of Venice – no expense or effort spared. Before 'La Salute' could even be started, at least 100,000 pylons had to be driven deep into the barene (mud banks) to shore up the tip of Dorsoduro.The Madonna provided essential inspiration, but La Salute draws its structural strength from a range of architectural and spiritual traditions. Architectural scholars note striking similarities between Longhena's unusual domed octagon structure and both Greco-Roman goddess temples and Jewish cabbala diagrams. The lines of the building ingeniously converge beneath the dome to form a vortex on the inlaid marble floors, and the black dot at the centre is said to radiate healing energy.The newly restored sacristy is a wonder within a wonder, featuring 12 key works by Titian – including a vivid self-portrait in the guise of St Matthew and his earliest known work from 1510, Saint Mark on the Throne . Salute's most charming allegory for Venice's miraculous survival from plague is Palma Il Giovane's painting of Jonah emerging from the mouth of the whale, where the survivor stomps down the sea creature's tongue like an action hero walking the red carpet. Life in a time of plague is a miracle worth celebrating in Tintoretto’s upbeat 1561 Wedding Feast of Cana, featuring a Venetian throng of multi-culti musicians, busy wine pourers, and Tintoretto himself in the pink, gently schooling a young, thin-bearded Paolo Veronese.Thousands still observe the annual pilgrimage on Festa della Madonna della Salute, heading across a pontoon bridge from Piazetta Santa Maria del Giglio to the church, where Venetians light candles for the continued health of their families and their extraordinary city. Unlike many Venetian churches, Salute remains an active place of prayer and reflection; out of respect for worshippers, no flash photography is allowed."},

In AD 828, wily Venetian merchants allegedly smuggled St Mark’s corpse out of Egypt in a barrel of pork fat to avoid inspection by Muslim customs authorities. Venice built a golden basilica around its stolen saint, whose bones were misplaced twice during construction (oops). ExteriorChurch authorities in Rome took a dim view of Venice’s tendency to glorify itself and God in the same breath, but Venice defiantly created the official doge’s chapel in its own cosmopolitan image, with Byzantine onion-bulb domes, Greek cross layout and Egyptian marble walls. The brick basilica is clad in patchworks of marbles and reliefs from Syria, Egypt and Palestine – priceless trophies from Crusades conquests and battles with Genoa. At the southwestern corner is the Four Tetrarchs , an Egyptian porphyry statue supposedly representing four emperors of ancient Rome looted from Constantinople. FacadeThe front of the basilica ripples and crests like a wave, its five niched portals capped with shimmering mosaics and frothy stonework arches. In the far-left portal, lunette mosaics dating from 1270 show St Mark’s stolen body arriving at the basilica – a story reprised in 1660 lunette mosaics on the second portal from the right. The far-right portal is another masterpiece of architectural thievery: over Greek columns and a Moorish arch is a lacy screen that might have been a Turkish sultan's balcony. Grand entrances are made through the central portal, under an ornate triple arch with Egyptian purple porphyry columns and 13th- to 14th-century reliefs of vines, virtues and astrological signs.Dome MosaicsBlinking is natural upon your first glimpse of the basilica's glittering mosaics, many made with 24-carat gold leaf fused onto the back of the glass to represent divine light. Just inside the narthex (vestibule) glitter the basilica's oldest mosaics: Apostles with the Madonna , standing sentry by the main door for more than 950 years. The atrium’s medieval Dome of Genesis depicts the separation of sky and water with surprisingly abstract motifs, anticipating modern art by 650 years. Last Judgment mosaics cover the atrium vault and the Apocalypse looms large in vault mosaics over the gallery.Mystical transfusions occur in the Dome of the Holy Spirit , where a dove’s blood streams onto the heads of saints. In the central 13th-century Cupola of the Ascension , angels swirl overhead while dreamy-eyed St Mark rests on the pendentive. Scenes from St Mark’s life unfold over the main altar, in vaults flanking the Dome of the Prophets (best seen from the Pala d’Oro).The roped-off circuit of the church interior is free and takes about 15 minutes. Silence is requested, but gasping understandable. For entry, dress modestly (ie knees and shoulders covered) and leave large bags around the corner at Ateneo di San Basso's free one-hour baggage storage .Pala d'OroTucked behind the main altar containing St Mark’s sarcophagus is the Pala d’Oro, studded with 2000 emeralds, amethysts, sapphires, rubies, pearls and other gemstones. But the most priceless treasures here are biblical figures in vibrant cloisonné, begun in Constantinople in AD 976 and elaborated by Venetian goldsmiths in 1209. The enamelled saints have wild, unkempt beards and wide eyes fixed on Jesus, who glances sideways at a studious St Mark as Mary throws up her hands in wonder – an understandable reaction to such a captivating scene. Look closely to spot touches of Venetian whimsy: falcon-hunting scenes in medallions along the bottom, and the by-now-familiar scene of St Mark's body smuggled out of Egypt on the right.MuseumSan Marco remained the doge’s chapel until 1807, and the ducal treasures upstairs in the Museo put a king’s ransom to shame. Gilt bronze horses taken by Venice from Constantinople were stolen in turn by Napoleon but eventually returned to the basilica and installed in the 1st-floor gallery. Portals lead from the gallery on to the giddiness-inducing Loggia dei Cavalli , where reproductions of the horses gallop off the balcony over Piazza San Marco. In the Museo's displays of restored 13th- to 16th-century mosaic fragments, the Prophet Abraham is all ears and raised eyebrows, as though scandalised by Venetian gossip. On an interior balcony, Salviati's restored 1542–52 mosaic of the Virgin's family tree shows Mary's ancestors perched on branches, alternately chatting and ignoring one another, as families do. Hidden over the altar is the doge's banquet hall , where dignitaries wined and dined among lithe stucco figures of Music, Poetry and Peace.TreasuryHoly bones and booty from the Crusades fill the Tesoro , including a 10th-century rock-crystal ewer with winged feet made for Fatimid Caliph al-'Aziz-bi-llah. Don't miss the bejeweled 12th-century Archangel Michael icon, featuring tiny, feisty enameled saints that look ready to break free of their golden setting and mount a miniature attack on evil. Velvet-padded boxes preserve doges' remains alongside alleged saints' relics, including St Roch's femur, St Mark's thumb, the arm St George used to slay the dragon and even a lock of the Madonna's hair."},

If you scan the top floors of the buildings ringing the Campo di Ghetto Nuovo , you can spot three synagogues, or schole (literally, ‘schools’), distinguished from the residential housing by the small domes that indicate the position of the pulpit. A plain wood cupola in the corner of the campo marks the location of the Schola Canton (Corner Synagogue). Next door is the Schola Tedesca (German Synagogue), recognisable by rows of five larger windows. When Jewish merchants fled the Spanish Inquisition for Venice in 1541, there was no place to go but up: around the Campo di Ghetto Nuovo and the adjacent Campo di Ghetto Vecchio , additional storeys atop existing buildings housed new arrivals and publishers.

The Schola Levantina (Levantine Synagogue) has a magnificent 17th-century woodworked pulpit, while the main hall of the Schola Spagnola (Spanish Synagogue) is reached by a sweeping staircase. On the Campo di Ghetto Nuovo, the rooftop Schola Italiana (Italian Synagogue) is a simple synagogue built by newly arrived and largely destitute Italian Jews, who had fled from what was then Spanish-controlled southern Italy. After Napoleon lifted restrictions in 1797, Ghetto residents gained standing as Venetian citizens. But Mussolini’s 1938 race laws were throwbacks to the 16th century, and in 1943 most of the 1670 Jews in Venice were rounded up and sent to concentration camps; only 37 returned. Today Venice’s Jewish community numbers around 400, including a few families in the Ghetto. A starting point to explore this pivotal community in Venetian arts, architecture and commerce is the Museo Ebraico (Jewish Museum), where English-language tours leave every half-hour starting at 10.30am, and head inside three of the Ghetto synagogues, including the Schola Canton, Schola Italiana and either the Schola Levantina during summer or the Schola Spagnola in winter. Opened in 1955, the museum has a small collection of finely worked silverware and other Judaica art objects used in private prayer and to decorate synagogues. You can also inquire at the museum about guided tours to the Antico Cimitero Israelitico (Old Jewish Cemetery) on the Lido."},

Around every turn, scientific marvels await discovery in luminous new exhibits.The obvious stars of the museo are the spotlit dinosaurs, including a terrifying ouransaurus from the Sahara and a psittacosaurus mongoliensis, a 120-million-year-old baby-dinosaur skeleton from the Gobi Desert. But the curators and designers of the museum's stunning new exhibits steal the show, leading visitors through evolution with a trail of dinosaur footprints and into galleries that follow the tracks of Venetian explorers. In hot pursuit of ancient legends from mummies to headhunters, macabre colonial trophies like elephant's feet, and circus-sideshow curiosities including a two-headed goat, Venetian explorers like Giuseppe Reali and Giancarlo Ligabue stumbled across wondrous scientific specimens. As you might expect from this lagoon city, the marine-biology exhibits are especially breathtaking. The most startling ceiling in Venice isn't a salon Tiepolo fresco but the museo 's 19th-century wunderkammer (cabinet of curiosities), covered with shark jaws, poisonous blowfish and other outrageous sea creatures. Corals and starfish fill glass columns in the glowing tidepool chamber, leading into a marine-blue room with deep-sea specimens encased in glass bubbles. This undersea journey is accompanied by a spooky soundtrack that brings to mind whale-song recordings and Philip Glass. The museum's grand finale downstairs is comparatively anti-climatic: a fish tank of Venetian coastal specimens bubbling for attention. Still, don't miss a close-up glimpse of the enormous dugout canoe moored at the water door – an unexpected sight for vaporetto riders along the Grand Canal. Alongside the exit staircase you'll notice charming marble heraldic symbols of kissing doves and knotted-tail dogs, dating from the building's history as a ducal palace and international trading house. The dukes of Ferrara had the run of this 12th-century mansion until they were elbowed aside in 1621 to make room for Venice’s most important trading partner: Turkey. Turkish merchants were a constant in Venice throughout the maritime powers’ rocky romance, celebrated with favoured-nation trading status and inter-Adriatic weddings, and tested by periodic acts of piracy, invasion and looting. Dubbed the Fondaco dei Turchi (Turkish Trading House), this building remained rented out to the Turks until 1858. Afterwards, a disastrous renovation indulged 19th-century architectural fancies, including odd crenellations that made the gracious Gothic building resemble a prison. Luckily, the renovation spared the courtyard and charming back garden, which is open during museum hours and ideal for picnics."},

Palladio also designed the monumental refectory , where a Veronese masterpiece, Nozze di Cana (Wedding at Cana), took pride of place – at least until Napoleon came to town. He liked what he saw, so naturally he cut it in two, rolled it up and shipped it off to Paris, where it remains in the Louvre today. But in 2009, filmmaker Peter Greenaway’s celebrated video art projections of Veronese’s painting ‘reinstalled’ the work in its rightful place.

The star of the show, though, is undoubtedly Giovanni Bellini’s Virgin Enthroned with Jesus, an Angel Musician and Saints (1505), which glows like it's plugged into an outlet. Bellini was in his 70s when he painted it and had already been confronted by the first achievements of Giorgione (1477–1510), with his softer sfumato (‘smokey’) technique, which blurred hard lines enhancing the emotional quality of the light, colour and perspective.

From the triple-petalled corollas on the fringes of the Madonna’s mantle in Torcello’s 12th-century mosaics to Queen Margherita’s spider web–fine 20th-century mittens, lace-making was both the creative expression of female sensitivity and a highly lucrative craft. The exhibit starts downstairs with a video explaining the early origins of lace-making and its geographical spread from Northern France to Bohemia, Malta and Turkey, while upstairs four rooms cover the major developments from the 16th to the 20th century. Pattern books, journals, paintings, furniture and costumery place the evolving art in context, starting with ecclesiastical garments and delicate trinette (accessories), and branching out into naughty, fringed underwear and sumptuously embroidered bodices shot through with silver thread. In the final room, bringing it all to life, a group of local lacemakers sit tatting and gossiping beneath pictures of the Lace School (where many of them learnt their craft), which was located here from 1872 to 1970.
