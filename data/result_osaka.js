One hundred thousand workers toiled for three years to construct an 'impregnable' granite castle, finishing the job in 1583. It was destroyed 32 years later by the armies of Tokugawa Ieyasu, rebuilt within 10 years, then suffered a further calamity when another generation of the Tokugawa clan razed it rather than let it fall to the forces of the Meiji Restoration in 1868.The present structure is a 1931 concrete reconstruction of the original, which was refurbished in 1997. The interior houses an excellent collection of displays relating to the castle, Toyotomi Hideyoshi and the city of Osaka. On the 8th floor is an observation deck with 360-degree views. The castle and park are at their colourful best in the cherry-blossom and autumn-foliage seasons.The Ōte-mon gate, the main entrance to the park, is a 10-minute walk northeast of Tanimachi-yonchōme Station (Tanimachi 4-chome) on the Chūō and Tanimachi subway lines.

It once symbolised everything new and exciting about this neighbourhood (shin-sekai is Japanese for 'new world') but today's Shin-Sekai is home to ancient pachinko parlours, rundown theatres and all manner of suspicious characters. But it is packed with cheap eateries: the must-try dish here is kushikatsu (deep-fried meat and vegetables on skewers).

Getting to the top is half the fun – for the final five storeys you take a glassed-in escalator across the open space between the two towers (definitely not one for vertigo sufferers). Tickets for the observation decks can be purchased once you get off the escalator.Below the towers, you'll find Takimi-kōji Alley (滝見小路), a re-creation of an early Shōwa-era market street crammed with restaurants and izakaya (pub-eateries).The building is reached via an underground passage that starts just north of both Osaka and Umeda stations."},
