It was built in 1938, but the design followed the late-Joseon-dynasty style. Murals of scenes from Buddha’s life and the carved floral latticework doors are two of its attractive features. Inside are three giant Buddha statues : on the left is Amitabha, Buddha of the Western Paradise; in the centre is the historical Buddha, who lived in India and achieved enlightenment; on the right is the Bhaisaiya or Medicine Buddha, with a medicine bowl in his hand. The small 15th-century Buddha in the glass case was the main Buddha statue before he was replaced by the much larger ones in 2006. On the right-hand side is a guardian altar with lots of fierce-looking guardians in the painting behind, and on the left side is the altar used for memorial services (white is the funeral colour).Believers who enter the temple bow three times, touching their forehead to the ground – once for Buddha, once for the dharma (teaching) and once for the sangha (monks), 20 of whom serve in this temple. Outside there are candles (like Buddha they light up the world, dispelling darkness and ignorance) and incense sticks (the smoke sends wishes up to heaven).Behind the main shrine is the modern Amitabha Buddha Hall, where funeral services are held. The statues are the 10 judges who pass judgement, 49 days after someone’s death, to decide if they go to heaven or hell.The belfry houses a drum to summon earthbound animals, a wooden fish-shaped gong to summon aquatic beings, a metal cloud-shaped gong to summon birds and a large bronze bell to summon underground creatures. They are banged 28 times at 4am and 33 times at 6pm.The new Central Buddhist Museum (adult/child W2000/1000; open 9am-6pm Tuesday to Sunday) has three galleries of antique woodblocks, symbol-filled paintings and other Buddhist artefacts. In one corner is a teashop, Namu (teas W3000-5000; open 10am to 7pm Monday to Saturday). In another corner is the Information Centre for Foreigners (open 10am to 5pm), staffed by English-speaking Buddhist guides. Making lanterns and prayer beads, doing woodblock printing, painting and drinking green tea are usually possible. The activities are free but donations are welcome. Ask about having a meditation lesson and a four-bowl Buddhist monk meal (W30,000). A temple stay can also be arranged."},

However, on Thursdays between April and November, you can visit unescorted (adult/child W15,000/7500; 9.15am-6.30pm Apr-Nov, last entry 4.30pm). It’s much better going around at your own speed, plus you can see more of the palace and grounds than on the tour. An audio guide can be borrowed free of charge.Changdeokgung was originally built in 1405 as a secondary palace, but when Gyeongbokgung (Seoul’s principal palace) was destroyed during the Japanese invasion in the 1590s, Changdeokgung became the primary palace until 1896. Like all Joseon palaces, it has a mountain behind it and a small stream in front – good pungsu (feng shui).Enter through the imposing gate Donh­wamun, turn right and cross over the stone bridge (built in 1414) – note the guardian animals carved on its sides. On the left is the beautiful main palace building, Injeong­jeon . It sits in harmony with the paved courtyard, the open corridors and the trees behind it. Its size and design are perfect – elegant and colourful but also stately. The electric lights inside are a reminder that Changdeokgung was used as a palace well into the 20th century.Next door are the government office buildings, including one with a blue-tiled roof. Further on are the private living quarters of the royal family. Peering inside the partially furnished rooms, you can feel what these Joseon palaces were like in their heyday – a bustling beehive buzzing round the king, full of gossip, intrigues and whispering. Don’t miss the white-tiled kitchen. Round the back is a terraced garden with decorative ondol chimneys. Over on the right is something completely different – Nakseonjae , built by King Heonjong (r 1834–49) in an austere Confucian style using unpainted wood. Royal descendants lived here until 1989.Walk through the dense woodland and suddenly you come across a serene glade among the large, ancient trees. This is the highlight, Biwon (Huwon), the Secret or Hidden Garden. Here are pavilions on the edge of a square lily pond, with other halls and a two-storey library. The board out the front, written by King Jeongjo, means ‘Gather the Universe’. Joseon kings relaxed, studied and wrote poems in this tranquil setting. The all-important civil service examination, gwageo, took place outdoors here.Further on are a couple more ponds and Yeongyeongdang , a typical yangban house, originally built in 1828 as a place for the Crown Prince to study. Continuing on are more pavilions and ponds, and finally Ongnyuc­heon , where a rock has three Chinese characters inscribed on it by King Injo in 1636: ong-nyu-cheon, which means ‘jade flowing stream’. A poem composed in Chinese characters by King Sukjong (r 1674–1720) was carved into the rock in 1690:‘The stream flows away endlessly/And the waterfall plummets down from the sky/These remind me of a white rainbow, thunder and light flooding the valleys.’A channel was also carved into the rock where the kings and their scholar officials would sail their rice wine cups while writing similar sijo poetry and carousing."},

Despite two kings being crowned here, it became a secondary palace from 1615 until 1897 when King Gojong moved in after leaving the nearby Russian legation.Although he was forced by the Japanese to abdicate 10 years later, Gojong carried on living here in some style until he died in 1919. His son, Sunjong, reigned as a puppet emperor until 1910 when he too was forced to abdicate by the Japanese, who then annexed Korea, bringing the Joseon dynasty to an undignified and abrupt end after more than 500 years.The palace used to be three times as big as it is now, but it still contains small gardens and ponds amid an extraordinary potpourri of contrasting architectural styles. Behind a grand wooden audience hall in traditional Korean style is a fusion-style tea pavilion Heonggwanheon designed by a Russian architect. The tea pavilion has pillars, a veranda and metal railings decorated with deer and bats – both auspicious creatures. This is where King Gojong drank the soothing beverage while discussing current affairs and poetry with his visitors.The stone mythical creatures in the main courtyard are haetae, which are supposed to protect the palace from fire, but in 1904 they must have fallen asleep – the palace burnt down.King Gojong’s living quarters, Hamnyeongjeon , was where he died in 1919, an event which sparked off nationwide protests against Japanese rule.The earlier of the two Romanesque buildings is Seokjojeon (built between 1900 and 1909 and designed by a British archi­tect), which now houses art and craft exhibitions (usually free admission). The other one (designed by a Japanese architect and built in the late 1930s) houses the Deoksugung Museum of Art . With four large galleries on two levels, the exhibitions include major international art shows.The changing of the guards (10.30am, 2pm & 3pm Tue-Sun 15 Feb-31 Dec) is an impressive ceremony involving 50 participants, who dress up as Joseon-era soldiers and bandsmen. Free guided tours of the palace (in English) take place at 10.30am on weekdays and at 1.40pm at the weekend. The ticket office is at the southwest corner of the palace."},

Along with photos, maps and artefacts, the films give a fascinating insight into what the war was like: the surprise 4am attack from the North (spearheaded by 240 Russian-made tanks), the build-up of UN (mainly US) forces in Busan, the daring amphibious landing at Incheon, the sweep north followed by the surprise Chinese attack – all of which took place in 1950.On the left of the museum entrance are the names of UN soldiers killed during the war.On the 3rd floor the Combat Experience Room is just that, and lasts five minutes (every 30 minutes from 9.30am to 4.30pm). Other displays cover Korea’s involvement in the Vietnam War (4700 Koreans died), North Korean attacks on the South since 1953, and Korea’s UN peacekeeping roles.Children love playing on the large military hardware outside – tanks, helicopters, missiles and planes, including a B52 bomber.Every Friday at 2pm from April to June and in October and November a military band performs, and a marching parade culminates in an awesome display of military precision and weapon twirling by the honour guard."},

The museum has books, diaries and relics of the early Catholic converts, some of whom were martyred and became saints. The displays have English descriptions. Downstairs are mementoes of Pope John Paul II’s visit here in 1984. Steadfast early Christian converts faced waves of government persecution, but they refused to recant their new faith. Inside Catholic churches, yangban nobles and ordinary folk sat together as equals in the sight of God, an act that challenged the rigid Confucian hierarchy of Joseon society. Outside the museum are gruesome details of the tortures early Catholics were subjected to by the government, who regarded them as dangerous heretics. Their arms and legs were bent and broken, they were beaten with heavy sticks and hung up in trees by their long hair (in those days all Korean males wore their hair long and tied up in a topknot).
