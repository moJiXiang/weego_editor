"reviewcomment":"One of my favourite places for coffee.  The only downside for me is that I live *just* too far away to make this a regular haunt.  Consequently, I tend to only come here in the summer when the walk is pleasant and nice.  When I arrive, this coffee shop&#39;s popularity is there for the world to see as people drink their coffee beverages on seats on the pavement outside and inside at communal tables.<br><br>The coffee is first class - made with love and care and square mile beans. The cakes are good as well.  If you do sit inside, you get to admire the decor which is done by artists and is rotated regularly.  What is not to like?",

All kinds of food around the world, so whatever you&#39;re feeling- go here. It&#39;s a really good mix of some normal usual cuisines to something a little bit out there like ethiopian food!",

"reviewcomment":"Awesome little coffee shop, accessible in a great area, but just enough tucked away to make it a hidden gem. They offer great filter coffees not always found in other cafés around town, and the baristas are super friendly! One guy engaged me in the most in-depth conversation about coffee I&#39;ve ever had, and even let me try some espresso vs the filter version of the coffee I bought! <br><br>The food options are nice as well--they offer a variety of sandwiches/salads and even soup, which makes the place a prime casual lunch destination. Seating can be scarce, but they have an interesting long bench with individual side tables.<br><br>Make sure to grab a stamp card! It&#39;s really cool anyway--I&#39;ll leave that as a surprise.",

"reviewcomment":"I was slightly skeptical arriving at The Curious Yellow Cafe as it didn&#39;t look so great from the outside and also very small. What have I learnt? Don&#39;t judge a book by its cover! <br><br>Firstly the staff were very warm and welcoming taking our order quickly without being intrusive. We both ordered the vegetarian breakfasts and banana shakes. Both were outstanding. I almost felt guilty as I watched one of the staff leave and return 5 minutes lately with fresh bananas especially for us. There was no &#39;sorry that&#39;s not available.&#39; The breakfast was by far the best vegetarian breakfast I&#39;ve had since being in London. All prepared and cooked right in front of our eyes in the small kitchen behind the counter so we could see what was going into our food. I must make a special mention to the scrambled eggs. I&#39;m not quite sure what she did but they were delicious! Soft but not runny and sweet and savoury at the same time.<br><br>Lastly even though it was only 10.30am we opted for a slice of chocolate beetroot cake as we had heard great things. Who could have ever guessed this could be such a great combo! The beetroot made the cake soft and moist but without overpowering the chocolate and the icing completed the masterpiece.<br><br>This will definitely be on my most recommended cafes list!",

The machine looks as though it should be is a museum and in a way it is. Martyn is stilll today, very much as shops must have been back at the turn of the century, (the previous century).<br>And the produce and service are fantastic. I have just topped up with loose Earl Grey tea and Ian Fleming&#39;s favourite; Wilkinson&#39;s little Scarlet strawberry jam.

All the pale ales I tried (they seem to favor this type, as do I) are rightly hoppy, the stout is almost like a nitro, thick rich, and only the tiniest bit smoky. They&#39;re all about the beer here, no other questions asked, so bring whatever you want (I saw full picnic spreads with knife and cutting board) and camp out for as many rounds as you can stand. <br><br>Make a Saturday of it. There&#39;s a little place to make multiple visits for cured meats just next door, and/or Maltby Street Market is a 10 minute walk, where you can get amazing pungent cheeses, fresh bread from St John, or even go hard: pregame with Gin cocktails, pick up some elaborate sandwiches and stash some dessert for drunken delight. Two more mini breweries are just nearby (Partizan about a 7 min walk, closes at 5pm and Brew by Numbers less than 5 min in the other direction, closes at 6).

In short: it&#39;s an Italian coffee bar that&#39;s open 24 hours. <br><br>It&#39;s not necessarily cozy in there with plush sofas and plenty of seating à la Starbucks. No, there&#39;s a counter with a giant espresso machine, a shelf displaying all kinds of snacks (think Portuguese custards, pannini sandwiches etc) and behind the counter there&#39;s a small army of Italian baristas (the non-hipster and genuine kind) who will serve you up your espresso drink in mere seconds. (This is also not a place where you should ask for complicated coffee concoctions à la Starbucks - keep it simple and real.)<br><br>Given that this is not a place to linger, I typically come here for a quick espresso before heading on to a next destination - whether it be the National Gallery, a musical or a bar nearby. In the summer though, you might be lucky and snatch one of the prime seats outside. That&#39;s actually quite fun, as you can watch and comment on the diverse Soho crowd parading by...",

"reviewcomment":"A wonderful and quaint little place just off the beaten track, that hold charm and charisma.<br><br> There are two parts to this business.<br><br> On the ground level there is a fantastic coffee shop that has a relaxed and informal vibe with an eclectic, homely, but surprisingly airy Decor. This is the perfect place to hang out when on Brick Lane with some time to kill. I personally always go there for a cup of tea to read my book if waiting for friends. Prices are reasonable for what you get, tea cups seem bottomless, and they sell truly scrummy home-made cakes that I would highly recommend.<br><br> In the basement there is a proper vintage shop i.e. not packed to the rafters with horrible acrylic 1970&#39;s dresses and little else that you all too frequently find in so many vintage shops! Here they have some wonderful classic pieces that are well made and truly beautiful. Even if you&#39;re not intent on browsing, it&#39;s worth a visit just to take a walk through a past of apparel.<br><br> When shopping with my mother, she frequently commented on the clothes in this shop as reminding her of not only her childhood, but of the clothes that were owned by her mother and grandmother. As these comments did not accompany our visit to other Brick Lane vintage shops, I feel this is a true testament to the authenticity of the true vintage label attached to these items.<br><br> The cafe is open reasonably late, with regular activities such as life drawing, literary and poetry readings, whilst the basement vintage shop runs regular hours.",

The only bad thing is that they are rather expensive, but you can always wait until there&#39;s a special offer in Tesco/Sainsburys/Waitrose (which happens quite often).<br><br> The campaigns that the company is sometimes involved in, like The Big Knit, with all those people knitting cute and tiny hats for the bottles, are just awesome.

The machine looks as though it should be is a museum and in a way it is. Martyn is stilll today, very much as shops must have been back at the turn of the century, (the previous century).<br>And the produce and service are fantastic. I have just topped up with loose Earl Grey tea and Ian Fleming&#39;s favourite; Wilkinson&#39;s little Scarlet strawberry jam. The change is handed to you through a little hatch. <br>Now wasn&#39;t shopping so much nicer back then!",

"reviewcomment":"If you like cheese, then you need to be very, very careful coming here. You will find it impossible to choose, so you will simply buy many good cheeses. This is an amazing cheesemonger and there isn&#39;t a bad cheese in the place. They&#39;re attentive, knowledgeable and friendly. In addition to having a wonderful array of delicious cheeses, they&#39;ve got fine wines, accessories, sauces, and even fresh sandwiches (using their cheeses, of course).<br><br>I duck in and grab something--anything--and love it every time. You can get unpasteurised cheeses here, which Americans don&#39;t get very much. You can also find brilliant artisanal cheeses where you can learn all about who supplied the milk, who made the cheese, where it comes from, etc. You can practically learn the goats&#39; names.<br><br>If you&#39;re in the Piccadilly Circus / Jermyn Street area, this is absolutely worth stopping in.",

We always shop from here even though the prices aren&#39;t that low, but for the quality you receive I dare say they are pretty decent.<br>At first Macken Bros looks like your typical butcher shop, but in reality it is a place, where quality is the main word. The meat there is always fresh and everything is organic. On special occasions they offer for example turkey, lamb and burgers, which all taste delicious, but you have to wait for one since early morning hours. <br>The staff are all great too. You can clearly see that they are all very well trained and completely understand their work.

"reviewcomment":"One of the great things about visiting London now is that a few of Melbourne&#39;s beloved coffee brands are attempting to make their names internationally known.  And what better way to do this than to open a place in London&#39;s edgiest suburb - Shoreditch.<br><br>This was the old Sharking stomping ground so I know it like the back of my hand.  The area in and around Redchurch Street previously was an area that small places went to open and see if they could make it before moving on to larger scale premises.  The street houses, pubs, hole in the all restaurants, small art galleries and walls where up and coming graffiti artists start out.  How apt that is to then stumble upon one of Melbourne&#39;s best coffee roasters open in the thick of it.<br><br>Inside Allpress Espresso the building it was heaving. It was late afternoon and the joint was jumping and with good reason - it was freezing outside and what better way to warm yourself than stepping inside a coffee house or taking a hot coffee for a walk to warm the hands up.<br><br>Inside they have their own coffee roaster and seemed to be convincing many a Londoner to take a bag of fresh beans home with them.  And even though I didn&#39;t get the chance to try the food, many a table were making good work of what they had received.  Funnily I did a foodie walking tour here and even though it was just getting off the ground, they walked straight past Allpress without giving it a second thought.  I did stop the guide to give her the Melbourne coffee spiel and possibly in the future they will make it a scheduled stop on the tour.  But more on that in it&#39;s own review.",

"reviewcomment":"I&#39;ll be honest. I only really came here to visit the Pet Kingdom, and also a little bit of the Toy Kingdom because I have vague recollections of squealing at a mountain of toys when I was little. <br><br>Imagine my disappointment and distress to find that the Pet Kingdom CLOSED on the 31st January and is being replaced with yet more clothes. You suck, Harrods.<br><br>Ah hem.<br><br>Anyway. Harrods itself is pretty special. Take my advice and pick up the guides they give you at the reception desk. Do NOT make the mistake of thinking &#34;It&#39;s just a shop&#34; because it&#39;s something else entirely.<br><br>It has a department for everything (except pets, grr). Technology, homeware, technology, women&#39;s fashion, food, perfumes, men&#39;s fashion, everything (except pets, grr).<br><br>It kind of works like a giant doughnut with a bit in the middle. You go up the escalators or lift and step on to the floor and walk left... if you keep going round, you&#39;ll end up back where you started. If you detour into the bit in the middle though, who knows where you&#39;ll end up. You&#39;ll be lost forever... or at least a good half an hour.<br><br>Everything is expensive of course. The cheapest cushion there was £59.95. You can get four at Next for the same price. I won&#39;t even go into how much the clothes are either. Just don&#39;t look unless you&#39;re on 100K a year. This is a hard and fast rude throughout Harrods except for two places: the Toy Kingdom and the Food Hall.<br><br>The Toy Kingdom is a place of wonder and magic. It has different sections within it to cater for every type of child or adult refusing to grow up, from reading rooms to lego play areas, to racks of princess dresses and even the sciencey power-a-light-with-a-potato kits. It&#39;s incredible. They even have a section for Harry Potter collectables! Not just the books and toy broomsticks, but actual wands and time turners etc, like the ones on sale at the experience in Watford. Amazing!<br><br>The Food Hall is chock-full of everything you could want. Chocolates, jams, cheese, cakes, fresh fruit and veg and the highest quality produce for only a little more expensive than Waitrose. The cheese is amazing, the jams are varied and delicious, you can get sushi chocolate if you&#39;re prepared to spend £32 for a box and we even saw apples with little hearts actually on the fruit as a special treat for valentine&#39;s day. SO cute. <br><br>To sum it up, if you&#39;ve never been, go. It&#39;s stunning. The architecture is beautiful, the store is shiny and so glossy and if you want to buy something, you&#39;ve got some reasonably priced toys, mementos and food that&#39;ll net you a coveted Harrods bag. But if you&#39;re going there to genuinely do some shopping, go to Selfridges. It&#39;s cheaper, probably a bit more impressive and the dress code is a lot more casual.",

These are the latter, delicious and reasonably priced, not to be confused with the former, which are overpriced (and still delicious). <br><br>Verde &amp; Co has been on my bookmarks list for ages, but a recent brunch encounter with the luminous Linzi M had left us with the need for a little coffee pick-me-up so the moment finally came to tick this one off my list. <br><br>If you&#39;re looking for hot chocolates or mochas, you need to stop in, it&#39;s absolutely perfect. There&#39;s a chocolate counter with some tempting little treats, so we tried a few... here&#39;s the verdict in case you haven&#39;t gathered... <br><br>Yum. <br><br>Lime + dark, cassis, pink peppercorn, you can&#39;t go wrong....also considering we&#39;ve been to other shops that stick on a more aggressive pricetag, these did the trick for a coffee companion. <br><br>There&#39;s not much space inside to sit, but you could always take yours to go and sit in Spitalfields and point at the hipsters. <br><br>Win-win, either way.",

"reviewcomment":"Talk about being whisked back to my childhood! I remember the good old days where you could walk into a candy shop with a dollar, buy individual pieces of candy ranging anywhere from a penny to a dime, and leave with a bag so full that it made me feel like the richest girl in the world.  Well those days are long gone, at least in Chicago.  That's why I was so excited to try Mrs. Kibbles, when I read about it in Luois Vuitton's City Guide of all places.  Just as the book promised, this place did not disappoint! This sweet shop was something right of a fairy tale.  The colors, the clear apothecary type glass jars that displayed sweets galore, and the glass showcase full of goodies all crammed into the tiniest candy shop in the world pulled at the heart strings of the little girl buried deep within me.  <br><br>Everything that I sampled from the lemon and pear drops, the truffles, the gummy beer bottles were so yummy.  I really felt like a kid again, and there's no better feeling!",

"reviewcomment":"Dear god this place is utterly awesome! <br><br>It stands almost alone among the kebab houses and takeaways of the whitechapel road. Located just by the Whitechapel gallery and near Aldgate east station it is an oasis of great pastries, sandwiches and coffee. <br><br>Not just any sandwiches mind, oh no. these sandwiches will delight all those who try. Yes they are pretentious but in this case thats a good thing. The last time I was there I has smoked salmon with wasabi cream on olive bread with coffee and a cupcake for £8, not cheap but pretty good value for something so excellent. Indeed the food was so good I had to walk 2 miles to my meeting to burn it off!<br><br>Seriously this place is among the best places in the area and, dare i say it, most of London for the price.",

"reviewcomment":"I was slightly skeptical arriving at The Curious Yellow Cafe as it didn&#39;t look so great from the outside and also very small. What have I learnt? Don&#39;t judge a book by its cover! <br><br>Firstly the staff were very warm and welcoming taking our order quickly without being intrusive. We both ordered the vegetarian breakfasts and banana shakes. Both were outstanding. I almost felt guilty as I watched one of the staff leave and return 5 minutes lately with fresh bananas especially for us. There was no &#39;sorry that&#39;s not available.&#39; The breakfast was by far the best vegetarian breakfast I&#39;ve had since being in London. All prepared and cooked right in front of our eyes in the small kitchen behind the counter so we could see what was going into our food. I must make a special mention to the scrambled eggs. I&#39;m not quite sure what she did but they were delicious! Soft but not runny and sweet and savoury at the same time.<br><br>Lastly even though it was only 10.30am we opted for a slice of chocolate beetroot cake as we had heard great things. Who could have ever guessed this could be such a great combo! The beetroot made the cake soft and moist but without overpowering the chocolate and the icing completed the masterpiece.<br><br>This will definitely be on my most recommended cafes list!",

Very filling but definitely savour it because you&#39;ll probably want more :) I can&#39;t stop thinking about it!

I have been to many in the US (west and east coasts) and the High Street Kensington one is by far my favorite.<br><br>It is massive and looks like a department store. It is on three levels: two for groceries (ground and basement) and one to sit down and eat (upstairs). The upstairs level looks a bit like an American food court - but a healthy, fresh and clean one.  One where you want to sit down, enjoy your food, hang out with friends, and use the free wifi - even start a book and not see time go by. <br><br>The &#34;upstairs section&#34; offers multiple options, from Saf, a raw and vegan restaurant, to sushi, juice bar, wok bar, salad bar, pizza bar, omelette bar. You name it, anyone can find something that they like. <br><br>One tiny little thing : closes at 6pm on Sundays, a bit early for me. They won&#39;t kick you out by 6 but you cannot enter the store anymore.<br><br>In a nutshell: Is it bad if I could spend a whole day in there?",

It&#39;s got such a fabulous range of spirits, you can&#39;t just put this down as a wine shop alone.<br><br>Upstairs is a veritable feast of spirits from around the world, and downstairs is a beautiful cave of wines - with a tasting area that can cater for any group size from 2 to 200, with tastings created specifically for each need, whether it&#39;s date night or a corporate event.<br><br>The knowledge of the team there is unquestionable, and they advise appropriately without pushing you towards the most expensive. Prices are fair; they&#39;re a little higher than online, but I&#39;m happy to pay them to support such a great local business.",

"reviewcomment":"I  found this place after meeting friends in Angel, who decided not to get a bite to eat in that area, so we went for a walk on the regents canal. I told them I saw a review of this really cool cafe place on the canal on yelp. They didn&#39;t believe at first! as it was quite a long walk from Angel. It is actually better to walk from the Dalston  to Angel route, than the other way round! <br><br>We finally found it just off Dalston, its a  very small cafe with a few communal tables and chairs dotted on the canal.  Sandwhich  dishes are about £6. I got the ham and my friend brought the salmon terrine, which was very tasty with cucumber salad. I think they only have a number of set dishes because after we left about 4pm, the salmon sold out. I also brought the homemade ginger beer which  was rather fiery, just how i like my ginger beer! <br><br>I agree with Ben M. who said it reminded him of  those  teepee tent/cafes  at Glastonbury. <br>I cannot fault the place so I have decided to give 5 stars. A ideal place to  have  a drink, brunch or cake on a sunny day. Is dog friendly as well.<br><br>Keep  it a secret though!",

"reviewcomment":"Dear Orangery, your tea service is spectacular. I will be back. Sincerely, Natalie.<br><br>Ok, I do want to write more than that, but seriously if you&#39;re looking for a place to have a nice tea, LOOK NO FURTHER! I&#39;ve had the tea service at Harrod&#39;s and while that was a great experience, I have to say I liked tea at the Orangery even better. I went with a group of colleagues while on a business trip to London. We made a reservation, which I would highly recommend. They may be able to fit you in as a walk-in with a small party, but reservations help. <br><br>I was impressed by the selection of tea and tisane on their menu. I generally cannot do caffeine, and usually resign myself to a decaf earl grey that most places have. The orangery had several herbal choices (completely caffeine free). Each person receives their own pot of tea, which catered to my selfish American ways ;)<br><br>We had the traditional afternoon service, and for each pair at the table we received a platter of goodies. Raisin scones with jam and clotted cream were probably my favorite. This was my first experience with clotted cream, and and must say the English have a winner on their hands! It&#39;s a delicious spread that is basically thick, slightly sweetened cream. I could feel it going straight to my thighs...and I loved it. Several little cakes and pastries I couldn&#39;t quite identify, but all were delicious. The cucumber sandwiches were a refreshing choice on a warm afternoon, and though I loved the sweets, provided a nice contrast.<br><br>The place settings were lovely. Bright aqua and pink colors. There is a story about the orangery&#39;s history on the back of the menu, which is informative and interesting. Something neat to read while waiting for the rest of your party to arrive. The location is very idyllic. You must walk through Hyde Park to get there, and have the opportunity to pass Kensington Palace as well. There is a pond nearby, and as you walk up to the Orangery take note of the elegantly pruned trees and lush greenery. A few minutes here, and you begin to feel like royalty yourself!",

I stumbled upon this place when I was in the area for a meeting so it&#39;s a shame that this can&#39;t be a regular haunt for me, but I do know that every opportunity I get to stop by this spot, I will make the most of it!

"reviewcomment":"Dear god this place is utterly awesome! <br><br>It stands almost alone among the kebab houses and takeaways of the whitechapel road. Located just by the Whitechapel gallery and near Aldgate east station it is an oasis of great pastries, sandwiches and coffee. <br><br>Not just any sandwiches mind, oh no. these sandwiches will delight all those who try. Yes they are pretentious but in this case thats a good thing. The last time I was there I has smoked salmon with wasabi cream on olive bread with coffee and a cupcake for £8, not cheap but pretty good value for something so excellent. Indeed the food was so good I had to walk 2 miles to my meeting to burn it off!<br><br>Seriously this place is among the best places in the area and, dare i say it, most of London for the price.",

"reviewcomment":"Superb coffee. Deliciously creamy and brilliant. As a fussy ex-patriate Melbournian coffee drinker, I was pleasantly suprised. The Kiwi&#39;s that run this place are doing London a great service. London is so stuffed with chain coffee joints and an astonishing number of putrid &#39;Americano&#39; drinkers. This place, though a tad out of the way for some, is most certainly worth the drive for latte and education alone! Delightful aftertaste, of caramelized nuts, delicious! <br><br>Eggs Benedict - eggs cooked nicely, perched on two muffins that didn&#39;t seem to be toasted terribly well. Hollandaise ok but lacked a bit of flavour. Nitpickery really for what was a fine breakfast. I hope to return soon and try something else.

There&#39;s a little place to make multiple visits for cured meats just next door, and/or Maltby Street Market is a 10 minute walk, where you can get amazing pungent cheeses, fresh bread from St John, or even go hard: pregame with Gin cocktails, pick up some elaborate sandwiches and stash some dessert for drunken delight.

We had seen people queuing up for a cup at Borough Market but there was always so much else to do rather than standing in line waiting for coffee. Recently, while staying in Covent Garden, we popped into Monmouth Coffee on Monmouth Street. <br><br>We opted to wait for a seat and even though there was a line it went quickly. We soon found ourselves paired up with two graduate students in a small booth. They were taking filtered coffee and sang its praises. We had a latte and a cappuccino sprinkled with cocoa accompanied by a delicious shortbread cookie. The coffee was awesome and the service fast and friendly. Four young women manned the coffee station next to the seating area while another woman and young man handled the take aways and the cash register. No bill was given we just told him what we had and he quickly responded with the required amount. A very tiny shop so each movement between customers and wait staff was choreographed to a precise movement. In this case the customer would be leading while the wait staff filled in the gaps and even managed to get a pram in and out without incident. Definitely worth the standing in line for.",

"reviewcomment":"24 hours a day 7 days a week. Drooling thinking about it!!! If you are on Brick Lane you must go here. <br><br>The bottom line: chewy soft plain bagels (not toasted) but gooey oozy yummy goodness with hot fatty salty beef (corned beef as we know it). Not the sliced kind, the kind they take a big fat chunk of, stick in a bagel with some mustard and you stand not the street and eat it, and then want to go back for more. Maybe a 2nd one? 3rd one? It&#39;s a no frills kind of place, no seating. There was a line but it went quick and they worked like a well oiled machine. The workers were quick and within seconds-BAM in my tummy!Thank goodness I am very far away from here, or I can see myself being very very very addicted.",

I was very skeptical as I kept hearing that it&#39;s cooked in orange juice, which I&#39;m not fond of, but it&#39;s really really lovely and spicy and you really probably have not tasted anything like it. I sure haven&#39;t. It&#39;s really good value, a meal box for £6 and you can have 2 fillings if you like or just load up on that lovely cochinita pibil, or 3 tacos I believe for the same price. Very filling but definitely savour it because you&#39;ll probably want more :) I can&#39;t stop thinking about it! They don&#39;t always have the cochinita on so count yourself lucky if they have it when you go. It&#39;s probably the best thing I&#39;ve ever eaten.",

I don&#39;t know much (anything) about Scandinavian food but YESSSSSSS! Their beetroot salad and sweet potato salad are ace. Not to mention the little bits of fried onion and dollop of mustard on their roast beef / salami on rye things (I don&#39;t even know what they&#39;re called, sozz, but they taste real good). Big yes on the Smørrebrød and kladdkaka! I&#39;ve had better cinnamon buns but these aren&#39;t too far off. Although for coffee it&#39;s probably best heading to Kaffeine across the road - not a fan of super milky coffee!<br><br>Popped in last week and they&#39;ve recently schnazzed up the place! The counter&#39;s all done up now - in super slick black and  salads in big wood bowls. Also noticed that they sell violet liquorice!! A box for 75p maybe? Not even a liquorice fan but trust me, these&#39;ll win you over too.",

"reviewcomment":"Ever since meeting my BFF (Best French Friend) Sev during my exchange year I&#39;m a big fan of cheese. When I say cheese I don&#39;t mean the cheddar variety, which I personally find incredible (imagine that word in a french accent) boring. I think about all the lovely varieties of cheese ... from blue cheese, do truffle cheese and soft camembert and brie and ... it goes on forever.<br><br>Anyway this shop/restaurant is giving you the option to just buy it or first eat it and then buy it.<br><br>First time I went there, I just got a block of interesting looking cheese and it was good. Second time we went full out with cheese fondue and the really nice raclette: it was  downright delicious. As its located inside Spitalfield Market you can sit &#34;outside&#34; the restaurant without being actually outside. It&#39;s still rather chilly on a normal english spring evening, but they have heaters and blankets, which made it really cosy. I had an amazing time messing around with the cheeses and drinking a lovely wine with it. as close as it gets to the french experience. I really loved the restaurant, as the waiters were nice and unobtrusive. They give you time to sit and enjoy the meal.",

The really cool thing is that they also do a little pastry, and some sweets. Just lovely :))) Each time we go to my parents, we will bring a box. The best gift you can offer when staying with someone. Trust me, they&#39;ll invite you back very quickly ;)))<br><br>Also. Go for the brownie! It&#39;s ABSOLUTELY heavenly. To die for. Miam!",

"reviewcomment":"Can someone please just start up a charity for me to have breakfast/brunch here every morning? It would be ever so greatly appreciated. <br><br>For real though- this place does an incredible breakfast/brunch, and somehow, although I hear horror stories galore about having to wait ages for a table (at The Table, ha! aren&#39;t they so witty!), every time I&#39;ve come, the wait has been either non-existent or minimal. Which thank god, because I don&#39;t know how long I could wait to get my hands on their insane poached eggs and waffles! <br><br>Although I&#39;ve never tried their meat-based breakfast options, many brunching companions have, and all can testify to their goodness (honestly, seeing their Full Borough breakfast, I have, on occasion doubted my choice of vegetarian-ness). In addition, they do great lunch burgers and their fixed lunch is fabulous (although, with the fixed menu, it can be a little hit-and-miss if they happen to be serving something you don&#39;t particularly like). <br><br>A particularly positive point of The Table&#39;s, is that when you order tea, instead of just bringing you a cup of tea, as most places tend to do, they bring you an entire pot of it (it helps that their pot is nice as well... what doesn&#39;t this place get right?)! But, if you&#39;re not a tea fan, don&#39;t worry- everything else is good too!",

Located round the corner from the Gherkin, AC is a den of tranquility amidst the hubbub of the City. Soft lighting and high quality fittings lend a relaxed vibe which, together with the free wifi, make it a place to linger. <br><br>None of this would matter (much) if the coffee was not up to standard. However, serving a wide range of espresso and brew options, the coffee certainly hits the required standard. I opted for a brew made from beans from Workshop and the promised caramel and spicy flavours were duly delivered. Wonderful. <br><br>The City is better served for coffee now than it was 24 months ago. However, notwithstanding this AC stands out from the rest.

"reviewcomment":"If you love Italian meats, cheeses and pastas, Lina was made for you :)<br><br>Context: I stumbled upon Lina after a less than thrilling experience searching for fresh meats in the Whole Foods about a 10 minute walk away. I was cooking in the evening and running out of time to find nice meats and cheeses. <br><br>The meats are AMAZING. The cheese is great too - there is a good selection of Italian cheeses. <br><br>All of Lina&#39;s meats are sourced from Italy, the staff will tell you about each one of them if you ask. Unfortunately, I was the customer curious enough to ask, and they were kind enough to share all the nuances of the cured meat world. <br><br>Whether you&#39;re looking for Parma ham, mortadella, bresaola or lesser known varieties, such as &#39;nduja, a spicy, soft salame from Calabria - you won&#39;t be let down. The quality on it&#39;s own is like nothing else I&#39;ve found in London to date on top of the fact that the price is comparable to what you pay in chain grocery stores. <br><br>For those who love pasta, Lina also makes fresh pastas:<br><br>&#34;Classic fillings are spinach &amp; ricotta; pumpkin; veal.  Regular specials including porcini; parmesan; crab; aubergine &amp; scamorza; artichoke &amp; truffle oil; pea and mint.&#34;",

Veggies, fruits, baked goods, dairy, etc. They also have cooked food (tarts, bread, sandwiches, pastas, etc.) for sale. Fantastic. The vendors are funny and approachable, and can tell you a lot about what they are selling. If you&#39;re in the area, check it out, and then go to La Fromagerie and The Ginger Pig for some other great snacks and groceries. Marylebone High Street also has some great food spots. All and all, great market. Not as big and busy as Borough, and still a great stop.",

Don&#39;t expect anything posh or fancy - it&#39;s a down-to-earth bakery, where real people eat real custards, so to speak. <br><br>In order to make the best out of this place, I suggest two options: <br><br>1) You come here on multiple occasions, as there&#39;s so many different things that will tempt your palette. You simply can&#39;t eat all of it in one visit, but you simply have to try most of it!<br>2) You talk to your bosses and persuade them to host a Portuguese Happy Hour - that way you can buy a variety of lots of different pastries and you get to sample a lot! (This was the option that I went for.)<br><br>I really love this place - but I suggest you come by on a non-weekend day, as the crowds are simply off-putting.",

The store is tiny, but the assortment of teas available (both in bags and loose leaf) is pretty incredible. <br><br>Towards the back of the shop, you can see some older advertisements and artifacts from the store&#39;s great history. There&#39;s also a little bar where you can try the teas that they&#39;re offering. The set up they had was pretty cute and the service there was great. <br><br>We stopped by London at the end of our travels, so we were very low on bag space at that point.

"reviewcomment":"A few years ago I stumbled into this store having never tried Japanese sweets.  I was instantly intrigued and loved the mocha filled with bean paste.  Then I branched out and discovered the rice paste covered in beans and a little treat that has beans in the middle of a small green gelatinous tortilla (really wish I knew what all of these were called, but they are staples and if you go to the shop you&#39;ll see what I mean).  I&#39;ve since been to Japan and now I love the store even more.  It&#39;s one of the only places you can find such an incredible array of Japanese sweets.  Most shops you can find a mocha ball, but these are incredibly fresh and of a very high quality.  You will definitely pay a bit of a premium for this, but it&#39;s completely worth it if you&#39;re looking for high quality Japanese treats.  My new favorite item is the fukuwatashisenbei, which actually get cheaper the more you purchase at Minamoto.  There are descriptions written in English about each of the items so you know exactly what you&#39;re getting.  The staff are always incredibly polite and helpful, but do make sure you check the expiration date when you purchase items because some will expire the day you bought them.  Some others may last a week or 2, but always better to be aware.",

Don&#39;t get me wrong, I&#39;m a big fan of the american goodies you can find in there, but it&#39;s all a bit new fangled for my liking. I like my sweeties of the old school variety. Cola bottles. Pear drops. White chocolate mice.<br><br> Mr HUmbug has big sweet jars right up to the cieling! like in the old days at the newagents when I&#39;d count all my coppers and ask for a 1/4 of pear drops. That&#39;s what sweet buying should be about! It&#39;s exciting to be able to do it again!<br><br> It is more expensive. You&#39;ll be saying to your friends stuff like &#39;but it only used to be 30p a 1/4&#39; and sounding a bit old. But there&#39;s enough stuff here to find something you like. I have an addiction to jazzies. Y&#39;know those little white chocolate discs with the candy coloured balls on them? I&#39;ll actually eat them until I feel sick. I can buy them here. This makes me deliriously happy. Or maybe I&#39;m just hyped up on sugar.<br><br> They make for good presents too. They&#39;re a great way of saying &#39;Sorry I was a bit of an idiot last week&#39;. It&#39;s cute and not an embarassingly large gesture.<br><br> So come here and eat sweets. Probably best enjoyed with a beer in the pub opposite.

I don&#39;t know much (anything) about Scandinavian food but YESSSSSSS! Their beetroot salad and sweet potato salad are ace. Not to mention the little bits of fried onion and dollop of mustard on their roast beef / salami on rye things (I don&#39;t even know what they&#39;re called, sozz, but they taste real good). Big yes on the Smørrebrød and kladdkaka! I&#39;ve had better cinnamon buns but these aren&#39;t too far off. Although for coffee it&#39;s probably best heading to Kaffeine across the road - not a fan of super milky coffee!<br><br>Popped in last week and they&#39;ve recently schnazzed up the place! The counter&#39;s all done up now - in super slick black and  salads in big wood bowls. Also noticed that they sell violet liquorice!! A box for 75p maybe?

One of them is a coffee shop where you can have brunch/lunch and the other, apparently, is a bar. I just went to the &#39;restaurant&#39; part because all I wanted was some coffee and cake.<br><br>The place is really nice, airy and bright, with simple decoration. The staff was lovely, always with a smile on their faces even though it was almost closing time. Always appreciated.<br><br>Brunch was over when I arrived, so I didn&#39;t have a chance to try the food. But I did try the cakes and they were wonderful. I had the Chocolate Guinness Cake with Baileys and clotted cream on the side and I just have one word to describe it: MARVELLOUS!<br><br>The coffee was also really good. Much better than the one you will get for the same price in any high street chains.",

Obviously a classy establishment, the Lanesborough has a home away from home feel in the lobby with tables replacing the check in counter and china vases everywhere<br><br>The dining room is stunning and Venetian inspired with a high glass roof, 3 huge chandeliers and plush seating. The Italian waiting staff were however very friendly and Hilary and I appreciated the professionally casual and non-overbearing feel to the service<br><br>A generous tray of different breads was served with an extra virgin olive oil and sea salt to dip them in. Our favourite was the poppy seed bread. Onto the tasting menu<br><br>1. Amuse bouche<br>We heard it as quail egg but was in fact a quail leg, which was served as a lollipop and fried in thin batter. Served hot, it was a great single bite to start the meal on the right note<br><br>2. Tuna &amp; veal<br>Wow!! Our favourite dish of the evening. Seared loin of  tuna with veal jelly containing sharp accents within it and tuna snow. What may have seemed initially like strange bedfellows were perfect companions. Clean flavours<br><br>3. Scallops, liquorice, smoked potatoes puree, fennel and pink grapefruit<br>The scallop was big and juicy with a perfect sear on the outside but the accompaniments were a little too similar for me. Would have appreciated maybe another flavour like citrus in there or perhaps a different texture<br><br>4. Fagottelli carbonara<br>One of Chef Beck&#39;s signature dishes, the fagottelli are llittle pillows of thin pasta encasing a molten mix of carbonara flavours. Wonderfully intense flavours and the word pillow is apt as they&#39;re so light<br><br>5. Wild seabass in fine herbs crust with sweet red pepper and &#34;S.Marzano&#34;<br>The star of this dish was in fact the sweet red pepper and S.Marzano tomato sauce - you could almost taste the sunshine stored up in those vegetables<br><br>6. Wild mushroom infusion with balsamic roasted goose foie gras<br>OK, with me and foie gras, you can&#39;t really go wrong, except for serving me too little foie gras! They didn&#39;t make that mistake here with a large slab of seared foie gras in a broth of fresh wild mushrooms.<br><br>7. Organic &#34;Rhug&#34; saddle of lamb with Mediterranean flavours<br>Nice tender sous vide lamb was the star of the plate<br><br>8. Milk chocolate, coconut and pineapple sorbets<br>An OK dessert, most of which was repeated on a special happy birthday plate from the kitchen<br><br>We had some nice petit fours to finish off the meal. A good start to the birthday celebration season",

"reviewcomment":"Mmmmmm! I&#39;ve both eaten in the restaurant and ordered delivery. <br><br>Food: I&#39;ve sampled quite a variety of dishes and they&#39;ve all been fantastic. The Penang curry has a good kick and a beautiful flavour to it. Spicy, a bit nutty, and perfectly seasoned. The Pad Kee Mau came extra hot when I had it delivered and WOW were they not kidding around! I ordered it extra spicy and they delivered! My eyes were watering by the end and I am not easily impressed with heat. Love it! Great Pad Thai, the main dish by which I judge Thai restaurants. Theirs was delicious with all the right flavours and a nice balance of sauce to noodles. The chicken satay was tasty, but not the best I&#39;ve ever had. My husband adores their prawn and chicken dim sum appetizer. Definitely great food for a really reasonable price.<br><br>Service: The waitstaff was a little slow, but very friendly when we ate in. The food took a while, but it wasn&#39;t ages, I just wouldn&#39;t recommend them if you&#39;re in a hurry. Same with delivery. We live a five minute drive away and the website said it would be within an hour and a half. We got our food after about an hour and ten minutes. It wasn&#39;t even a weekend, so it was quite a wait. The delivery guy found us without difficulty, though, which is more than I can say for some other Thai delivery we&#39;ve had recently. We tipped him because he was so friendly.<br><br>The portions are pretty good. They&#39;re not massive, but they&#39;re not the dinky little servings you get in XOXO, either. They have become our go-to local Thai place when we can&#39;t be bothered to cook at home. Highly recommended, especially if you like your food really spicy. They don&#39;t mess around with the heat, so it&#39;s a great change of pace as I usually have to beg to get my food extra hot.",

Keyword: clean. And, actually, in a strange way, really vivid and beautiful-- bright red, healthy looking cuts in a minimally decorated &#39;farmhouse-chic&#39; (if that&#39;s a thing) space with a metal chain door curtain. <br><br>The guys behind the counter are clearly career butchers, dedicated to their craft, and very knowledgeable.

They&#39;ll more than likely have it in the back. <br><br>I may be a poor student, but if I am going to drop real money on any aspect of my home cooking, it will be the meat.

"reviewcomment":"Dear Orangery, your tea service is spectacular. I will be back. Sincerely, Natalie.<br><br>Ok, I do want to write more than that, but seriously if you&#39;re looking for a place to have a nice tea, LOOK NO FURTHER! I&#39;ve had the tea service at Harrod&#39;s and while that was a great experience, I have to say I liked tea at the Orangery even better. I went with a group of colleagues while on a business trip to London. We made a reservation, which I would highly recommend. They may be able to fit you in as a walk-in with a small party, but reservations help. <br><br>I was impressed by the selection of tea and tisane on their menu. I generally cannot do caffeine, and usually resign myself to a decaf earl grey that most places have. The orangery had several herbal choices (completely caffeine free). Each person receives their own pot of tea, which catered to my selfish American ways ;)<br><br>We had the traditional afternoon service, and for each pair at the table we received a platter of goodies. Raisin scones with jam and clotted cream were probably my favorite. This was my first experience with clotted cream, and and must say the English have a winner on their hands! It&#39;s a delicious spread that is basically thick, slightly sweetened cream. I could feel it going straight to my thighs...and I loved it. Several little cakes and pastries I couldn&#39;t quite identify, but all were delicious. The cucumber sandwiches were a refreshing choice on a warm afternoon, and though I loved the sweets, provided a nice contrast.<br><br>The place settings were lovely. Bright aqua and pink colors. There is a story about the orangery&#39;s history on the back of the menu, which is informative and interesting. Something neat to read while waiting for the rest of your party to arrive. The location is very idyllic. You must walk through Hyde Park to get there, and have the opportunity to pass Kensington Palace as well. There is a pond nearby, and as you walk up to the Orangery take note of the elegantly pruned trees and lush greenery. A few minutes here, and you begin to feel like royalty yourself!",

Here in the UK it seems to be working.<br><br>The staff is super friendly and knowledgable and they even allow little Napoleon (the Frenchie) inside. <br><br>Bottles are rotated frequently in the sampling cabinets and it&#39;s great to have the option of different tasting sizes. <br><br>They have high-end wines on sale, but also great affordable selections, many of which I have purchased myself. <br><br>I will continue to purchase my every day drinking wine at The Sampler and look forward to expanding my wine knowledge there.",

"reviewcomment":"Daylesford has absolutely the freshest and tastiest meals as well as a great little market downstairs for buying the very same ingredients they made your food with!.I first stopped by here a while back for groceries. The food items, as you would expect, is a little bit pricier than what you&#39;d find in Sainsbury&#39;s - but because I was so lazy, I usually stopped by the latter. However, if you&#39;re okay with spending a little more cash and buying fresh and locally grown veggies and fruits, delectable cheese, home-baked bread, and grassfed meat, Daylesford Organic is the place to go. It&#39;s like a farmer&#39;s market sucked into one glorious and vast three-floored food heaven.<br><br>And as I write this review, I regret not coming here more often to eat breakfast, brunch, lunch, and they even serve food to go at the counter on the ground floor! For that one time I did visit, I ordered a juicy piece of salmon on a bed of squash salad with cranberries. Sounds healthy? You betcha it was! It was a huge bowl so totally worth the value and it just tasted so fresh. I also had the seasonal green which was a tiny little cup with some cooked kale leaves - expensive 4 quids for the little guy but you pay for the quality. My friend had the corn beef with egg, and the mixed greens. Mixed greens was a huge bowl of salad and a yummy light dressing to top it off (more worth it than the seasonal green. His cornbeef meal was cooked in cast iron so woohoo for added iron (it was pretty tasty too albeit not as healthy as my salmon!) To top it all off, we had ginger and honey tea. I had whole bits of stringy ginger in my teapot and a saucer with really fresh honey at the side. The tea itself was all right, not the most flavorful despite the chunk of ginger but I kept nomming on the honey at the side.<br><br>Also, free wi-fi if you wanted to loiter with your computer over your meal.<br>Arghhhhh why didn&#39;t I come here more often before I left London?!",

"reviewcomment":"So Tinker II is a zippy little thing but unfortunately last weekend she got a flat and I had to sort her out with a new front shoe. I rolled here into Lock 7 bright and early on Sunday and within 5 minutes we established that it was not just going to be inner tubes but a whole front tyre that needed replacing. I left my number and they said they would call me when it was done.<br><br>less than 30 minutes later I have a little voicemail on my phone. Tinker II is ready for collection. I parted with my £26 and rolled out of there a happy cyclist. Since then I have popped in again when I needed a new rear light. £12 later I have just what I need after some friendly advice.<br><br>These guys are great. They run an efficient shop that can turn around repairs quickly. It&#39;s not the cheapest but it won&#39;t break the bank either. They also serve up food and drink and I&#39;ve yet to try the coffee but I hear good things.",

"reviewcomment":"And so I find myself at the Breakfast Club, Shoreditch again. It&#39;s our default breakfast meeting place when we can&#39;t think of anything new. I guess that&#39;s because it&#39;s mostly reliably good. This morning I&#39;m having the huevos rancheros, which are as good as I&#39;ve had in London. My other regular choices are the avocado with poach eggs, bacon and chilli and the scrambled eggs and smoked salmon, which are also pretty consistent. I used to go for the full breakfast, but found it a little dull in comparison. My colleagues enjoy the bircher muesli, but I&#39;ve never tried it.<br><br>The service here can be a bit erratic, as they seem to value hiring staff based on how hipster they are instead of how good they are at waiting tables, but it&#39;s usually good enough.<br><br>We normally come weekday early morning, and so never have to queue to get in, but I&#39;d imagine this is a different story for weekend brunch, if the queue at the Islington branch is anything to go by.",

Especially with those chunky, caramelised hazelnuts and Belgian chocolate slapped all over. <br><br>There&#39;s something that feels a bit wrong about sitting down in a restaurant environment with waiter service for ice cream (plus it&#39;s pricier) but it&#39;s a good alternative to drinking alcohol in the area and a nice thing to do after dinner one evening with your tea total friends or younger relatives.<br><br>You can, of course, go for the take away option which has the same choices and go out to Leicester Square to gobble it all up.",

Each location has different salads and sandwiches and some locations have no salads at all. It was the perfect meal to take along with me while sightseeing. They had yummy pastries too. Their prices are different when you sit in vs. take out but it&#39;s worth it to sit down and relax. Only a couple tables at this location, but it looked like most people ordered to go. <br><br>It is right across the station for the Gloucester Underground stop.",

"reviewcomment":"A big thank you to my friend Hilary who treated me to a slap up pre-birthday dinner here at Apsleys. Knowing that I&#39;m a bit of a foodie, she was pleased and I was impressed that she came up with a Michelin starred restaurant, which wasn&#39;t on my radar<br><br>The brainchild of Heinz Beck, who runs the 3 Michelin starred La Pergola in Rome, Apsleys is based in the Lanesborough Hotel. Obviously a classy establishment, the Lanesborough has a home away from home feel in the lobby with tables replacing the check in counter and china vases everywhere<br><br>The dining room is stunning and Venetian inspired with a high glass roof, 3 huge chandeliers and plush seating. The Italian waiting staff were however very friendly and Hilary and I appreciated the professionally casual and non-overbearing feel to the service<br><br>A generous tray of different breads was served with an extra virgin olive oil and sea salt to dip them in. Our favourite was the poppy seed bread. Onto the tasting menu<br><br>1. Amuse bouche<br>We heard it as quail egg but was in fact a quail leg, which was served as a lollipop and fried in thin batter. Served hot, it was a great single bite to start the meal on the right note<br><br>2. Tuna &amp; veal<br>Wow!! Our favourite dish of the evening. Seared loin of  tuna with veal jelly containing sharp accents within it and tuna snow. What may have seemed initially like strange bedfellows were perfect companions. Clean flavours<br><br>3. Scallops, liquorice, smoked potatoes puree, fennel and pink grapefruit<br>The scallop was big and juicy with a perfect sear on the outside but the accompaniments were a little too similar for me. Would have appreciated maybe another flavour like citrus in there or perhaps a different texture<br><br>4. Fagottelli carbonara<br>One of Chef Beck&#39;s signature dishes, the fagottelli are llittle pillows of thin pasta encasing a molten mix of carbonara flavours. Wonderfully intense flavours and the word pillow is apt as they&#39;re so light<br><br>5. Wild seabass in fine herbs crust with sweet red pepper and &#34;S.Marzano&#34;<br>The star of this dish was in fact the sweet red pepper and S.Marzano tomato sauce - you could almost taste the sunshine stored up in those vegetables<br><br>6. Wild mushroom infusion with balsamic roasted goose foie gras<br>OK, with me and foie gras, you can&#39;t really go wrong, except for serving me too little foie gras! They didn&#39;t make that mistake here with a large slab of seared foie gras in a broth of fresh wild mushrooms.<br><br>7. Organic &#34;Rhug&#34; saddle of lamb with Mediterranean flavours<br>Nice tender sous vide lamb was the star of the plate<br><br>8. Milk chocolate, coconut and pineapple sorbets<br>An OK dessert, most of which was repeated on a special happy birthday plate from the kitchen<br><br>We had some nice petit fours to finish off the meal. A good start to the birthday celebration season",

"reviewcomment":"Mmmmmm! I&#39;ve both eaten in the restaurant and ordered delivery. <br><br>Food: I&#39;ve sampled quite a variety of dishes and they&#39;ve all been fantastic. The Penang curry has a good kick and a beautiful flavour to it. Spicy, a bit nutty, and perfectly seasoned. The Pad Kee Mau came extra hot when I had it delivered and WOW were they not kidding around! I ordered it extra spicy and they delivered! My eyes were watering by the end and I am not easily impressed with heat. Love it! Great Pad Thai, the main dish by which I judge Thai restaurants. Theirs was delicious with all the right flavours and a nice balance of sauce to noodles. The chicken satay was tasty, but not the best I&#39;ve ever had. My husband adores their prawn and chicken dim sum appetizer. Definitely great food for a really reasonable price.<br><br>Service: The waitstaff was a little slow, but very friendly when we ate in. The food took a while, but it wasn&#39;t ages, I just wouldn&#39;t recommend them if you&#39;re in a hurry. Same with delivery. We live a five minute drive away and the website said it would be within an hour and a half. We got our food after about an hour and ten minutes. It wasn&#39;t even a weekend, so it was quite a wait. The delivery guy found us without difficulty, though, which is more than I can say for some other Thai delivery we&#39;ve had recently. We tipped him because he was so friendly.<br><br>The portions are pretty good. They&#39;re not massive, but they&#39;re not the dinky little servings you get in XOXO, either. They have become our go-to local Thai place when we can&#39;t be bothered to cook at home. Highly recommended, especially if you like your food really spicy. They don&#39;t mess around with the heat, so it&#39;s a great change of pace as I usually have to beg to get my food extra hot.",

"reviewcomment":"Their chocolate sorbet tastes like a full on brownie. It&#39;s amazing. AND VEGAN.<br>Well when I went it was vegan. They have rotating flavours that are egg &amp; dairy free and have 3-4 options out at a time. Don&#39;t be shy- just ask! <br>The only down side is you can only choose one flavour for the small. But you can sample before you buy, so you can commit without fear of the wrong choice.",

"reviewcomment":"I know its hard to go wrong with chocolates ever but Hotel Chocolat sets a different bar (pun intended) for chocolates all together! <br><br>Dark, Milk, White, Hot, Cold, Gooey, Soft, nutty, fruity, alcoholic you name it and they have it! I am not a dark chocolate fan by any standard but the dark chocolate here will blow your mind off (it definitely blew mine). If you&#39;re looking to buy the best present or treat yourself to one you cant go wrong with their awesome chocolate collection. But there is one risk, once you taste the chocolates here you would not only be addicted but also not want to buy chocolates from ANY other place! <br><br>My mum was down here from India and she is not a big chocolate fan but she literally became one after she tried their awesome hot chocolate and dragged me back there every other day. I was shocked how my super health conscious mum was gorging on chocolates. She even bought a lot of them to show off to her friends back home and she was extremely impressed with their packaging too. <br><br>Verdict: Had a fight with your partner and want to say sorry? Look no further and buy them some of these delicious little balls or big bars (depends on your taste ;p)",

"reviewcomment":"Anywhere I travel, I&#39;m always on the lookout for specialty coffee. Coffee isn&#39;t hard to find in London with plenty of Starbucks, Costas and Caffe Neros around town, but I wanted coffee from a smaller, perhaps local roaster. Luckily I remembered the name Square Mile Coffee Roasters that I heard of many years ago. Never tried it since shipping coffee from the UK just wouldn&#39;t make sense with the specialty roasters we have here (Counter Culture, Intelligentsia, Stumptown, etc).<br><br>I found Flat Cap Coffee Co. on Square Mile&#39;s &#34;Where to drink our coffee&#34; page (<a href='/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.squaremileblog.com%2Fwhere-to-drink-our-coffee%2F&amp;s=6b5a755bc11112a8873310ec597290d0b7b67c7d5b8ff20441d8e62ab48c33ee' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>squaremileblog.com/where…</a>). It was near my hotel so I had to pay a visit. You can&#39;t miss it as it&#39;s basically at the very front of the Strutton Ground Market with a bold black tent. The setup is simple including a standard La Marzocco espresso machine and a grinder or two. I ordered a cappuccino and it was as delicious as any I&#39;ve had in the US. Flat Cap&#39;s location is convenient as it allowed me to walk up and down the (small) Strutton Ground Market while enjoying my cappuccino. After finishing my cappuccino, I went back to buy a bag of beans (for drip/pourover coffee) to bring home. They didn&#39;t have any at the time and told me to check back tomorrow after they checked their warehouse.<br><br>I went back the next day on my bean quest and also enjoyed my first flat white ever (how come we don&#39;t have those as widely available in the US?). Unfortunately they still didn&#39;t have any beans for me, but they did let me have my flat white for free (thanks again, guys). Flat Cap is just a couple of really nice guys here running a small, unassuming stand serving delicious coffee.",

"reviewcomment":"I was recently having a conversation about cookies with friends, as you do, and Ben&#39;s cookies came up. I had vaguely heard of the place, and passed it many times, but never tried it. Obviously as soon as I expressed my fondness for a gooey middle I was told I had to try Bens, and so next time I passed one that is what I did. I was not disappointed! The flavour selection is very impressive, thus far I have only tried white choc and peanut butter and chocolate, so there are loads left for me to try. I have heard about the ice cream sandwiches being amazing, have yet to check this out myself but I don&#39;t doubt it. I now seem unable to pass a Bens without suddenly getting the urge for a cookie, but as they have also had the effect of other cookies paling in comparison this is ok by me!! If you like your middles gooey, and who doesn&#39;t??, you are in for a treat",

Don&#39;t get me wrong, I&#39;m a big fan of the american goodies you can find in there, but it&#39;s all a bit new fangled for my liking. I like my sweeties of the old school variety. Cola bottles. Pear drops. White chocolate mice.<br><br> Mr HUmbug has big sweet jars right up to the cieling! like in the old days at the newagents when I&#39;d count all my coppers and ask for a 1/4 of pear drops.

You&#39;ll be saying to your friends stuff like &#39;but it only used to be 30p a 1/4&#39; and sounding a bit old. But there&#39;s enough stuff here to find something you like. I have an addiction to jazzies. Y&#39;know those little white chocolate discs with the candy coloured balls on them? I&#39;ll actually eat them until I feel sick. I can buy them here. This makes me deliriously happy. Or maybe I&#39;m just hyped up on sugar.<br><br> They make for good presents too. They&#39;re a great way of saying &#39;Sorry I was a bit of an idiot last week&#39;.

"reviewcomment":"Daylesford has absolutely the freshest and tastiest meals as well as a great little market downstairs for buying the very same ingredients they made your food with!.I first stopped by here a while back for groceries. The food items, as you would expect, is a little bit pricier than what you&#39;d find in Sainsbury&#39;s - but because I was so lazy, I usually stopped by the latter. However, if you&#39;re okay with spending a little more cash and buying fresh and locally grown veggies and fruits, delectable cheese, home-baked bread, and grassfed meat, Daylesford Organic is the place to go. It&#39;s like a farmer&#39;s market sucked into one glorious and vast three-floored food heaven.<br><br>And as I write this review, I regret not coming here more often to eat breakfast, brunch, lunch, and they even serve food to go at the counter on the ground floor! For that one time I did visit, I ordered a juicy piece of salmon on a bed of squash salad with cranberries. Sounds healthy? You betcha it was! It was a huge bowl so totally worth the value and it just tasted so fresh. I also had the seasonal green which was a tiny little cup with some cooked kale leaves - expensive 4 quids for the little guy but you pay for the quality. My friend had the corn beef with egg, and the mixed greens. Mixed greens was a huge bowl of salad and a yummy light dressing to top it off (more worth it than the seasonal green. His cornbeef meal was cooked in cast iron so woohoo for added iron (it was pretty tasty too albeit not as healthy as my salmon!) To top it all off, we had ginger and honey tea. I had whole bits of stringy ginger in my teapot and a saucer with really fresh honey at the side. The tea itself was all right, not the most flavorful despite the chunk of ginger but I kept nomming on the honey at the side.<br><br>Also, free wi-fi if you wanted to loiter with your computer over your meal.<br>Arghhhhh why didn&#39;t I come here more often before I left London?!",

"reviewcomment":"The store is actually on old Bond street in the Royal Arcade and closest tube is Green Park.<br>I went to one of Charbonnel et Walkers events last night held in conjuction with Appletons Rum.<br>WOW is my first impression the store looks just like an old fashioned sweetshop filled with delectible goodies. Mounds of chocolates on display and boxed in stunning boxes my favourtie being the limited edition Jubilee box adorned with a crown encrusted with swarovski crystals, I really wanted one but at £100 I can only hope i get one as a gift lol. <br>The night started off with Appleton cocktails, the Jamaican mule or the Old fashioned at 6.30pm.<br>The tastings started at 7pm after an interesting talk from the manager of the store telling us the history of the company, i would just like to say that the employees of the store were very imformative and helpful but they really do love and belive in the company (a rare find). You couldnt help but be drawn into the chocolate world. We were then introduced to Appletons management who gave us a brief history again i felt myself thinking Jamaican beaches whilst sipping on my cocktail.<br>We were introduced to 3 chocolates to accompany the 12 year old Appleton Estate Rum<br>Cecily  a dark chocolate ganache which went perfectly in my opinion with the rum.<br>Milk praline noisette  a mix of chopped hazelnuts and chocolate, the nutty taste with the smooth rum left a nice imprint on the tongue<br>Orange sticks  crystalised Seville orange peel in dark chocolate  this gave me ideas of a good cocktail mix<br>We then sampled a coconut rum called Koko Kanu (forget the usual white bottle imposter)  this is the real deal a genuine coconut rum.<br>This was served with a vanilla truffle  a smooth chocolate blended with madagascan vanilla. Very sweet but very nice<br>We then tried a banoffee truffle  fresh banana pulp and caramel blendwith chocolate inside a milk chocolate shell. The rum really brought out the slight salty taste of the caramel.<br>finally we had a a coconut truffle the texture of the coconut with the rum was unusual.<br>Finally we sampled Charbonnel&#39;s latest creation a sea salt caramel  wow if like me you bite a chocolate first watch out for the liquid centre. This was my first taste of a salted caramel so has probably ruined me for other brands now.<br>I could quite happily sample and shop but would have to do this on payday or a treat.<br>I really hope to be back for a future event but can safely say the combined evening was an extreme success.",

Since then I&#39;ve passed on the favour to many others.<br><br> The cookies themselves are incredible. There are plenty to choose from but I recommend the chocolate flavours - milk chocolate, double chocolate and triple chocolate. They&#39;re not cheap (around £1.20 for one, depending on weight) but they&#39;re worth every penny. And if you buy a box of 7 you only pay for 5.<br><br> If you can try to get them fresh out of the oven. The chocolate is warm and gooey and no cookie has ever tasted so sumptuous. They&#39;re still great even when they&#39;re cold, but if you take them home don&#39;t be afraid to put them in the microwave for a few seconds to try and replicate that just-baked taste.<br><br> These are the most amazing cookies you will ever taste and I can&#39;t recommend Ben&#39;s highly enough.

I guess this place is also related to the popular Lantana in Fritzovia, but after my experience today, I definitely prefer Salvation Jane.<br><br>I got the aubergine and mozzarella tart and sweet potato soup-both of which were their specials of the day. Both dishes were really delicious and it only came out to 10 pounds, so definitely keep your eye out for their specials board.<br><br>Staff was also really friendly and helpful; our server was willing to answer all of our questions about the menu and he even put up when we were taking forever with splitting the bill. He also gave us free extra pieces of bread and a refill on our tea when we asked! <br><br>The lunch rush is pretty crazy, but  getting a table wasn&#39;t too bad on a Wednesday afternoon; if you prefer quiet places, it usually clears out by 2pm so this place is the place for you, too.",

OF COURSE, OF COURSE, OF COURSE you have to only get the classic rolls, no location cycles through the chocolate or pecan ones fast enough for those to be dependably fresh. <br><br>There are few things more disappointing than a not perfectly fresh Cinnabon, a sadness I&#39;ve experienced far too many times in airports across the USA, but not here. If you are going to get a four pack force them to cut ones from the main tray, those pre-made boxes of four are for jokers (yes I was once duped).<br><br>In fact I recommend haranguing the staff, sometimes necessary, until they report on/guarantee the freshness.

As others have said, it&#39;s an old-fashioned family bakery which produces a lovely - and extensive - selection of cakes, pastries and bread, much of which is difficult to find elsewhere. While some of it - particularly the large cakes - can seem quite pricey, the delicious sunflower seed bread and soda bread are little treats and well worth the price. The staff are always friendly and the premises are spacious enough to allow you to have a wander and make your choice without feeling under pressure from the staff.<br><br> It&#39;s worth saying that several of their breads and cakes are sold in Budgens across the road, so if you cannot get to Dunns during their opening hours of 6-6, their delights are on offer until 10pm at the supermarket.",

"reviewcomment":"This is an amazingly delicious hole-in-the-wall restaurant in an unassuming corner in London, close to the Farringdon station. I normally do not eat chicken, but when I went into the place, I knew I had to get the ginger-lime chicken the young man at the counter recommended -- he was clearly enthusiastic about what he was doing and made it clear he cared about his customers. I also got the Moroccan lentil soup, which was delicious: one of the best lentil soups I have had, I must say, on par with those in the Middle East. <br><br>Overall, Anfa Cafe is a great gem that is more than worth your time to take the metro to Farringdon. The cafe itself is very small and casual. Definitely very welcoming. It is clear they have a good local following. It seems like it can get quite crowded during lunchtime, but the friendly servers at the counter are very efficient and the food comes out quite fast. If only they had wi-fi... which would put them beyond 5 stars.<br><br>I would definitely highly recommend Anfa Cafe. I will return there when I return to London to eat real chicken for probably the next time in life. Not any chicken, however... but the one of the ginger-lime kind...",

"reviewcomment":"I was recently having a conversation about cookies with friends, as you do, and Ben&#39;s cookies came up. I had vaguely heard of the place, and passed it many times, but never tried it. Obviously as soon as I expressed my fondness for a gooey middle I was told I had to try Bens, and so next time I passed one that is what I did. I was not disappointed! The flavour selection is very impressive, thus far I have only tried white choc and peanut butter and chocolate, so there are loads left for me to try. I have heard about the ice cream sandwiches being amazing, have yet to check this out myself but I don&#39;t doubt it. I now seem unable to pass a Bens without suddenly getting the urge for a cookie, but as they have also had the effect of other cookies paling in comparison this is ok by me!! If you like your middles gooey, and who doesn&#39;t??, you are in for a treat",

"reviewcomment":"This is THE place for the food and atmosphere you will get in a typical Malay mamak restaurant in Malaysia. <br><br>The nasi lemak is authentic where the sambal (chili paste) is on the right spicy level (translation: above-average spicy at a British level) and the fried egg has runny yolk. YES. <br><br>There is an array of mamak &#34;appetisers&#34;(such as pasembor - Indian rojak) or typical mamak food like (roti tisu with fish curry, mee mamak, mee rebus, laksa, etc.) The concept here is so reminiscent of home you forget you&#39;re in the UK altogether until someone opens the door and cold wind drifts in.  <br><br>Although in Malaysia you can get at least 5 nasi lemak for the price of £5, the prices here are reasonable on a British scale (just take it as a re-investment since the Malaysian government subsidies it). Why pay £3-4 for cold pasta when you can get an awesome plate of nasi campur (mixed dish with rice)?<br><br>The staff are exceptionally friendly and pleasant.  <br><br>Went for lunch, ordered takeaway for dinner later. If I didn&#39;t live so far away from Queensway, I will definitely be more than just an occasional customer!",

The bright airy shop is so inviting and there is such a large collection of both traditional and new sweets. It was very hard to not buy a little bit of everything!<br><br>I opted for the medium bag and got to pick 2 sweets to go in. I got the cherry jellies and the pineapple chunk hard sweets. When deciding between the sour apples and the cherries, the lady behind the counter was super helpful and knew all about each one! The cherries were bursting with flavour. They weren&#39;t too chewy or too soft and the pineapple chunks were super flavourful as well.<br><br>Armed with a sweet tooth and a stamp card... there is no reason not to go back.",

Seriously. Three kimchi burgers around plus the chicken burger to split in three ways. An order of korean chicken wings? Yes, please! Two orders of bulgogi fries? Bring it.<br><br>Everything was great. The burger was delicious. Perfectly cooked and the kimchi just added an amazing flavor. Possibly one of the best burgers I&#39;ve had in London. The bulgogi fries were to die for. They just needed more beef to make it that much better. And the chicken wings were heavenly. The picked radishes that came with them was just the icing on the cake. <br><br>I noticed on the big menu above the bar that they had something called Korean tacos which wasn&#39;t on the paper menu, so I&#39;m curious if such a thing exists, and if it does, why isn&#39;t it in my face right now?<br><br>Seriously. Get to the Black Heart to enjoy this delicious food while you can. It&#39;s a great atmosphere as well.

"reviewcomment":"so fucking amazing i feel like i dreamed the food, it tasted the way food tastes when you are extremely stoned and have the major munchies - i wasn&#39;t as  i&#39;ve given up smoking ... ,or the way food tastes in Italy  or France when you taste something and go &#39;wait , how do they make something so simple taste so incredibly good, it&#39;s just a simple vine  tomato ,how do they do that ?!!!!The meal i had  was on of the top meals of my  entire life ..but so  unexpected in London and so unpretentious and simple ..toast , with some kind of white bean garlic mush ,my fellow diners and i literally fought each other for the last scrapings.  then chicken chorizo ,vine tomatoes and lentils ..sounds like nothing right ? except FLAVOURS  .. i made involuntary  orgasm sounds with every mouthful as did my dinner companions ,we were all going crazy for our food , they ordered  some kind of mushroom peroggi thing and  said it was divine and we all cleared our entire plates  . I had a glass of house red i felt so good , it was excellent and as  was a cold shitty night and  i was feeling so high i ordered pudding .. childhood apple crumble  but with adult twist of  brandy custard,.. i really  don&#39;t do puddings ,i&#39;m a health food nut.. but i&#39;d rather eat  kale  for a month and work out  like a fiend every day  and go here and eat this pudding  twice a month as my  reward,it was  THAT  good ,maple syrup in the custard -who knew how good that could taste ?  , the BEST  i&#39;ve ever had,i understand very well now what they mean when they talk about perfect balance of flavours ,the recipes are to die for .. My diner companions  started to drink the remains of the custard on it&#39;s own   .I cannot wait to go back,it&#39;s miles from where i live in far  West   London but worth the trek ,, i felt like i&#39;d been on holiday ..an absolute revelation of a place .Very minimal decor ,nothing at all striking about it ,waiter with cute personality and good  stylish look and nice service but really the food is the reason to go , GO HERE  ...i cannot rate this little place  highly enough PLEASE DO A COOKBOOK I WANT TO  LEARN TO COOK LIKE THIS",

"reviewcomment":"I came here for afternoon tea last fall, and had one of the most memorable dining experiences of my life! I saw a promotion for their Downton Abbey tea online: the first person to make a reservation on a few specific days got the Downton tea for 2 for just £2.25 a person! Seeing as the regular tea costs £34.50, it was more than a steal, and I couldn&#39;t believe my luck when I was the first caller.<br><br>We were seated in in comfy chairs overlooking Hyde Park, with live piano music in the background. The friendly server helped us pick our teas and kept coming back to check if we needed more hot water. The food and drinks were preceded by an amuse bouche of mango and passionfruit salad, wonderfully sweet and light. Then came the 3-tiered tray... traditional tea sandwiches; warm scones and buns wrapped in a cloth napkin, accompanied by clotted cream, honey, lemon curd, and strawberry jam; a plate of desserts including bread pudding, Victoria sponge, Napoleon pie, lemon posset, and an eclair. The sandwiches and scones/buns were freshly made and UNLIMITED. All this for £4.50 total! (Though I would come back for a big big splurge and pay the regular price). <br><br>The white-gloved staff didn&#39;t treat us any less courteously even though we were there for the discount tea. We sat for 2.5 hrs and never felt rushed. It still feels like I dreamed it.",

It hasn&#39;t changed - you still get great cocktails, great food and all amongst some creative craftiness!<br><br>They still run a selection of great evenings, and the only downside is that usually it&#39;s very busy here and it can be hard to find a table.<br><br>Loving the mismatched china and retro furniture - although that spider still freaks me out a little too.<br><br>Not sure why I rated this 3 stars before.

"reviewcomment":"In the time between my breakfast and lunch yesterday, I got a craving for a smoothie. A strange craving yes, but one that needed satisfied. My hotel happened to be right round the corner from this cafe so yelp told me, and the reviews encouraged me to head on round. <br><br>When I got in I instantly liked the place. It has the contemporary chalk on the walls and rustic wooden furniture thing going on, and the food they offer looked absolutely amazing. Ill definitely be going back to try the food out, but yesterday all I wanted was something healthy that would wake me up. I can&#39;t remember the exact ingredients of my smoothie, but I&#39;m positive it was blackcurrant, raspberry and ginger. Regardless of what was in it fruit wise, it was deliciously fruity and the ginger gave it a strange but pleasant kick. The staff were chatting away to a couple of regulars, which made me like the place more. Rapport with customers is always a great thing to see. Highly recommended place!",

In fact, I&#39;m banking on this little treasure being so off the beaten track that none of you will find it and then I can keep all the cheese a secret and eat it all.<br><br> It&#39;s amazing in here.<br><br> It&#39;s in my favourite part of Greenwich, just down the road from my favourite pub, and right by my absolute dream house. This is fancypants local Greenwich and it&#39;s stunning. Nestled in a little street of indy foodie shops is The Cheeseboard. There probably isn&#39;t a more brilliantly middle-class shop in town. That&#39;s a good thing by the way, if you&#39;re going to live in Greenwich, you do have to embrace the impending middle class-ness.<br><br> There&#39;s a huge range of cheeses here (as you&#39;d expect really) but even stuff I wouldn&#39;t usually go for looks yummy in here. I&#39;m not a fan of the blues - they&#39;re too strong for me and well, they actually do look mouldy. But I want to try them in here. I actually want to try everything.<br><br> I took some friends here at the weekend and they weren&#39;t planning on spending. Of course they did. I&#39;m pretty certain half of their goodies would have been munched on their journey home.<br><br> It&#39;s not just cheese here, they do jams and jellies and yummy organic things. But you do come here for the cheese. You&#39;ll just end up buying other things as well. The ladies who work here are friendly and they know their stuff too. It&#39;s everything a local cheese shop should be.<br><br> Now if you could all pretend you&#39;ve forgotten this review, it&#39;ll stay a secret, just the way it should.",

"reviewcomment":"I stumbled upon this place on Friday night and am a huge fan. It&#39;s a cozy Italian restaurant with the hustle and bustle of Soho that makes it perfect for a dinner before a night out. The food is Italian with an emphasis on pizza (HUGE portions). It is dimly-lit and buzzing, making it a great place to get together with friends or for a date. <br><br>The food was very good and the value was excellent. Mains averaged £10 and they had very reasonably priced wine on offer. Service was great. <br><br>I would say if you&#39;re looking for a fun spot before a night out that won&#39;t break the bank, this should be your go-to.",

"reviewcomment":"Sorry, Who-bucks?! It&#39;s all about The Cut. <br><br>Sharing a venue with the Young Vic, there is never a dull moment at The Cut. You&#39;ll find yourself in the buzz of creativity, with maybe the occasional celebrity sighting if you&#39;re there at the right time (Will Young, Thandie Newton, Naomie Harris, to name but a few. Not one to name-drop, but...). This spot is a favourite for anybody who appreciates art with a community feel. With an open-plan space, exposed walls and concrete floors, it has a fresh warehouse effect. <br><br>If I&#39;m in the area, I would always opt for the Cut Bar whenever I need a quick pick-me-up, in the form of their freshly baked almond croissants and a velvety cappuccino with cocoa dust, enough to blow any coffee chain out of the water. Their free range chicken breast burger is tender and juicy enough to dissolve lovingly in your mouth, plus they do my favourite kind of chips: crunchy on the outside, fluffy on the inside and with plenty of mayo if you ask nicely. The balcony is well-suited for a round of pre/post - show drinks and the staff is efficient and friendly. <br><br>Be warned though. I would thoroughly advise booking well in advance if you want to have dinner in the evening, as The Cut becomes rammed at this time. Also, if you don&#39;t enjoy standing all night, I would avoid going during any production press night, as about 70% of the seating gets reserved for the press, plus the whole upstairs gets cordoned off. Feels a bit poncey at times, but this doesn&#39;t happen every night, so it&#39;s forgivable.  Aside from that, they have a full bar, a wide range of cocktails based on London hotspots (mine&#39;s Angel: strawberries, prosecco, passion fruit and vodka) and warm, dim lighting with jazz for those intimate moods.<br><br>Would recommend: If you&#39;re a red wine drinker like me, go for their house red, Sangiovese 2011, Vinvita: smooth and easy-drinking with a hint of red fruits.",

"reviewcomment":"A friend introduced me to the 'Original Maids of Honour' and we had a brilliant time chatting and eating. Both of these activities I do best. It is a little on the expensive side. But fabulous never the less and definitely worth the splurge. <br><br>This place is known for its High Tea or otherwise known as cream tea. It also must be on a tourist guide, because I see a lot of touristy types visiting this cafe. So it definitely attracts many people from around the world. I suppose this is because this place is the epitome of being English. You feel very sophisticated when you drink your tea - with your little finger out!<br><br>Now on the food..I seriously loved jam and cream scones as a kid.  This place is right up my ally... as old English food goes straight to a soft place in my heart. The quality is very good - the scones are fluffy and home made. The sandwiches are traditional, which are simply cheese or cucumber. The last course is a choice of dessert to your taste. I had the coffee bun, which was lovely.<br><br>I can definitely say I will be back again!",

"reviewcomment":"This place gives me faith that humanity has a chance after all. That we aren&#39;t doomed to Starbucks ourselves out of existence. That uniqueness, oddities and eccentric beauty are still valued. <br><br>Because, how in this day and age of chain-restaurant vanilla Soho can this bizarre, belligerent place still exist? I ***king love it. <br><br>On the lookout for dessert, we eschewed Patisserie Valerie and it&#39;s chainy cakes to pop into this other French patisserie. As soon as I walked in the door, I knew I wasn&#39;t in Kansas anymore*. First of all, I was greeted by this older man, who looked a bit disgruntled. The place was full of little tables and, as my mother would say, a lot of tatty crap. I echo the other reviewers, this is like your granny&#39;s tea room. If your granny was a hoarder, who decided to open a cake shop. <br><br>I picked out a cake from the window, the one with the most cream, natch! And left my sister to pick out the other. She dithered and dithered until I suspected the old man was going to slap her around the head. <br><br>We eventually got our cakes and a charming young French man delivered the coffees**. As we ate, I took in the pink bunting, random fairy lights, the piano and all the other random assortment of stuff and thought &#39;yeah, this is weird and I dig it&#39;. My sister is a crap cake picker and had ordered this dry cherry almond thing that looked vile. <br><br>This place is so strange that if it was in east London, I would wonder if it wasn&#39;t some kind of hipster live art show. ALL THE STARS! Go there and give them money, if only to keep this crazy place alive. <br><br>* A bit like being in an episode of &#39;Goodnight Sweetheart&#39;, what do you mean you haven&#39;t seen it?<br>** Like a scene from &#39;Open All Hours&#39;... what, you haven&#39;t seen that either.

"reviewcomment":"I read Elliot A&#39;s review about this place and it made me come here the very next day. Truth be told, I&#39;ve been walking by this place everyday for the past 1.5 years on my way to work, but I didn&#39;t feel drawn to it for some reason. Which is strange, as I&#39;d seen it written up in Independent London and elsewhere as one of the local spots in London. I guess what didn&#39;t really attract me was the rather non-inspiring display of food in the counter; they use it more as a storage place than as a selling counter. <br><br>So I went here and what I found is that this place is all about substance over style - and not the reverse. While the counter may not hold attractive stuff, what comes out of the kitchen is spot on and makes both my belly and my mind very happy. I can, at this point, only vouch for the breakfasts, but I will soon try their pizza - must be a winner as this place is run by true Italians!<br><br>But Blandford&#39;s Café really had won me over when I walked by it in the evening of the very same day that I had breakfast there. As I walked by, the owner&#39;s daughter waved at me. This was the call to action and the action would be to come back here as they want me to come back. It felt like family! I have since been back a couple times and every time I&#39;m impressed at the great hospitality. It really seems that the majority of the people coming here is regulars as the staff greets them like this: &#34;The usual?&#34; or &#34;Are you sure you don&#39;t want the Spanish Eggs today?&#34; or &#34;I haven&#39;t seen you in a while.&#34;",

The doughnuts aren&#39;t particularly cheap (around £1.20 for one), but a box of 12 is much better value and a double dozen is even better yet.<br><br> There are plenty of flavours to choose from - I&#39;ve tried most and my favourite is still the maple glazed.

Nevermind the fact that there are plenty of other healthy and delicious lunch spots to discover near UCL, the hot buffet here is still my go to.

"reviewcomment":"I asked my hotel manager for a casual place to eat that was not a chain thinking he was going to tell me to go to Mc Donalds.  Well...he told me to go to Pret a Manger ...while is a chain...he said there food is very good and they give anything they don't sell at the end of the day to the homeless...sounds cool.<br><br>You go in and there are open refrigerators that have all different kinds of sandwiches mostly baguette. At lunch, they have hot wraps too.  You bring your selection to the counter where you can also purchase soup, coffee, or tea.  They have a take away and eat in price.  The price to take it away is about 50 pence less per item than eating in.   Genius!!   I never had to find a table even during the busy lunch hour...<br><br>I had the Thai Chili Chicken which was delish...  It's like chicken salad with Sweet Thai Chili sauce.  The baguette that the chicken is housed in is VERY fresh and with a slight crisp outside.  It really reminded me of a Banh Mi.  The price was under 3 pounds.  <br><br>They also make yummy breakfast baguettes.  I had the egg and bacon.  And the egg is basically egg salad.  Thought that was weird but it tasted pretty good.   One morning I did stop in hoping to grab some lunch stuff for an all day bus tour but they don't sell the lunch till later...<br><br>A few days into my London trip, and I realize this place is like Starbucks is to Seattle.  You will not have trouble finding one or several in close proximity. <br><br>They are all about using local in season ingredients, they donate to the homeless and they are OCD about recycling (will see signs on the wall everywhere).  Really wish there was one of these in the US.  Highly recommend!!  Well ..not really because you'll probably end up there anyways...lol.",

Its better than the cinnamon bun from cinabon yes i am comparing it to a chain store, but thats what i grew up with. Soft cinnamon buns with extra frosting, but the cinnamon bun at gails, was absolutely fabulous. <br>Gosh, it looks like the uglies cinnamon bun in the world with a huge tail sticking out from the bottom, but its so good. Its like two different worlds combined into one bun, crispy on top, and soft gooey, cinnamoness on the bottom. How did the baker do this????

"reviewcomment":"this review is of their tea and their online customer service. i&#39;ve never actually set foot in any of their locations and i&#39;m their #1 fan as of 2 days ago. a while back Husband brought back a few of their teas for me as a gift (we live in ireland at the moment). we both fell madly in love with their earl grey tea. i know, you wouldn&#39;t think you could really do a whole lot with this basic tea, but trust me, yumchaa&#39;s is pretty much the best i&#39;ve ever had.<br><br>fast forward to the bottom of the tea pouch... Husband has been complaining that we&#39;ve been running low on the magic earl grey and that we need to go back to london specifically to get more. as much as i love spur of the moment &#34;damn-we&#39;ve-run-out-of-tea&#34; or &#34;crap-i-got-a-hole-in-my-heattech-leggins&#34; shopping trips to london, i decided i&#39;d check ye olde interwebs first. <br><br>lo and behold, they have a web site. lo and be sad, their online ordering system is on the fritz. never fear tho, they provide an email address and are happy to hear from you.<br><br>i trepidatiously (like that?) sent an email asking please could they and would they ship to ireland, and could they do so before valentine&#39;s day. within several hours i received a very chipper reply from a very enthusiastic Louise who said she would be happy to do so and that she would get that out to me tomorrow. i imagined she walked over to the shelves, pulled the teas i wanted, put them in a pouch and walked them over to the post office herself the following morning.<br><br>the package arrived on the 15th (for which i blame my husband&#39;s office&#39;s postal people) with all these cute teapot stamps on it and a personal thank you note from Louise.<br><br>the thing that impressed me the most (besides their delicious teas) was how clear it was that Louise absolutely loved her job and was absolutely passionate about tea. it&#39;s so refreshing to find that sort of thing in this fast paced auto-responder sort of times we live in :)",

"reviewcomment":"I read Elliot A&#39;s review about this place and it made me come here the very next day. Truth be told, I&#39;ve been walking by this place everyday for the past 1.5 years on my way to work, but I didn&#39;t feel drawn to it for some reason. Which is strange, as I&#39;d seen it written up in Independent London and elsewhere as one of the local spots in London. I guess what didn&#39;t really attract me was the rather non-inspiring display of food in the counter; they use it more as a storage place than as a selling counter. <br><br>So I went here and what I found is that this place is all about substance over style - and not the reverse. While the counter may not hold attractive stuff, what comes out of the kitchen is spot on and makes both my belly and my mind very happy. I can, at this point, only vouch for the breakfasts, but I will soon try their pizza - must be a winner as this place is run by true Italians!<br><br>But Blandford&#39;s Café really had won me over when I walked by it in the evening of the very same day that I had breakfast there. As I walked by, the owner&#39;s daughter waved at me. This was the call to action and the action would be to come back here as they want me to come back. It felt like family! I have since been back a couple times and every time I&#39;m impressed at the great hospitality. It really seems that the majority of the people coming here is regulars as the staff greets them like this: &#34;The usual?&#34; or &#34;Are you sure you don&#39;t want the Spanish Eggs today?&#34; or &#34;I haven&#39;t seen you in a while.&#34;",

The doughnuts aren&#39;t particularly cheap (around £1.20 for one), but a box of 12 is much better value and a double dozen is even better yet.<br><br> There are plenty of flavours to choose from - I&#39;ve tried most and my favourite is still the maple glazed.

"reviewcomment":"Inspirational! This place completely impressed me.<br><br>Timberyard beckoned to me on my way home from a meeting, and I am glad that I followed my fancy into a wonderland of industrious comforts to finish out my work day. Never have I had a coffee shop anticipate my needs as much as Timberyard has: friendly and effective service, varied and delicious baked goods, purpose-built workspaces, functional and fuss-free wifi, outlets galore.<br><br>Special mention to a playlist that gave a well-curated sampling of vintage hits--I play similar music in my DJ sets, and I felt as if Timberyard was reminding me of all the songs I had forgotten. Volume-wise, I was able to have an internal phone conversation just fine, and I saw the guy next to me had an extended Skype video chat with no difficulty with volume or connection.<br><br>My raspberry coconut brownie was outstanding, as well as gluten-free. I was so satisfied with it, and so focused on my work, that I didn&#39;t end up ordering anything else over the 4+ hours I was there. I wanted to buy something else to take home, but by the time I looked up, it was closing time, and everything was packed up, leaving me anxious that the café hadn&#39;t made enough money from my stay there. If there had been a donation box, I would have left a fiver. Instead, I paid the staff a compliment on my way out, and was warmly asked to return soon.<br><br>And now: I ask not what Timberyard can do for me, but what I can do for Timberyard. Seriously Timberyard, it&#39;s been a pleasure doing business with you.",

The interior is a comfortable and clean standard greasy spoon with reflective vests and rumpled newspapers looking slightly out of place in the otherwise upscale Northcote road area. <br><br>Tony&#39;s breakfast special is £6.50 for eggs, bacon, sausage, tomatoes, fried slice and beans. There is a larger option but I&#39;ve never seen anyone come close to finishing it, so the standard set might be a safer bet. There is a presentable vegetarian option featuring bubble and squeak and hash browns. <br><br>The staff is lovely and none of them ever seem to forget a face.

"reviewcomment":"If you like wine, you like Wined Up Here. It is that simple.<br><br>This is an independent wine merchant, owned and run by the lovely and ever helpful Charlotte. I did know the history of how she came about buying the store, and what she did before, but alas, it slips my mind.<br><br>Regardless, she, and one or two friends of hers that sometimes help her out, are brilliant. As standard, she will help you through any manner of wine selection. Be it a total novice with a vague idea, or one slightly more picky and selective with their wines looking for something new.<br><br>I still remember the first time I went in, and asked her what to expect from each of her Pinots. I was instantly explained to about the differences in tastes, textures and purposes between each bottle she had. What it went well with, what the underlying taste would be, the aftertaste, and the situation most suited to it - as well as why. It was superb. I ended up buying 3 bottles in the end, I think. As well as a unique set of wine glasses.<br><br>She also hosts regular wine tasting events, which whilst you pay a small fee to attend, are made up in all the wine you then consume, the bread, cheese and pate, and cake, and the 10% discount on any wine purchased that night. Score!<br><br>Sadly, she doesn&#39;t update the website very often (it still thinks it&#39;s December), and so the best way to know what&#39;s coming up is by calling or popping in.<br><br>Oh, did I mention that all the wines have hand written labels hung on them to explain what they are/what to expect?<br><br>Whoops!<br><br>Sublime, dear!",

"reviewcomment":"I&#39;ve finally found the best steak in London. It was a taste I&#39;ll never forget!<br><br>Barbecoa is Jamie Oliver&#39;s steak restaurant with gorgeous views of St Paul&#39;s Cathedral. The restaurant is lovely - dimly lit with large seating areas. Perfect for corporate entertaining. <br><br>They sell steak on the bone (t-bone or ribeye) which is very unusual. I ordered a ribeye on the bone served medium rare. It was crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside. Delicious. It came with a sauce of my choice and some lovely sides.<br><br>I thought the starters (we had mixed starters of chicken lollipops - not so great, calamari - lovely, ribs - lovely, parma ham and mozarella - lovely, tempura vegetables - lovely) were delish. <br><br>I also had a taste of the rhubarb panacotta which was irresistible. Will I be going back? hell yes.",

"reviewcomment":"This is THE place for the food and atmosphere you will get in a typical Malay mamak restaurant in Malaysia. <br><br>The nasi lemak is authentic where the sambal (chili paste) is on the right spicy level (translation: above-average spicy at a British level) and the fried egg has runny yolk. YES. <br><br>There is an array of mamak &#34;appetisers&#34;(such as pasembor - Indian rojak) or typical mamak food like (roti tisu with fish curry, mee mamak, mee rebus, laksa, etc.) The concept here is so reminiscent of home you forget you&#39;re in the UK altogether until someone opens the door and cold wind drifts in.  <br><br>Although in Malaysia you can get at least 5 nasi lemak for the price of £5, the prices here are reasonable on a British scale (just take it as a re-investment since the Malaysian government subsidies it). Why pay £3-4 for cold pasta when you can get an awesome plate of nasi campur (mixed dish with rice)?<br><br>The staff are exceptionally friendly and pleasant.  <br><br>Went for lunch, ordered takeaway for dinner later.

"reviewcomment":"This is definitely something you should experience if you are visiting London. True, there are a lot of cheaper high tea places even outside of London...and Fortnum and Mason seems to be quite touristy due to its association with the royal family, but you simply can&#39;t beat the experience.<br><br>We ordered the tea service. Unlike some other places, you are not allowed to share tea services (they charge by head), as you get unlimited refills on the food. May I suggest that you come hungry?<br><br>It&#39;s a three tier tea service -- you get cakes and pastries on the top, scones on the middle, and sandwiches on the bottom. The sandwiches were fantastic -- even the humble cucumber sandwich was done really, really well. The cakes and pastries were really good as well -- I would have destroyed them if I wasn&#39;t sick and had a reduced appetite. However, the scones disappointed me, as I&#39;ve definitely had better elsewhere (Mandarin Oriental has spectacular scones), but the jam and clotted cream saved them somewhat.<br><br>I&#39;ve had better tea service elsewhere, but none of them have service that is quite as English-style as it is here. But be warned... Be on your best behaviour here! They don&#39;t seem to tolerate much touristy bullshit. My friend who appeared late got her own food, but since I could not finish my tea service at all, she took some of the sandwiches and started eating (without asking, but we are on share-all-food terms ;). We weren&#39;t going to get seconds, but our waitress might have been a bit distressed by us...",

"reviewcomment":"What a wonderfully warm, charming and inviting cafe. I was in Covent Garden after arranging visas for my forthcoming holiday and was in need of a good cuppa, a sit down and few minutes knitting (yes, KNITTING - you heard me correctly!) before I continued on with that day&#39;s to-do list. On the notice board outside the cafe it highlights it&#39;s necessary to register as a member before ordering drinks or food. The idea behind this is to increase the number of people the &#34;Poetry Society&#34; (housed above the cafe) can contact and let know about wonderful poetry reading evenings (and much more!) in the basement area of the cafe. I was more than happy to sign-up after seeing the delicious homemade fare and lovely selection of teas, coffees and fruit juices on offer. I didn&#39;t eat this time, however the girls next to me had the soup of the day and it looked delicious. A perfect autumn lunchtime warmer!<br><br> As I settled down with my pot of tea and knitting, Judith from the Poetry Society&#39;s office asked if I&#39;d be interested helping out in constructing the &#34;World&#39;s Largest Knitted Poem&#34; which had been constructed for World Poetry Day on 8th October from lots of knitters around the country each knitting a letter each. I went upstairs (with my lovely cuppa!) and sewed together 3 squares while I finished my drink. Judith added my name to the list of people who helped with the challenge and apologised for interrupting my knitting and tea, but as I said to her, I was more than happy to help out and it made for a thoroughly enjoyable hour or so in town. It&#39;s opportunities like these that make living in London so much fun! Go to the Cafe and see what&#39;s going on. You never know, you may be offered a piece of cake in return for penning/knitting a limerick or two ! :-)",

"reviewcomment":"This is an amazingly delicious hole-in-the-wall restaurant in an unassuming corner in London, close to the Farringdon station. I normally do not eat chicken, but when I went into the place, I knew I had to get the ginger-lime chicken the young man at the counter recommended -- he was clearly enthusiastic about what he was doing and made it clear he cared about his customers. I also got the Moroccan lentil soup, which was delicious: one of the best lentil soups I have had, I must say, on par with those in the Middle East. <br><br>Overall, Anfa Cafe is a great gem that is more than worth your time to take the metro to Farringdon. The cafe itself is very small and casual. Definitely very welcoming. It is clear they have a good local following. It seems like it can get quite crowded during lunchtime, but the friendly servers at the counter are very efficient and the food comes out quite fast. If only they had wi-fi... which would put them beyond 5 stars.<br><br>I would definitely highly recommend Anfa Cafe. I will return there when I return to London to eat real chicken for probably the next time in life. Not any chicken, however... but the one of the ginger-lime kind...",

"reviewcomment":"The juiciest, cheesiest, and messiest in London... but also one of the best. Bleecker Street Burger is a black food truck cranking out some of the best burgers in London. Check their Twitter to find where they are on a given day - @bleeckerburger. Before even locating the truck, I could smell the tasty burgers being cooked. <br><br>Arriving at the friendly counter, I asked which burger to order and was informed the double was an award-winning creation. Waiting in anticipation as my burger was cooked, I pondered what to top such a burger with. I noted that the condiments were outside the truck, which places burger destiny in your own hands (luckily, I think we all know what we like). Upon receiving the burger, I took a quick peek and noticed that it looked like a Classic American backyard grill burger. I grabbed the mayo, mustard, and ketchup to put a generous topping of each on top. <br><br>I found a seat in the park and bit into this beautiful burger... making sure to keep it away from my clothes (since it was dripping with flavor). Melted cheese, juicy beef, sweet, salty, and creamy condiments... and a pillowy bun that gives any London burger a run for its money. My burger disappeared within only a few minutes, and so did my napkins trying to battle this multi-napkin affair. A food truck that makes a burger better than most steakhouses. Compared to my other top burgers Bleecker easily takes them on, but personal preference steps into the equation. I love pickled or caramelized onions, bacon, or a hint of or spicy/smoky flavor. As a result, Bleecker is not my #1 in London, but it&#39;s darn close.",

Once inside however, my eyes were simply overwhelmed (in a good way) at the selection of teas, tea accessories, and all things tea related. <br><br>The salespeople were quite nice, and glad to explain the differences of the teas and provide a taste test for you. This place was cozy inside, and larger than one might expect once inside the store. There are simply walls of tea and more walls of tea items to brew the perfect cup. <br><br>I came away with orange oolong and jasmine flower tea; two of my favs. While the prices are not cheap, you are getting quality tea leaves....nothing quite like it in the states unless you visit a chinese tea shop.

"reviewcomment":"If I have my girlfriend to thank for converting me from tea to coffee, I have Talkhouse Coffee to thank for sealing the deal. Well, in fact my girlfriend also introduced me to Talkhouse Coffee. So maybe I just have my girlfriend to thank for everything.<br><br>Whichever, Talkhouse Coffee is very much this coffee-lovers dream. The coffee is top-notch - Square Mile, Workshop Coffee - and expertly prepared, in this case via Aeropress and served as standard without milk. The result is an epiphany: that coffee doesn&#39;t necessarily have to be a hot, strong drink to provide a much-needed jolt of caffeine, it can actually be refreshing, full of delicate yet pleasing flavours and something to sip in awe rather than absent-mindedly.<br><br>Talkhouse Coffee&#39;s interior is predominantly white and airy while the staff are friendly and faintly hipster. It all rather reminds me of Blue Bottle Coffee in Brooklyn, another place that wowed me. Like Blue Bottle Coffee, Talkhouse Coffee&#39;s walls are dotted with coffee-making equipment, giving relative newcomers like me an insight into just how dedicated coffee die-hards are when it comes to experimenting their way to the perfect brew.<br><br>Rather surprisingly, Talkhouse Coffee also serve food, and it&#39;s similarly noteworthy. I had a splendid stack of American pancakes with blueberries, bananas, cream and maple syrup. My girlfriend had sweetcorn fritters. Both dishes were excellent.<br><br>Talkhouse Coffee sell Workshop Coffee in bags (beans or ground on the spot).

"reviewcomment":"Superb! <br><br>I&#39;m not really a French food fan. Well actually, I&#39;ll eat (mostly) anything, but it&#39;s more that French food is not on my top 5 list of go-to foods / restaurants. In fact it&#39;s probably not on my top 10 list!<br><br>However that said I very much enjoyed Comptoir Gascon&#39;s offerings. We went for the lunch special which is very reasonable at £14.50 for two courses. I thought &#34;as I&#39;m here, lets go a little crazy!&#34; I started with the pig&#39;s trotter cake and tartare sauce. Of course it wasn&#39;t like eating a knuckle sandwich, nor was it like eating toe nails (as one would imagine). I&#39;m not actually sure which part of it had the pigs feet in it because it was more like a cross between a hash brown and a potato rosti. Come to think of it, perhaps it was more like a potato cake. Not withstanding, it was surprisingly very tasty and I&#39;m always impressed when dishes are seasoned well. I know that might sound a little odd, but I believe getting seasoning right is key - salt and pepper on a dining table (generally) should be redundant, but I appreciate people have different tastes too.<br><br>So my first try of pig feet cake was a score, and to follow in the &#34;dirty food&#34; theme I had going on, I opted for the mussels marinières and French fries to follow. Also very good and another score. <br><br>If I were in the area, I would definitely go back, and I would also give it a thumbs up if anybody wanted to take me there for lunch. Anyone? Anyone?

(it wasn&#39;t far from the flour and sugar - doh!)<br><br>About 5 minutes later, I grab a spot in line to checkout and the same Waitrose worker pops up in front of me to show me that I had grabbed the gluten-free bicarb because there was none of the regular left on the shelf, which she realized after directing me there. She says &#34;that one is expensive, so if you don&#39;t need it I found more of the regular bicarb in the back&#34;. Can I just say, WOW?!?!<br><br>She had: 1. followed up on the direction she gave me, 2. realized that I may need help, 3. went in back to find the right item, and then - 4. FOUND ME in the store to give me the right item. I couldn&#39;t even stand it - and gushed all over her with thanks. This store is not small and it is not quiet, which means that she really went searching with armfuls of this product to make sure that she got it to me.<br><br>I&#39;m still happy about it. And I love this store. It also has every organic, diverse and good product you could possibly need. And delivers to your home if you like. And hires amazing staff, apparently. Thumbs up for Waitrose!!",

Good selection of the standard deli fare - sun blushed tomatoes, salami etc, - however this place comes into its own with an outrageous selection of marmalades, jam and other preserved concoctions, spanning the entire back wall of the shop. Eat in, or take out, the choice is yours. Cheery service provides the icing on this particularly satisfying retail cake, and I suspect if you want a cherry as well they probably sell these too.",

It&#39;s an old classic, if anyone&#39;s actually interested, and the atmosphere of Yumchaa was just perfect for the uncanny action in the book.

The pastries are well made and the croissants are the biggest and best I&#39;ve ever tasted, and in my opinion, are worth the trip alone.<br><br>The service is good, but they can get very busy and run out of all the best food early so make sure you get there early for lunch. The sandwiches are great, using their own bread of course, freshly made and wholesome they make a great lunch, chicken / basil/ mayo is my favorite. Throw in a coffee and a croissant (or slice of the excellent Carot cake) and job done!<br><br>They take orders for cakes if you&#39;d like one for an occasion, and the staff are pretty clued up on the ingredients of everything, so they&#39;ll be able to advise you on any dietary requirements you may have. <br><br>Usually playing funky music (not so keen on the Jazz FM though) its always clean and pleasant to sit in or take your coffee round the park.",

"reviewcomment":"This is quite possibly my favorite find during my stay in London.<br><br>Greensmiths is deceptively small from the outside. My friend wanted to come in because she was starving and wanted to get something from the display windows. We found a cute little bakery area and a butchers area, in which we proceeded to order a couple baked goods to satiate our hunger. There was some ground meat with a crust on the outside that was absolutely fantastic. The mince pies were okay, but I might just not be used to the taste of mince pie (I&#39;m still not sure what it should taste like..).<br><br>Then we noticed stairs! There was a plethora of other things to see. Fresh produce, coffee shop, extensive wine collection, groceries, and a restaurant! I loved the little restaurant hidden in the store. It was obviously the place to have a quiet lunch with friends. The atmosphere was relaxed. If I didn&#39;t live an ocean and some thousands of miles away, I would love to spend my afternoons here sipping on coffee and enjoying a meal with friends. Amongst four of us, we shared a turkey and cranberry sandwich, mushroom risotto, salad, and squash appetizer. The food was light, healthy, and filling. I could tell a great amount of care went into picking fresh ingredients.<br><br>Greensmiths has a very young and happy vibe to it. I loved coming in here and I loved browsing around.

White walls with turquoise boiserie, a chandelier, gilted golden mirrors, and dark brown leather couches and armchairs. It&#39;s the Mediterrannean goes to Versailles. Or vice versa. Either way, it&#39;s perfect for me!<br><br> They have bakery-made brownies and other goodies at the till (I was very tempted) and they said that on occasion they make their own brownies. Those, apparently, are huge. They&#39;re the ones who said it&#39;d be best to share them or consider them a full meal. Now that&#39;s a REAL muffin :)<br><br> I&#39;m happy to recommend them as they also have those lovely firefly drinks, the innocent smoothies, and other healthy yummy things to drink and eat.<br><br> Overall I loved the quietness, the warmth, the light, the colours, and, of course, the COFFEE!!<br><br> I now have a favourite coffee shop in Covent Garden!!

"reviewcomment":"a few days ago, my flatmate literally brought home 3 boxes of 12. i shit you not, it was amazing. they have such good deals here (she blames the deals for why she bought so many) like once you buy a dozen, it&#39;s only another pound to get another dozen glazed and then another 2 pounds for another dozen chocolate or something along those lines. jelly filled and chocolate iced are my favorites cause they&#39;re sweet enough but still simple. they really indulgent ones make me little sicky sometimes, but lets be real, i&#39;d never kick a donut out of bed<br><br>krispy kreme is a little taste of home for me, and i can&#39;t resist getting one every time i&#39;m in holborn. one time, i got in a fight with a bitch who made fun of me for shaking the doors and crying cause they were closed. yes, i was slightly intoxicated. oh memories!",

"reviewcomment":"This place would get 5 stars if it had better prices!<br><br>The food they have there is great to pick up quickly between class, but really can&#39;t be frequented every day because it might set you back. The prices aren&#39;t terrible, but sometimes the portion doesn&#39;t fit the price. Also, their hot chocolate is deplorable.<br><br>It really should have wifi...and it really doesn&#39;t. What coffee places don&#39;t have wifi these days? Psh.<br><br>ONTO THE POSITIVES. They have absolutely amazing large chocolate covered donuts that will blow your pants off. These are fantastic! Their sandwiches are quality as well and they have many nice Italian baked items. They have this garlic bread-type thing which has the texture of a churro but is shaped like a slice of bread. It&#39;s fantastic (but a tad too expensive). <br><br>Anyways, the place is located right in Russell Square which is super convenience when leaving any of Birkbeck&#39;s buildings, and it&#39;s a quick place to stop and pick something up!",

"reviewcomment":"Ideally located right outside the exit of the Eurostar, this is the place to come to if you feel like a delicious breakfast or a light lunch. <br><br>The wooden decor gives a cosy feeling to the place. The menu offers a large selection of breakfast options. You can share a basket of various breads and try out their numerous spreads : apricot jam, marmalade, speculoos spread or even white or dark chocolate flavours. You can also order the usual French croissant or a soft-boiled egg. <br><br>If you are after a light lunch, they serve some delicious soups and tartines with bacon, chicken and all sorts of veggies. <br><br>You might have to queue for a few minutes as the place is quite popular but they usually serve relatively quickly. They also have large tables if you come with a group, which is quite convenient. There is still enough space around if you do not feel like interacting with your neighbour. <br><br>If you are in a hurry, you can also buy a croissant, pastry or a sandwich at their store next door.",

One of the effects of the lamp shade was such that you could hear what anyone on the other side of the room was saying, or, in my case, the guy on the other side could always hear me laughing!<br><br> There&#39;s also a TV screen available where you can see footage from the shop&#39;s production process.<br><br> The chocolate is hand-made on the premises by people who are absolutely passionate about what they do, and it shows. There&#39;re quite a few different flavoured bars available, including green tea and an unexpectedly delicious tobacco-dark chocolate combination. One of the more unusual combinations was that of chocolate-covered wasabi peas. I&#39;m not sure if that worked, but, hey, it&#39;s something everyone should try at least once. The packaging is also very pretty, befitting that of a premium chocolate.<br><br> This is the only branch of L&#39;Artisan du Chocolat where you can get their chocolate cocktails. I didn&#39;t get the chance to sample some the time I went, but I did get to try some delicious cocoa pulp sorbet and Iscream soft salted caramel gelato.<br><br> Essentially, there&#39;s something here for every kind of chocolate lover, and it was well-worth my making the &#39;trek&#39; from East London!",

I explained I wanted red velvet and then we went through what kind of design I wanted, frosting type, etc. Because I said my cake had a train ride to travel and survive, he suggested a combination of cream frostings so I could get the yummiest cake that would still make a day&#39;s travel in good condition. He kindly suggested that he&#39;ll have the majority of the cake ready but that I could help put the finishing touches to it before I take it. I vaguely themed it to Alice in Wonderland, lots of cute mushroom candies, etc and it looked great and tasted amazing.<br><br>Highly recommend this friendly and delicious bakery!",

"reviewcomment":"Based on the ridiculously good customer service that I just received at this Waitrose today, I&#39;m gonna go ahead with a very big 5-star rating!!<br><br>The story -- I&#39;m American, so finding sodium bicarbonate (baking soda) at a UK or Euro grocery store is a challenge like no other. It should be next to the flour and sugar, am I right Americans?<br><br>So, I catch a young female worker after combing the second aisle that I thought -might- contain this crazy item, and ask her &#34;where oh where is this sodium bicarbonate?&#34;. She directs me to the aisle that I was already in, but gives me a description of what it looks like. So, I head back and find it within a minute or so and move on with my shopping. (it wasn&#39;t far from the flour and sugar - doh!)<br><br>About 5 minutes later, I grab a spot in line to checkout and the same Waitrose worker pops up in front of me to show me that I had grabbed the gluten-free bicarb because there was none of the regular left on the shelf, which she realized after directing me there. She says &#34;that one is expensive, so if you don&#39;t need it I found more of the regular bicarb in the back&#34;. Can I just say, WOW?!?!<br><br>She had: 1. followed up on the direction she gave me, 2. realized that I may need help, 3. went in back to find the right item, and then - 4. FOUND ME in the store to give me the right item. I couldn&#39;t even stand it - and gushed all over her with thanks. This store is not small and it is not quiet, which means that she really went searching with armfuls of this product to make sure that she got it to me.<br><br>I&#39;m still happy about it. And I love this store. It also has every organic, diverse and good product you could possibly need. And delivers to your home if you like. And hires amazing staff, apparently.

"reviewcomment":"I love this place so much it&#39;s difficult to know where to begin! It has the most amazing food, cakes and coffee from the wonderful cakes to pies and sausage rolls plus a wonderful array of freshly made lunches - casseroles, special salads etc Everything is locally sourced where possible and of top quality. It&#39;s a deli as well as a coffee shop and it is one of my favourite things to go and buy a range of yummy treats from hoggity pies and game pies to home made fishcakes to have for dinner. They renovated the upstairs a while ago so there is now more seating space than there used to be which is great news as it&#39;s the perfect place to stop for a slice of Victoria sponge cake and coffee in the middle of the afternoon. You can sit by the window and watch the world go buy, lovely!<br><br> Handmade food is also a catering company so definitely worth looking at for any catering needs!",

"reviewcomment":"House is a café above a small gallery in Camberwell and a venue in its own right. It is everything I like café to be: great tea in charming mugs, delicious homemade cakes, comfy mismatched seats, wireless internet and friendly staff. Added to that it&#39;s cheap - £1 for a cup of tea and less than £2 for a coffee. <br>The best thing about House is its style, which is kind of expected considering its arty premises. The green globe lights, whitewashed walls and wooden floors give it a bright and airy feel that one normally associates with a gallery. <br><br>It&#39;s a calming space that is great for sitting and working, much like I am doing now!<br><br>The art from downstairs often creeps upstairs and there are colouring pencils and paper on offer if you feel inspired to create!<br><br>Breakfast, sandwiches and salads are all on offer as well as a great selection of teas and coffees. I recommend the strawberry milkshake.",

"reviewcomment":"Lovely little French place to grab lunch (no place to sit, only takeaway) when out and about in the City. You feel transported to a back street in Paris when you step in, with their French music on the background and the staff speaking in French among them, it is very charming.<br><br> It has a lovely selection of large baguettes with fillings to choose from, ranging from £3.40 to £4.20. My favourites are Le Nature (egg, lettuce, tomato, cream cheese) and L&#39;Italien (mozzarella, tomato, pesto, olive oil, black olives... sooo yummy!). Plus they make their bread themselves, and you can tell!<br><br> They also make most of the sweet things in the store, which are all lovely. I think the only ones that they don&#39;t do in-house are the muffins (which are delicious too)<br><br> Definitely worth a try if you are in the area (of if you aren&#39;t! I normally have to walk for a while from where I am to get there but the thought of their baguettes direct me unconsciously ;)",

"reviewcomment":"Jen Cafe is one of a few reasons I would ever go into Chinatown for chinese food. Firstly it is definitely a cafe, not fancy at all and service is very rushed and definitely do not expect manners as for most chinatown restaurants. It is like a chinese greasy spoons without the warm smile not even for a regular.But it is one of the places in London where I can forgive the restaurant for bad service as it is part of the experience if you&#39;re planning to eat in Chinatown in the first place.<br>The cafe itself is very small, cheap metal tables and seats, plastic cutlery and plates, bright green walls and an &#39;out of service&#39; sign always stuck on their toilet which makes it all very unwelcoming. But I like it and especially when they make the most fresh and delicious Beijing dumplings in London. And you should only come here for their dumplings and their popular variations of Bubble tea. Only use the other items on the menu as a stomach filler for the more hungry ones as the quality would not match the dumplings at all.<br><br>You can tell it&#39;s fresh from the lady sitting facing the window making the dumplings in front of you as you walk by and there is a choice of either pork or vegetarian and then boiled or pan fried. I always go for the pork just because it is more fragrant and then a portion of it being pan-fried for £6.00 and a portion of boiled for £5.00. They are like no other Beijing dumplings anywhere else in London. First of all they are made from glutinous rice flour rather than all-purpose or plain flour. This provides a more lighter and softer pastry, more sticky which makes the dumplings more moist, making it a delight to eat. The filling is perfectly seasoned and flavoured well with chives and other ingredients. Flavours are definitely not lacking here.<br><br>Whether it is pan fried or boiled both varieties comes to you piping hot. Even though I always order both varieties I always preferred the boiled ones as it&#39;s a fresher, cleaner taste, more squidgy and holds more of the pork stock inside. However I know many prefer the pan-fried just for that smokey flavour and crispy base. Once it&#39;s left on your table it&#39;s to your customisation with the condiments on your table and the platelets given. The usual mix tends to be a spoonful of vinegar and half of that in soy sauce and then chilli oil to your preferred spice level. Of course you can keep adding each to get the flavour you want.<br><br>As a stomach filler I would recommend the noodle soup dishes to the rice dishes as I find their meat over rice a bit too greasy with fatty and poor in quality meat. I always go for their special which is shredded pork and pickled cabbage with rice noodles and make sure you ask for rice noodles or they will give you instant noodles instead. So the noodles aren&#39;t the best quality, a bit plasticky but for the price of £5.50 I&#39;m not complaining because it is the pork and pickled cabbage that flavours the broth making it very appetising and warming to the soul with the meaty, savoury and sour taste. You can always spice it up with the chilli oil on your table too.<br><br>Depending on what time you go it is always quite packed and yes service is very rushed and they will throw the bill at you straight after you finish your last bite so a bit of warning there. But with that in mind and a bit of openness you will find yourself having a very nice delicious, quick yet filling meal there. Definitely not a place for a romantic meal but for good quality, authentic Beijing dumplings.",

"reviewcomment":"Had a fabulous date night at the Warrington! I had the steak, which was absolute perfection. I was sad that it wasn&#39;t a thicker cut of steak, so I could savour it longer! The sauce that is served with the steak was to die for. So delicious! It comes with fat chips, which are totally yum! Be warned, the chilli chips will cause a fire to erupt in your mouth. They looked so harmless, but they are deceiving.<br><br>The Englishman ordered the fish and chips. I was shocked to see it was a whole battered fish on chips, served with mushy peas. I tried the mushy peas. They were delish. The serving size was huge. They could give you a bigger portion of the mushy peas though. <br><br>Before dining here, I thought the prices seemed a bit steep. Not outrageous, but reflective of being located in Maida Vale. I&#39;d say for what you get, it&#39;s actually good value for money. No wonder this place is always packed. YUM!<br><br>P.S. It&#39;s also a nice place to go for drinks. However, they don&#39;t make cocktails. You might be able to convince them to make you something simple, but be prepared for an alternative.",

I&#39;m sold!<br><br>I had a free evening, and luckily Andrew and one of his friends decided they could entertain me, so we headed to The Black Heart for some burgers and fries from Kimchi Cult.<br><br>We ordered everything. Seriously. Three kimchi burgers around plus the chicken burger to split in three ways. An order of korean chicken wings? Yes, please! Two orders of bulgogi fries? Bring it.<br><br>Everything was great. The burger was delicious. Perfectly cooked and the kimchi just added an amazing flavor. Possibly one of the best burgers I&#39;ve had in London. The bulgogi fries were to die for. They just needed more beef to make it that much better. And the chicken wings were heavenly. The picked radishes that came with them was just the icing on the cake. <br><br>I noticed on the big menu above the bar that they had something called Korean tacos which wasn&#39;t on the paper menu, so I&#39;m curious if such a thing exists, and if it does, why isn&#39;t it in my face right now?<br><br>Seriously. Get to the Black Heart to enjoy this delicious food while you can. It&#39;s a great atmosphere as well.

"reviewcomment":"The juiciest, cheesiest, and messiest in London... but also one of the best. Bleecker Street Burger is a black food truck cranking out some of the best burgers in London. Check their Twitter to find where they are on a given day - @bleeckerburger. Before even locating the truck, I could smell the tasty burgers being cooked. <br><br>Arriving at the friendly counter, I asked which burger to order and was informed the double was an award-winning creation. Waiting in anticipation as my burger was cooked, I pondered what to top such a burger with. I noted that the condiments were outside the truck, which places burger destiny in your own hands (luckily, I think we all know what we like). Upon receiving the burger, I took a quick peek and noticed that it looked like a Classic American backyard grill burger. I grabbed the mayo, mustard, and ketchup to put a generous topping of each on top. <br><br>I found a seat in the park and bit into this beautiful burger... making sure to keep it away from my clothes (since it was dripping with flavor). Melted cheese, juicy beef, sweet, salty, and creamy condiments... and a pillowy bun that gives any London burger a run for its money. My burger disappeared within only a few minutes, and so did my napkins trying to battle this multi-napkin affair. A food truck that makes a burger better than most steakhouses. Compared to my other top burgers Bleecker easily takes them on, but personal preference steps into the equation. I love pickled or caramelized onions, bacon, or a hint of or spicy/smoky flavor. As a result, Bleecker is not my #1 in London, but it&#39;s darn close.",

In fact Caravan manages to be all of these things and more.<br><br>I went for dinner in a group of 4, and good job we booked in advance as the place was rammo. It still has that &#39;we&#39;re all friends here&#39; vibe though, helped by the fact that they have a lot of long communal tables, and a really mixed crowd - great for people-watching yay :)<br><br>The menu is unexpectedly interesting (more on this in a minute), and great for veggies (all 3 of my companions) and meat-eaters alike. We ordered a mix of small and large plates to share (always the best way) and got stuck in. <br><br>Highlights included the jalapeno corn bread with chipotle butter and the blue cheese dish with figs and orange honey - see what I mean about interesting?! Slightly usual combinations that turned out oh so tasty. Ooh the butternut squash and pesto pizza was also yum, and I can&#39;t go without recommending a) you get dessert and b) try a cocktail - mine involved gin and blackberry jam and managed to erase its own name from my memory...try it though!<br><br>The thus far unsung hero of the evening (and the main reason that bumped this up to 5-stars) was our server - a cute five-foot-something goateed hipster-spec-ed guy who was just so goddamn charmingly cool (or coolly charming?!) that you wanted to just keep on ordering stuff. Hmm well played, Caravan.<br><br>Yes it&#39;s predictable in fulfilling that now well-known London equation: obscure industrial space + restaurant makeover = *hipster alert*, but it keeps a good amount of heart alongside that.

The selection of tea is huge and I love being able to try a new type or style every time I visit, especially when paired with one of their fantastic cakes and pastries.<br><br>Highly recommended.",

"reviewcomment":"A really great supplement to your regular grocery runs! <br><br>Initially I signed up for the &#34;small fruit and veg box&#34; as I felt the supermarkets near me were sorely lacking in good, varied produce. <br><br>Then I thought -- oh yes, organic eggs. Surely, I need those weekly. <br>...and milk. <br>...and bread. Juices? Sure. <br>...and pies, lasagnas and other quick from freezer to oven food. <br>...and I just ate a quiche, spinach, ellemental and tomato - divine. <br><br>*setup was easy -- they deliver, obviously. I arranged to give them a key to the building door (they have a secure process) and they pop it right inside very early AM and are on their way. Never missed. <br><br>*can skip weeks for holiday, etc. I once put it on hold for a month just because we needed a break and would be away for a bit. No big deal. <br><br>*Automatic billing via debit card. Billed once your food hits your door. <br><br>*Can amend the orders very easily each week. They email me on Mondays and I often add in a few things here and there depending on what we need/want for the week. Very flexible. <br><br>*They recycle all of their own boxes, so I simply leave them out on Wednesday mornings for the driver to pick up from the following week. The fridge items come packed in UK wool and ice packs, also can be sent back to be reused. The company obviously values the earth! <br><br>I&#39;m particularly fond of their frozen foods (lasagna, pies, etc) especially for when we are in a crunch. I also like their pasties, quiches, etc. These seem to be my favorites. Of course the eggs and milk and such are all great. <br><br>One thing about the fruit/veg -- is that because its not sprayed to high hell with pesticides, fresheners etc...you often need to plan to eat it within a few short days, otherwise risk spoiling. Also, it comes from the ground. Like real dirt in the UK. SO sometimes you need to wash/scrub a bit before eating. Normal behavior, but worth noting! Usually each week comes with a small bag of potatoes and onions as well, great complements to the many dishes and recipes they include. (i like this -- though I don&#39;t know about using recipes, I prefer to ruin everything I make!) <br><br>Overall I&#39;m pretty happy with this. Always a surprise, or something I wouldn&#39;t normally buy. I like all the stories about the farmers and growers, the recipes and information. Nice to support local -- even though I realize this is a pretty significant operation now. Bonus, it runs smoothly because of it... <br><br>If you like fresh stuff arriving to your door -- I highly recommend! A bit pricey, but saves you from the Tesco-tsk-tsk of the world.",

For a place that serves greasy-spoon staples there is a surprising lasck of grease. No bad thing - it&#39;s often the artery clogging element to the food in these kinds of places that makes me avoid them. Thankfully Andrews seems to be able to cook a damn fine English breakfast without it being drowned in a pool of cholesterol.<br><br> There is plenty of choice on offer - jacket potatoes, omelets, burgers etc - all available for less than you would expect (Grays Inn Road is plagued by places selling £5 plus sandwiches - a hot meal for less is amazing!) and served hot and fast. Last time I went in I had a side of chips - chips that were on a par with classy upscale restaurants.<br><br> It&#39;s always busy here - a sign of its quality - so you may end up sharing a table with someone - but thats part of its charm.

I cannot stress the difference between Morrisons and waitrose on Holloway Road. They are like a different world yet so close physically. One is a nice relaxing experience with beautiful food, beautiful people and slightly inflated prices. The other is not and is a horrible experience that you only tolerate for the lower prices. <br><br>I personally would rather just relax whilst shopping, not have to que for ages and pay a fraction more for the pleasure. But occasionally I&#39;ll do a big bargain shop and instantly regret it and get in an argument with some idiot in Morrisons that often is someone that works there!",

Rant over.<br><br>The good news is that Budgens is now in my life. I thoroughly scoured the shelves thinking that it was too good to be true, how could a pricey area house a discount supermarket. The selection is fabulous for the central location, organic products grace the shelves and to my surprise, their staff is lovely. The deli counter, bakery and aisle especially for ethnic food, were the elements that won me over. We, of course, didn&#39;t need to do any grocery shopping but who can leave empty handed. <br><br>Budgens, I thank you for my expanded thighs, the oversized bag of licorice and smartie cookies were great...I promise to come back soon.",

(seriously). <br>*Speaking of this, the Tom Kha soup is pretty wonderful. <br>*My personal favorite is the Kao Pad Thai (so good). <br>*They have beer and wine! They&#39;ll bring it to you. <br>*Get the brownies. <br><br>At first the portions *might* seem a bit small for some dishes, but in reality its really filling, the ingredients are fresh and I am always quite full. They are so speedy, that I barely have to think it through and the food is here. <br><br>The food is generally pretty spot on. It&#39;s nothing fancy, but it works. And its better than I can make. And its packaged well. So, 4 very solid stars. <br><br>Far exceeds all other delivery places, it is our go-to!

There&#39;s always a butcher on hand for and special techniques and they&#39;ll pretty well prepare anything you get as you like it.<br><br>I wish we saw more places like this instead of the sad looking stuff we&#39;re used to getting in the supermarket.

"reviewcomment":"Sainsbury&#39;s Harringey is my local supermarket and the one I use most often. Ever since the store was renovated last year, shopping here has been nothing but pleasure. It is less stressfull compared to how it was before the refurbishment.<br>The car park has been extended and the store itself massively improved. It is much more spacious now, with the new lobby where the magazines and the tobacco counter are stationed. The ailes are wider, so you can actually browse and shop without having to elbow your way through. All the trolleys are brand new, so no worries about a doggy trolley getting stuck while you&#39;re in the middle of your shopping. There is more light in the store, both natural and artificial. <br>The selection of the stock is pretty wide, with new items constantly appearing on the shelves. The deli counter and the fishmonger are pretty good, even though you won&#39;t find as much selection as in some other supermarkets. <br>Sainsbury have also started selling clothing, kitchen and electrical appliances, which makes it a convenient one-stop shop. <br>I have noticed Sainsbury&#39;s have started offering a lot more of special deals and offers, making your money stretch further.<br>After you&#39;ve finished shopping you might stop for a coffee and pastry in the new in-store cafe, which is light, airy and very pleasant place to relax for a few minutes.",

"reviewcomment":"What is it that makes full stop so great?<br><br>The cosy, relaxed atmosphere? The nice staff? The absolutely delicious milk that makes all their milk-based coffee beverages taste heaven? The Square Mile coffee that is so well-crafted and robust? The fact they are open late?<br><br>The SOY MATCHA LATTE with a drizzle of honey that has become my new obsession? Oh, also, they&#39;ve recently started a &#39;tab&#39; programme, where you can prepay for drinks (£15, £50, etc) and then just deduct from the tab. With a £15 purchase, they give you one free drink, so this basically just replaces their former frequent drinker card programme (its actually a better deal, buy 5, get 1 free, basically).<br><br>The food is really nice-- great sandwiches in particular. Yea, they are basically something you could make at home, but they have top quality ingredients and for a good price as well. Around £6 for sandwich and beverage, generally.<br><br>My one gripe is that when you order a takeaway soy matcha latte (which normally comes in a tall glass if you have it in), it comes in a tiny takeaway cup that is half the volume of the beverage you&#39;d get if you had it in. Same price. Kinda lame, guys. <br><br>Otherwise, this is probably my favourite study spot in London.",

It&#39;s tiny, there&#39;s the French shop assistants. I can&#39;t afford to spend lots of money. So I&#39;ve just looked longingly through the window and wished I was rich enough to buy them.<br><br> But! Today I did pop in! And I&#39;m so pleased that I did. I spent £5.60 on tasty things and had five little macaroons (I even shared one). Sea salt caramel was very yummy and pistachio, but it was the fig and date on that blew me away. Remember those fig rolls you ate in the 90s (do people still eat them? can you still buy them?) well they taste exactly like that. But fancier. Yummy.<br><br> The staff were friendly, in that very &#39;French&#39; way, and the shop itself is like a stunning little gold cave. A bit tacky, but on the edge of Burlington Arcade it works just fine. The French can get away with ostentatious. Yay. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll come here very often at all, but if I did that would ruin the fun. There&#39;s something very decadent about coming in here and buying treats for yourself, but even if i bought them as a present for someone, I&#39;d eat them all myself.",

And boy oh boy was I surprised to find I had my own little tower of gluten and diary free deliciousness. It started with egg, and cucumber sandwiches on the bottom, followed by scones with jam and butter, followed by an almond and raisin cake, and finished with a cupcake and chocolate coated strawberries.

"reviewcomment":"What a find Crepe Fun-Tastic is, hidden in a small outlet next to Victoria underground. It&#39;s open late, serves a range of good value (£4-£6) sweet and savoury crepes amidst a multi-coloured interior and the staff are very friendly. <br><br>I went for a simple, Nutella-only sweet crepe, but it was delicious. I also liked the fact that it was cheaper to eat-in, as takeaway means they &#34;have to provide a bag.&#34; So Crepe Fun-Tastic even scores on the environmental front! As others have said, the owners are Hungarian, reflected in the Hungarian rock (and Rasmus) soundtrack, and the atmosphere is really welcoming.<br><br>The small, sheltered restaurant also acts as providing a quiet haven from the hubbub immediately outside. I work nearby, and I can see Crepe Fun-Tastic being a new lunch place for me.",

No waiting around! I usually make a stir fry of sorts, adding these with a sauce right at the end (I find them too delicate for soups). IF YOU PUT THEM IN THE FRIDGE OVERNIGHT, they will become stiff and hard to separate. You can soak them for 5 minutes in warm water to help separate them, but they will never be the same!",

(I had walked by many times before, but was never in need of cheese :-)<br><br>Upon entering the store, I was greeted by a poster announcing an upcoming show on the BBC where Cheeses had partnered up with Nigel Slater...oh dear, I always fall asleep when watching his cooking shows!<br><br>Anyway, the woman behind the counter was nice and I kind of put her in charge of creating a selection of cheeses for me. I have to admit, I&#39;m not very knowledgeable when it comes to cheeses, but this is exactly why I came to a specialty store. <br><br>The store itself is very cute. Tiny and narrow, but just being in there makes you want to buy all sorts of things. And they offer other food items as well, such as chutneys, biscuits &amp; digestives and even some sausages. <br><br>Overall, I was very happy with my shopping experience at Cheeses, although I would&#39;ve liked it even better if they offered to taste some cheeses. (Although I assume that they wouldn&#39;t have refused if I had asked them.) <br><br>Another tip for prospective shoppers: I bought some fancy crackers/digestives, which - to be honest - I found way too expensive. I suggest you stop by at nearby W Martyn to stock up on crackers and chutneys at a much more affordable price.",

"reviewcomment":"This is a cracking little find of a bakery. I was out driving with a friend, we were both hungry so he navigated me towards this place, all the while describing how good the bread was and how he loved the crust. I&#39;ve heard people raving about sandwich shops before, but usually it&#39;s the fillings, not the bread!<br><br> We had a sandwich, drink and cream slice each and it came to £6.25 altogether. Can&#39;t say fairer than that. In fact, I&#39;d say they are undercharging. Let me say why (but sshhh, don&#39;t tell them!).<br><br> The ladies here are proper London lasses who really know how to make a sandwich. They whack loads of filling between two slices of the most gorgeous bread in the world. Once I started eating, I had to admit to my mate that he was spot on about the bread. The crust has this weird but alluring quality of being both crunchy and chewy at the same time and the bread is soft and strong. Perfect.<br><br> They make all of their own breads and cakes and have a huge selection to choose from, all sorts of rolls, loaves, baps, doughnuts, slices, tarts, pies, and so much more. I must have been in there for 5 minutes and still not laid eyes on all their wares, and it&#39;s a small shop! The cream slice was the best I&#39;ve ever had, and you could taste the love that had gone into making it.<br><br> All of this goes a long way to explaining the queue snaking out of the door, and that the best choice you could make today is to join it.",

"reviewcomment":"I took my boyfriend to Aurora Soho for a surprise birthday treat and it was just that! After reading Jay Rayner&#39;s brilliant review in the Observer, I thought this would be a perfect place to spend a romantic evening celebrating a special birthday, and I wasn&#39;t disappointed.<br><br> From the moment I called to make a reservation to leaving at the end of the night, the staff were superb - friendly, hospitable and couldn&#39;t do enough for us.<br><br> Aurora is a small, warm and very welcoming restaurant serving delicious, locally sourced, fresh food.<br><br> The interior of Aurora is painted in a lovely bohemian blood red (as Jay describes it!) with candles and lillies adding atmosphere and a beautiful scent! The chairs and tables are all authentically old school; wooden seats with leather pads and arranged in intimate groups and alcoves which makes for a great intimate atmosphere.<br><br> We ate upstairs, however I believe there&#39;s also a downstairs eating area and in the summer people rave about the beautiful courtyard garden as a perfect place to lunch and enjoy when we have some sunshine!<br><br> The food is a mix of traditional british fare, with a twist. Aurora offer a great mix of meat, vegetarian and fish mains which are all reasonably priced for this jewel of a find in Soho. We ordered the Steak and Swordfish which came with a selection of seasonal veg - both were cooked to our liking and tasted wonderful. The deserts are to die for - we shared a beautiful homemade cheesecake (which is just right after a sizable main!).<br><br> Our booking did have a 2 hour table limit, but there was enough time to savor the food and atmosphere without feeling rushed or hassled to leave.<br><br> A great little find for any foodie looking for quality in Central London!",

It is by far the best Italian bakery in London! Their sweet sfogliatelle are scrumptious, finger licking good. They have AMAZING rolls with added ingredients such as herbs or raisins. Their flat breads are out of this world. I would often order pizzas to bring to girlfriends&#39; apartments when we had a wine and pizza night in. My fave were the slices of onion and rosemary pizza. But seriously, they were all good. <br><br>Another good plan is to visit the cafe on a weekend morning, order a cafe latte (also excellent), and sit outside with a muffin or other such pastry (namely: panettone) to watch the people go by on nearby Kensington High Street. The coffee is rich, not burnt, creamy. I spent (and gained!) a lot of pounds and a lot of hours here, but it was always worth it! I can&#39;t wait to make a trip to London again. Exeter Street will definitely be the first stop on my list.",

"reviewcomment":"This shop is a must for true chocolate lovers (at least those with reasonably deep wallets). I used to work around the corner, and the occasional visit here was a real treat - and I&#39;m not normally that turned on by chocolate.<br><br> The emphasis is on very, very high quality hand-made chocolate products as a luxury, almost gastronomic, experience: this is not the place for chocolate bunnies or other such novelties. The chocolate products here have been made with very fine selected cocoa, described as you would wine, with distinctive flavours and &#39;notes&#39; in terms of its aroma and taste. If you have never experienced chocolate like this before, it&#39;s something of a revelation (although potentially a dangerously expensive habit to acquire!).<br><br> The presentation is generally very restrained, adding to the feel of quality and exclusiveness - there are caskets, hampers and wooden boxes as well as more traditional presentation boxes. The one exception is a heart-shaped box for the ultimate statement of commitment!<br><br> All this quality comes at a price, so be prepared to dig deep. Prices start from around £5.95 for a basic 250g bar, up to £65 for the 1.2kg Luxury Casket. For £8.50 you can have a 350g box of drinking chocolate - and here that means flakes of pure dark chocolate, with 70% cocoa solids, not powder.<br><br> There are quite a lot of options around the £20 mark for smaller boxes, including chocolate stem ginger at £18, or £22.50 for a 280g box of Grand Cru Truffles, which come in Dark, Milk, Champagne, Raspberry, and Malt Whisky flavours (or a mixture of all five). They also do boxes especially designed to round off the perfect dinner party, from £12.95 to £43.50. The shelf life of some products is limited to around 3 weeks.<br><br> Needless to say, the products would make the perfect gift for the discerning chocolate lover, for a dinner party or as a special gesture to your loved ones.",

My friend is lucky to live nearby so whenever I visit her I pop into this store to fill up my supplies.<br><br>It&#39;s more like home and cozy version planet organic, without the fuits&amp;veg and make up.

"reviewcomment":"For me personally the best Italian place in London.<br><br> The décor is simple, so is the food, but probably that&#39;s the secret of its divine taste.<br><br> Their pasta with pesto is fabulous, nowhere else do they make is so well, and portions are generous, too. Pricewise, it&#39;s comparable to popular Italian chains, with the difference their food really rocks!<br><br> But it&#39;s not only pesto. Their mushroom risotto, hand-made cannelloni with spinach and ricotta and black seafood spaghetti prove their dishes are as good as only Italian food can be.<br><br> Falling in love with their vegetarian panini I was always trying to find something nearly as good during my trips to Italy, however, without success.<br><br> And if you don&#39;t have enough, the place has also a small selection of Italian products, anything from panettone to mozarella.",

"reviewcomment":"I do love F&amp;W. If you&#39;re looking for something filling but healthy, this is the perfect place. Superb salad bar, soups, fresh sandwiches, sushi and lots of other choices. It also does some pretty yummy things that aren&#39;t so healthy too, like the chocolate brownies. When I had my first brownie here about 2 years ago, I thought I had died and gone to heaven! Very chocolatey, very gooey, and very perfect with one of their lovely lattes :) So after a healthy salad of leaves, pea shoots, and mung beans, this goes down rather nicely!<br><br> It&#39;s a cool place with a great vibe and although it can be a strain on the wallet at times, F&amp;W is one of my original finds of real, good, healthy and hearty food in the centre of town. I love what it stands for - local, organic and damn fine produce. Yes it&#39;s full of yummy mummies and pretty models on a break from a shoot for their fill of the healthiness it offers, but it&#39;s an honest and good place. It offers a lovely shopping experience around bonfire night and Christmas too, with lots of tastings on the shop floor mmmm<br><br> I&#39;ve spent many an afternoon here working on my laptop, sat upstairs (which has limited seating) among the library of food - shelves stacked high with wonderful goodies. Great for vegetarians, but they do cater for the carnivores too. Well worth a visit if you&#39;re in the area.",

The shock and awe of being in London during the winter was enough, but being in Harrods? And in the food hall?? And eating gelato??? What a dream... I swear, the entire time was just a blur. I thought I was hallucinating, and when this large martini glass full of ice cream was placed in front of me, I swear I must have died and gone to heaven, cuz all I remember was gelato love, right there in the middle of the food hall...of Harrods...in London....and it was HELLA good. <br><br>I would go back for that experience over and over.<br><br>I know, total tourist moment, but whatever.

"reviewcomment":"This place is a dream, a true dream.<br><br>Firstly, Shannon Corner is a place that isn&#39;t really a place. It&#39;s just an ugly roundabout with some giant stores like B&amp;Q, Halfords, DFS...in fact it has nationwide fame through DFS adverts. Undeserved nationwide fame. Except no...because Krispy Kreme legitimately puts this place on the map. I can only imagine that some American bewildered by London&#39;s tiny inconvenient streets somehow alighted upon this location and thought yes, this ugly highway aligned with giant stores is the closest thing I have seen to America on this tiny inconvenient island it is the ideal location for our flagship Krispy Kreme Drive Thru. (By the way, I&#39;m allowed to say all these horrible things about Shannon Corner because I grew up round here and I LOVE IT SO MUCH REALLY even though it&#39;s rubbish. But you can&#39;t say so).<br><br>Any way, thank you to this anonymous US person I have just made up because this place is a delight. It&#39;s clean and spacious inside, the staff are nice, and they have a HOT sign. If you see the hot sign on from the A3 I suggest you veer off as quickly as motoring law and general public safety will allow and get yourself in here because, as you gaze at the little doughnuts rolling under a &#39;waterfall of glaze&#39; (this expression comes from an actual Krispy Kreme sign...I don&#39;t have those kind of poetic talents) then someone will come and give you a FREE HOT doughnut. Free hot original glazed doughnuts are delicious on every level. Because I was insanely excited (and wearing a Krispy Kreme hat which I took from the till; I think they generally only encourage children to wear them but I probably didn&#39;t look like the kind of person you reason with at that point), I got 3 free doughnuts. I ate them all immediately. I definitely couldn&#39;t eat 3 regular doughnuts all together, there&#39;s something about them being hot that means you can somehow eat much larger than should be acceptable numbers of them. Be warned.<br><br>Anyway...you should visit. I particularly recommend this as the fitting end to your trip to one of New Malden&#39;s fine Korean restaurants, although you will need a car to achieve this as you&#39;re in Toytown USA now...",

"reviewcomment":"I heart Ben&#39;s! <br><br>Huge, chewy, mounds of scrumptious goodness! We visited a couple of locations while on holiday in the UK. <br><br>I tried the following flavors: <br>Peanut Butter- This cookie was like a mini chewy cake of chunky peanut butter :) Moist with loads of peanut bits throughout.<br>Lemon- Tangy and sweet! Moist lemony cookie with a fresh citrusy flavor. <br>Dark Chocolate Chunk- Soft, chewy cookie with large gooey shards of dark chocolate chunks. <br>Oatmeal- Thick and chewy filled with oats, raisins and nuts.<br>Milk Chocolate Chunk- Pretty much the same as the dark chocolate, but with sweeter milk chocolate chunks.<br>Milk Chocolate Orange- Moist cookie with shards of gooey milk chocolate chunks and sweet candied orange pieces. <br><br>To note: The Oatmeal, Dark Choco and Milk Choco were brought back to the US and were still delicious! Moist chewy goodness even after 2 days!",

"reviewcomment":"Ideally located right outside the exit of the Eurostar, this is the place to come to if you feel like a delicious breakfast or a light lunch. <br><br>The wooden decor gives a cosy feeling to the place. The menu offers a large selection of breakfast options. You can share a basket of various breads and try out their numerous spreads : apricot jam, marmalade, speculoos spread or even white or dark chocolate flavours. You can also order the usual French croissant or a soft-boiled egg. <br><br>If you are after a light lunch, they serve some delicious soups and tartines with bacon, chicken and all sorts of veggies. <br><br>You might have to queue for a few minutes as the place is quite popular but they usually serve relatively quickly. They also have large tables if you come with a group, which is quite convenient. There is still enough space around if you do not feel like interacting with your neighbour. <br><br>If you are in a hurry, you can also buy a croissant, pastry or a sandwich at their store next door.",

"reviewcomment":"Paul just gives me good memories of past travels to Europe. I don&#39;t know why. Maybe because it was the only thing open in Brussels on Christmas day, but I just have such fond, warm memories of Paul and it&#39;s deliciously smelling baked goods and it&#39;s ready made breakfast quiches and all the nice amenities of a casual, quaint cafe but ... open on Christmas!<br><br>I must say, I had no idea Paul was an international chain. <br><br>I came here for breakfast with Yee Gan O. during my visit to London recently after a rather sour experience at Flat White and decided to grab a quick snack before heading out for sightseeing for the day. The shop was cozy, the one baker was friendly, and there were sparsely anyone else inside the shop. <br><br>We picked out some quiches (sweet and savory) and waited for our food to be heated up. I love the decor of a place like this because everything just reminds me of being very homely. And the nice thing is when Americans do Homely, especially like Starbucks, it just LOOKS corporate and you know they&#39;re trying too hard. Despite this being a chain, the European Homely look is still very much believable. I was temporarily transported!<br><br>This is a great spot to relax, kick back your feet and enjoy some delicious baked goods, and delicious they are.",

"reviewcomment":"Had a fabulous date night at the Warrington! I had the steak, which was absolute perfection. I was sad that it wasn&#39;t a thicker cut of steak, so I could savour it longer! The sauce that is served with the steak was to die for. So delicious! It comes with fat chips, which are totally yum! Be warned, the chilli chips will cause a fire to erupt in your mouth. They looked so harmless, but they are deceiving.<br><br>The Englishman ordered the fish and chips. I was shocked to see it was a whole battered fish on chips, served with mushy peas. I tried the mushy peas. They were delish. The serving size was huge. They could give you a bigger portion of the mushy peas though. <br><br>Before dining here, I thought the prices seemed a bit steep. Not outrageous, but reflective of being located in Maida Vale. I&#39;d say for what you get, it&#39;s actually good value for money. No wonder this place is always packed. YUM!<br><br>P.S. It&#39;s also a nice place to go for drinks.

"reviewcomment":"I&#39;m not entirely sure why this is being called Franklins Pub. <br>It does have a pub / bar area at the front and seating outside n the street, and though a good place for a few drinks, nice lager on tap and good wine selection, but the place is really more of a restaurant, I&#39;d be hard pressed to call it a pub.<br><br>Anyway, it&#39;s small and intimate, very much a neighbourhood restaurant. The food is of the St Johns &#39;nose-to-tail&#39; style so great for carnivores. There will be one vegetarian dish so if it&#39;s not to your liking as a veggie then choice will be very limited (though the cheese selection is fab).<br><br>The quality of the food is why you go though; I&#39;ve very rarely had anything that wasn&#39;t superb from stalwarts like the steak to more adventurous game dishes or sweetbreads. Like anywhere it can have the odd day when a dish has been merely competent and delicious as opposed to the usual excellence.<br><br>The service is also good and strikes a good balance between formal and friendly. Wine list is excellent, talking of which I marked it £££, but if you&#39;re tempted down list from the 3-4 (of each colour) house type wines it will quickly become a ££££ (there&#39;s a great Margaux, a steal at £45,half price you&#39;ll find it anywhere up town).<br><br>I&#39;ve been going for the best part of a decade and it remains not only a local favourite for me but has trumped many a pricier option in town.<br>Definitely worth a try.",

There are pre made combinations as well as &#39;choose your own&#39; combos. You choose from the type of meat and salad dressing to any extra toppings. For a smaller lunch, you can also choose from their pre made salad boxes that does stuff like lentils and quinoa. <br><br>They also do hot food such as 2 kinds of soup a day, wraps, and toasts. Oh, and a juice bar if you don&#39;t feel like walking down a few more blocks to get cheaper ones from the juice stand. <br><br>Extra 20% on the bill when you dine in? <a href='/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2F%7E%7E%7E%7ERipoff.com&amp;s=da33590d03d697fb70ff3ee7a72f45d4bfce2af26b0a2ed5be07b10893a3656d' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>~~~~Ripoff.com</a>",

"reviewcomment":"we sat outside with the pup for a brunch/lunch in the cold autumn sunshine. it&#39;s a perfect people watching spot along in primrose hill. the menu was really appealing to me - lots of great veggie options ranging from breakfasts, baguettes, baked potatoes, salads and sweet treats. their coffee is monmouth coffee so you are also assured of a lovely cuppa. <br><br>i ordered the halloumi salad which came with hummus and pitta - at £9.75 it wasn&#39;t the cheapest salad i&#39;ve ever had, but i was definitely happy with the serving size and the fresh ingredients. my boyfriend had poached eggs on a bagel - the tiny serving of rocket it came with seemed a little pointless, but aside from that the eggs were perfectly poached and he enjoyed it a lot. <br><br>the girls and guys serving were friendly and quick, and fellow diners were super friendly - which seems to be a recurring theme when you are dining with a cute puppy in tow!",

"reviewcomment":"Almost completely self-service! Samba Swirl are a frozen yoghurt vendor in Angel, small place, only a few seats available inside but then there is Islington Green just over the road, a lovely place to sit and have a snack.<br><br>Offering 4-5 different flavours of fro-yo, you operate the dispensers yourself putting in as much or as little (or as many!) of your desired flavour(s!) as you wish then you decide on your toppings. At a second service station a cornucopia of fruits, nuts and sweet things await your distribution. Again, as much or little (or many!) of the abundant choices available are allowed. Whether scooping with a small shovel or twisting a handle to release the goods all over the fro-yo, cover it as you will then all that&#39;s left is to do is pay. Your pot of wonder is then weighed and a cost is issued depending on this weight - all of the serving pots are a standard size. Large.<br><br>You pay, take a coloured spoon and be on your way. Marvellous. Also, it&#39;s surprisingly cheap. I&#39;ve filled and stacked my pots previously and paid less than I have in places like Pinkberry and Frae. What&#39;s more, it tastes really good. Damn good in fact!<br><br>I&#39;m enjoying Samba Swirl so much that I&#39;m now wondering if the professors in Cern are wasting their time seeking out this Higgs Boson particle when there are greater mysteries to solve. Forget the universe, how does Samba Swirl do it! Then again, it may be best not to know, like magicians not giving away their secrets. Apart from the shit ones. And then they&#39;re out of work &#39;cos everyone knows how they do it.<br><br>I digress. Fact is, Samba Swirl is well worth a visit. Or several.<br><br>TTFN<br>Ian",

Especially the downstairs and corner sitting areas scream &#39;MOROCCAN!&#39;. So yeah, very authentically looking place, delicious cocktails (at least the non-alcoholic ones I tried), fresh mint tea, great service. In terms of the menu both, the selection and presentation are very traditional. I would recommend ALL their starters, including grilled haloumi, and hummus and as a main I cannot adore enough lamb stone dish. So tender, proper slow cook meal with veg, filling, comforting, making smile on ones face. Yet, the portions are very good size.<br>On the other hand, you can go really wrong if you feel like experiment. I tried moroccan pasta (shaped as tiny little balls) in a tomato sauce of sort, the meal didn&#39;t talk to me or make sense - the texture or anything hooked me in. <br>Dessert = baklawa could use at least tiny little innovation, but with lunch menu of 2 courses (big main course, peppermint tea, baklawa) for £12 or so who could say a word. Besides, as stated above - this place&#39;s charm is authenticity and tradition...",

I switched the mushrooms for beans as mushrooms are wrong &amp; you can&#39;t have a breakfast without beans.  You also get a tea or coffee to wash it down with.. The coffee is real coffee too, none of that instant rubbish you sometimes get palmed off with.<br><br>The service is good &amp; there are newspapers for you to read, great if you are hungover &amp; incapable of conversation.<br><br>Downside is that you sometimes have to queue for a significant amount of time for a table... But it&#39;s well worth the wait.<br><br>Other mild annoyance was the lady sat behind me having breakfast on her own, I only know she was dining alone as she felt the need to call everyone in her phone book to let them know that she was.... She also spread the news of Friday nights conquest, really wanted to tell her that it&#39;s very unlikely that she will hear from him again.... He&#39;ll call you...

"reviewcomment":"In the time between my breakfast and lunch yesterday, I got a craving for a smoothie. A strange craving yes, but one that needed satisfied. My hotel happened to be right round the corner from this cafe so yelp told me, and the reviews encouraged me to head on round. <br><br>When I got in I instantly liked the place. It has the contemporary chalk on the walls and rustic wooden furniture thing going on, and the food they offer looked absolutely amazing. Ill definitely be going back to try the food out, but yesterday all I wanted was something healthy that would wake me up. I can&#39;t remember the exact ingredients of my smoothie, but I&#39;m positive it was blackcurrant, raspberry and ginger. Regardless of what was in it fruit wise, it was deliciously fruity and the ginger gave it a strange but pleasant kick. The staff were chatting away to a couple of regulars, which made me like the place more. Rapport with customers is always a great thing to see. Highly recommended place!",

"reviewcomment":"Can someone please just start up a charity for me to have breakfast/brunch here every morning? It would be ever so greatly appreciated. <br><br>For real though- this place does an incredible breakfast/brunch, and somehow, although I hear horror stories galore about having to wait ages for a table (at The Table, ha! aren&#39;t they so witty!), every time I&#39;ve come, the wait has been either non-existent or minimal. Which thank god, because I don&#39;t know how long I could wait to get my hands on their insane poached eggs and waffles! <br><br>Although I&#39;ve never tried their meat-based breakfast options, many brunching companions have, and all can testify to their goodness (honestly, seeing their Full Borough breakfast, I have, on occasion doubted my choice of vegetarian-ness). In addition, they do great lunch burgers and their fixed lunch is fabulous (although, with the fixed menu, it can be a little hit-and-miss if they happen to be serving something you don&#39;t particularly like). <br><br>A particularly positive point of The Table&#39;s, is that when you order tea, instead of just bringing you a cup of tea, as most places tend to do, they bring you an entire pot of it (it helps that their pot is nice as well... what doesn&#39;t this place get right?)! But, if you&#39;re not a tea fan, don&#39;t worry- everything else is good too!",

If you&#39;re looking for anything organic or health food related, the chances are they stock it. They sell lots of fresh fruit and veg, including an impressive variety of squashes. When I&#39;m there, I usually stock up on seeds, nuts, kale chips, and other things that will stop me snacking on potato crisps and chocolate in the office.  They also offer a variety of lunch items like quinoa salad and vegetable frittata, and a few good wines and craft beers.<br><br>It loses one star as it&#39;s just a little bit overpriced, especially the bread and some of the veg.",

"reviewcomment":"Part of a chain of French bakery/restaurants, Le Pain Quotidien is all about the bread and pastries. Not much of a breakfast menu, especially for those on Atkins. I went with the two soft-boiled eggs, which were perfectly cooked and extremely hot.Served with a small stack of dippy soldiers (thin sliced bread for dipping into the yolk). I don&#39;t know how they expect people to peel these eggs. Don&#39;t get me wrong, I love me a soft-boiled. But I think I might have burned off my fingerprints.<br><br>On the table were three jars - nutella, apricot preserves and something in French that might have been blackcurrant preserves. All went nicely on the slices of baguette that came with my eggs.<br><br>Specials board changes constantly with different mains, soups and desserts every day. Today the soups were a tomato bisque and gazpacho.<br><br>Excellent coffee. Rather than a latte, I had a &#34;pot&#34; of coffee which was about two cups of coffee (with an interesting bowl rather than a mug) in a French press. Great &#34;wake up&#34; juice, this will cure what ails ya!<br><br>Note: they have a couple of individual tables, but the center of the dining area is dominated by a very large table. Communal dining. Very Continental!<br><br>All told, an excellent simple breakfast. I will return!",

"reviewcomment":"And so I find myself at the Breakfast Club, Shoreditch again. It&#39;s our default breakfast meeting place when we can&#39;t think of anything new. I guess that&#39;s because it&#39;s mostly reliably good. This morning I&#39;m having the huevos rancheros, which are as good as I&#39;ve had in London. My other regular choices are the avocado with poach eggs, bacon and chilli and the scrambled eggs and smoked salmon, which are also pretty consistent. I used to go for the full breakfast, but found it a little dull in comparison. My colleagues enjoy the bircher muesli, but I&#39;ve never tried it.<br><br>The service here can be a bit erratic, as they seem to value hiring staff based on how hipster they are instead of how good they are at waiting tables, but it&#39;s usually good enough.<br><br>We normally come weekday early morning, and so never have to queue to get in, but I&#39;d imagine this is a different story for weekend brunch, if the queue at the Islington branch is anything to go by.",

"reviewcomment":"What a wonderfully warm, charming and inviting cafe. I was in Covent Garden after arranging visas for my forthcoming holiday and was in need of a good cuppa, a sit down and few minutes knitting (yes, KNITTING - you heard me correctly!) before I continued on with that day&#39;s to-do list. On the notice board outside the cafe it highlights it&#39;s necessary to register as a member before ordering drinks or food. The idea behind this is to increase the number of people the &#34;Poetry Society&#34; (housed above the cafe) can contact and let know about wonderful poetry reading evenings (and much more!) in the basement area of the cafe. I was more than happy to sign-up after seeing the delicious homemade fare and lovely selection of teas, coffees and fruit juices on offer. I didn&#39;t eat this time, however the girls next to me had the soup of the day and it looked delicious. A perfect autumn lunchtime warmer!<br><br> As I settled down with my pot of tea and knitting, Judith from the Poetry Society&#39;s office asked if I&#39;d be interested helping out in constructing the &#34;World&#39;s Largest Knitted Poem&#34; which had been constructed for World Poetry Day on 8th October from lots of knitters around the country each knitting a letter each. I went upstairs (with my lovely cuppa!) and sewed together 3 squares while I finished my drink. Judith added my name to the list of people who helped with the challenge and apologised for interrupting my knitting and tea, but as I said to her, I was more than happy to help out and it made for a thoroughly enjoyable hour or so in town. It&#39;s opportunities like these that make living in London so much fun! Go to the Cafe and see what&#39;s going on. You never know, you may be offered a piece of cake in return for penning/knitting a limerick or two ! :-)",

"reviewcomment":"Cafe Plum is a gem and makes me feel happy:) It&#39;s nice to know that there is somewhere I can go to have food that feels like it was made with love. I like to check the menu online before I go to see what the weekly special is. My favourite of the specials is the risotto with leeks. It is rich but delicious and it is a bright spot in my week if it&#39;s on the menu.<br>The milkshakes here rock!! I think this might be the best milkshake I&#39;ve had in London and the ice cream they use in it is delicious. I have also had the coffee here which is good.<br>The fusilli pasta is always good and fresh although it is a bit heavy on the cheese for my taste. Sometimes it is vegetarian and some weeks not, so I&#39;d advise you to make sure before you take it for granted as they are very similar regulars on the menu otherwise.<br>The chicken sandwich with rocket leaves is good and tastes like it was made with attention to the simple but good ingredients. I do find the rocket leaves a bit much though and would be happy if there were less. <br>Overall, I really like this place because the food tastes like good home cooking and the staff are friendly too. The cafe itself is small but cosy and I have always been lucky to find a table. I haven&#39;t tried the breakfast but the menu looks like it has a lot of great things and I hope to try it sometime.",

"reviewcomment":"Oh man, I just read an article that mentioned sfogliatelle and it reminded me of how much I yearn to visit the Exeter Street Bakery again. It is by far the best Italian bakery in London! Their sweet sfogliatelle are scrumptious, finger licking good. They have AMAZING rolls with added ingredients such as herbs or raisins. Their flat breads are out of this world. I would often order pizzas to bring to girlfriends&#39; apartments when we had a wine and pizza night in. My fave were the slices of onion and rosemary pizza. But seriously, they were all good. <br><br>Another good plan is to visit the cafe on a weekend morning, order a cafe latte (also excellent), and sit outside with a muffin or other such pastry (namely: panettone) to watch the people go by on nearby Kensington High Street. The coffee is rich, not burnt, creamy. I spent (and gained!) a lot of pounds and a lot of hours here, but it was always worth it! I can&#39;t wait to make a trip to London again. Exeter Street will definitely be the first stop on my list.",

Imagine, if you will, a huge plate of fired breakfast for little more than £3, pints of orange juice for less than Tesco, and great service for free.

"reviewcomment":"This shop is a must for true chocolate lovers (at least those with reasonably deep wallets). I used to work around the corner, and the occasional visit here was a real treat - and I&#39;m not normally that turned on by chocolate.<br><br> The emphasis is on very, very high quality hand-made chocolate products as a luxury, almost gastronomic, experience: this is not the place for chocolate bunnies or other such novelties. The chocolate products here have been made with very fine selected cocoa, described as you would wine, with distinctive flavours and &#39;notes&#39; in terms of its aroma and taste. If you have never experienced chocolate like this before, it&#39;s something of a revelation (although potentially a dangerously expensive habit to acquire!).<br><br> The presentation is generally very restrained, adding to the feel of quality and exclusiveness - there are caskets, hampers and wooden boxes as well as more traditional presentation boxes. The one exception is a heart-shaped box for the ultimate statement of commitment!<br><br> All this quality comes at a price, so be prepared to dig deep. Prices start from around £5.95 for a basic 250g bar, up to £65 for the 1.2kg Luxury Casket. For £8.50 you can have a 350g box of drinking chocolate - and here that means flakes of pure dark chocolate, with 70% cocoa solids, not powder.<br><br> There are quite a lot of options around the £20 mark for smaller boxes, including chocolate stem ginger at £18, or £22.50 for a 280g box of Grand Cru Truffles, which come in Dark, Milk, Champagne, Raspberry, and Malt Whisky flavours (or a mixture of all five). They also do boxes especially designed to round off the perfect dinner party, from £12.95 to £43.50. The shelf life of some products is limited to around 3 weeks.<br><br> Needless to say, the products would make the perfect gift for the discerning chocolate lover, for a dinner party or as a special gesture to your loved ones.",

"reviewcomment":"For me personally the best Italian place in London.<br><br> The décor is simple, so is the food, but probably that&#39;s the secret of its divine taste.<br><br> Their pasta with pesto is fabulous, nowhere else do they make is so well, and portions are generous, too. Pricewise, it&#39;s comparable to popular Italian chains, with the difference their food really rocks!<br><br> But it&#39;s not only pesto. Their mushroom risotto, hand-made cannelloni with spinach and ricotta and black seafood spaghetti prove their dishes are as good as only Italian food can be.<br><br> Falling in love with their vegetarian panini I was always trying to find something nearly as good during my trips to Italy, however, without success.<br><br> And if you don&#39;t have enough, the place has also a small selection of Italian products, anything from panettone to mozarella.",

"reviewcomment":"I do love F&amp;W. If you&#39;re looking for something filling but healthy, this is the perfect place. Superb salad bar, soups, fresh sandwiches, sushi and lots of other choices. It also does some pretty yummy things that aren&#39;t so healthy too, like the chocolate brownies. When I had my first brownie here about 2 years ago, I thought I had died and gone to heaven! Very chocolatey, very gooey, and very perfect with one of their lovely lattes :) So after a healthy salad of leaves, pea shoots, and mung beans, this goes down rather nicely!<br><br> It&#39;s a cool place with a great vibe and although it can be a strain on the wallet at times, F&amp;W is one of my original finds of real, good, healthy and hearty food in the centre of town. I love what it stands for - local, organic and damn fine produce. Yes it&#39;s full of yummy mummies and pretty models on a break from a shoot for their fill of the healthiness it offers, but it&#39;s an honest and good place. It offers a lovely shopping experience around bonfire night and Christmas too, with lots of tastings on the shop floor mmmm<br><br> I&#39;ve spent many an afternoon here working on my laptop, sat upstairs (which has limited seating) among the library of food - shelves stacked high with wonderful goodies. Great for vegetarians, but they do cater for the carnivores too. Well worth a visit if you&#39;re in the area.",

"reviewcomment":"This place definitely gets a 5!  After being in Europe the last week or so, I was feening some asian tea... a friend of mine recommended this place in London, and I was not let down!  It&#39;s a very very small shop, meant to be just taken to-go.  Although they do have a small bench on the side of the shop for you to sit and wait for your drink.<br><br>I opted for the Peach Oolong Tea with Aloe Vera half sweetened (I think that&#39;s the one I chose, lol... Europe is becoming to be a bit of a blur) since I tend to not have much of a sweet tooth.  I explained to the lady that I tend to like my tea kinda as is and only very slightly sweetened... and I was so surprised when the lady who made my drink even let me sample the sweetness of my tea before putting it in a cup.  WUT?!  No tea place has ever let me sampled their drinks before serving it to me!!!  Super, super plus for that!  Anyways, super tasty, and just the perfect amount of sweetness for me!  They had good, small chunks of aloe which paired perfectly with my peach tea.  c:<br><br>My friend also told me that the owner of this shop also was a martial arts master!  Not sure if that&#39;s entirely true, but him being an avid regular of this place ... I don&#39;t disbelieve him.  The owner even looks the part (even if he wasn&#39;t a martial arts master)... so cool!   Hahah.",

"reviewcomment":"Many many moons ago I worked here and then as now my favourite thing about this Collection is the building in which it is housed. Big and beautiful, this double fronted Georgian house is perhaps the most elegant and desirable on the Square, shame really that it sides onto the busy road that cuts Canonbury Square in half. Unconverted and empty for a long time, as it stood it was unsuitable to house both the collection of Italian Futurist works gathered over the years by Mr and Mrs Estorick and all the public spaces that were needed to make this into a public gallery. But with the addition of two extensions, large hall like rooms in the basement and at the back of the building the house was transformed into the perfect space. Public access to the building is through the side gate taking you straight into the back garden, sheltered by large London plain trees. Double doors open onto a seating area served by the small café offering coffees, cakes, sandwiches and salads where you can while away a spring or summer afternoon watching the slow trickle of patrons. The house is intimate, the collection specialised and sadly never in my time and I think still, not attracting the type of numbers it deserves. Modigliani, Morandi, De Chirico and Bala are all represented here- all the important names in Italian art at the turn and beginning of the last century. They are all to be found upstairs in the permanent collection. Downstairs, in the two spacious galleries, each with large French windows onto the garden, temporary exhibitions are shown. There was the exhibition of Italian motoring and film posters, all iconic images. And then an extensive retrospective of De Chirico&#39;s work, one painting a small adaptation of the last but all as fascinating as the next. If Futurist paintings do little to stir your soul go at least to enjoy the café, take your family, young or old or perhaps you are looking for the perfect venue for a wedding reception. Whatever your reasons for visiting I urge you to go and see what I&#39;m talking about.",

"reviewcomment":"These guys know what they&#39;re doing. The selection of beer here comes from across the world, with an uncanny knack of picking out the very best of beer to be found near and far. There are bottles of excellent local brews Sambrook Wandle and Junction, German alcohol-free beer (the best on the market, in my opinion) Erdinger Alkohol Frei and, (voice aquiver) two bottles from star Danish brewery Mikkeller. Plus a good selection of beer from Belgium, England, Austria, the Czech Republic and more (much of which I didn&#39;t recognise), all at reasonable prices.<br><br>The shop itself is worth a mention too: wood panels everywhere, with the beer bottles presented neatly on shelves. Throw in the friendly service and slow trumpet jazz sountrack playing softly in the background and it&#39;s very difficult to leave the shop without buying something. Which considering the quality of the produce on offer here, is no bad thing.",

A lot. So I have to say: Bravo, well done!!<br>It won&#39;t be a big surprise for you now, that I&#39;m happy to recommend Sweet Things to you. <br>By the way: This is my first review in english - I thought it&#39;s appropriate  considering that I stay in London for six months and that from now on, I&#39;ll be a regular guest at this lovely cupcakery.",

Bachmans is quietly nestled in a row of shops which are situated along a busy road - you might not give it a second thought when you wizz past, but if I told you that this unassuming little place was voted Best Patisserie in the UK (2007) - would you stop the car then?<br><br>This is not your bog standard bakery, there are 5 full time pastry chefs on the premises working on sweet concoctions. Being half Austrian, this is the only place that I buy Stritsel (it&#39;s a sweet brioche bread stuffed with raisins and currents). The owners are Swiss so they know how to make it properly. The cakes and pastries are almost too beautiful to eat, but don&#39;t let that stop you from tucking in.<br><br>They also make bespoke cakes for weddings and parties - although if I were to get married and got the cake from here, I would be thinking less &#34;I do&#34;, and more &#34;When do I get to eat the cake?&#34;",

"reviewcomment":"I was first introduced to Baldwins Butchers around 3<br>years ago when I simply had enough of buying cheap disgusting meat from<br>supermarkets. I now buy all my daily<br>meat from them like chicken/turkey fillets, fillet steaks, chops, and their<br>amazing homemade sausages especially their Hungarian sausages which have a nice<br>spice to them. <br> Now that summer has arrived, I am buying even more meat<br>for my weekly BBQ for family and friends, their souvla and souvlaki cutting is<br>perfect for traditional Greek/Turkish BBQ&#39;s along with their homemade sheftalia.<br>I also love a normal BBQ with T-Bones steaks, Burgers &amp; Sausages. <br> Their staff is really friendly and helpful if I need something<br>specific for a dish. I sometimes purchase my meat from their shop, but lucky<br>for me I get my meat delivered to my door. So my conclusion is that the meat is fantastic, juicy,<br>tender, fresh, and affordable with the luxury of being able to get my meat delivered to my<br>front door. I have written this review to share my experience and<br>because they deserve it.Thank you Baldwins Butchers for making mine and my family&#39;s<br>food experience exquisite.<br>Photo link: <a href='/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fimg804.imageshack.us%2Fimg804%2F3550%2Fphoto2ft.jpg&amp;s=496948a47e183275109bc33a6b69b339f796956bbdbd38489f719014315e77fb' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>img804.imageshack.us/img…</a><br>Photo link: <a href='/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fimg526.imageshack.us%2Fimg526%2F148%2Fphoto4m.jpg&amp;s=cf77e44e5ad15e87bd26054fe9cad287183b958127ae7ee8360451a33ceeed88' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>img526.imageshack.us/img…</a>",

"reviewcomment":"The first of a chain now all over London, this place maintains a consistently high standard. There is always a wide range of fresh fruit and vegetables and it&#39;s usually good. The tomatoes and cucumbers, for example, taste of something, unlike the watery stuff often sold. There is a wide range of fresh herbs (heavenly coriander), spices, dairy and just about anything else you&#39;d expect in a supermarket. Much of it is Turkish, of course. You can buy honeycomb there, lots of different kinds of halva, fabulous Lava houmous, a delicious aubergine dip...<br><br>And then there&#39;s the bakery. At the back of the shop there&#39;s usually a rack of trays of flat bread cooling from the oven. They do large round loaves and the bobbly ones with sesame seeds too.<br><br>There&#39;s also an extensive meat counter but as a vegetarian I shall pass over that. <br><br>Every now and again I go in to find that the layout of the shop has substantially changed. When I first went there about twenty years ago they had a small part of a disused clothing factory. Now they have all of it. They have invested to improve the shop and increase their range without sacrificing quality. Mr Tesco please note.<br><br>The downside: the olives from their deli counter are disappointing and there&#39;s often produce that is out of season and from the other side of the world. I don&#39;t have to buy it, though.",

He booked a gluten free menu for me in advance and we had a window seat (he had to pay extra to guarantee a window seat).<br>The view as you cruise up the Thames is awesome and I got to see some of my favourite landmarks en route. Even saw a pub backing onto the river that we are going to investigate at a later date.<br>Being a history geek I loved the history of the thames and its usage as we went along the cruise. My husband thought it was a bit corny but didn&#39;t care as he was tucking into his food and wine!<br>The food was excellent. As mentioned previously, they catered for my food intolerance and I was not made to feel like I had made them go out of their way (unlike some restaurants). My husband loves his food, but is picky, yet managed to eat everything (which is rare when he eats out).<br>They have a photographer on board who can take a picture to capture any special days or simply to keep as a memento.<br><br> Can&#39;t wait to either go again or try the evening cruise!",

"reviewcomment":"So the word on the street is that Shoryu has been opened by the Japan Centre, so off I went for lunch with a friend.<br><br>The place is sleek looking, black design, dual store space, although the tables are slightly cramped together. At lunch time it was super busy, must be a testament to how good its food is.<br><br>I believe I had the dracula ramen (can&#39;t remember - see photo) and I remember the broth was quite mild but I prefer this broth to the broth at Tonkotsu and at Bonedaddies. The egg however, pales in comparison to the runny yolk amazingness that is the egg at Bonedaddies. It is not too thick and creamy, how this compares to authentic Japanese I could not say, but it was nice and gentle to my sensitive stomach.<br><br>Drinks on the other hand could do with some work. My lunch mate&#39;s drink tasted horrible, and mine was just decent. It felt like too much ice went in so it went a bit too watery. Please introduce some nice drinks for people like me, I have a super sweet tooth. I do not really care that much if the drink is super unhealthy :)<br><br>Overall, I think I would come back here again, maybe to try the hirata bun, but Flesh &amp; Buns come first for that.",

"reviewcomment":"Mizuna is one of my favorites if I happen to be in the area during lunchtime. I&#39;ve only had their salads (personal favorite is the peruvian with chicken), but they are fresh, cheap, and delicious. For such a small cafe, they have a pretty extensive menu with a number of different salads/wraps/etc that I don&#39;t think you can ever really get bored. I&#39;ve been here with people who&#39;ve had their jacket potatoes as well as their wraps and everyone seems to have nothing but positive things to say about this place. <br><br>The staff here is very pleasant and helpful - they don&#39;t make a fuss if you want to make substitutes (you can also completely customize your order). The queues do get pretty crazy after 1pm so come before to avoid the rush if you can. <br><br>Another thing to say is that this is a very small cafe. They have a few counter seats and then two tables outside, so I don&#39;t think this is very good place if you&#39;re planning to come and sit - I&#39;d say it&#39;s best for take away. <br><br>Most items come in under £5 so if you&#39;re looking for quality and value, definitely keep Mizuna in mind.",

BECAUSE I CAN AND I&#39;VE DONE IT NOW. <br><br>I was actually walking from great portland street to the office, cutting through marylebone high street, and lo&#39; and behold, I smelt a tempting sexy smell, something that reached out to my base instincts. Cinnamon, I turned around and looked, and looked again. And, there it was, the source of the smell, the familiar sign, Nordic Bakery. I can&#39;t even begin to tell you how happy I was. <br><br>Since, I was on my way, I grabbed a cinnamon bun to takeout and it was warm, gooey, cinnamony and my life just felt complete.

"reviewcomment":"Artisan is my favorite coffee house in London. When we first moved to Chiswick, I passed by it several times on a bus and, no matter the time of day, it was always busy. That is usually a good sign, and this time was no different. <br><br>Their lattes and other espresso drinks are outstanding. The espresso is smooth, roasted dark but not too much. In the summertime, they do a great iced latte as well. My wife loves their chai tea lattes, and their loose leaf teas are great as well. It&#39;s almost always full to the point you can just find a table, so it&#39;s a great place to hang out and people watch. We take our kids, as do many others, and they always have a baby-cino as well. <br><br>I highly recommend you check it out.",

"reviewcomment":"I always used to find myself travelling to the Japan centre just of Piccadilly. Being a &#34;foody&#34;, I always found it had a lot to offer and was always excited by the &#34;exotic&#34; range of food they had to offer. Unfortunately I have two main gripes with the Japan Centre: firstly that, due to location, it is so expensive; and secondly that it&#39;s so far away that the beautiful array of fresh produce would probably spoil by the time I made it home. However, luck is at hand, as not ten minutes down my road I have the Wing Tai Oriental Supermarket (WTOS).<br><br>Although stock may at WTOS might not be as extravagant or as delicately considered as it is at the Japan Centre; WTOS will provide you with the essential ingredients you need to take you out of the Uncle Ben&#39;s box. There is still a huge array of different fish, veg, herbs, pastes, even cereals that you would never be able to find in your usual supermarket, and I always manage to get pleasantly rummaging around the different and exciting foods. The food here is just as varied as well and (although still on the pricey side of things) is not as expensive as the Japan centre; but I think this aids to WTOS really being able function properly as an everyday supermarket, rather then somewhere you would perhaps go for a special occasion.<br><br>From an outside glance, WTOS may look unwelcoming and disorganised, but as it stands I feel the opposite. If you happen to be passing, my suggestion is to go in, even if just for a quick browse; and if you just so happen to feel like a snack, my recommendation would be the roasted wassabi peas.",

"reviewcomment":"After being unimpressed with the breakfast options available on a chilly, drizzly portobello road we decided to consult yelp, which to our surprise came back with a multitude of options in the surrounding area, some with impressive ratings. Although Kitchen and Pantry was not top of the ratings, as I looked up from my iPhone it was conveniently situated at the corner of a side street just 100m away.<br><br>When we arrived the place was bustling with people like us trying to shelter from the elements. We were worried about being able to get a table but a very friendly maitre-d style employee reassured us that once we had ordered at the till there would be a table for us, which was impressive considering the flow of people entering the restaurant. <br><br>Upon entering we were pleasantly surprised by the selection of freshly baked sweet and savoury goods on offer as well as the traditional English breakfast menu and wide range of coffee, tea and other hot drinks.<br><br>I chose the spinach &amp; ricotta pastry slice and carrot cake and my boyfriend chose from the English breakfast menu which with tea and coffees came to around £15 which for the area was very reasonable.<br><br>The food was brought to our table briskly and was simple, fresh and tasty which is exactly what we look for in a breakfast. My boyfriend also commented on the quality of the bacon and sausages used which was much higher than most breakfast places.<br><br>All in all this was a really great choice for breakfast/brunch in the portobello road area, if you want tasty food in at a reasonable price with a laidback yet lively atmosphere then this is the place for you! <br><br>Would definitely go again!",

I was there yesterday and I was welcomed warmly as always. <br><br>The thing that made me the biggest impression was the crab cake. It was rather small-ish but the most delicious thing I&#39;ve eaten in a long time. The crab meat was amazing and the chunks were big and chewy and you can feel them melting inside your mouth. The crust was also delicious, bringing a rich flavour to the cake. <br><br>I loved the restaurant and would definitely go back soon. <br><br>Additional info - the restrooms were spotless and very nice.",

Places like Frae and Snog melt into a creamy, almost frothy liquid (boo) which seems really chemical but maybe that&#39;s just me.

I needed something that would both satiate me for the moment and leave me enough to have something resembling breakfast tomorrow before hopping on the Tube to Heathrow. Enter the Bagel King, where I obtained a hot lamb samosa for the most attractive sum of £1.10. It was greasiness incarnate - seriously forcing me to reevaluate the meaning of the word as I knew it - but for all that it was hearty, spicy, and exactly what my grumbling stomach needed. Also, it was roughly the size of my face.

"reviewcomment":"As far as Organic shops go, this tiny little place is a haven for those seeking alternatives from a quick supermarket meal. As soon as you walk inside, you&#39;re presented with a stack of fresh organic bread, of several varieties. The Organic Orange Juice by Grove Fresh is not so easy to find in the larger stores, but this specialty shop has this oh-so-yummy drink in stock. Don&#39;t be put off by the prices though, I find that organic food is worth its value in taste - once you find your favorites. Like the Tomato sauce without preservatives, that has tons more antioxidants and good stuff than Heinz, or the all fruit preserve without added sugar, which is thicker and tastes better than any other jam. This list just goes on and on. <br><br>I used to look down on those who embraced a &#39;new age&#39; lifestyle like organic food, wondering if the self-satisfaction was really worth the price to be paid. Since I moved near to this shop though, I&#39;ve had to eat my words. The hot soup they make in winter and fresh cakes are certainly worth trying out - with some caution. I still won&#39;t pay more than a pound for tomatoes - wise since I make less than the taxable threshold - but try and keep me away from Montezuma&#39;s Dark Chocolate with Chili flakes, and we&#39;ll have a few words.",

"reviewcomment":"Amazing beers; great pizza; friendly staff. The place is tucked away on the bank of a canal in Hackney Wick. We came on a dismal and dreary London winter night, so I almost thought we wouldn&#39;t be able to find it. I bet it looks a lot more cheerful in the summer. <br><br>Inside is industrial space with wooden tables and benches. Looks stylish, but without unnecessary pretension. <br><br>I&#39;ve tried four different beers here, and the golden ale is by far my favorite. It has to be the best golden ale I&#39;ve tried. Amazingly subtle honey notes. Very drinkable and tasty. The stout is quite amazing as well. If you are a beer geek, you won&#39;t regret the visit because of those two beers only.",

"reviewcomment":"Prestat is what I imagine a chocolate shop to be from Roald Dahl&#39;s decriptions of Willy Wonka&#39;s chocolate factory and also from his autobiographies of candy shops from his childhood. I suppose then it&#39;s no surprise that this holder of a royal warrant was his favourite chocolate shop when Dahl was among the living. <br><br>Just walking into this shop brings out your inner child and lets him run rampant. Colorful doesn&#39;t even begin to describe the cacophany of bright colours, glittering labels, shiny stickers, and decadent chocolates. This was stop 3/5 on our Chocolate tour of Mayfar and what a stop it was. The nice little added benefit was that we could taste as many of the chocolates as we wanted (and taste we did!). <br><br>I started with a chilli and lime chocolate and was surprised at how much the sweetness and hint of acidity in the lime brought out the creaminess of the chocolate. The kick of chilli a few seconds later in the back of my throat was also a welcome surprise. From there, it was on to a saffron and stem ginger chocolate that was an intriguing but enjoyable experience. I didn&#39;t get much saffron flavour as it was a bit overpowered by the sweet bite of the crystallised stem ginger but a good idea nonetheless. <br><br>Prestat is known for it&#39;s Napolean truffles which were first made (according to legend) after Napolean was exiled from France (the 1st time) and came to live in London. His chef became close friends with Prestat&#39;s chocolatier and taught him how to make Napolean&#39;s favourite truffles and they&#39;ve been making them ever since. The Napolean and coffee truffle caught my eye and I enjoyed the rich coffee aroma and flavour in a fairly delicate truffle. <br><br>Overall, I must have eated about 20 pieces including salted caramel (love how salt brings out sweetness in things), orange and rose, and more than I can even remember.<br><br>Basically, I love this place and would go in for a few minutes even if chocolate was the furthest thing from my mind just for the joy of being in such a vibrant little shop!",

"reviewcomment":"Went in for breakfast yesterday morning, it was a treat.... for £5 you get fried egg, sausage, 2 slices of bacon, fried potatoes, mushrooms, a slice of toast &amp; a scrumptious tomato with basil on it, they are really good &amp; if you don&#39;t like something you can swap it for no extra cost - not like Dalston Lane cafe, where you have to pay extra.. I switched the mushrooms for beans as mushrooms are wrong &amp; you can&#39;t have a breakfast without beans.  You also get a tea or coffee to wash it down with.. The coffee is real coffee too, none of that instant rubbish you sometimes get palmed off with.<br><br>The service is good &amp; there are newspapers for you to read, great if you are hungover &amp; incapable of conversation.<br><br>Downside is that you sometimes have to queue for a significant amount of time for a table... But it&#39;s well worth the wait.<br><br>Other mild annoyance was the lady sat behind me having breakfast on her own, I only know she was dining alone as she felt the need to call everyone in her phone book to let them know that she was.... She also spread the news of Friday nights conquest, really wanted to tell her that it&#39;s very unlikely that she will hear from him again.... He&#39;ll call you... He didn&#39;t give you his number for a reason.... Hopefully I&#39;m wrong though &amp; they will live happily ever after &amp; be comfortable in silence eating their breakfasts!!",

There&#39;s even those pretty chinese hand-made tea bombs that slowly unfurl in hot water to reveal coral-like garlands and explosions.<br>Anyway, on Saturday afternoon after freezing up the high street, I was presented (after my 15 minute wait) with the prettiest latte EVER!

"reviewcomment":"I got into the habit during my working life at Canary Wharf of having breakfast at Crussh most days. This was when I was a sane and solvent individual, and had a proper job, and not one that involved substantial periods of resting.<br><br> But I digress. Although Crussh would always be heaving to the rafters with mannerless Cityboys elbowing you out of the way to grab their organic porridge (with two free toppings), the friendly staff always made the visits as pleasant and efficient as possible. I generally went for a smoothie rather than the porridge, with my favourites being the Energy Explosion and the Fat Burner. All the Super Smoothies have a specific booster, aimed at one issue in particular, so if you&#39;d had a grand night out on the Toilet Duck once again, there&#39;s something to give you an instant pick me up here.<br><br> An unsung plus to Crussh&#39;s bill of fare are the small but perfectly formed salads. Full of interesting things like whole grains, chunks of oily mackerel, and various leaves and berries, they will fill even the greediest of gutses up for hours.<br><br> Wheatgrass addicts can also get their fix here, and it&#39;s frequently on offer.

"reviewcomment":"Waitrose is, in my opinion, the best supermarket in Putney.<br><br> They have a bakery, fresh fish counter, fresh meat counter and delicatessens all on site  which for a small supermarket is really good. The nearest Asda for example (which is about four times the size) does not have a fresh fish counter at all. The range of fruit and vegetables is excellent, and all from reasonably local sources.<br><br> An extensive wine department can be found at the back of the store, which is better than some dedicated local shops like Threshers. The staff are all very helpful, and will even make wine recommendations.<br><br> Some complain that Waitrose is expensive. However, if you compare like for like products Waitrose is actually very competitive. But they don&#39;t sell any lower quality or value products, so if you do go here for every shop then it will end up costing more. They also don&#39;t have as many special offers as some of the other supermarkets.<br><br> Fresh flowers are located at the front of the store if you are looking for a gift, and they also have a reasonably large magazine section.<br><br> I find the isles in the store are wider than other supermarkets, which results in a less cramped shopping experience. The tills are always well staffed, so you never seem to have to queue for very long if at all. They will validate your parking in the Putney exchange car park if you spend more than £10.<br><br> An added bonus at the weekends is that a talented violinist often busks in Putney Exchange, who you should be able to hear while you&#39;re shopping or queuing.",

But even if you do get the gist, you can&#39;t really appreciate how wonderful the selection of nuts truly is until you go there.<br><br> I even enjoy just walking past and enjoying the nutty waft that emits from the shop.

And we were indeed: when we walked in, the pleasant smell of a sushi bar greeted us and led us directly to the heart of the shop: the counter with the sushi rolls &amp; sashimi on display. Right beyond it, you can witness the busy staff making the delicious treats. (Open kitchens like this - to me - are always a sign of good quality. It&#39;s basically saying: we have nothing to hide!)<br><br>And indeed, the salmon hand roll we had for take-away was a revelation in itself: fresh, sweet-tasting and absolutely delicious.

Several other things are great:<br><br>One! - A choice of barbeque sauces, that are all unique to T&amp;R. You want mild, no prob. You want hot enough to make your eyes and nose water, they got it. Take your pick.<br><br>Two! - The chips. Every great sandwich needs great chips. Specially seasoned, and heaping in size... one can&#39;t ask for more.<br><br>Three! - Location/Style. I am a huge street food fan, and this is the best I&#39;ve had in London so far. Additionally, being permanently tucked into the Brick Lane alcove by Old Truman Brewery, it&#39;s IDEAL for lunches. Get that? Make it happen.<br><br>Four! - Service. Personable, fast, friendly, helpful, cheerful. What other words can I think of?

It&#39;s so good that it is rare to go in and there not be people there, in a good way because it&#39;s popular not in a queueing because of the slow service kind of way. <br><br>The service is quick, polite, friendly and efficient and after a couple of visits, you&#39;re treated like a regular by the lovely staff and owner who are all so nice! <br><br>The food is delicious and what I would describe as the main meals, for example to name just two dishes the Chicken Biryani and Moussaka both of which are really tasty, are so filling that often if I eat them for lunch I do not need to eat a main meal, just a snack, for dinner as I&#39;m still usually so full! There also have a wide range of sandwiches, wraps and baguettes with lots of of different fillings to choose from. Similarly, the salad bar is full of variety and tasty delights, including one of my favourites - dolmades (the Greek dish vine leaves). I can also recommend their bacon sandwiches and freshly squeezed orange juice, both of which I&#39;ve sampled en route to work when feeling slightly the worse for wear....<br><br>Finally, the prices are extremely reasonable and exceptional value for money, you almost feel rude paying just 4 shiny pounds for one of their main meals. <br><br>Located on Park Road, close to Baker Street tube and station and Regent&#39;s Park.",

The decor is extremely quirky, the menus are handwritten into old novels, the tables and chairs are all mismatched, it&#39;s very inviting. The highlight of chinwag is without a doubt it&#39;s burgers. You NEED to try one. The beef burger was absolutely delicious, very tender meat, crunchy greens and you can choose a variety of add ons including bacon, a fried egg and grilled aubergine. The burgers are absolutely massive so you can easily share one between 2 along with a portion of delicious chips. The service here is great- the owners have been there everytime I&#39;ve visited and they often serve you your food. This place is definitely the best new cross has to offer in terms of lunch and I highly recommend it.",

"reviewcomment":"This is a unique little place in what used to be an old Victorian toilet.  I have to admit, I was apprehensive about going in at first, especially when my boyfriend told me it still looked like a toilet.  However, he wouldn&#39;t let up and his curiosity, coupled with his early-at-work-late-back-home business hours, made me the &#34;go to girl&#34;.  So, I walked down the steps and into a clean, friendly and original little cafe.  The wall behind the counter is a bespoke unit of shelves filled with canned fruit in mason jars.  The lighting on this wall is such that it looked like an art installation straight from mom&#39;s pantry.  There is a small bench seating area with table, and along the walls in what used to be the toilet stations, there is now a &#34;bar style&#34; eating counter perfect for individuals.  Now, of course I kept considering that this is where men used to do their business, but the Victorian rolled porcelain is just so pretty and everything is CLEAN!  The ceilings are pegboard style.  Picture country kitchen with a modern twist.  Overall it was just cool.<br><br>As for the food, the baked goods looked delicious, though I had a croissant, which is hard to do wrong.  When I asked for butter and jam, I was brought a small plate with butter and apple compote (obviously homemade).  This was superb.  My latte was strong and quite good as well.  There is also a small condiments counter with cubed sugar to sweeten your coffee and free water in pitchers garnished with sliced cucumber, a nice touch.  There is also a bell for curbside service.  And during the spring there will be outside seating.<br><br>The staff working was very kind and willing to chat with me about the choice of location, food, etc.  As an additional plus, the owner (or at least I think he was the owner) was there working on his laptop.  He put his heart and hard labor into this place and it shows.  I found out from him that there was actually a piece done on KRLD by Mike Rogers in Dallas, Texas about putting a slogan with this little shop.  I&#39;m sure this was done in jest, so seeing as I&#39;m from Dallas I&#39;ll be sure to get back to Mr. Rogers with the message that this is definitely a place I will &#34;go&#34; again and again and again when I&#39;m in London.",

"reviewcomment":"I have been frequenting this cafe in its previous incarnation as Seymour Bros for years, and was horrified when it closed for refurbishment, imaging all sorts of yuppified and bland decor. Luckily, and to my absolute joy, it has remained almost unchanged except for a new jazzed up deli counter - huge sigh of relief!<br><br>The cafe is situated across the ground floor of  a converted house at the bottom of Camberwell&#39;s beautiful Grove Lane. There are wooden floors throughout and mismatched wooden tables, chairs and lamps. In the middle room, there&#39;s an open fire that&#39;s perfect on a cold winter&#39;s day.<br><br>In the summer, there is a beautiful outdoor area reminiscent of the secret garden with overgrown tress, hanging vines and rickety garden furniture.<br><br>The menu has a varied selection of sandwiches, available on a selection of different breads, and there is a daily hot special.  Breakfast is also available all day, and I am particularly fond of the cinnamon ciabatta. For a sandwich, the brie and apple or cambozola and red pepper are my undisputed favourites. Lately I had a yellow pepper soup there, which was surprisingly excellent. <br><br>The cakes are another strong point with an ever-changing selection of homemade beauties including cheesecakes and brownies.<br><br>As you can see I am a massive fan of this place and hope that it stays the same for as long as possible. At the moment, it becomes a thai restaurant in the evening, but that is going to move to Bellenden road in Peckham very shortly. Judging by the new sign saying wine bar above the door, I guess that will be it&#39;s future. I&#39;ll add more once that happens!",

Same for my friend. Good news: they believed in our honesty and that we would return to pay the bill ... which we did.<br><br>Next to the staff, the place is also nice. It&#39;s not very big, but has some seats outside (back and front) for you smokers out there. It has a mixture of normal cafe chairs and some super comfortable arm chairs. The menu has a decent choice of food, starting from soup, over quiche, to wraps and cakes.

"reviewcomment":"Found a little piece of home beautifully tucked away in Covent Garden. Surprisingly I managed to actually get some nice weather here and after a long day exploring some of the most popular places around the city, I passed by this small (and cozy) spot and decided to give it a try. <br><br>The place is tiny but has a really nice feel to it, helped by the really nice choice of tables, huge windows facing the street and a beautiful display of their sweet and salty treats. <br><br>I ordered one of the most popular choices back home for an afternoon (or any time of day for that matter) snack: pão de queijo (or cheese ball) and a quindim for dessert (sorry but I can&#39;t remember its English name). Both were simply delicious and on par with some of the best I had back home! Definitely worth any £ spent on them and worth a visit if you&#39;d like to try them. <br><br>I had an opportunity to talk to Wagner, who seemed to be one of the owners, and he was very nice and attentive. <br><br>Definitely recommended!

The staff is genuinely friendly and I always start my day nicely when I eat at La Mance. <br><br>The menu is lovely and has a good variety in eggs, that is of course if you like eggs. But who doesn&#39;t. Try the chorizo option - it&#39;s a bit spicy and so yum.

Do it.)<br><br>Aaaaand the plot thins when I insert the fact that I didn&#39;t eat fish until I was 20 years old. I thought it was vile. When I was 20 I went on a study abroad program called Semester at Sea, and as you can imagine... seafood was on the daily menu for six months.<br><br>After one month of eating the only non-fish alternative (peanut butter and jelly), I gave in. And I still haven&#39;t forgiven myself for wasting a full month not eating the most amazing, fresh, delicious fish I&#39;ve ever had. The reason it was so fantastic was that it was sourced directly from local fishers at each port we called at, so mahi-mahi in Cuba, piranha in Brazil, skate in Cape Town... all the way around to king salmon in Alaska.<br><br>My fish from Chelsea Fishmonger brought me right back to my earlier experience. So fresh, so local, so delicious. And most importantly, so ethical. I spoke with an employee for about 20 minutes about their fishing practices which involve, among other responsible things, only stocking fish caught by softer inshore non-destructive fishing methods. <br><br>Now I&#39;m not just upset about the one month I didn&#39;t eat fish on the ship, I&#39;m upset about the 20 years I didn&#39;t know places like Chelsea Fishmonger existed!",

"reviewcomment":"What luck to have the best delicatessen in Streatham just a couple of streets away. Sunday breakfasts wouldn&#39;t be the same without fresh French bread and French butter, croissants, a piece of Reblochon when available, and a chunk of salami from Le Tour De France. They even have a Plat du Jour that you can buy whole or in part, which certainly goes down well with a bottle of their organic wine later in the day I particularly like the Choucroute Alsacienne which I eat with their pork rillettes and more French bread. And their vols au vents are a wonderful treat for afternoon tea in the garden with friends. Make a detour to Le Tour De France you won&#39;t regret it.",

There is also a set lunch menu for under a tenner.<br><br> The restaurant has some of the worst artwork on the walls whic as provided many a conversation starter. Basic tables and chairs but that is why it&#39;s cheap and great. I&#39;m not sure it could be improved with out jacking up the price. There are only two lads working there and they keep the place (including the toilet) really clean.<br><br> Often the chaps working there bring me baclava after my dinner for free an they are very friendly.<br><br> (The photo shown is very old.

Sublime quality and the prices are rather cheap given such quality - I bought a litre of their very tasty, lovely and mild 2006 olive oil for £6. Their 2009 olive oil was £9 per litre, a real bargin considering what you pay elsewhere for a good cold pressed single estate extra virgin olive oil.<br><br> Check out the link to Mr Murat&#39;s website, they have a wide range of products and have a online shop.<br><br> I look forward to going back soon and hope that Mr Murat will be there; the person who served me on my first visit - while reluctantly offering advice on the different oils - was not very forthcoming and did not offer an olive oil tasting!",

"reviewcomment":"As someone who used to work round the corner from here and now considers this place to be the thing I miss most about my old job, I could wax lyrical about this place for hours.<br><br> One of a few independent sandwich shops on The Cut the Waterloo Sandwich bar is easily missed for those walking past the Young Vic. But it shouldn&#39;t be missed, not even if there&#39;s an inevitably long queue (it&#39;ll move quite quickly, promise). Here you&#39;ll find amazing baguettes, paninis and salads to order, all at relatively reasonable prices (i.e. cheaper than your nearby Eats and Prets).<br><br> As with the two previous reviews, I&#39;d recommend the amazing salad boxes, cramming pesto or chili chicken in with sweet potatoes, roasted veg, couscous and rice. Just don&#39;t try to fit it onto a plate when you get back to the office.<br><br> Or if you&#39;re after something to eat on the go, the chorizo baguette with gran padano and rocket was a personal fave of mine. Sigh.<br><br> There is space to sit down, but the place is so full of people trying to queue for great food that I wouldn&#39;t recommend it. Instead, I&#39;d say take it back to the office to make your Pret-munching colleagues nice and jealous.",

"reviewcomment":"What an amazing place. It&#39;s like having a mini Borough Market inside St Pancras station. Sourced Market is split down the middle as a deli/shop. On one side you can grab some food to go (or stay as there are long tables and stools to sit at) and on the other side you can... shop. For food.<br><br>Sourced is the name because they only sell produce from independent (and where possible local) food and drink specialists. All variations of food and drink too; oils, cheeses, pasta, baked goods, cold meats, fruit and veg and many others neatly organised around the open fronted store. A special mention needs to go to the beer section. Not only is it extensive and rammed with good quality beers but a majority of them are brewed right here in London. They&#39;ve been &#39;sourced&#39; from quite a number of micro breweries and a there&#39;s still room for some American craft beers too. Also, if you fancy a Monmouth coffee (as many do) then look no further, Sourced barista&#39;s can knock one up for you in no time - unless you enjoy queuing at Monmouth Coffee house in Borough Market for half an hour. I don&#39;t. Decision made. Or you can buy a load of it in a bag, take it home and make it yourself.<br><br>They&#39;re seasonal, convenient, local (to me at least) and sell produce that has been made with a bit of love and care.<br><br>It&#39;s open until 9pm on weekdays and 8pm on weekends and, just as a warning, if you do visit Sourced Market you will want to take a a bagful of goodies back with you. You have been warned!<br><br>TTFN,<br>Ian",

"reviewcomment":"The Hammersmith Farmers Market takes place every Thursday in Lyric Square. The highlight of this market for me are the hot foods on offer for lunch and something I imagine that many workers in Hammersmith look forward to every Thursday. The stalls include a spit roast pig stall (pork and lamb are on offer here), ethiopian food, moroccan food, thai food and, interestingly, they even have filipino food. The longest lines always seem to be at the roast pig stall and the thai/filipino food stall.<br><br> Because I&#39;m normally caught up in getting my lunch I haven&#39;t paid much attention to fresh produce on offer but mainly I&#39;ve noted things like cheeses, baked goods, some fruits and veges.<br><br> Its not a big market but worth a visit if you&#39;re in the area around lunch time on a Thursday.",

"reviewcomment":"So I&#39;ve been meaning to have breakfast here for ages. I finally got round to going and I was not disappointed. <br>The decor is very fitting for the ambience in the place and the staff are amazingly attentive. I have the rate the overall feel as 5 stars. <br>With regards the breakfast, it was well presented and made to order. I did forget to take a picture of it, but that&#39;s because it looked so yummy and I didn&#39;t want it to get cold. I also ordered a mixed berry smoothie which was fresh and hot the spot.<br>Overall the food was very nice, I could have easily had seconds. My only negative would be the price, it is abit on the expensive side but worth it.",

And everyone else thought that too because it was BY FAR the busiest stall at kerb. It was snaking around by the time I left.<br><br>Not surprised either- a white bap with piles of pulled pork on top like the size of a small child&#39;s head.

The Terrace is a really good sandwich shop. <br><br>Overall, it isn&#39;t that spectacular and is a bit on the pricey side, but for the area it really is the best place. <br><br>There is always beautiful rustic breads on show and the food is just so fresh. It use to be two shops before but has been merged into one mega restaurant. <br><br>I love the Terrace for its design. Simple. Black and white decor, classy, comfortable and timeless. <br><br>The last time I went there was for breakfast. I had a lovely omelette and my friend had the granola with fruit which,when seeing it made me regret the egg.

The glass case up front held an abundance of gorgeous looking desserts, but it was a mission for cupcakes that brought me here.<br><br>We selected the toffee, lemon, and raspberry cupcakes. All of the cakes were moist and the raspberry and lemon cakes had actual raspberries and cream in them. The toffee frosting was nice, it had a hint of coffee. The raspberry frosting again was nice, but  I could have done with a little more raspberry flavour and a little less sugar. My numero uno favourite one was the lemon. The frosting had a great balance of tang and sweetness and I probably could have eaten another one.... except that I will be bouncing around the walls in 10 mins from all the sugar!<br><br>If I am ever in Covent Garden and feel like tea and a pastry, I will be here in a heartbeat.",

I have never had a poor experience at a Pret and even in the afternoon when the pickings can be just a little slim, they&#39;re still just as good. Today&#39;s was a free range egg mayo with cress on brown bread. Muy bueno!<br><br>This Pret is no exception to the rule. Coolers of sandwiches that were made today are ready for choosing with prices clearly marked. Crisps, fruit, yogurt, and a few options for sodas (even Pret&#39;s own brand!) there too.<br><br>Coffee can take a minute when it&#39;s busy, but they are extremely efficient and you&#39;ll never be waiting for long. Unlike some other caffeine outlets (*cough* Starbucks *cough*), the coffee doesn&#39;t taste over roasted and I&#39;ve never had a barista here make a mistake. maybe that&#39;s because they don&#39;t do eleventy billion different varieties of mochachinos and blended nonsense. It&#39;s coffee. It&#39;s good. Move on.<br><br>This Pret is across the street from Angel station. It&#39;s a busy street, so do use the proper crossing unless you&#39;re a professional.",

"reviewcomment":"As far as Organic shops go, this tiny little place is a haven for those seeking alternatives from a quick supermarket meal. As soon as you walk inside, you&#39;re presented with a stack of fresh organic bread, of several varieties. The Organic Orange Juice by Grove Fresh is not so easy to find in the larger stores, but this specialty shop has this oh-so-yummy drink in stock. Don&#39;t be put off by the prices though, I find that organic food is worth its value in taste - once you find your favorites. Like the Tomato sauce without preservatives, that has tons more antioxidants and good stuff than Heinz, or the all fruit preserve without added sugar, which is thicker and tastes better than any other jam. This list just goes on and on. <br><br>I used to look down on those who embraced a &#39;new age&#39; lifestyle like organic food, wondering if the self-satisfaction was really worth the price to be paid. Since I moved near to this shop though, I&#39;ve had to eat my words. The hot soup they make in winter and fresh cakes are certainly worth trying out - with some caution. I still won&#39;t pay more than a pound for tomatoes - wise since I make less than the taxable threshold - but try and keep me away from Montezuma&#39;s Dark Chocolate with Chili flakes, and we&#39;ll have a few words.",

"reviewcomment":"Prestat is what I imagine a chocolate shop to be from Roald Dahl&#39;s decriptions of Willy Wonka&#39;s chocolate factory and also from his autobiographies of candy shops from his childhood. I suppose then it&#39;s no surprise that this holder of a royal warrant was his favourite chocolate shop when Dahl was among the living. <br><br>Just walking into this shop brings out your inner child and lets him run rampant. Colorful doesn&#39;t even begin to describe the cacophany of bright colours, glittering labels, shiny stickers, and decadent chocolates. This was stop 3/5 on our Chocolate tour of Mayfar and what a stop it was. The nice little added benefit was that we could taste as many of the chocolates as we wanted (and taste we did!). <br><br>I started with a chilli and lime chocolate and was surprised at how much the sweetness and hint of acidity in the lime brought out the creaminess of the chocolate. The kick of chilli a few seconds later in the back of my throat was also a welcome surprise. From there, it was on to a saffron and stem ginger chocolate that was an intriguing but enjoyable experience. I didn&#39;t get much saffron flavour as it was a bit overpowered by the sweet bite of the crystallised stem ginger but a good idea nonetheless. <br><br>Prestat is known for it&#39;s Napolean truffles which were first made (according to legend) after Napolean was exiled from France (the 1st time) and came to live in London. His chef became close friends with Prestat&#39;s chocolatier and taught him how to make Napolean&#39;s favourite truffles and they&#39;ve been making them ever since. The Napolean and coffee truffle caught my eye and I enjoyed the rich coffee aroma and flavour in a fairly delicate truffle. <br><br>Overall, I must have eated about 20 pieces including salted caramel (love how salt brings out sweetness in things), orange and rose, and more than I can even remember.<br><br>Basically, I love this place and would go in for a few minutes even if chocolate was the furthest thing from my mind just for the joy of being in such a vibrant little shop!",

"reviewcomment":"Waitrose is, in my opinion, the best supermarket in Putney.<br><br> They have a bakery, fresh fish counter, fresh meat counter and delicatessens all on site  which for a small supermarket is really good. The nearest Asda for example (which is about four times the size) does not have a fresh fish counter at all. The range of fruit and vegetables is excellent, and all from reasonably local sources.<br><br> An extensive wine department can be found at the back of the store, which is better than some dedicated local shops like Threshers. The staff are all very helpful, and will even make wine recommendations.<br><br> Some complain that Waitrose is expensive. However, if you compare like for like products Waitrose is actually very competitive. But they don&#39;t sell any lower quality or value products, so if you do go here for every shop then it will end up costing more. They also don&#39;t have as many special offers as some of the other supermarkets.<br><br> Fresh flowers are located at the front of the store if you are looking for a gift, and they also have a reasonably large magazine section.<br><br> I find the isles in the store are wider than other supermarkets, which results in a less cramped shopping experience. The tills are always well staffed, so you never seem to have to queue for very long if at all. They will validate your parking in the Putney exchange car park if you spend more than £10.<br><br> An added bonus at the weekends is that a talented violinist often busks in Putney Exchange, who you should be able to hear while you&#39;re shopping or queuing.",

"reviewcomment":"Give me the pulled pork, and give it now!  As a former midwestern gal hailing from the heartland of the US, I can tell you, this is definitely the best I&#39;ve found on this side of the pond. Several other things are great:<br><br>One! - A choice of barbeque sauces, that are all unique to T&amp;R. You want mild, no prob. You want hot enough to make your eyes and nose water, they got it. Take your pick.<br><br>Two! - The chips. Every great sandwich needs great chips. Specially seasoned, and heaping in size... one can&#39;t ask for more.<br><br>Three! - Location/Style. I am a huge street food fan, and this is the best I&#39;ve had in London so far. Additionally, being permanently tucked into the Brick Lane alcove by Old Truman Brewery, it&#39;s IDEAL for lunches. Get that? Make it happen.<br><br>Four! - Service. Personable, fast, friendly, helpful, cheerful. What other words can I think of? The gent working the truck was proud of how good he knows his food to be, and &#39;sells&#39; it while you wait. Kudos.",

"reviewcomment":"Moulin Rouge is a saviour for most of us at my workplace as it is located a stone&#39;s throw away and the service, food and prices are all wonderful but more importantly it&#39;s a decent independent eatery which is rare around these parts! It&#39;s so good that it is rare to go in and there not be people there, in a good way because it&#39;s popular not in a queueing because of the slow service kind of way. <br><br>The service is quick, polite, friendly and efficient and after a couple of visits, you&#39;re treated like a regular by the lovely staff and owner who are all so nice! <br><br>The food is delicious and what I would describe as the main meals, for example to name just two dishes the Chicken Biryani and Moussaka both of which are really tasty, are so filling that often if I eat them for lunch I do not need to eat a main meal, just a snack, for dinner as I&#39;m still usually so full! There also have a wide range of sandwiches, wraps and baguettes with lots of of different fillings to choose from. Similarly, the salad bar is full of variety and tasty delights, including one of my favourites - dolmades (the Greek dish vine leaves). I can also recommend their bacon sandwiches and freshly squeezed orange juice, both of which I&#39;ve sampled en route to work when feeling slightly the worse for wear....<br><br>Finally, the prices are extremely reasonable and exceptional value for money, you almost feel rude paying just 4 shiny pounds for one of their main meals. <br><br>Located on Park Road, close to Baker Street tube and station and Regent&#39;s Park.",

"reviewcomment":"A friend and I stumbled across chinwag after googling places to eat in new cross and since then we have returned several times. The decor is extremely quirky, the menus are handwritten into old novels, the tables and chairs are all mismatched, it&#39;s very inviting. The highlight of chinwag is without a doubt it&#39;s burgers. You NEED to try one. The beef burger was absolutely delicious, very tender meat, crunchy greens and you can choose a variety of add ons including bacon, a fried egg and grilled aubergine. The burgers are absolutely massive so you can easily share one between 2 along with a portion of delicious chips. The service here is great- the owners have been there everytime I&#39;ve visited and they often serve you your food. This place is definitely the best new cross has to offer in terms of lunch and I highly recommend it.",

"reviewcomment":"I do love the Shoreditch Grind. It&#39;s big retro cinema sign and it&#39;s dark wooden decor, exposed bricks, spiral staircase inside and neon lights, very vintage feel. It&#39;s becoming my local spot with my boyfriend before he sends me home. It is a shame it is so small so like many Yelpers have said, it&#39;s not a place you can sit for long and wind down as you&#39;re more likely to find yourself a window seat on a high stool than a table seat. But saying that one of the best things about it is that it is also open late, till 1am on the weekends.<br>But the place holds a good vibe, probably because they sell coffee cocktails but I am also impressed they serve their own branded coffee and there&#39;s a deli bar where cakes, sandwiches and hot soups are available. Sadly I&#39;ve only tried their hot chocolate and latte but they were good. Both personalised for me with a nice  fancy latte art. In fact that barista was so impressed with what he had achieved he came back to take a photo of his art which was funny. My hot chocolate was so indulgent, it was thick, rich and smooth. The nice foam on top created a layer of bliss as it lighten it up a bit. Not only did it taste good but it looked amazing, cute even.<br>My latte met everything I needed from a good latte. It came in the perfect temperature, a good layer of foam and a nice richness coming through the creamy steamed milk. <br>In the summer I can see myself sitting on the outside beaches watching life go by  the old street roundabout. It is memorising and somewhat a nice distraction from city life. The place itself could do with more comfortable seating, maybe fit a few retro sofas in. The place has so much life and so much potential but it&#39;s a shame there&#39;s not enough space for people to add to it. Still I love the place. Just people would just go away and let me have a seat :p.",

Wish we had these here in the states.  They are easy to eat on the go and for a quick meal.  SO good!  Looking forward to trying the steak and ale when i go back to London.",

I was left with a few hours to kill before catching a train from Marylebone, but didn&#39;t particularly want to sit in a station chain cafe so wandered down here. The food was outstanding - fresh, delicious and served quickly by very friendly staff. There&#39;s a huge variety available, from panini and salads to hot specials, and the prices are very reasonable (definitely better than the station).<br><br>Only thing to be aware of is that you can only pay with cash, so come equipped!",

The staff is genuinely friendly and I always start my day nicely when I eat at La Mance. <br><br>The menu is lovely and has a good variety in eggs, that is of course if you like eggs. But who doesn&#39;t. Try the chorizo option - it&#39;s a bit spicy and so yum.

When I was 20 I went on a study abroad program called Semester at Sea, and as you can imagine... seafood was on the daily menu for six months.<br><br>After one month of eating the only non-fish alternative (peanut butter and jelly), I gave in. And I still haven&#39;t forgiven myself for wasting a full month not eating the most amazing, fresh, delicious fish I&#39;ve ever had. The reason it was so fantastic was that it was sourced directly from local fishers at each port we called at, so mahi-mahi in Cuba, piranha in Brazil, skate in Cape Town... all the way around to king salmon in Alaska.<br><br>My fish from Chelsea Fishmonger brought me right back to my earlier experience. So fresh, so local, so delicious. And most importantly, so ethical. I spoke with an employee for about 20 minutes about their fishing practices which involve, among other responsible things, only stocking fish caught by softer inshore non-destructive fishing methods. <br><br>Now I&#39;m not just upset about the one month I didn&#39;t eat fish on the ship, I&#39;m upset about the 20 years I didn&#39;t know places like Chelsea Fishmonger existed!",

But it shouldn&#39;t be missed, not even if there&#39;s an inevitably long queue (it&#39;ll move quite quickly, promise). Here you&#39;ll find amazing baguettes, paninis and salads to order, all at relatively reasonable prices (i.e. cheaper than your nearby Eats and Prets).<br><br> As with the two previous reviews, I&#39;d recommend the amazing salad boxes, cramming pesto or chili chicken in with sweet potatoes, roasted veg, couscous and rice. Just don&#39;t try to fit it onto a plate when you get back to the office.<br><br> Or if you&#39;re after something to eat on the go, the chorizo baguette with gran padano and rocket was a personal fave of mine. Sigh.<br><br> There is space to sit down, but the place is so full of people trying to queue for great food that I wouldn&#39;t recommend it.

Looks like nothing from the outside, but inside it&#39;s packed with freshly baked bread, made on the premises, an amazing selection of cakes and tarts, plus some hot pasties. The staff are numerous and helpful. And to top it all off, it&#39;s cheap. After buying my fresh bread from the more expensive places nearby (Fresh and Wild for instance), once I&#39;d been to the Little Baker, I&#39;ve never looked back.",

"reviewcomment":"I have been frequenting this cafe in its previous incarnation as Seymour Bros for years, and was horrified when it closed for refurbishment, imaging all sorts of yuppified and bland decor. Luckily, and to my absolute joy, it has remained almost unchanged except for a new jazzed up deli counter - huge sigh of relief!<br><br>The cafe is situated across the ground floor of  a converted house at the bottom of Camberwell&#39;s beautiful Grove Lane. There are wooden floors throughout and mismatched wooden tables, chairs and lamps. In the middle room, there&#39;s an open fire that&#39;s perfect on a cold winter&#39;s day.<br><br>In the summer, there is a beautiful outdoor area reminiscent of the secret garden with overgrown tress, hanging vines and rickety garden furniture.<br><br>The menu has a varied selection of sandwiches, available on a selection of different breads, and there is a daily hot special.  Breakfast is also available all day, and I am particularly fond of the cinnamon ciabatta. For a sandwich, the brie and apple or cambozola and red pepper are my undisputed favourites. Lately I had a yellow pepper soup there, which was surprisingly excellent. <br><br>The cakes are another strong point with an ever-changing selection of homemade beauties including cheesecakes and brownies.<br><br>As you can see I am a massive fan of this place and hope that it stays the same for as long as possible. At the moment, it becomes a thai restaurant in the evening, but that is going to move to Bellenden road in Peckham very shortly. Judging by the new sign saying wine bar above the door, I guess that will be it&#39;s future. I&#39;ll add more once that happens!",

"reviewcomment":"&#39;Cafe Rouge&#39; have branches all over London and while the food maintains its good standards throughout the mood of the places tend to vary.<br>The Chiswick one is one of the nicer ones for relaxing atmosphere. I have enjoyed an unhurried weeked Breakfast/Brunch on occasion and like to stare out the glass store front [French Windows ;) ] and watch the World go by.<br>Service is generally good. Occasional lapses of alertness or the female staff pretending to ignore me can be overlooked.<br>The English Breakfast while not being as comprehensive as the offerings from &#39;High Road Brasserie&#39; or &#39;Carvosso&#39;s at 210&#39; is still very good and a tad cheaper for a smaller selection.<br>The menu stays pretty similar but changes a few dishes regularly with the season. One of the great things about the Cafe Rouges is that it is one of the few places that offers a variety of light options when a big portion is not reuired.I often have just the Terrine Maison with some French Bread and it just hits the spot if you are only slightly hungry.Other light choices like the Tart (quiche) or the soups are also recommended for a quick bite.<br>I have had a Steak Frites here a couple of times, which was fine, but would say &#39;La Trompette&#39; is the place to go for that dish in Chiswick.<br>The Cafe au Lait (latte) or Hot Chocolate are my usual beverages and done about as well as you could find in West London.In summer I often opt for a Citron Presse which is a kind of DIY lemonade with water to get it to your desired consistency.<br>Desserts are fancy in that French way and I usually just go for something simple, if I am having one.<br>In conclusion, Cafe Rouge Chiswick is Recommended for decent food and a friendly, relaxed place to chill out.",

I have to say, I was expecting a lot of cheesy crap with a few good bits but was pleasantly surprised. <br><br>Overall,  this is a great place to find cheap, on-trend clothing -- at the moment, tartan, leopard prints, and leather-look garments. There is quite a lot of &#39;fell off the back of the truck&#39; stuff from ASOS and similar trendy brands. There were some very hot platform heels and shoe-boots on offer as well.  My personal buy of the day was a pair of silver shiny reptile print leggings for £6.  <br><br>What I really liked was the friendliness of the sellers ....not too pushy, but happy to help. Yes, there are also some of the usual cheaper market homewares, children&#39;s toys and the like, but this can be quite handy sometimes! There were also a few artisan bakers and foods at the southern end of the market, got a lovely loaf of rye bread to take home.  As I happily trotted away I thought....where next will I wear those leggings??!",

"reviewcomment":"The Hammersmith Farmers Market takes place every Thursday in Lyric Square. The highlight of this market for me are the hot foods on offer for lunch and something I imagine that many workers in Hammersmith look forward to every Thursday. The stalls include a spit roast pig stall (pork and lamb are on offer here), ethiopian food, moroccan food, thai food and, interestingly, they even have filipino food. The longest lines always seem to be at the roast pig stall and the thai/filipino food stall.<br><br> Because I&#39;m normally caught up in getting my lunch I haven&#39;t paid much attention to fresh produce on offer but mainly I&#39;ve noted things like cheeses, baked goods, some fruits and veges.<br><br> Its not a big market but worth a visit if you&#39;re in the area around lunch time on a Thursday.",

I finally got round to going and I was not disappointed. <br>The decor is very fitting for the ambience in the place and the staff are amazingly attentive. I have the rate the overall feel as 5 stars. <br>With regards the breakfast, it was well presented and made to order. I did forget to take a picture of it, but that&#39;s because it looked so yummy and I didn&#39;t want it to get cold. I also ordered a mixed berry smoothie which was fresh and hot the spot.<br>Overall the food was very nice, I could have easily had seconds. My only negative would be the price, it is abit on the expensive side but worth it.",

Popped in for a quick bubble tea takeaway with a friend last night and we were in and out in under 10 minutes with our glorious, freshly made bubble tea. I had the red bean milk tea with bubbles, and it was the perfect combination of sweet and savoury, with a bit of added sugar and red beans mixed in with the tapioca bubbles. The ladies working were friendly and answered our questions about recommendations for types of tea to get. 4* because there was very little inside seating (3 stools at a bar), and when we visited 2 of the stools were taken so we couldn&#39;t hang about.",

"reviewcomment":"The new Tapped &amp; Packed on TCR has opened its doors for business - and it&#39;s a beaut.<br><br>Only a stone&#39;s throw (... or perhaps a small catapult) away from its older sister coffee shop on Rathbone Place, the new café has a strangely familiar, but still altogether different, vibe.<br><br>Sitting on a corner site near-ish Warren Street tube, the interiors are nicely done - the shop footprint has given the owners less space to play around with but the whole place seems so open thanks to a double-height ceiling and huge windows on two sides. The pared-down effect fixtures and fittings are very similar to the original T&amp;P, from the surfaces and tables down to the awesome little spoons.<br><br>The baristas are as talented as ever; an early morning pour-over training session was being held to ensure coffee as good as you&#39;d come to expect in the area. The offerings are as before, filter coffees taking to the stage alongside (as opposed to acting as a supporting cast to) the usually more ubiquitous espresso-based versions.<br><br>I ordered a flat white and some banana bread (which although not as accomplished a breakfast item as Kaffeine&#39;s dreamy toasted wonder) was still lovely. I followed this with an espresso on my way out, and although I didn&#39;t enquire as to the beans used, it was gorgeous - powerfully fruity with hints of chocolate and raspberries.<br><br>The place also lays claim to what I believe must be the coolest water tap in London (nay, the UK... or even Europe - possibly the World?!). Ask for a glass and the barista will hand you a small frosted duralex number and point you towards the source - a very fine, looped copper pipe with a mini-red US firefighter style red handle on it. The water comes out at room temperature, which is the reason for keeping the glasses chilled I suppose, but it adds a level of quirky fun to an already excellent coffee shop.<br><br>I guess I can only curse my misfortune for having moved out of the area (having lived at 72 TCR - so close!!) and am therefore unable to call this my local coffee house - but with friends still in the area I have an excuse to frequent this place more than could ever be deemed neccessary!<br><br>5/5 is a no-brainer - roll up, order a perfectly-made coffee from one of the friendly baristas and snicker at the blissfully ignorant pedestrians strolling past outside, 20oz take-away coffee cups in hand with that silly green mermaid on the side whilst you sit pretty inside T&amp;P. You have a reason to feel smug... sheer coffee bliss.",

The egg filling itself was smooth and silky and soft and its perfume is strong enough to tease and draw you in.<br>I love them and happily buy them for friends too. So if you&#39;re in Chinatown and craving egg tarts, do give this place a try and let me know what you think.",

"reviewcomment":"Apparently you don&#39;t buy sammies or sandos around here, it&#39;s a sarnie or a bap or something.  I know this because my work intranet newsgroup sternly corrected me and forebode any of my outlandish abbreviations.<br><br>Regardless, sandwiches they make here at Make Mine, and they&#39;re not half bad.  They might not be as cheap as I&#39;d like for a breakfast sandwich (3.25 for a signature selection, 2.90 for a two topping dealio) or lunch menu choice (4.75) but they toast &#39;em perfectly and are generous with the innards, but not to the point where they spill out and turn into a liability.<br><br>If you&#39;re lucky, while you&#39;re waiting, you might get to listen to your preparer  guy flirt with his short-ish ingredient chopping assistant (who is having none of that) while he puts together your order.  Ah, early morning innuendo!  <br><br>You want to Make Mine on the go, the three little coffee tables they have instore seem to be more for those waiting on orders, and the service has always been prompt.  I haven&#39;t had to deal with more than a few peeps in queue at a time, so it&#39;s been good to grab after the gym, but I think they have good enough turnover to keep their ingredients fresh.  Of good quality is hard to say, but it all tastes good, and it ain&#39;t the cheapest sammie/sarnie/sando/whathaveyou around, so I choose to think it&#39;s better than alright..",

There&#39;s a huge variety available, from panini and salads to hot specials, and the prices are very reasonable (definitely better than the station).<br><br>Only thing to be aware of is that you can only pay with cash, so come equipped!",

The tasting in their cellar finished off a great tour. <br><br>I&#39;m now a big fan of cask ales and I&#39;m glad I was able to find London Pride, London Porter and 1845 at my local Total Wine store.",

The Terrace is a really good sandwich shop. <br><br>Overall, it isn&#39;t that spectacular and is a bit on the pricey side, but for the area it really is the best place. <br><br>There is always beautiful rustic breads on show and the food is just so fresh. It use to be two shops before but has been merged into one mega restaurant. <br><br>I love the Terrace for its design. Simple. Black and white decor, classy, comfortable and timeless. <br><br>The last time I went there was for breakfast. I had a lovely omelette and my friend had the granola with fruit which,when seeing it made me regret the egg.

The glass case up front held an abundance of gorgeous looking desserts, but it was a mission for cupcakes that brought me here.<br><br>We selected the toffee, lemon, and raspberry cupcakes. All of the cakes were moist and the raspberry and lemon cakes had actual raspberries and cream in them. The toffee frosting was nice, it had a hint of coffee. The raspberry frosting again was nice, but  I could have done with a little more raspberry flavour and a little less sugar. My numero uno favourite one was the lemon. The frosting had a great balance of tang and sweetness and I probably could have eaten another one.... except that I will be bouncing around the walls in 10 mins from all the sugar!<br><br>If I am ever in Covent Garden and feel like tea and a pastry, I will be here in a heartbeat.",

Today&#39;s was a free range egg mayo with cress on brown bread. Muy bueno!<br><br>This Pret is no exception to the rule. Coolers of sandwiches that were made today are ready for choosing with prices clearly marked. Crisps, fruit, yogurt, and a few options for sodas (even Pret&#39;s own brand!) there too.<br><br>Coffee can take a minute when it&#39;s busy, but they are extremely efficient and you&#39;ll never be waiting for long. Unlike some other caffeine outlets (*cough* Starbucks *cough*), the coffee doesn&#39;t taste over roasted and I&#39;ve never had a barista here make a mistake. maybe that&#39;s because they don&#39;t do eleventy billion different varieties of mochachinos and blended nonsense.

"reviewcomment":"Vauxhall is one of the dullest areas in London.  Even the runway to outer space outside the station does nothing to alleviate its unattractiveness, packed as it is between grey buildings, St George&#39;s Wharf, convoluted roads and a supremely ugly roundabout.<br><br>But in amongst the gloom, there is a gem.  You&#39;ve probably unknowingly walked past it hundreds of times.  It&#39;s an old Georgian building which looks nondescript (bar the countless old signs nailed to the outside wall) but step inside and hello, it&#39;s as if a Victorian West End theatre set up inside Aladdin&#39;s Cave.<br><br>Pretty much everything you can see is for sale.  From the wrought-iron love seat in the garden to the gigantic wooden screens on the walls, poke around and there&#39;ll be a price tag somewhere.  It&#39;s because Brunswick House is owned by Lassco, an architectural salvage company, and they&#39;ve rather cannily turned their showroom into a restaurant.  Despite the items presumably having been sourced from all over the country (or indeed the world), and across several centuries, they&#39;re uncannily well put-together, with not a chair out of place.  The main room apparently used to be some sort of a music-hall, since there&#39;s a stage up front and a basic lighting rig above (which these days supports a selection of chandeliers and art deco lamps), plus the kitchen storeroom is hidden in the wings and from tantalising glimpses behind the velvet curtain, it looks remarkably like a prop cupboard.  Even the ladies&#39; loos are cool, with two mismatched sinks (one positively child-sized) perched underneath a gigantic gilt mirror.  Yet despite the quirkiness and the old-school vibe, they&#39;d shelled out on one of those super-fast airblade hand driers.  I love it when people keep things looking good without sacrificing practicality.  Yes!  BHC proves it can be done.<br><br>With all this upon which to feast my eyes, I was half expecting comparatively sub-par food, but the clue was in the bathroom: they don&#39;t cut corners here.  The menu is short, but my friends and I had three of the four mains on offer and each one was divine.  It&#39;s modern British; creative, delicious and memorable.  One person had wine (which came served in a tumbler - about the only reference to it being a cafe that I could find) and we all shared a pudding, which included peanut brittle so I was in seventh heaven.<br><br>To top it all off, our waitress was truly lovely.  She took the time to chat and talk about the place, which just makes the biggest difference to a night.  In the end our bill was £20 each which considering the quality of the food and the service was an absolute bargain.  I honestly couldn&#39;t find a single fault.  Apparently the menu changes regularly - and presumably so does the decor.  Sounds to me like a bloody good reason to make the Brunswick House Cafe a regular haunt.",

Across from Marylebone Station, this little coffee shop caters mainly to busy commuters, construction workers, lunching friends and locals.<br><br>You will always be greeted by a smiling Italian man with a giant handlebar moustache. I&#39;m not sure if this is Gino, himself, but he looks like Super Mario and even pays homage to the character with a little action figure on his cash register-- so maybe his name is Mario. Whatever the case, this man is always smiling, singing and welcoming people into the shop. It can get really busy around noon, but the service is fast and furious: You place your order with Mario/Gino and he gives you a number. About 5 minutes later one of the efficient waitresses will appear with your food.<br><br>I was staying at the London Landmark which is right next door, so I either stopped in for one of their amazing Americanos each morning or had a full sit down Breakfast or Lunch almost every day. I had the breakfast Special twice with delicious fresh eggs, rashers, sausage and toast. The Liver and Chips was great, too. This is not fine dining, but proper coffee shop fare done the way it&#39;s supposed to be.<br><br>This place does everything from all day breakfast, to Sandwiches and Salads. When the crowd dies down, you can hear Gino/Mario singing along with the radio.<br><br>Great value (breakfast with coffee for 2 ran us just under 9 pounds), great food and amazing service.

A quick 5-10 minute walk from the fantastic (but overly crowded/touristy) Borough Market is foodie heaven.<br><br>Underneath the old railway tracks you will find 20 or so of the finest food stands in London. A friend and I started out the epic morning with some fresh belgian waffles with bacon and duck confit paired with warmed apple cider from Waffle On. This was followed by some excellent pieces of smokes salmon from Hansen &amp; Lydersen while we waited (and waited) for the pastrami from Monty&#39;s Deli. This is far and away the best deli sandwich in London, close your eyes and you can imagine you&#39;re in NYC. Even the matzoh ball soup was fanastic. Well worth the queues...you can only get Montys at this market!<br><br>Of course the morning was not complete without some brownies from the Bad Brownie Co. and some gin cocktails from Little Bird Gin. I had the perfect G&amp;T which was garnished with a slice of grapefruit while my friend had a bloody mary. <br><br>Maltby Street is one of the best foodie scenes in all of London, well worth the trip for a Saturday morning.

Also they don&#39;t make you sign up to a 12 month contract, it&#39;s just a rolling monthly agreement. In addition if you are a member of Jubilee Hall you can use a number of their other London gyms too, including one in Hampstead. This small gym chain is also part of a larger fitness network which means you can use 101 different gyms in the South East including the Oasis gym near Tottenham Court Road which has an outdoor pool.<br><br>The gym itself is nice. It has quite a few cardio machines with built in teles, lots of weights machines and free weight things too. It has a number of classes as well. There is a little cafe also which always smells amazing although I&#39;ve never actually eaten there.<br><br>The atmosphere in the gym is really pleasant and everyone seems very friendly. I would definitely recommend this gym, it&#39;s also a charity too so you can feel doubly good working out!",

I spotted the cute little panda on the sign outside last year when it first opened and knew I had to go, and I&#39;d always wanted to try banh mi.<br><br> Myself and my husband are now regulars - he usually goes for the panda panda special and I have the satay chicken with extra chilli and peanuts. He is also a fan of the fish balls and we both like the summer rolls as well. Every time we go I mean to try something else but that satay chicken sandwich is just too good to miss!!<br><br> I also highly recommend the milkshakes - you can have them made with a vast array of chocolate bars and they are amazing. Thick and really tasty - like a pudding to go with your lunch. The pineapple bubble tea is also good, but without the fancy packaging you get in places like Bubbleology.<br><br> Panda Panda is definately worth visiting Deptford for, oh and bring cash they&#39;d don&#39;t take cards!",

Tutti&#39;s has a great selection of sandwiches, paninis and pastas at very affordable prices, and the window bar is an excellent idea for watching the world go by as you enjoy your lunch. Recently renovated downstairs, the place now has extra seating and two &#39;caves&#39;. The owner renovated the old coal storage in the basement offering two stylish and separate hangouts if you want more privacy while enjoying your lunch/coffee.",

This location happen to be my neighborhood one and I&#39;d highly recommend it if you&#39;re looking for a pleasant catch-up spot or a morning coffee with the papers.  The morning pastries and Lebanese desserts (and there&#39;s a lot of it) are all solid to desirable (with the exception of a few rare one-off less-fresh pastries).  This location excels on several points: chic without being obnoxious, small without feeling too crowded, and friendly service.  I&#39;ve never had a full meal there but their desserts are beautiful and I&#39;ve been told by accompanying friends that they are delicious.  (I believe they had a new pastry chef come in a few months back.) I&#39;ve had a few starters (homous and babaganoush) and both were solid.  Extra:  The bread/pita is made fresh in this store and you can see the production through the glass walls - nice decorative touch and makes me feel like I&#39;m eating bread fresh from the oven every time.",

TICK<br><br>-Sweet little garden area at the back - perfect for sunny days and taking your time with your meal perusing a weekend paper TICK<br><br>The most popular option seems to be a warm main (usually vegetarian lasagne, moussaka or a stuffed pepper) with 3 salads (which could be mushrooms, greek salad, lentils, chickpea and spinach or a dozen other beautifully seasoned and sauced options) - the halloumi wrap is also worth a try.<br><br>It really does seem a little out of place (there&#39;s a greasy kebab shop next door!) in Clapton, but I guess the area&#39;s changing and the market for that kind of food is growing.  Good stuff too!  The cafe sells health food bits and pieces, drinks and fresh bread so you can pick up some staples to take home. <br><br>If the criteria I listed appeals to you, I would urge you to visit if you&#39;re nearby :)  Let me know if you like it!",

"reviewcomment":"Oh god they have Carnaroli rice, i can live properly :-) I&#39;m obsessed with my passion of cooking and risotto is one of my specialties. You may not know, but the Carnaroli is the best quality of rice you could use to make a risotto. It&#39;s an hybrid created (naturally) by man during the 1940s and it combines the taste and size of two different types of rice. <br><br>But i&#39;m digressing :D<br><br>This sainbury&#39;s is rather huge but well organized, the workers seemed a bit rushed, but it was sunday and there was a impressive number of customers. <br><br>What surprised  me is that everything runs quite smoothly! <br><br>Now, if i could find the sushi boxes i&#39;ve seen in other smaller venues, i would be delighted :)",

"reviewcomment":"This delightful place serves some of the very best coffee and cake that I have come across in London (or anywhere else, for that matter).  When I visited recently, I had a deliciously smooth latte and a simply mouthwatering slice of rhubarb and ginger cake.  The latter was fresh and moist, with just the right combination of flavours. Wonderful!  So, why doesn&#39;t &#39;Ginger &amp; White&#39; deserve 5 stars? Well, there are 2 reasons.  First, the place is small and cramped which, given its popularity (it was virtually full on the Saturday lunchtime when I went), is a significant problem.  There is a large communal table in the downstairs area.  I sat there, but I didn&#39;t have as much space as I felt I needed. In fact, I felt like an interloper!  The till and the area in which the serving staff congregate are immediately next to the communal table.  The result is that the place becomes chaotic if more than one customer is trying to pay their bill at the same time.  There is what looked to me like a very small seating area on the first floor, which is reached via a small staircase.  I was told it was full so I did not go up there.  But it also looked cramped.  The other drawback is the pricing.  I was charged a whopping £7.40 for my coffee and cake - very high indeed, even allowing for the quality of both.  On the plus side, service is friendly and efficient, marshalled by a very pleasant host who seemed to know many of the customers by name!  It appears that &#39;Ginger &amp; White&#39; has a loyal and regular clientele, which says much about it.  Located in a street off Haverstock Hill, about 5 minutes from Belsize Park tube station, &#39;Ginger &amp; White&#39; is worth visiting. 8/10.",

"reviewcomment":"Don&#39;t be scared people!<br><br>This market is a proper southeast Asian market. And I mean PROPER. Probably the most proper one I&#39;ve been to in this part of town. The bonus? They have a lot of vegan meats. I suppose though, it can be a little off-putting, since it&#39;s in a section of the store that smells like a combo of moth balls and pickled meats. I don&#39;t really eat the fake meats that often, but I now know where I can get it when/if I want it. They even have vegan prawns! Plus the tofu here is super cheap! I&#39;d been looking for a place like this nearby for a while, so I&#39;m glad I finally went in after passing by it on the bus so many times.<br><br>Also great is that they sell a lot of random street foods you&#39;d find all over Southeast Asia, like fried sesame rice balls with bean paste inside! Go here for all your (Southeast) Asian needs. Tesco is so much more expensive. Plus all the fresh produce and spices you need to make your curries, both Thai and Chinese, can be found here... even a few things you may have never heard of.",

So for those who dont know what I mean it is like this, you enter the one shop unit size business and to the left are the tills,to the right are fridges with prepackaged salads, coleslaw and juices. In front of you is a hot food counter and to the far left, meet the sandwiches, wraps and prepackages curries and rice.<br><br> The best thing (apart from the speed of service) is the prices.

"reviewcomment":"Sainsbury&#39;s is my supermarket of choice. Even though Waitrose is just next door, I nearly always go to Sainsbury&#39;s. Why? <br>1) I am used to it and know I can get everything I am looking for there. <br>2) The quality of the food is high and selection is good.<br>3) I also sometimes buy their &#39;Taste the Difference&#39; foods which usually deliver as well as the &#39;Basics&#39; range (eg loo rolls which are great value).<br>4) Prices are good.<br><br>The only downside to the Islington branch is that it doesn&#39;t have the best layout (long and wedge shaped) and the car park stuck at the back means you have to schlep your trolley in the rain through an obstacle course all the way around the side of the store past the crowds waiting for the bus along the pavement but this is a minor complaint really given the central London location. The Camden Town Sainsbury also has an underground car park but is a newer store. That branch also has an in store bakery which Islington doesn&#39;t.<br><br>Weekends, especially Sunday, also tend to be a zoo so either be prepared for the crowds or go during the week.<br><br>Bonus of the car park however is that you can visit the excellent market stalls in Chapel market and pick up some great bargains on fruit and veg as well as fish. There is an excellent fish stall in the market with much lower prices than you&#39;ll find in Supermarkets and probably fresher.",

"reviewcomment":"Having caught the tail end of the TV programme I recently signed up for membership at The People&#39;s Supermarket. Following an induction a few weeks ago, I worked my first shift last weekend. Both the members and shoppers come from all walks of life with the latter predominantly based locally. <br>The concept is fully democratic and there are no bosses, instead everyone supports each other. It is an excellent experience to look behind the scenes and to learn what is important in running a supermarket. Keeping the shelves stocked is obviously a major priority. I completed my first shift behind the till and was worried to be letting everyone down by being so slow. I needn&#39;t have worried as many people come here exactly because TPS is so different from regular supermarkets - a friendly atmosphere seems more important than ultra-efficient bar code scanners. Mind you, even in my first hour I would win against Tesco&#39;s self-service tills hand down - and noone shouts &#34;unexpected item in bagging area&#34; in a monotonous drone ...<br>Prices of fresh produce can change daily as neither supplies nor suppliers are uniform. I was amazed at the superior quality of some of the vegetables, and many of the prices were extremely competitive.<br>As already mentioned by other reviewers, the shop does not just stock fairtrade and organic goods, but also a lot of regular corner shop convenience stuff. I was amazed at how many times I scanned wagon wheels during my shift - at 40p a big pack these were an obvious bargain!<br>The flower stall also deserves a special mention as this definitely offers good value. A couple of guys bought beautiful bouquets for only £10 each.<br>Unfortunately, I live nowhere near the shop and won&#39;t be able to do all my shopping here. But I made sure to stock up on my favourite Ecover products (they were very competitively priced, even before the members discount), some tinned staples, those amazing red peppers and some goodies from the deli counter. The pecan pie was the best I have ever tasted, and the treacle tart a clear winner, too.<br>Actually, all the food looked amazing and that evening Arthur was running a cookery class downstairs. I like the vibe and energy of this place and will do my bit to make sure that this concept catches on as a real alternative to corporate chains at every corner.",

"reviewcomment":"Pret is my lunchtime sandwich outlet of choice.<br><br>It serves organic, free-range food. The food is awesome and freshly made every day, they have so many people behind the tills for rush hour that you never have more than 1-2 people in front of you in the queue. And you probably only waited 30 seconds to get served.<br><br>Pret is also my &#34;under the weather&#34; vendor. So I was feeling a bit ill today, my stomach is not agreeing with me. In line with the &#34;no more greasy food please!&#34; popped into Pret for leek and potato soup (there are so many &#34;bits&#34; inside that it&#39;s well worth the £3.50 that I paid it) and also went for a hot toastie, tuna melt. OK, the cheese was a bit bad for the stomach but it was delicious, and hot. And I learnt today that the little green things inside the sandwich were called capers and were not aliens. All in all, £7 for a hot and satisfying lunch, good stuff!<br><br>On one previous occasion I found that the sandwich I wanted was all being taken off the shelf by the manager. Feeling a bit weird, I asked him whether there were something wrong with them. He said the staff forgot to put the salad in, and if I wanted to buy one could I please wait about 5 minutes for them to fix the issue. So, happily he chatted away to me for a while, and when the sandwich came I was a happy bunny because guess what, he gave me a free drink because I had to wait. WOOOOO! What a nice manager.<br><br>So sad now though, they don&#39;t serve that sandwich anymore and my love for Pret has dropped slightly, they don&#39;t serve my favourite sandwich for some reason!!!! But they still serve amazing soya hot chocolate, so I couldn&#39;t abandon this place completely.<br><br>The staff are pretty nice and efficient. I don&#39;t really think the media storm last year about Pret paying staff from overseas for cheap labour was justified nor should it have been such a big deal. If there are jobs that foreign labour can do better, then why blast the business? I&#39;m sure if enough British people wanted to be in this job, and had what it takes, they would be able to get it.<br><br>Can you tell I&#39;m a Pret fan yet?",

"reviewcomment":"Oh Hummingbird Bakery - how yummy and beautiful are your offerings! I&#39;m going to say straight up that I&#39;m not a huge fan of cupcakes. Sure, they&#39;re pretty but they are often liking eating sugary nothingness. The cupcakes, here, however transcend this and are genuinely moist and tasty. The carrot cake, red velvet and black bottom are highly recommended. I&#39;ve also tried the brownie with frosted topping - it&#39;s more cakey in texture than other brownies but the frosting complements it perfectly. <br><br>There are a few tables to sit in and I&#39;ve always found service to be friendly. It should be noted, though, that the coffee is not fantastic, so I&#39;d recommend sticking to the sweets. <br><br>It&#39;s worth keeping an eye on their Twitter feed for promotions and also monthly specials. I once indulged in an American brunch cupcake (bacon and maple syrup) - so wrong but oh-so-right!",

They do an array of blended juice drinks, all with cocktail like names, and a smaller selection of smoothies too. On top of that they do all your regular coffees, and a selection of fun sandwich combinations too. <br><br>When I sat down on one of their massive big couches I totally felt at home. It&#39;s one of those places you could sit for hours on a laptop working away. The decor inside is contemporary and classy and the food and juice is great. I went for the Joe&#39;s Sweet Kiss, which was strawberry, apple and ginger, and the Serrano sandwich, containing Serrano ham, tomato and mozzarella, with a green pesto dressing. Both of them were delicious and brought to my table by the wonderful server. Great place, a definite recommendation!",

It was a taste I&#39;ll never forget!<br><br>Barbecoa is Jamie Oliver&#39;s steak restaurant with gorgeous views of St Paul&#39;s Cathedral. The restaurant is lovely - dimly lit with large seating areas. Perfect for corporate entertaining. <br><br>They sell steak on the bone (t-bone or ribeye) which is very unusual. I ordered a ribeye on the bone served medium rare. It was crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside. Delicious. It came with a sauce of my choice and some lovely sides.<br><br>I thought the starters (we had mixed starters of chicken lollipops - not so great, calamari - lovely, ribs - lovely, parma ham and mozarella - lovely, tempura vegetables - lovely) were delish. <br><br>I also had a taste of the rhubarb panacotta which was irresistible.

"reviewcomment":"This place is probably responsible for heart attacks in old city folk. But it&#39;s worth it. Fuzzys is the best takeaway food in London. Ever.<br><br> Who doesn&#39;t like a good roast dinner? Is there ever a time when you don&#39;t fancy eating roasties? Mmmmm. thinking about this place is making me want to go there right now.<br><br> It&#39;s good value for money, even though it does seem expensive, but around a fiver for a full meal with whatever you want with it is great. You choose the meat, and then whatever else you want. If you don&#39;t like carrots no problem! And, the clincher: If you want extra roasties just ask. Brilliant.<br><br> Now I know eating a roast dinner every single day might be overkill, so I highly recommend the salads. Chicken with chili jam is great and yep, you guessed it, you can have roasties with this too. I actually prefer the salads to the measl, they have herby pasta, lentil and bean things instead of just lettuce and stuff.<br><br> Oh, and if you want brekkie, you can get that too. Yum.<br><br> The only thing I&#39;m not a fan of is the price of the drinks, but that&#39;s what the water cooler at work is for.<br><br> Go. Go now. Go and get fat and sleepy.

Surprisingly I managed to actually get some nice weather here and after a long day exploring some of the most popular places around the city, I passed by this small (and cozy) spot and decided to give it a try. <br><br>The place is tiny but has a really nice feel to it, helped by the really nice choice of tables, huge windows facing the street and a beautiful display of their sweet and salty treats. <br><br>I ordered one of the most popular choices back home for an afternoon (or any time of day for that matter) snack: pão de queijo (or cheese ball) and a quindim for dessert (sorry but I can&#39;t remember its English name). Both were simply delicious and on par with some of the best I had back home! Definitely worth any £ spent on them and worth a visit if you&#39;d like to try them. <br><br>I had an opportunity to talk to Wagner, who seemed to be one of the owners, and he was very nice and attentive. <br><br>Definitely recommended!

"reviewcomment":"I thought the previous review was not only very harsh but also far from correct.<br><br> I have worked in the area for over 6 years and have seen fluctuating fortunes in the Pie man. For a number of years this place was just about sausage rolls, pies and frozen ready meals which were not helping there cause. Recently they have a new manager/chef who is producing some very high quality and imaginary lunches. They have installed a coffee machine that produces really great beverages and I now see queues outside of the like I haven&#39;t seen for 5 years. They are using local products from the fishmonger, butcher and baker on Chelsea Green and it really shows in the taste. I honestly thought this place, two years ago, was going to close, but now i believe its here to stay and is a great asset to the area.<br><br> A tip - When you go in for lunch ask them what they have made on site that day and avoid what has been sent in by there outside kitchen. Although anyone who has an eye for food could tell immediately. Unfortunately it would seem that maybe &#39;seriousfoodie&#39; (the previous reviewer) decided to buy sent in lasagne and frozen fish pies  maybe not that serious?",

"reviewcomment":"Have walked by this place many a time coming out of Borough market. The outside looks like a very intimidating froofy wine shop where I will never fit in let alone afford any of the products.<br><br>Completely untrue! <br><br>My friend had been here years ago when it was Majestic wines and wanted to go and see it again. The place is a huge warehouse of booze glorious booze...well wine specifically, with a long metal bar running down the middle for wine tastings. (it is connected to The Whisky Exchange, with super fancy pants whiskeys n such if you walk all the way to the back though)<br><br>We walked around a bit but then spoke with a friendly sales assistant who offered us tastings of what was chilling in the middle tasting area (It was Bastille day so it was all French wine that day). We wanted  white wine of some sort to go with our sausage and cheese we bought. He was very knowledgeable, even asking what region the food came from to better pair the wine.<br><br>We ended up tasting about 5 different very tasty wines but going with three of them, for 10, 13, and 14 pounds. I didn&#39;t expect there would be quality wine for that cheap. <br><br>And Cedric was hilarious and relaxed and quoted family guy as he explained to us which wines were which. Very happy about my experience here. Will definitely come back again when in the area on Borough market day.",

"reviewcomment":"It&#39;s a long story how we ended up by St Paul&#39;s at 10:00 PM so I won&#39;t go into it but it worked out well. We were looking for a late night bite when most places were closed and we came across Cafe Rouge. We were greeted by the manager and seated in a cozy corner with a perfect view of St Paul&#39;s Cathedral, lit up by spotlights just across the block.<br><br>I always love a damn good steak frites and upon the server&#39;s recommendation, we both ordered the Bavette steak, cooked rare as suggested. The steak had a nice flavor although it was a tad tough. I would have preferred it to be a little more tender but still not bad. We moved on to desert for the Crepe Chocolat Banane. It was a gooey-chocalate frenzy of bananas and chocolate over crepes. It was paired nicely with a cafe latte.<br><br>The service here was one of the best features. We were checked on frequently by both the server and manager who made sure our meal was pleasant. It was near closing time but we didn&#39;t feel like we were being rushed by any means. Overall, Cafe Rouge was a nice finish to our evening on a night when our plans had been abruptly changed. I saw a few other Cafe Rouge&#39;s around London so I&#39;d certainly be happy to return again.",

With a three year old en tow, eating out is always a little pain in the hole... two minutes in and their drinks all over the table, they&#39;ve pulled out all of the sugar sachets and you&#39;re beginning to wish you hadn&#39;t bothered. But in here, the table clothes are wipe-downs, the cups are plastic and there&#39;s a fancy dress playing area for the kids to go nuts in whilst you wait for food to arrive. There&#39;s no child-haters giving you the side eye over their mac book pro&#39;s anywhere to be see. So, three year old.. you can climb all over your chair to your hearts content. <br><br>This is very much a children&#39;s restaurant.. polka dot tables, beautiful bright paintings on the walls, half sized knives and forks etc but the food is fantastic. The children&#39;s dishes are simple and child friendly but are nicely put together with fresh home made ingredients. great pesto. I had a salad which was lovely, very generous portions.. neither of us could finish them. The three year olds meal was free with mine, too. So it was a total bargain. <br><br>I&#39;ll definitely return, it was nice to relax over a meal out with a child and for them to be able to get up and wander about without annoying people.",

The experience was short but pleasant.<br><br>Quite dark on the inside, Flirtease seems to attract a young crowd and isn&#39;t some place young professionals (our age) would hang out, but it&#39;s nice to stop by before hitting other bars in town. It has limited seating and is decorated with high top tables, bar stools, and lower lounge seating for groups. It&#39;s not a large place but if you&#39;re a small party, you should be fine.<br><br>Their menu has plenty to sample from. Their hot chocolate arrived piping hot (which made up for the chill in the room) and their desserts were plentiful. If we wanted cocktails, they were there, but we didn&#39;t order them. There were only two people working on staff that night but it didn&#39;t seem like Flirtease gets a lot of foot traffic. Perfect for a low key evening.<br><br>Flirtease is a nice enough place and tries to draw attention to what the area lacks. All in all, great idea. I&#39;d like to see it prosper a bit and become a place for people in their late twenties to hang out. The staff were honest, friendly, and warm so it&#39;s a place I think deserves a bit more visitors. We will be back.",

"reviewcomment":"After a relatively quick, but deeply disturbing, trip to Oslo this last week, a peek in at one of my favourite haunts  outside of Paris of course  at Kensington and Chelsea, seemed the right emotional &#39;pic-me-up.&#39; When you&#39;ve witnessed the aftermath of a cowardly mad-man&#39;s choice of action in the hearts and eyes of normally calm and stoic people  who still can not understandably fathom the amount of hatred it would take to be so inanely destructive and cruel to their once unshakable society  it makes one relish the life one has when visualising the carefree &#39;Flotsam and Jetsam&#39; going about their everyday business, while poignantly supping on a simple coffee on the streets of busy London.<br>Tragic events and morbidity aside. I like to frequent this Caffe Nero whenever I am in this neck of the woods, that&#39;s when it is not too busy  which it generally is, because it is superb. With the added bonus of the extra large windows that frame the building and which open up, ushering in the warm Summer&#39;s day. Along with the out door tables and chairs that get bathed in sunshine after a harsh Winter  while watching the bustling, swarms of tourists and Londoners alike, weaving through the streets like ants, doing what they do. I have a great affiliation for the Caffe Nero chain and have since sworn my allegiance to all of them whenever I come across one  forsaking all others  mainly, because of their staff&#39;s attitude to the clientèle.<br>The coffee is excellent and the cheery staff will make it just the way you like it, no fuss, no hesitation. My belief is, if Nero&#39;s could accommodate, even if you asked for a Cleopatra lookalike to deliver your libation to your table, they would. It&#39;s Caffe Nero&#39;s ethos  the customer first and foremost. So, apart from the fact that the coffee and tremendously fresh foodstuffs are terrific, the biggest deal for me, is the friendliness of the &#39;obviously&#39; hand-picked staff. No programmed coffee dispensers here. I have yet to go into a Caffe Nero and strike a &#39;rude&#39; one. I think that politeness and friendliness must be a pre-requisite to being given a job with Nero. The staff truly take their work very seriously and if you are not happy with what has been poured, they oblige you another, no sweat.<br>In other words, their customer skills are near to perfection.<br>If you are a rather sociable person like myself, and enjoy a friendly, personable smile awaiting you with your coffee  along with a light bit of banter  Caffe Nero is the place. Whatever the management team are doing, they are doing it right. So few places these days give polite, caring service. Because of the intense population explosion everywhere, with standing room only, you get the impression in most places these days that they are doing you the favour, so drink up and shove off. It is wonderful to walk in somewhere and be made to feel special, like the comedy TV show Cheers where everyone gets on, everyone remembers your usual and the entire experience is one of joy  even the daily newspapers on the wall for people to read  something a little bit gentler and considerate to look forward to in today&#39;s harsh world.",

Sure, they&#39;re pretty but they are often liking eating sugary nothingness. The cupcakes, here, however transcend this and are genuinely moist and tasty. The carrot cake, red velvet and black bottom are highly recommended. I&#39;ve also tried the brownie with frosted topping - it&#39;s more cakey in texture than other brownies but the frosting complements it perfectly. <br><br>There are a few tables to sit in and I&#39;ve always found service to be friendly. It should be noted, though, that the coffee is not fantastic, so I&#39;d recommend sticking to the sweets. <br><br>It&#39;s worth keeping an eye on their Twitter feed for promotions and also monthly specials.

On top of that they do all your regular coffees, and a selection of fun sandwich combinations too. <br><br>When I sat down on one of their massive big couches I totally felt at home. It&#39;s one of those places you could sit for hours on a laptop working away. The decor inside is contemporary and classy and the food and juice is great. I went for the Joe&#39;s Sweet Kiss, which was strawberry, apple and ginger, and the Serrano sandwich, containing Serrano ham, tomato and mozzarella, with a green pesto dressing. Both of them were delicious and brought to my table by the wonderful server. Great place, a definite recommendation!",

"reviewcomment":"This branch of the Asian supermarket is tucked away in a business park area in Greenwich, but if you take the time to go, you&#39;ll be rewarded with a huge range of produce. The place is clean, the veggies fresh and there is a fish/seafood counter the likes of which you&#39;ll not see except at Billingsgate, and who wants to get up at 5a.m. to buy a whole box of fish when you only need one?<br><br>Some of the great produce:<br><br>Veggies: Chinese veg like Choi Sum, Gai Lan (better than Soho generally, as they stock the &#39;baby&#39;/ &#39;dwarf&#39; varieties which are more tender, less stringy), mooli, tropical fruits, Tung Choi (Morning Glory), Winter Melon &amp; Pea shoots whenever in season. There are also 10+ varieties of Vietnamese herbs (Viet mint, saw tooth coriander etc) and more besides.<br><br>Chiller cabinets hold ready cooked Chinese dishes like braised beef brisket in Chinese soy marinade; belly-pork slices in chillies- Sichuan-style; sliced pig&#39;s ears in sesame &amp; chilli, chicken feet in garlic &amp; black beans and many other classic Chinese dishes at about £4 per box.<br><br>Freezer cabinets hold frozen fish, scallops, squids, shucked oysters, panko breaded prawns, soft shell crabs etc, all sold at a price that&#39;d make you wince the next time you see them on a restaurant menu (approx. £1.80 for the 7 or 8 prawns/ plate at a restaurant). The boxes of various sizes of frozen prawns are marked with numbers like &#39;16/20&#39;, &#39;21/25&#39;, denoting the average number of prawns per unit weight, the smaller the number, larger the prawns. The choices centre around the shell-on (SO)/ headless (HL)/ Black Tiger- the most common, popular option (@ around £9-12/box). All you need do is to take it home, partially defrost it, re-bag/re-freeze in the portion sizes you want &amp; you&#39;ll have large, plump king prawns on tap.<br><br>Cases of Asahi/Sapporo/Singha bottled beers (~ £22/ case of 24), dried goods of all descriptions, lines of restaurant type cooking utensils and crockery are all carried under the one hanger-sized roof.<br><br>There are enough Japanese products like nori, instant dashi powder, sushi soy, ready prepared wasabi, mirin etc for those who want to make a simple Japanese meal. The selection is limited, but slowly expanding over time.<br><br>They also have a cooked meat counter selling cold (supplied daily) roast duck, roasted belly-pork, char siu, suckling pig and soy-braised offal, all sold by weight.<br><br>The star of the show is surely the fish/seafood section. Large tanks holding LIVE lobsters (Canadian &amp; Scottish), crabs (English &amp; thinner-shelled Canadian), eels, turbot, clams and razor-shells. There are oysters, live whelks and winkles (simmer for 13min, eat with a soy, hot oil and chilli dip- quite unlike the cold vinegared rubber one more usually encounters). The fish counter stocks some of the freshest fish I&#39;ve come across in London. Wild and farmed sea bass, soles, tilapia, breams, sardines, salmon, squid and octopus, scallops and abalone, fresh prawns...the list goes on and on, all quickly sold to the seemingly never-ending queue of weekend shoppers.<br><br>Now that they finally accept credit cards (as of about a year ago), the presence of on-site free parking, 8 lanes of tills with packers, there really isn&#39;t any reason why they don&#39;t deserve the full 5 stars...",

I popped in to Cafe Lemon earlier today for a hangover busting brunch and was not disappointed: you get a lot for your money here, and the atmosphere is really chilled out and happy.<br><br> While I was busy tucking into my veggie sausage and mushrooms (with bubble &amp; squeak, egg and hash browns on the side!) it looked like those who&#39;d actually got up early enough to order lunch were having a nice time too: they have some delicious looking wraps to choose from.<br><br> I only made it as far as &#39;veg breakfast no.1&#39; but look forward to exploring the rest of the menu :)",

"reviewcomment":"I like that when I visit H&amp;B I can ask almost any member of staff a question about their products and they have some knowledge - or just ask about general nutrition and they&#39;re happy to give advice - or just ask where something is and...you catch my drift, don&#39;t you? <br><br>It&#39;s a small/medium sized store, which was previously located in Moorgate. I&#39;ve bought slimming products, snack bars, vitamins, cereals, teas and, so far, everything I&#39;ve needed has been available. They also have a small cooler section which I noticed stocks meat alternatives and a wall almost solely dedicated to body building supplements (frequented by many a city gent I might add!). <br><br>It&#39;s worth popping in just for snacks as there&#39;s usually some sort of offer on and the price gram for gram is usually better than the small enticing packs you find near the counters of the nearby sandwich shops.",

"reviewcomment":"Use your loaf and support your local business. You don&#39;t need a lot of dough to shop here, so what are you waiting for?<br><br>I imagine like me, you don&#39;t think about your bread a lot. You probably have a favourite brand, but don&#39;t put too much thought into it, you just scoop it into your shopping trolley once a week. If it isn&#39;t the supermarkets own branded stuff, it probably cost anything between 89p and £1.89. Does it always last, or like me do you end up throwing the last few slices out?<br><br>So it was, on a Saturday morning I find myself with no bread, it&#39;s a 5 minute walk to Sainsbury&#39;s, or 2 minutes to The Bakers of Muswell Hill. I guess I&#39;d always assumed it would be expensive. Fact: IT IS CHEAPER THAN ANYWHERE ELSE. That last fact obviously depends on what you have, but a loaf of bread starts at 79p. I could have had one taken out of the oven fresh, but they said it would be too warm to slice, and being lazy I went for one that had been out of the oven half an hour already. Any idea how long the ones in the supermarket have been out. Hours? a day or two? You can actually watch the guys in the back baking the bread here, and still the price starts at 79 measly pence. The prices go up as your choice increases, granary, different shapes and sizes. I don&#39;t know what the crocodile shaped loaf in the window costs, but I love it. There are of course pastries and sweet things, and the girl who served me had some lovely buns too!<br><br>Seriously, why do people not shop locally and more specialised? I guess convenience and cost. Well cost is no longer an issue, and it&#39;s nearer my house than the supermarket. I imagine that is true for a lot of you, so I hope there&#39;ll be a queue this Saturday.",

"reviewcomment":"Such a great place. I came here with two friends, on the suggestion of one of them who had been recommended it as a haven for chocolate lovers (which I definitely am). First off, I love that they do everything here. They grind cocoa and coffee beans and make fresh chocolate, hot chocolate, coffee, mocha. They have daily specials, freshly baked cakes, cookies. The shop upstairs is beautifully laid out with chocolates in all sizes, configurations, packages. Downstairs, is the chocolate café/restaurant, where all the food has chocolate of some kind in it. We split goats cheese and walnut salads with a chocolate vinaigrette and a duck confit and chocolate wrap (the wrap also has cocoa in it!), followed by a trio of chocolate deserts and accompanied with three types of chocolate drink (hot chocolate, mocha and chilli-chocolate). Yes, we are chocolate fanatics. <br><br>Speaking of the basement restaurant, the food is simple but works well, and some of the flavours are pretty innovative, and there&#39;s certainly scope for further additions to the menu down the line. Indeed, we got chatting with the (off-puttingly good looking) French chef (or [co-]owner?), who kindly gave us a mini tour of the various equipment used to grind and refine the beans and mix the chocolate, and who told us about his hopes for the future - in particular how he wants to introduce more substantial items to the restaurant menu, such as fish and chicken dishes with chocolate as a vital component. This itself isn&#39;t anything new to cooking in general - after all the Mayans have been cooking with chocolate for centuries - but it would definitely be a welcome change to the generic ideas of chocolate recipes that you find in the likes of Lindt and Thornton shops and cafés.<br><br>The next time I&#39;m in Covent Garden, which should be very soon, I will definitely be back here to stock up on some chocolate goodies, and perhaps grab another wrap or salad while I&#39;m at it.",

"reviewcomment":"This place is so darn cute. As cozy as your grandmother&#39;s living room but with a bit more chic. They offer a lot of cute tea cups, aprons and tea towels on sale. The display helps jazz up the place.<br><br>The servers are sweet and the drinks and bits come out fast. Today we ordered a strawberry and orange tea pot for two and a slice of lemon drizzle cake. Although the cake was a wee bit dry, the dryness made sense. The cake had a cornbread texture and it worked. The drizzle was tart and sweet. So a definite must-eat again dessert.<br><br>During a previous visit I had their scones with clotted cream and jam on the side. The scones were nice, moist. What stood out was that the clotted cream came in little packets. Here&#39;s this cute place that makes you think you&#39;re eating at your fancy nan&#39;s house and they give you cream in a packet? I would have preferred it served in a small dish, like the jam. <br><br>Definitely a place I look forward to returning to, especially with out of town guests.",

Just over a pound for a delicious sandwich on ciabatta. <br><br>Basically, you&#39;re getting warm, homemade food prepared with lots of love and kindness for the price of a meal deal at Tesco or Sainsbury&#39;s.<br><br>Highly recommended!",

If you need something special. This would be a good place to buy it,  the only downside is that they have no Canadian Ryes so my predilection for Forty Creek Double Barrel Reserve went unsated.",

"reviewcomment":"This is by far the best poutine I have had in London. &#34;What&#39;s a poutine?&#34; you might ask. Well, a poutine is a French Canadian dish that includes chips, topped with cheese curds, then topped with gravy. <br><br>At one point, the Maple Leaf was the only place you can find this dish, unfortunately with shredded cheese, but their gravy is delicious. Over Canada Day weekend, Match Bar had a Canada theme pop up which advertised cheese curds, but I found out what they meant by cheese curds was feta which was revolting. Then I also found The Abbey Tavern which served up a poutine similar to The Maple Leaf, but their gravy was less than stellar. So in comes The Poutinerie, although they added gruyere to the mix, they have the Canadian National dish pretty spot on. The chips are crispy, the cheese curds are squeaky, the gravy was smooth and it was overall delicious!<br><br>They provide many options, a traditional one for £5, Coq Au Vin (chicken and bacon) for £6, and Philly Steak for £7. I&#39;ve had my taste of all of them and I think by far my favourite was the Coq Au Vin, but if you&#39;ve never had a poutine before, please do yourself a favour and start with the traditional one so that you know how it should be.<br><br>They&#39;re a very friendly couple and told Andrew M. and I they&#39;ll be having a Christmas theme poutine for December! And have plans to have other seasonal options as well.<br><br>Good to have them within walking distance to my flat. A bit of home (country) is not far away.",

"reviewcomment":"Love the place.  Conveniently located at the Trafalgar Square.  I was out from National Gallery at 9:00PM on Friday night and found this place on my way back to the Tube.  I brought my first London meal back to my hotel from there and it was truly yummy.  There&#39;re a lot of choices in London.  For something fast and affordable, it&#39;s a good choice and it&#39;s everywhere.  It seems very popular for local.  Interesting to see that food has two prices for eating in the restaurant and take out.  I like the concept.<br><br>Got this from its napkin:  &#34;Our kitchens are brimming with new ingredients like fresh dill, spring onions and French quinoa.  We&#39;ve used vibrant red salanova, apollo, and spinach leaves to perfect our salads so they fill you up, not slow you down.  Spring is in the air.

"reviewcomment":"Of all the people to recommend this place to me, it was an estate agent as she sped away from one house she had shown us around on her way to another. The first viewing was simply a blur but a good enough looking blur for us to walk back and beg for a space to sit and eat cake.<br><br>It was packed with mothers with children and we were actually turned away as it was so full, but we did get offered a seat outside around the back (don&#39;t think they expected us to take it as it was a bit of a cold day - but we NEEDED cake so snapped at the chance). <br><br>The outside bit is quite big actually, that too must get to bursting point on a sunny day, and the room around the back is cosy and comfy too. Enough about the seats, let&#39;s get to the tea and cake!<br><br>There is a great selection of teas from proper Chinese stuff (very technical I know) to the random infusions and granny tea. A tea for all sorts. The cakes were amazing! They have a cake selection plate that we tried as we though they&#39;d be small slices and we wanted to try lots of different cakes - the plate was rammed full of 5 slices of different cakes (you can choose which ones you want of course) and it would have been rude not to finish them all. Beautiful home made cakes, can&#39;t get better.<br><br>Quick tip: come closer to closing time, I think you get bigger slices of cake as they want to get rid of them :)<br><br>Great little place, quite new I think, and it overlooks the park which makes for a wonderful view through the big windowed frontage.",

You can pick up some lovely freshly roast chicken and lamb ribs for your lunch on a Saturday.<br>They open early- I&#39;ve been there at 7.30am but also close by 5ish most days.

"reviewcomment":"This traditional butcher&#39;s shop is wonderful - it offers excellent products and personal service which are miles away from the supermarket experience. With meat cut to order, you can get exactly what you want in the size you want - along with any advice on choosing and cooking it that you may need.<br><br> Worth a special mention are the wonderful pies. I love the steak and kidney in particular, although these do tend to sell out before the end of the day. The pork pies are also superb, and the faggots absolutely delicious.<br><br> There is also a range of other products including sauces, pickles and relishes.",

"reviewcomment":"A small street market in Westminster primarily serving the local office workers trade but also very popular with local residents, of which I am one.<br><br> Excellent value for money! There are 2 fruit and veg stalls (great characters working on these stalls), a florist stall, a hardware/electricals stall, the regular guy who sells books, children&#39;s books and diaries, a regular well dressed lady who sells office and casual wear (she wears what she sells and she looks good) at down to earth prices, a young couple who run a hats, scarves and accessories stall etc etc. Some stalls are long term features and sometimes there are guest ones.<br><br> Since last year or so there is a hot food stall called Madame Gaultier (regular-ish) selling continental style hot dishes for lunch. A pasta dish or potato gratin dish here or there. I go there for my fix of celeri remoulade and grated carrots salad. Towards the end of last year a Jamaican couple have started selling West Indian dishes like Jerk Chicken and rice and peas which is great.<br><br> Well worth visiting if you are in the area.

"reviewcomment":"This is another gem in Borough Market, the premier foodies&#39; market in London<br><br>Located in the Jubilee Market, Mario Prati&#39;s stall specialises in the much sought-after fresh truffles from Acqualagna, in the Marche region of Italy. The star ingredient is available for smelling in a large jar marked &#39;Smell me!&#39; Although I&#39;ve never done drugs, I don&#39;t think many smells can beat the umami hit from fresh truffle<br><br>They also sell truffle products like truffle salt and truflle oil, both secret ingredients I use in my cooking. If you can&#39;t afford fresh truffle, truffle salt is a great alternative. I&#39;ve not tasted the truffle honey they have for sale and can&#39;t quite reconcile in my mind a combination of honey and truffle flavours<br><br>However, Tartufaia also have another very important string to their bow. In a little refrigerated display to the side of their stall, they have different flavoured foie gras parfaits and terrines available for purchase. Wonderful flavours and your friends will be stunned if you serve these at a dinner party. The foie gras parfaits are super rich and I just let a little piece melt in my mouth as an indulgence. The terrines pair well with chutneys at room temperature for a decadent starter<br><br>Limited products at this stall but definitely a case of quality over quantity!",

"reviewcomment":"My old walking pal Dan was in town for the weekend. As he is in the midst of a serious love affair with both food and beer I thought that a visit to the guys at the Kernel Brewery for cold refreshment on our walk from Greenwich to Borough would hit the spot.<br><br> The brewery can be found in an old railway arch in an, at least for now, &#34;off the beaten track&#34; area of Bermondsey. It&#39;s open to the public from 9 until 3 on Saturday when you can also do a bit of shopping, with neighbouring offerings from the likes of the Monmouth Coffee Company, Neal&#39;s Yard Dairy and the St John&#39;s Bakery amongst many others. Think of Borough as a proper market, with car parking but without the crowds or the tourists, and you will be near the mark for this little gem of an area.<br><br> Anyway, the brewery itself is well worth travelling across town to visit because these guys are turning out some of the finest brews I have ever had the pleasure to drink. I was very impressed to see Kernel being stocked behind the bar at the Hawksmoor, Wright Brothers and Pied a Terre. Check out their website around Thursday to see what they will be selling at the weekend; if there is something special you fancy I would recommend getting here early because the good stuff doesn&#39;t last long!!!<br><br> As well as buying the normal range of beer and the &#34;limited&#34; edition stuff at a much cheaper price than you will find in the bars that have the honour of stocking it you can also sample the beer on site. There is not much in the way of seating, one picnic table and a concrete ledge for squatting, but this did not seem to be bothering the crowd of about 15 when we rocked up at 2pm.<br><br> The Pale Ale Citra had sold out by the time we arrived. However, we soon got over our disappointment and had the Strong Dark Mild, which is a great collaboration with the people at Redemption. Served in a nice &#34;tulip&#34; glass we found ourselves a perch and enjoyed this smooth, dark, easy drinking ale. Just for the hell of it we also shared a very tasty IPA Citra, which was like a grown up &#34;bitter and twisted&#34;, before heading off to stock on provisions for the week ahead.<br><br> If you are a serious beer lover I would say that a trip to the Kernel Brewery is pretty much essential. If you like Borough Market but are a bit put off by the scrum it can entail I would suggest you give this area a try one Saturday morning....you will not be disappointed.",

"reviewcomment":"What an amazing place. It&#39;s like having a mini Borough Market inside St Pancras station. Sourced Market is split down the middle as a deli/shop. On one side you can grab some food to go (or stay as there are long tables and stools to sit at) and on the other side you can... shop. For food.<br><br>Sourced is the name because they only sell produce from independent (and where possible local) food and drink specialists. All variations of food and drink too; oils, cheeses, pasta, baked goods, cold meats, fruit and veg and many others neatly organised around the open fronted store. A special mention needs to go to the beer section. Not only is it extensive and rammed with good quality beers but a majority of them are brewed right here in London. They&#39;ve been &#39;sourced&#39; from quite a number of micro breweries and a there&#39;s still room for some American craft beers too. Also, if you fancy a Monmouth coffee (as many do) then look no further, Sourced barista&#39;s can knock one up for you in no time - unless you enjoy queuing at Monmouth Coffee house in Borough Market for half an hour. I don&#39;t. Decision made. Or you can buy a load of it in a bag, take it home and make it yourself.<br><br>They&#39;re seasonal, convenient, local (to me at least) and sell produce that has been made with a bit of love and care.<br><br>It&#39;s open until 9pm on weekdays and 8pm on weekends and, just as a warning, if you do visit Sourced Market you will want to take a a bagful of goodies back with you. You have been warned!<br><br>TTFN,<br>Ian",

Same for my friend. Good news: they believed in our honesty and that we would return to pay the bill ... which we did.<br><br>Next to the staff, the place is also nice. It&#39;s not very big, but has some seats outside (back and front) for you smokers out there. It has a mixture of normal cafe chairs and some super comfortable arm chairs. The menu has a decent choice of food, starting from soup, over quiche, to wraps and cakes. I only tried the soup ... it was OK, but nothing to go back for. <br><br>I think I will tag this as a cosy place for a coffee and a chat, and maybe next time I will sample the cake.

Probably not the best choice with a bad front tooth the lettuce was the real deal, full of flavour, though also a little difficult for me to negotiate right then!

"reviewcomment":"I tried Bagelmania for the first time today and really liked it. To be honest I have never really been a bagel type of girl but the girls in the office raved about this place so I thought I would give it a go. I was impressed by the number of fillings available, made to order or if you are in a hurry theyhave a few pre packed ones ready to go. They also have a great selection of cakes for those aof you like me who have a sweet tooth.<br>The service was fast and friendly, just what you need when you are on your lunch break!<br>I will definitly be back.",

"reviewcomment":"So the word on the street is that Shoryu has been opened by the Japan Centre, so off I went for lunch with a friend.<br><br>The place is sleek looking, black design, dual store space, although the tables are slightly cramped together. At lunch time it was super busy, must be a testament to how good its food is.<br><br>I believe I had the dracula ramen (can&#39;t remember - see photo) and I remember the broth was quite mild but I prefer this broth to the broth at Tonkotsu and at Bonedaddies. The egg however, pales in comparison to the runny yolk amazingness that is the egg at Bonedaddies. It is not too thick and creamy, how this compares to authentic Japanese I could not say, but it was nice and gentle to my sensitive stomach.<br><br>Drinks on the other hand could do with some work. My lunch mate&#39;s drink tasted horrible, and mine was just decent. It felt like too much ice went in so it went a bit too watery. Please introduce some nice drinks for people like me, I have a super sweet tooth. I do not really care that much if the drink is super unhealthy :)<br><br>Overall, I think I would come back here again, maybe to try the hirata bun, but Flesh &amp; Buns come first for that.",
