"reviewcomment":"I live around the corner from Nimba and discovered it shortly after I moved in. We immediately loved it and felt so welcomed by the staff.<br><br>Their espresso machine has been broken for about two months now and I felt so bad for them - we started coming more frequently to try and support them. HOWEVER, the machine has been FIXED!! This is great news. They make amazing mochas and cappuccinos (according to my coffee-drinking boyfriend - I come for the tea).<br><br>Nimba is a lovely cafe. Their donuts are outstanding, not just dry sugar-bombs; their breakfast sandwiches are simple and delicious; and they have lots of shelves with excellent books. One time, my boyfriend ordered a coffee, only to find that he was out of cash. No problem, they said, just pay next time. We came in two days later and got some more drinks and paid for the coffee. Small-town service in NYC? I&#39;ll take it!",

The bread is always fresh. Jerry is the man. What more can I say about this place that hasn&#39;t already been mentioned? Oh yeah, they have a lot of imported Italian stuff which is hard to find and brings me back to when I lived there for a while.

The class I sat in on was led by Ryan and he was a real character--killed it with the jokes all night!

"reviewcomment":"OMG, I am truly on &#34;cloud 9&#34; when I make it over from the Chelsea Market!  There are so many farm fresh, salads, and appetizer bar options! Not to mention Hemispheres has three main entree stations to choose from, that offer hot and unique dinning options for lunch and dinner. It&#39;s hard to name exact dishes since they change the menu every week, but in the past their fish/seafood is spot on, pork loins are tender, and their soul food side dishes are exactly that... food for the soul! Even though, they have this burger station available everyday, they are something not to miss when you visit! They have like 4 different bread options to choose from, three types of cheeses, and a vegetarian option. I love mine on Pretzel Bread and topped with pepper jack cheese!<br>Another tip for my fellow Yelpers lucky enough to dine at this private paradise is...LEAVE ROOM FOR DESSERT!  It&#39;s almost overwhelming how many options they provide every day. From cheese cake and apple crumb cake, to freshly baked/prepared cookies, pastries, and parfaits! <br>Something to consider as well is, the adjacent cafe &#34;Truck Pit&#34;. Yes, there&#39;s a legitimate food truck that they&#39;ve transplanted to the middle of the 8th Floor cafeteria! You must try the frequently original FroYo flavors that they churn out through the week. Simply addicting and heavenly!<br>Overall, Hemispheres, combined with the Truck Pit, on the 8th Floor of Google&#39;s NYC office location, is hands down one of the best-kept secrets in the Chelsea area!",

"reviewcomment":"This guy is awesome.<br><br>I came in for some B12 and D vitamins (most people are lacking those in their diet, and low levels could cause irreversible neurological disorders), and I figured a stop through would be just as confusing as when I peruse the aisles of Whole Foods. You see labels upon labels and just take a guess as to which is the superior product. But here, you&#39;re greeted by a super nice fellow who takes the time to help you find what&#39;s best for your needs, tells you how the vitamins are supposed to work in your body, suggests things to eat to ensure you absorbs the vitamins properly, etc... I suppose if you&#39;re in the vitamin business you&#39;re expected to have a pretty vast knowledge of your area of expertise, but I was still quite impressed.<br><br>It&#39;s a bit of a trek if you live anywhere except Upper West Side, but it&#39;s worth stopping by if you find yourself in the area.",

"reviewcomment":"This wine shop is a joy to go in. I rarely feel good about parting with money - even in exchange for alcohol, but this was a truly lovely experience. I was buying a present for some friends who had put me up for a couple of weeks, and I wanted to treat them to some good wine. They know more about wine than I do, so I thought that this would be a tricky mission. <br><br>In fact it was extremely easy. I walked in, described their taste, mentioned my budget and voila, I had 12 different  bottles of very decent wine - one or two a little unusual and cheeky, and all for less than the budget I had set. I thoroughly enjoyed the experience - at no time did I feel like I was being dense or that I wasn&#39;t quite good enough for the &#39;club&#39;. The owner was charming, engaging and just so very knowledgeable. <br><br>My friends loved the selection - every single bottle of it, and I got all the kudos for my brilliant taste in wine.

There&#39;s a variety of veggies, fruits, and snacks. They change up their snack inventory every so often so it can vary on what you find (ie: peanuts, pita chips, apple cider). There&#39;s also a small bread section with pitas, bagels, french bread, and rolls. You can also get olive oil, pasta, and milk here too. <br><br>This location is a bit camouflaged and if you weren&#39;t looking for it - you might just walk past thinking it&#39;s an abandoned shack. It&#39;s situated right next to a parking lot - just walk through the narrow entry way and through the plastic covering - tada produce market. If you&#39;re closer to port authority - I know there&#39;s another stiles farmers market right across the street from there next to a pizza joint.

"reviewcomment":"If there are restaurants in heaven....this is what they must be like!!! <br><br>Let me start by saying that, though I was raised as a vegetarian, I have always been very picky about my vegetarian food. My dad is a Chef Master so I&#39;m a little bias. With that being said....this is probably the best vegetarian food that I&#39;ve ever had that has not come out of my family&#39;s kitchen. My carnivore friend told me about his obsession with this place and when I came to visit....he brought me here. We came back 3 times in the 5 days I was in Brooklyn lol. It&#39;s really that good. Let me bullet so i can avoid writing a book about it: <br><br>PROS<br>-Great tasting, fresh vegetarian food! Honestly amazing! Try the falafel. Try the black bean burger (best I EVER had). And for God sakes, try the juice!!!!<br>-Great price. Lunch special is like $6 for a burger and fries, $8 for a burger and a fresh squeezed juice. Great portions...substantial nourishment!! You&#39;ll be full for hours! I ate half of my burger and was stuffed.<br>-Friendly (and handsome!!) staff. Rasta vibe...you can taste the love in the food! <br>-Healthy. Yes. Healthy food can taste great if it&#39;s made right!! <br>-Great selection! I am going to go back and try everything on the menu...you know...if i ever get tired of eating black bean burgers!!! <br><br>CONS<br>-If you&#39;re in a rush, call in your order. Everything is made fresh to order so it takes a few minutes to prepare. <br>-No seating...standing room only. Which apparently is not uncommon in NY. <br><br>That&#39;s honestly the only Cons I can think of. This place is a diamond in the ruff. <br><br>Anyway, stop reading this and go try it already.

Literally on the first block, on the right hand side, after you cross the West bound side of Queens Boulevard. ***<br><br>Sweet &amp; Sara has long been one of my favorite vegan indulgences. I ordered a bunch of goodies online for my boyfriend for Halloween (hello, Halloween-themed bats and ghosts!) and went to pick them up. I set my appointment for Wednesday on Monday morning but had an opening in my schedule to pick them up earlier, which they happily arranged for. That was really sweet of them.<br><br>Then I got there, and everyone was so nice! I&#39;ve come to the factory before and met Sara and didn&#39;t expect anything but sweetness. It&#39;s a family affair here, folks. Makes me want to start a family business. They were so pleasant and funny. Added bonus: Everything there smells like marshmallows.<br><br>As if it isn&#39;t clear, I love the product, admire the people, and love it when I have time to pick them up at the factory instead of grabbing some from Duane Reade*. <br><br>*Who else is super excited they can get these delicious bits of heaven at the city&#39;s most common drug store?

"reviewcomment":"Great liquor store. Maybe a little bit pricey but everything in this store is worth its value. Also, excellent excellent selection in whiskeys. I was planning on making rum balls for new years yesterday and realized that I haven&#39;t bought fancy dark spiced rum since I lived in my Bayridge Apartment. And by &#39;fancy&#39;, I merely mean not Captain Morgan&#39;s. I&#39;m sorry, but Church Avenue wasn&#39;t going to cut it. I&#39;ve been in here a few times before with the ex and knew they would have something great. Note to self: They have Laphroaig. Which I personally think is nasty as hell. But the amount of rare scotch and whiskeys in here is delightful and my Dad would be mesmerized. I asked the guy at the counter about dark rums and he pulled out 3 different bottles.

I&#39;m sold. Being able to taste test (or &#34;take shots&#34; as my boyfriend will tell you) so many oils and vinegars truly makes O Live an experience, not just a fine shop.<br><br>We had such a blast sampling the vinegars in particular and decided on purchasing a sampler set. The staff was extremely accommodating and helped us custom-build our set of 6, filling the bottles before our eyes. Less than a week later, our family was so enamored and crafting so many excuses to use these guys that we were almost out and they drove down from CT to get some more! A few favorites: Strawberry, Espresso, White Peach + Garlic Olive Oil is a great base for almost any dish!<br><br>This is definitely a staple for our family now. Near or far, this place is worth the trip! I&#39;m so thrilled to have O Live in my life and can&#39;t wait to share it with others :)",

I came here looking for a nice big slice of steak to grill for myself on V-day (Spoiler - it turned out amazing).<br><br>My favorite part is that they display most of their cuts along with the prices, so you can look and decide how much marbling you want and what is within your price range. I ended up buying a 1.5lb slice of the bone-in cowboy steak (and I will be going back soon to try the porterhouse cut). The butchers were extremely helpful in helping me decide (tenderness, marbling, price, etc), and even offered tips on how to best cook it.<br><br>Tip: If you want to cook the steak in a skillet instead of broiling or grilling it, don&#39;t buy the bone in. I like my steaks rare, and while most of the steak cooked perfectly, the meat attached to the bone ended up raw.",

You can also shop for tea pots and other naturally-derived products (herbal soaps, etc.) up front. <br><br>As other reviews mention, the owner gives one-on-one time to every customer, so expect a bit of a wait if there are people before you. The first time I went, I expected to just pop in and pick up a few bags of tea--and then had to wait 20 minutes because of the two customers ahead of me. But the guidance is worth the wait, otherwise you may be overwhelmed by the 100+ varieties. <br><br>Overall, I definitely plan on stopping by whenever I&#39;m in the area.",

They have a chocolate counter up front, candy against the wall, and cupcakes toward the back. I started to explore and found the gold mine - ICE CREAM AND GELATO! The owner told us that he just received a fresh batch of gelato, but the ice cream flavors really caught our attention. My bf loves peanut butter, so he was pretty much set on getting the PB Fudge. The sweet owner offered us samples of the flavors we were interested in. We first tried the PB fudge, and it was delicious. It was a PB ice cream with fudge ripples throughout. He also let us sample the oatmeal cookie. YES, oatmeal cookie in ice cream form. It was heaven. We almost tried the apple crumble flavor but we didn&#39;t want to be torn over so many choices. So nice of him to let us sample so many flavors! (Most people would just get annoyed.) We chose the oatmeal raisin cookie. I swear there were little pieces of chocolate chips in it, but after looking closely, it was small crushed pieces of raisins. Could&#39;ve fooled me!<br><br>I went ahead and grabbed my bag of chocolate covered gummy bears and a couple of malt balls. The owner also let us know of the cupcake deal, but we declined since we didn&#39;t have anymore room.<br><br>Our total came out to less than $7. A bit pricey, but I&#39;d rather support my local neighborhood shop any day (especially since the owners are so nice!). We&#39;ll definitely be back.",

Someone went around collecting the utensils after each course, the hostess in the middle collected the dishes.  The chefs plated each course in a line.  It was so fascinating to watch the efficiency of it all.<br><br>The food, of course, was amazing and beautiful.  The starting courses were my favorite of the night.  There was this uni dish that was probably my favorite.  (I don&#39;t even like uni normally!!)  A good number of the dishes had freshly shaved truffle on them.  One of the desserts was a truffle-flavored ice cream with truffle shaving!!  Chef Ramirez started with a huge truffle at the beginning of the night, and by the end it was shaved down to almost nothing.  Oh man, every time he went at it with the truffle, I felt like a star-struck teen at a Bieber concert.  <br><br>My partner and I shared the wine pairing (since neither of us are big drinkers).  I&#39;m not sure if it added much to the meal, except for the sheep&#39;s milk cheese which was paired *amazingly* with a sweet wine.<br><br>Overall a FANTASTIC experience.",

"reviewcomment":"I cannot speak highly enough about this place. If you like cheap, delicious meat to grill, then this is the place! The menu is in Polish and half of the staff doesn&#39;t speak English so your best bet is to find the youngest staff person to help you and theres a good chance they are bilingual. While all of their meat is delicious, my favorite is getting thick slices of bacon and then throwing it on the grill and cooling it so its melt in your mouth delicious. I make it a point to stop here when I am in the area. Steve&#39;s is a hidden gem....you won&#39;t be disappointed!",

"reviewcomment":"Words cannot describe how incredible this italian speciality store really is. First of all, the store is pristine and every worker is well groomed and tidy, (my mom insists they all get manicures! ha). The workers never fail at greeting their customers with a smile. Secondly, the food is always fresh. I would not recommend buying meat from anywhere else. You won&#39;t be disappointed. The chicken cutlets are sliced thin, perfectly cut, and ready to be fried or baked. If I&#39;m having a bad day, Faicco&#39;s is definitely my &#39;go to&#39; for comfort food! They make a ton of yummy appetizers, which are always a huge hit at parties. Be ware- holiday time can be totally chaotic so plan accordingly! <br><br>What to get:<br><br>-Chicken tenders (with a hint of lemon flavoring) <br>-Potato croquettes<br>-Rice Balls<br>-Prosciutto balls<br>-Fresh mozzarella<br>-Broccoli Rabe bread <br>-Eggplant bread <br>-Olive bread<br>-Stuffed mushrooms <br>-Cold Cuts (they slice so thin!) <br>-macaroni and potato salad <br>And so so much more!<br><br>Faicco also makes the most spectacular sandwiches. My favorite sandwich: Roast beef, fresh mozzarella, shredded lettuce, mayo, and tomato! I also love their desert freezer, which always has tartufo, tortoni, and sorbet. <br><br>I can&#39;t say enough good things about Faicco&#39;s.

"reviewcomment":"Now while I&#39;m not the biggest coffee drinker, I do appreciate a truly great cup of coffee. A few months back, my family and I enjoyed delicious beverages and great, friendly service on the steps of this Italian-style coffee house, tucked away between 2nd &amp; 3rd. Never would have found this place if we didn&#39;t ask around, and boy, am I glad we did! <br><br>There&#39;s no table seating at I am coffee, so you can either have your java to go, or sit on the steps and enjoy it there. When I drink coffee, I usually drink it on the go. However, I very much enjoyed sitting out on the steps--the experience felt very authentic. I ordered one cappuccino, and while the coffee was good, the service is what made the place shine. I watched as the barista whipped me up a fresh cup, and I was served quickly with a friendly smile. While it may be a tad expensive, overall I feel that the experience is well worth it!",

I started with A&amp;A. <br><br>On a nippy Saturday morning there was a line, a long one, but I  didn&#39;t care. I spent 8 hours in a car to get here and a line was not going to stop me. <br><br>What I got? My usual for breakfast; bake and saltfish. It was heaven. The bake was crisp on the outside and piping hit goodness on the inside. The saltfish was well seasoned and the pepper that I had added gave it an extra kick. <br><br>My cousin got an aloo pie. The aloo pie was crisp and the chana was seasoned to perfection. Topped with pepper and tamarind and you have greatness. <br><br>Thanks to A&amp;A I am already dreading returning to Norfolk.",

Awesome.<br>- Honeycrisp apples: I know you can get these in some supermarkets but it is just the greatest all-time apple and they&#39;re the best when they&#39;re fresh, local, and organic.<br>- Farm eggs, raw milk cheese, free-range meat, Long Island wines, lavender, pickled everything, IPA cider, apple cider donuts, a rainbow of beans, carrots, cauliflower, tomatoes, actual flowers, everything everything everything I love.<br>- Bring your compost!

Just need something that goes well with a hearty ribeye or is perfect for a housewarming celebration? Well, you&#39;re in luck...  They have these little wine kiosks set up in the front of the store. The kiosks help you pair the wine accordingly with the meal or occasion. Super helpful. <br><br>When you check out they give you a little print out info sheet on the wine you selected. It has space for notes and such so you don&#39;t lose track of wines you especially like or dislike.

She has weird hours though so give her a call so you don&#39;t miss out.",

"reviewcomment":"Visited on a Sunday afternoon. It was packed. &#34;New Harlem&#34; type of crowd.  <br><br>The weather was pretty warm outside, so I got the iced tea. Yum. It was a lemony, red colored tea. Perfectly sweetened. Next time I&#39;ll have to choose my favorite sweetener, honey. <br><br>I grabbed a seat at the long table by the window. Ended up staying for about 1.5 hrs to get some work done on my laptop. Chatted up with some folks at my table. Friendly crowd. <br><br>My iced tea came in a long glass chute personally delivered to me by a waiter. Payment is made at the end, not when you order. I was expecting my bill to come to $7. Nope. My yummy iced tea was only $3.50. Pleasantly surprised. Had to tip.  <br><br>What could improve the experience:<br>-Get a menu board instead of the weird pamphlet thing with the menu <br>-Collect payment at the register. Makes things easier. Less formal. <br>-Maybe display your Balthazar goodies on the counter so people remember to order some. Yum!<br>-I found out about this place on Yelp. From the street, it&#39;s kind of hard to tell that there&#39;s an awesome tea place inside. Find some sensible way to draw attention to your storefront. <br>-Simplify your wifi info. <br><br>New fave tea/coffee place in the nabe.",

The woman behind the counter carried on a soft conversation with a tired businessman while two young ladies that looked like they could have just stepped out of Ginza giggled over a story. Retro Japanese tunes played softly.<br><br>Having been to Tokyo a few times, I can safely say this is the closest feeling I have ever experienced in NYC to being abroad in Japan. Beautiful decor, surprisingly authentic and traditional food (Umeboshi!!) and really excellent coffee. <br><br>Sit back, order some siphon coffee (They have two varieties) and maybe a Katsu sandwich, and watch as they prepare your drink from a really stunning set of gold siphons. I think this is where the old Rai Rai Ken used to be and, now outfitted with cool Japanese screen doors and cherry blossom branches, I can safely say this is a pretty awesome next step.<br><br>I almost didn&#39;t want to review this place because it is so chill and so small and I am worried it will be overwhelmed in the coming warmer months.

"reviewcomment":"Since my first time at Jahlookova, I&#39;ve been back more times than I can count. Everyone is so welcoming and you really get the sense of community in here. <br><br>My visit today was what really prompted me to update my review. I&#39;ve had a stressful day and just really needed to awaken my body with a fresh juice and didn&#39;t feel like dealing with the hassle of it at my apartment. This time I ordered a green juice (can&#39;t remember what it was called) that had apples, lemons, ginger, kale, cucumbers, cilantro and parsley. I asked to hold the cilantro and replace it with extra ginger. Substitutions are never an issue in here. I grabbed my juice and decided to get a veggie patty. The total was around $11 (the patty is $2.75 and the large juice is $7), but I digress. Let me tell you about this patty. My god, it was heavenly! Just when I thought I came here way too much, they&#39;re gonna see a whole lot more of me. Next time I&#39;m here, I&#39;m buying all the veggie patties they have. It was loaded with vegetables in a green sauce. The sauce was just the right amount of spice without overbearing the flavor of the vegetables. Definitely a keeper!<br><br>Side note: I do have to say, I avoid the prepackaged juices. I&#39;ve tried 3 of them and didn&#39;t like any. I don&#39;t know if I&#39;m just used to Blueprint or Suja when it comes to bottled juice or if these were just poorly executed. <br><br>Last time I was here I picked up some lipgloss and I&#39;ve never had my chapped lips heal faster! They sell flavored sticks, incense, oils, and other natural items. I just saw tonight that they have alkaline water for a suggested donation of $2/gallon. Definitely beats making your own!<br><br>Until next time, Jahlookova...",

Seriously, I loved everything we tried - I don&#39;t think I could even pick out a favorite! For Italian food lovers (or just food lovers period), this is a must. I don&#39;t get to go to New York all that often, so the opportunity to try so much good food in one fell swoop was seriously appreciated. <br><br>Our tour guide was great. I particularly enjoyed all the history of the neighborhood, especially since it provided nice breaks in between all the eating. The tour group itself was just a whole lot of fun - everyone was chatty and happy and the energy was buzzing. <br><br>Though I know other food restrictions would get tricky for them, it was definitely vegetarian friendly. There was only one meat item on the tour, and while I would have still been content just skipping it, the tour guide was kind enough to provide an alternative, which in this case were some of the sweetest sundried tomatoes I&#39;ve tried. They definitely went above and beyond there, and hey, I loved having my own personal tasting.<br><br>The portions were perfect - it was enough to get a good sense of everything and leave feeling satisfied, if not bordering on stuffed. Overall, it made for a wonderful afternoon and I would love to try one of their other tours next time I&#39;m in New York.",

Also labeled by name along with tidbits of information such as prefectures as well as acidity levels. <br><br>The real bonus is that the store clerk which I&#39;m also assuming is the owner is VERY knowledgeable in his craft.

"reviewcomment":"The gem of all gems in the East Village. Russo&#39;s is not a restaurant, but an Italian market specializing in two things: homemade pasta and cheese. WIN.<br><br>Walking into Russo&#39;s felt like I was back in Italy. Established in 1894, Russo&#39;s is the real deal and the closest to authentic Italian you are gonna get in NY. It&#39;s a tiny place right next to Venieros on 1st and 11th, with a few large refrigerators housing lots of cheese, and fresh pasta. They have an entire fridge devoted to fresh ravioli with fillings including sausage, goat cheese, spinach, mushroom, butternut squash, lobster and pumpkin. They have a large variety of different pastas, gnocchi, and even whole wheat options. <br><br>Russo&#39;s also has imported olive oils, marinated olives, as well as pepperoni, sausage and anchovies behind the counter. And just like authentic markets in Italy, they have a small menu of sandwiches. The Italiano or Caprese are a crowd favorite.<br><br>For my first Russo&#39;s trip, I bought fresh pasta (only used half of it tonight), a 1/4 pound of ricotta, and 1/4 pound of their house blend of grated cheese made with parmesan, asiago and pecorino. All for $9. I made an arugula-basil pesto for dinner with their pasta, and topped it with pine nuts, fresh arugula and dollops of their ricotta cheese, which was so fresh, flavorful and outrageously delicious. Ricotta takes any pasta dish to the next level.<br><br>Next trip I&#39;m trying their ravioli and bufala mozzarella. While I usually go to Eataly for fresh pasta and cheeses, Russo&#39;s is my new go-to. It is even more authentic, feels Italy, and is half the price.",

"reviewcomment":"I can&#39;t say enough good things about this place. The food is delicious and fresh. The prices are unbelievable, given the quality and size. I usually get the #3 large combo sub with the marinated mushrooms- SO GOOD. Their sausage bread and cinnamon bread are also pretty great. I often pick up a loaf of one (or both, since they&#39;re so cheap- $2/whole cinnamon bread loaf or whole sausage bread loaf for $4) to bring to friends in central NJ when I visit. The shop is very small and doesn&#39;t have an eat-in section. Around lunch time, this can be very busy. The couple that owns this place is incredibly sweet, and it&#39;s always nice to see them when I stop in for a sandwich. The mozzarella here is very good as well. Just remember- cash only, and it closes early- around 3PM, so you have to get here early. I used to live around the corner from here, so it was an easy trip I&#39;d make at least twice a week. Now that I live closer to Monmouth Deli.....I still find myself stuck on Second Street Bakery.<br><br>Also- something I noticed under the Yelp filtered reviews- a lot that I read under the filtered section that had been removed, actually seemed like legitimate reviews. This place is just that great. I&#39;d probably create a Yelp account just to review and recommend this place.",

Had  the duck prosciutto and pastrami - both excellent with a nod to the prosciutto if both are available the day you visit. The kielbasi was great, so much better than the supermarket if not quite up to the garlic level my all time favorite the long lost Kurowycky. Also enjoyed the double bacon which was meaty and more attractive on the plate than in the store. Twenty cevapi to a package would proably feed four for dinner for quite a reasonable price.

"reviewcomment":"Amazing.  I LOVE chocolate (fine, all sweets, but esp. chocolate).  In a city filled with so many delicious options from chocolatiers and chocolate confectioners local and otherwise, this is easily one of my top picks for gift giving.  The NAMA chocolates are incredibly unique and unlike any other chocolate I&#39;ve ever had before.  When I first read about them I was intrigued - so many great reviews and yet I had never heard of them (what?!)..  So obviously the next day I went to the store to check it out.  After trying the samples, I purchased 3 boxes.  A few days later I was back to buy 2 more boxes.  I simply had to share this new finding with my family and closest chocolate loving friends!  Needless to say, they were hooked, too.  I think I probably purchased around 8-10 boxes within a month of first discovering them.<br><br>So what are they?  Well, if you love that creamy, melt-in-your mouth feeling - these are a must.  They&#39;re semi-soft chocolate squares that have to be kept refrigerated. Imagine a cream/fudge/icecream/chocolate orgy.  That&#39;s what NAMA chocolates remind me of.  They do have a &#34;dark chocolate&#34; one but it&#39;s still rather creamy and not so bitter.  Of course, you can ask for a sample and decide for yourself!  The white and matcha ones are yummy, too, but (for me) not as delicious as the milk varieties.  **PAY ATTENTION TO THE EXPIRATION DATE ON THE BACK**.  In my opinion, they taste exponentially better when they are fresher - so plan accordingly to buy AND consume within a few days.  Also - look before you buy and buy the ones with the expiration date that is furthest.  <br><br>Service?  Wonderful.  Every time I have been there the employees have been incredibly sweet (no pun intended) and very happy to help and give out samples.  The packaging is very neat/clean and they will give you an icepack or two depending on the temperature outside and how long it will be before you can get them to a refrigerator.  Plus, free giftwrap upon request!<br><br>I can&#39;t say much as to their other treats.  The chocolate covered potato chips were surprisingly yummy, but I really think the NAMA chocolates steal the show.  I haven&#39;t tried their other chocolate items - I mean, when that money can go towards another box of NAMA chocolates...",

I made it with a home made marinara the other day and let the pasta finish cooking in a little but of sauce and it really soaked up the sauce. It cooked to a beautiful consistency and you can really tell the difference between fresh pasta and the kind in the box.  <br><br>I love this place!",

I have bought three different cuts of steak, whole chickens, and lamb, all of it was consistently amazing. <br>This place is not cheap. <br>That being said, I feel like it is worth it because a). they really take the time to help you learn how to cook what you are buying so that you get the best experience out of your purchase and b). you know you are getting intelligently sourced, high quality meats. <br>I can&#39;t say enough about the service here. I missed my old butchers (Holland Court Meat Market) in Carnagie Hill whom I adored. I have found that some of the other butchers in the Cobble Hill neighborhood sometimes didn&#39;t seem to care much about the customer. These guys, however, go out of there way to provide great service. They get it. <br>This is why a lazy punk like me is taking the time to write this. <br>I want them to succeed. Give them a shot.

"reviewcomment":"Old School Italian Butcher Shop<br>Delicious Homemade Chili<br><br>Take a trip back in time, and visit Italy when you&#39;re on the Upper East Side.  Walking down the street one fine afternoon, I couldn&#39;t help but notice a &#34;Delicious Homemade Chili&#34; sign, which tugged at my taste buds. With high hopes, i decided to venture in and grab a bowl. Two chicken fingers, one container of chili, and a mixed green salad later, I found myself sitting on their bench watching people walk by. <br><br>The chili was DELICIOUS!! Not too thick - hearty. The roasted red peppers balanced out the flavor perfectly. Their chicken strips, are entirely too addicting. Thin and long, the strips have a nice consistency. They are fairly thick and have a crunchy texture, with just the right amount of saltiness. If you like chicken strips, this could become a regular addiction. The green salad was decent, thankfully it did not have iceberg lettuce.<br><br>The food here is served cold, and available for pick up / delivery. If you ask nicely, the guys will gladly heat up your soup, and there is a bench outside. As this is a butcher shop there is no seating, their drink selections are limited.  I had visited Ottomanelli many years ago, and was glad to re-discover it again. <br><br>Great job guys!! <br>Thank you for being so sweet - I&#39;ll definitely be back.<br><br>The Scene: Traditional, Italian<br>Destination Rating: 5<br>Date Rating: N/A   (Perfect for ordering in)<br>Hob Nob Potential: 4<br><br>Strong Suggestion: Try the chili - it&#39;s delicious!",

I have a slight froyo addiction and always had trouble finding a spot in Park Slope to fulfill my weekly frozen guilty pleasure. I was so happy that I stared in disbelief for a few minutes until I came to the realization that no, I was not dreaming. My wishes had come true! A froyo spot right down the block from my boyfriends house. Perfect!<br>The owner, Jack, is always smiling and seems to be on a first-name basis with all his customers. We sit up at the front and just talk with him sometimes because he&#39;s such a friendly guy. There&#39;s a nice selection of froyo and toppings to go with it. We never leave feeling less than satisfied. Lots of shining stars and thumbs up for this place!!",

"reviewcomment":"I&#39;ve made it my mission to explore all of the &#39;legit&#39; coffee shops in town, and Everyman is about as good as it gets. The baristas are coffee masterminds, but in an unassuming way.  There&#39;s nothing that irks me more than smug baristas who make me feel like I should be honored they&#39;ve come down from their coffee pedestal among the gods to make my cortado. At Everyman they can nerd out about coffee as well as anyone, but they can also listen to me complain about the stress of picking our cabinets for my apartment remodel (read: privileged people problems), which I appreciate.  And from listening to some of the idiotic things that I hear people say or ask for (while stationed at the community table with my coffee and mac), they should get a medal for staying cool.<br><br>They also have cool combos you can order - last week I got a cortado with a shot of espresso on the side for 5$. Pretty sweet (not actually sweet, but... you get it).  I&#39;ve never succumbed to the sweet treats, but when my remodel really gets out of control and my stress level skyrockets beyond the need for espresso, I&#39;ll update and letcha know.<br><br>Well done Everyman.",

The nut cookies, they told me, were also among the most popular.  So, I loaded up on these and headed out to see my peeps.<br><br>At the last stop of the day, my customer offered to let me try some of the treats in the box.  So, I took a sliver of the brownie.  And then another... and another.  So much for a sliver, but these slutty brownies are amazing... chocolate chip, oreo, and brownie layers of amazingness.  No, really, if you are anywhere near Staten Island, putt down your phone, tablet, laptop and head to the Cookie Jar and get all slutty!<br><br>And if you&#39;re far away, they deliver. They were filling an order when I walked in and they let me know they ship anywhere.  I needed to send a gift, so I ordered online last night.  The next afternoon, to what did my wondering eyes did appear?  The box of cookies sitting on a counter in Boston!!  It&#39;s like they were teleported, it was so fast!   My friends were sending me texts all afternoon how much they loved them.  I got similar messages from my customers.  <br><br>If you&#39;ve got a cookie craving, check out the Cookie Jar.  You will not be disappointed.  As for me, they will be my go-to delivery treats.  Unfortunately, I cannot go there for business anymore since they don&#39;t take American Express.  Oh well, I can always get a few for myself on my way to another bakery!",

You might not be observant enough to pick up on all the little clues, but I read some Encyclopedia Brown books as a kid, and I saw them all: <br><br>The huge bin of jalapeños off to the side. <br>The bunch of fresh cilantro slung over the counter. <br>The menu of Mexican food. <br>The glowing Yelp reviews about their excellent Mexican food. <br><br>I&#39;m not sure what, but something told me I would enjoy their tacos. And I do. I also love their carnitas torta. Piled high with juicy pork, it was a very, very good sandwich on its own. With a ladleful of the homemade hot sauce they keep behind the counter? It was perfection. <br><br>Oh, and perfection in the South Slope costs only $7, with a bottle of Poland Spring.",

Being a very amateur wine somalier like myself (2 Buck Chuck - what what!), the staff threw me no shade for my limited knowledge on wine. They were super helpful in helping me narrow down my choices and gave me great recommendations based on the flavors I liked. Speaking of that, if you&#39;re a frequent shopper or live in the neighborhood, they can put you in their database to keep a record of your previous purchases to help guide you on what to pick on your next visit. <br><br>Their later opening hours are great for picking up a bottle to take home after you&#39;ve already had 2-3 glasses from your after work event - not that I know from personal experience or anything...",

"reviewcomment":"This place never ceases to blow my mind.<br><br>They have a fantastic selection of craft beers. You can mix and match individual bottles to take home, or get a draft beer to sit and enjoy. The staff is EXTREMELY knowledgeable and more than willing to help you pick something out.<br><br>But perhaps most importantly, every fall they tap a keg of Southern Tier Pumking, at which point I make a mad dash to go in and get my growler filled (for $20 which is totally reasonable because I got the same fill at Beer Culture for $28!). For anyone who hasn&#39;t tried Pumking, it is hands down the best pumpkin ale out there, which I can confidently say after conducting a side-by-side tasting of 27 different pumpkin beers. There&#39;s no way to know when it&#39;ll get tapped except to follow their website or social media, but totally worth it.<br><br>Not sure how my review turned into a self-righteous sermon about pumpkin beer, but the moral of the story is that if you love beer (of any sort), then you&#39;re bound to love this place.",

"reviewcomment":"I had been dreaming about trying this falafel so I couldn&#39;t wait for lunch time to come around.  To my chagrin I had to wait in a 25 person line.  But it moved pretty quickly and within about 15 min I was placing my order.  <br><br>Here&#39;s the lowdown:<br>-Falafel Sandwich (green falafel + hummus + Israeli salad + green cabbage + tahini sauce + everything (S&#39;rug traditional Yemeni hot sauce with cilantro, chili, garlic and olive oil, amba picked mango chutney &amp; pickles Israeli style): maybe I was just hungry out of my mind but this falafel was one of the best I have ever had.  The whole wheat pita was so soft and yummy and held the falafel sandwich together very well AND never got soggy.  The falafel was so fresh and was the right type of spicy.  The sauces are at the very top and as you keep going through the falafel sandwich you leave most of the sauces and head into the hummus portion which is not as creamy as most--which I loved.  It mixed so well and didn&#39;t overpower anything.  The sandwich was also extremely filling.  <br><br>-Date-Lime-Banana Smoothie (3 Dates, 1 Banana,  1/2 cup soy milk and 1 freshly squeezed lime): Just like everyone said, it tasted just like a banana smoothie.  But in my experience with smoothies that have bananas in them, they all taste like that.  I did like the chunks of dates that would come up through my straw from time to time but it wasn&#39;t something I&#39;d ever order again.<br><br>FINAL VERDICT: I&#39;ll be looking out for this truck more often as the wait is worth it :)",

If you&#39;re willing to spend a couple minutes extra to get a FRESH cup of coffee then mod cup is a must.  The owners, Justin and Travis, roast the beans themselves a few blocks away and even directly trade with farms to ensure the freshest of coffee. Before drinking Mod Cup, I was a huge fan of Dunkin Donuts. They may have made me a coffee snob now, but once you&#39;ve had good coffee it&#39;s hard to go back. Definitely worth a try.

Go get some doughnuts, and then go back, and GET MORE!<br><br>Located in a small shop in Brooklyn, this bakery is one of the best for doughnuts!  I first have to say they only have yeast doughnuts here, so I&#39;m sorry to all you cake doughnut fans!  However, I would want all cake doughnut fans to have an open mind and try a yeast doughnut from here.  <br><br>They are pricy (a little over $2 each) but the doughnuts are a good size and I feel the price is justified.  Dough has your classics, such as glazed and chocolate but what got me here were their unique flavors.  Yes, they have flavors such as toasted coconut and cinnamon sugar, which are not too out of the box (and yes, they are good too, the flavors are not too overwhelming on these).  <br><br>Some of the interesting flavors I&#39;ve tried include: (some I have not seen every time I went, I am honestly not sure if they rotate them or the doughnuts were just temporary, and unfortunately, I could not remember all of the unique ones I&#39;ve tried, so sorry!)<br><br>Thai Chili - Sweet, with a little spicy kick too it.  It took me a bite to get into it since the slight spice caught me off guard.   My taste buds adjusted well to it but I would say not to eat it if you are truly looking to satisfy a sweet tooth.<br><br>Hibiscus - This doughnut has some type of sweet citrus tart flavor to it.  Very tasty.  If you ever have had Hibiscus tea and like it, then try this!<br><br>Cheesecake with Graham Cracker - Self-explanatory, I love cheesecake, I love graham crackers and thus, I love this combination and it is done very well!! Cannot go wrong!<br><br>Blood Orange - This doughnut utilizes their typical doughnut and the blood orange taste is through the icing they mix together and put on top.  The flavor did not diminish in the icing, and there is even a small piece of an orange (sweetened) on it!<br><br>Caf Au Lait - Has a taste of pecan with the crumbles on top and a coffee-like icing.  <br><br>Passion Fruit - A very nice sweet and tarty taste with some cocoa nibbs on top to enjoy!<br><br>Dulce De Leche topped with Almonds - This is one of my personal favorites.  The milky taste wins me over and the combination of almonds along with it wins me over every time!<br><br>Chocolate and Salted Caramel - Sweet and salty you ask?  Well if you like salted caramel ice cream, then what are you waiting for... get THIS!  I feel the saltiness is not overdone here and just right.<br><br>I would always get a bunch of doughnuts to bring home and will always regret it, because my family destroys them all before I can get to them again!  But I would always make sure to cut a small piece to taste each doughnut... <br><br>Because I feel they are.. that.. damn.. good. <br><br>However, do not let me sway you, please try them for yourselves.  I am always intrigued by how cake-doughnut lovers would feel about this place!<br><br>P.S.  This place is CASH ONLY, so bring them bills!",

"reviewcomment":"Great experience, the wine tastings here are a must try.<br><br>You must know going in, that they specialize in Old World wine, you won&#39;t see many California&#39;s here. They have a limited selection, but they have a relationship with each vineyard they carry and import the wines themselves. They are extremely knowledgable and have no problem assisting anyone from an expert, to a newbie. <br><br>And now the most important part, their tastings. You can sign up to be notified when they will be having their next tasting, which is not just a few bottles of wine by the register. They have an entire upstairs dedicated to these evenings, and they taste around 6 wines each time. You can drink glass after glass while listening to the owners tell stories of each of the winemakers, from high level wine lingo, to what was paired for lunch with each wine on his last visit. A great experience, and entirely free, no pressure to buy... although you&#39;ll want to continue to support such a well run business.",

"reviewcomment":"High quality coffee bars have been scarce in midtown - but thanks to the arrival of Melbourne-influenced Aussie coffee Blue Stone Lane. As a fan of Sightglass Roasters in SF, I was excited to find its fine presence in NYC in Midtown East. <br><br>Nested downstairs of an office building, Bluestone Lane&#39;s authentic Aussie coffee drinks and well thought-out decorations bring a refreshing breeze that a coffee break deserves. Be prepared to immerse yourself in Aussie culture and order in Aussie ways (Flatwhite, Piccolo, Long Black) from good-looking baristas in light-blue shirts and dark-blue apron. You will leave with a desire to come back for an authentic coffee experience more than the caffeine itself. <br><br>You can&#39;t go wrong with a soy flatwhite (or almond milk latte) and avocado smash. <br><br>Even if you are not there for coffee, try a Chai Latte, B-Green cold-pressed juice, some Balthazar bakery, or hand-crafted vegemite toast.  I did not previously associate café with good juice, but Blue Stone Lane&#39;s B-Green juice does it right.",

"reviewcomment":"This place is an absolute gem! My friend and I had to try this place after seeing that they&#39;re known for thee BEST iced coffee in NYC. <br><br>We came here and were greeted by Joe, an incredibly welcoming kind soul. Get the iced coffee.  We were coffee noobs so Joe offered us a sample and we were hooked! I ordered the vanilla iced coffee which was perfect. Surprisingly not too sweet and just the right amount of everything. My friend got the hazelnut iced coffee which was also delicious. Their iced coffee really is the best! The proof is also in the newspapers displayed on the walls.<br><br>But what makes this quaint little cafe so charming are the workers. It was so nice to hear Joe&#39;s stories--from growing up in Italy to starting his business. Caffe Capri has such a wonderful neighborhood feel that&#39;s so rare in bustling cities. I&#39;m definitely coming back on my next visit :)",

"reviewcomment":"There&#39;s a reason why Nasto&#39;s has been in business for more than 70 years.  Everyone who&#39;s grown up in the Ironbound knows this is a local hidden gem.  There&#39;s no place in Northern Jersey that serves better old school homemade ice cream than Nasto&#39;s!<br><br>Service is very friendly and quick.  And the best part, prices are awesome! For a couple of bucks, you can get a pretty good amount of your favorite thick, creamy, rich, buttery, homemade, high quality ice cream!<br><br>There are tons of different flavors to choose from.  I&#39;ve tried several flavors and everything is simply amazing. My favorite though has to be the chocolate peanut butter.  So much goodness in each and every scoop.  The chocolate is perfect, not too sweet, but rich and creamy in content.  The same goes for the peanut butter: you can taste the rich natural goodness of the peanut butter. Together, it is perfection.  Sure, you can buy good ice cream elsewhere, but I guarantee you won&#39;t find ice cream as smooth, rich and creamy as this one.  And if you don&#39;t know what to choose from, they can give you samples of flavors to try.  And now, you can buy a gallon of your favorite ice cream to take home with you! <br><br>They also have a wide array of Italian deserts to choose from: sorbets, tartufos, tortonis, cannolis, tiramisu, and gelato.   They also have the best ice cream cake ever!  Yes, getting an ice cream cake from Nasto&#39;s was always a staple for anyone who grew up in the ironbound.<br><br>Hands down, Nasto&#39;s has the best ice cream in Northern New Jersey,",

"reviewcomment":"Table Wine has been in the neighborhood for four years now. It is great that Jackson Heights can support a small, characterful store like this. They have kept true to their original model; they only carry good wine, they have bottles for all budgets, they have regular tastings, and everything is from small producers. They seem to do this because they love wine not simply to make money. The staff are all knowledgeable without being intimidating, and the hand written labels on every bottle are always spot on. If it says &#34;bacon&#34; or &#34;green pepper&#34; then, amazingly, that is exactly what you will taste. They carry organic wines, Long Island wines, a great selection of rosé wine in the summer. They will also speed chill a bottle of white for you. <br><br>The layout of the store is really clever and helpful. The wine isn&#39;t piled up by region or price but is arranged in racks by taste. So they start off at the door with whites and reds that are crisp and flinty and light and as you go down the wall the wines get gradually richer, heavier and more complex. Brilliant idea! They also have a central table for wines that are under around 12 bucks, another section for New York State wines, another for for more prices wines at 20 bucks plus, and a sparkly section. Finally, on the back wall, they have an amazing selection of spirits. They have a particularly wonderful Irish single malt, Tyrconnell, which I highly recommend. <br><br>The only slight quibble is that because they get wines from small producers something that becomes a favorite can disappear. But that seems to reinforce the nature of wine as a living thing, something that is seasonal and local, rather than something that is produced a gigantic industrial pipeline, which is the impression that I get in your average wine store stacked with boxes of the same anonymous brands. Table Wine&#39;s racks store most of the bottles horizontally, apart from the ones on display at the top. Going past after they have closed I have seen them lying these bottles on their sides. Talk about dedication, but it means that I have never had a bottle from them whose cork was difficult to remove. Another store that flies in the face of commercial anonymity.",

"reviewcomment":"Came here on a rainy day looking for a cup of coffee. What I found here instead wasn&#39;t the normal kinds of coffee, but rather an interesting menu of Hispanic influenced drinks. Their beans are from Stumptown, but unfortunately it seems like they&#39;ve stopped selling the beans because of lack of demand.  <br><br>I chose to go with what looked like their best seller, the café con leche. The café con leche is much more than the Spanish translation, coffee with milk. It&#39;s creamy and foamy with a pinch of butter and salt, which makes it sound kind of gross, but it&#39;s actually quite wonderful! I had a sip of my friend&#39;s Cuban espresso, and it was also really good. The consistency of the drink was creamy and it had a sweet, smoky taste. <br><br>They serve you at a window, but there&#39;s seating inside and outside. I will definitely be coming back to try the other drinks on the menu.",

"reviewcomment":"It&#39;s hard to make a grab-and-go lunch seem like anything more than a transaction, but somehow the incredibly friendly folks at GoGo Grill make it so. <br><br>Despite the raves of a former colleague, I waited for months before trying this cart parked outside of my office most weekdays. My excuses are in hindsight ridiculous - the cart was too small, I&#39;d heard they served hamburgers on English muffins. I really don&#39;t understand English muffins. <br><br>On New Year&#39;s Eve, I front ran a resolution and tried GoGo. The wind was howling off the Hudson, turning my exposed fingers an unhealthy shade of pink after less than a minute. How these people could prepare soup or bread or anything else in this weather is a feat practically superhuman. <br><br>Then there&#39;s the food. In the month since my first visit, I&#39;ve mostly had falafel, and it is exceptional. Although not quite the same thing you would get in a Arab restaurant - the mashed chicken peas are quite rough and much more lightly fried than that - the taste is standout. <br><br>The stand is incredibly flexible in how you take your lunch. There&#39;s no boxing into certain combos or serving things in expensive packages. The falafel can come with a salad, in bread or even as a side with yogurt and hummus. This is how I&#39;ve come to get it, a side with an extra two balls. This costs $4 seems almost criminally cheap.<br><br>One time I the falafel with the soup of the day, a squash soup that is served quite frequently. It was clearly freshly made, with the sharp tang of the vegetable. It was, however, vegan, and I missed the hint of cream that would have been there if animal products were a loud. <br><br>No matter, I&#39;ll be with this cart as the specials and seasons change, enjoying lunch each time.",

Debating a wine to pair with something tomato-y, I&#39;m told that I could probably pass on the $14 bottle I&#39;m considering and go with a $9 one they strongly recommend.

I&#39;ve never found a place that can so consistently sell me exactly what I&#39;m looking for (or didn&#39;t know what I was looking for, because I&#39;m a wine idiot) while actually selling it to me at the price I said I could afford.<br><br>Affordable wine treated like fancy-pants wine, whoa.

Sure, it&#39;s a little expensive, but that much is expected for a higher quality of food. <br><br>On top of that, the folks who run the place couldn&#39;t be nicer. Like a huge dumbass that I am, I leave my laundry bag there all the time. They think it&#39;s funny, but it&#39;s always there. They laugh at me, like they&#39;re in on the joke. I half expect them to play a prank on me. <br><br>But, I digress. <br><br>This place is the best grocery store on Graham Avenue. Hands down. They&#39;ve got a great beer selection, a great cheese selection and great fresh vegetables. Plus, they don&#39;t have shit brands. All of it&#39;s pretty good quality. <br><br>Frankly, I don&#39;t know what&#39;s not to love.",

"reviewcomment":"Oh spekuloos, where have you been all my life?! This stuff is like crack I swear! I had seen Wafels &amp; Dinges featured on an episode of Bobby Flay&#39;s Throwdown and they beat him so when I saw the truck while in East Village one day, I had to see what the hype was about... best.decision.ever. I of course ordered the throwdown wafel which consisted of the liege wafel, spekuloos, and whipped cream- that&#39;s it! Very simple in comparison to some of the other combos, but man oh man this is all you need! <br><br>I was so confused by the spekuloos since I had never had it before. Is it peanut butter, is it caramel spread? What are you, you beautiful mouthgasming creature?! I eventually found out it was gingerbread spread and my world was forever changed. I will never go back to nutella again! They sell jars of spekuloos at the trucks and you can also buy them at their brick and mortar cafe. If you can&#39;t get it there, the Biscoff brand of spekuloos is in almost all grocery stores now, but for some reason I think the Wafels &amp; Dinges brand is better even though no one else I know can taste a difference.<br><br>Word on the street is they have spekuloos ice cream now too...

A quick Google search brought us to the NYC Trees website, where for a very reasonable $109, we got a 6 foot tree, next day delivery, installation, and stand...ALL INCLUSIVE!<br><br>In addition to our tree looking way more beautiful than any of those 2nd rate sidewalk ones, we felt good knowing that our tree was a sustainable one that was sourced from regional farms. The quality is top notch too - the tree looks very healthy, with &#34;full&#34; branches and very minimal needle shedding.<br><br>One of the co-founder brothers himself (Lou) came to deliver and set up our tree and he was super friendly, offering to help move around things to place the tree and trimming the branches so our tree looked perfect. He even watered the tree and gave me tips on how to take care of it - now that&#39;s what I call excellent service!<br><br>If you want your own hassle-free NYC Christmas tree experience, look no further than NYC Trees!",

They have store-made items I really like such as their various versions of bratwurst (large, small and breakfasty).  <br><br>I also find their potato salad to be very good. Some of their other salads I&#39;m only okay with.<br><br>So why do they get five stars from me? They&#39;re the only pork store in the area that&#39;s open on Sundays! They have rescued many a last-minute barbecue.<br><br>Also, they have the most extensive selection of pre-packaged German goods in the neighborhood (cookies, bread, soda, candy, jars of condiments, etc., etc., etc.).<br><br>And finally, the Zum Stammtisch Pork Store is in glorious GLENDALE! (not Middle Village, not Ridgewood, not Forest Hills, not Woodhaven, not Flushing fer cryin&#39; out loud!)

"reviewcomment":"Kensington and Prospect Park South have a major DEFICIT. It&#39;s impossible to find a decent fucking sandwich that elevates beyond the common deli faire. ENTER: Brancaccio&#39;s. With some freaking amazing quality sandwiches. Good bread, great meats, and quickly made.<br>There&#39;s a somewhat daunting list of options when you first walk in....but seriously, every sandwich is pretty awesome. The Tuna with Prosciutto is great, so is the Egg Ham, Cheese and Tomato on Ciabatta. And don&#39;t forget to pick up one of their Prosciutto Bread loafs.<br><br>Seriously, this place is a breath of fresh air, with some amazing food and a fun atmosphere, go grab a sandwich. Important fact though: There&#39;s no seating here, so head to the park to chow down!",

The welcoming venue was perfect for what we were looking for, and I was impressed with the entire staff at the Astor Center Gallery Space, Fatima, Josh, Allison, but most of all Ross. <br><br>Ross went above and beyond to help make sure that our event went off without a hitch. He fielded my random questions leading up to the event, advised me of what I needed to consider, provided contacts for preferred vendors and all without ever making me feel like a pest. <br><br>On the day of the event he not only worked with me, but with all my friends who arrived early to set up. He was patient and kind, and he was fun. He makes it seem so easy. He showed us how to work the awesome AV equipment, he and Allison showed us where we could find the platters &amp; dishes (included in rental fee btw) and they let us create the exact vibe that we wanted for our family and friends.<br><br>So if you&#39;re considering the space for a wedding or event, I would highly recommend it!!",

I&#39;ve been here  another time since writing the draft of this review, and both times staff were extremely helpful and friendly. Recommendations include green tea with almond milk + okinawa syrup (Japanese mineral that provides a sweet, healthier alternative to sugar, not to mention so delectable I ordered it both times), as well as black tea with caramel flavor. <br><br>Two words: souffle cheesecake... can almost guarantee it will go perfectly with any tea that you order :)<br><br>You might be confused by the 4 types of tea or overwhelmed by all the possible combinations of syrup and flavor, but whatever you choose, will most likely be awesome. Don&#39;t be afraid to ask for suggestions, the staff is more than happy to help.",

We came here after stopping by Pies and Thighs and being told they weren&#39;t doing any more seatings, so we checked in with the staff here and were told we could bring our food here. Besides being totally chill dudes and making great juices- they had great surf videos and music playing in the background. PLUS- apparently one of the co-owners also heads up Clinton Street Bakery in the LES so you can pick up some yummy pastries here and forfeit the line there.  <br><br>Thanks guys!",

"reviewcomment":"Made the trek out to Sunset Park w/ my boyfriend to try out this little cafe on 5th Avenue. The owner/server/chef was very charming and kind- and his food was equally amazing. We tried the lentil soup (probably one of the best I&#39;ve ever had), the turkish coban (pronounced shoh-bahn) salad, and the mixed platter for apps and entrees. The platter could&#39;ve had a bit more meat in there but when paired w/ the salad it was just enough to fill our stomachs and leave room for the plat de resistance: the almond pudding! E and I paired it with cups of traditional turkish tea and we fought each other for the last bite (the only time I&#39;ve ever seen my bf fight me over dessert). All in all, the meal cost around $37 for both of us including tax and tip. Sooo good.<br><br>Extra star earned for playing Anggun&#39;s Snow on the Sahara. Yesss.",

I tried a pickle from each &#34;picklelized?&#34; barrel. Obviously, I&#39;m a pickle lover like my main man, Buckwheat... so I enjoyed the 3 month pickled pickle. The 3 day pickle tasted like a cucumber with a little dressing on it and the 3 week, well... let&#39;s just say I wasn&#39;t a fan.<br><br>My plan for when I come back to NY, you ask?

You get to choose some fruits/veggies, not limited to kale, pineapple, beets, ginger, and they juice it in front of you! If they accidentally make too much to fit into your cup, you get to quickly drink some before they fill your cup back up again. Very fun to watch, delicious (and kind of healthful) to drink.",

"reviewcomment":"Warning: I&#39;ve lived in Turkey, so this review is gonna get all sorts of pretentious up in here. Because despite the fact that it&#39;s &#34;Greek&#34; yogurt, Chobani has a Turkish founder and the people of Turkey know their yogurt. <br><br>Ok first off, this place is GORGEOUS. It&#39;s the perfect extension of the Chobani brand and emphasizes fresh and wholesome ingredients in every way. Their employees wear white coats while crafting your perfect bowl and are just the nicest people. Sorry I&#39;m a branding nerd and this place literally inspired me to write a blog post for work. <br><br>I&#39;m not going to go too much into their yogurt as everyone else already has. Just know the Toasted Coconut + Pineapple and Fig + Walnut are delish. <br><br>What got me most excited about this place is now they&#39;ve opened up a cafe section with simit sandwiches! Simit, aşkim, how I&#39;ve missed you like how one misses an annoying friend from a past life. <br><br>A little background on the simit: I guess it&#39;s like the Turkish equivalent of a bagel or pretzel that&#39;s sold on carts that old men push around. Many a mornings were started with simit and many a mornings I&#39;ve been disappointed by their rock hard horrible nature. <br><br>Anyways, I ordered the 1/2 Smoked Salmon + Herbed Labne sandwich, out of nostalgia more than anything, and the 1/2 Turkish Red Lentil soup. Thankfully I was very pleasantly surprised! The simit wasn&#39;t its typical rock hardness and was actually soft, a little fluffy, and pleasant to eat. You can&#39;t go wrong with smoked salmon! And the Red Lentil soup? Oh my goodness, that was some good soup. I&#39;m really glad to see Chobani embracing its Turkish roots and would love to see more food items on the menu that utilize yogurt because yogurt is literally eaten with everything in Turkey.<br><br>Chobani, aşkim, keep being wonderful in every way and I will keep coming in to get my snack or small meal fix in SoHo.",

"reviewcomment":"Back in college, a friend of mine used to make a homemade savory version with jalapeno, cheese, and sausage.  And, while I had never seen or heard of a kolache prior to my time as a co-ed, I quickly fell hard for these historically Czechoslovakian treats.  Suffice to say, it was &#34;love at first bite.&#34;<br>In paying tribute to the many Texas expats in my Mexican food Meetup group (<a href='/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.Meetup.com%2FManzana&amp;s=f3e03e79a551e2445e0380ffdc16ca839d0a9878090ceeeb45b399cf7bcdf1bf' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>Meetup.com/Manzana</a>), I decided to host July&#39;s monthly get-together at Brooklyn Kolache Co. <br>Flavors range from from the savory, such as bacon, egg, and cheese, to sweet, like lemon curd. <br>Of those that I sampled, my favorite kolache was, without a doubt, the pimento cheese.  Its warm and squishy exterior reminded me of a crazy cross-breed of a brioche bun and a potato roll.  With density.  This gave way to a creamy interior that was laced with cheddar cheese nibs and the slightest hint of spice.  Dynamite!<br>Although it&#39;s a bit of a hike from Manhattan, I would definitely consider Brooklyn Kolache Co. to be &#34;destination worthy.&#34;  As an added bonus, the venue boasts an intimate outdoor space for al-fresco dining.  NYC weather permitting, of course.  :)",

"reviewcomment":"I love these guys - Honey bakery is amazing! <br>It a small place and I&#39;m pretty sure Popov himself makes pretty much everything to order which means you can trust everything is fresh and made by the owner himself.  Last time I was there him and his wife made my order together which is sweet to watch - I feel like i&#39;m literally tasting the marriage of two palates &amp; food cultures - a badass mix of korean spices and uzbek/russian deep savory  flavors.<br><br>faves:<br>Spicy lamb steak sandwich -  tender lamb stuffed into amazing tandoori bread which soaks up all the broth and yet stays crispy. Ask for it spicy, its so so good.<br>Lamb Pilaf-  fragrant cumin smell, warm and sticky, rich, insanely addictive<br>Uigur Lagman - handmade noodles, tender lamb -  an insanely huge portion that we heat up as leftovers for days. peppery yet milder seasoning than the other lamb dishes.<br>Homemade raspberry lemonade with blueberry mint ice-cubes - mmmmmm the ice cubes slowly melt into your drink making every sip even tastier<br>chak-chak- I can see why they deliver this stuff wholesale across nyc, a great crispy yet sticky snack with a honey nutty flavor. nom nom nom. <br><br>Most of the food here tends to fall toward the wintry spectrum. My favorite things here are hearty have great depth. I get the idea this food is what I would dream of if i was lost in Siberia or traveling the steppes. But if you&#39;re looking for breezier fare there&#39;s still great coffee and all kinds of side salads and  freshly baked sweet and snacky things to try. <br><br>I usually order delivery but if you have a little time, go in person. On the weekends there&#39;s a sweet little thrift store across the street you can explore while you wait for your food, a cheap grocer with all kind of herbs and diverse produce just a few stores down, and you can always sit outside with a pastry and coffee and enjoy the weather.  As an uptowner, I&#39;m so happy these guys are in my neighborhood!",

Light, fluffy, flavorful unlike most gluten free bread products.   <br>I get so frustrated when we go somewhere that serves GF bread that is crumbly, tasteless, thick and nasty- I tell them about Everybody Eats. My husband and love Astoria&#39;s Sandwich Bar and sometimes he gets a GF one to so we can split our sandwiches. He loves Everybody Eats bread especially the baguette. This place is like no other gf bread. If you haven&#39;t tested it I urge you to run and get some! G-FreeNYC offers it as well as many other locations. I actually haven&#39;t tested the bagels or cookies but have heard all good things. I would love it if Brooklyn Coffee shops in Astoria carried there bagels so we could enjoy the coffee house. This company needs to be in all Astoria restaurants now days!! Wish more natural/health food shops in Astoria had it stocked- maybe someday soon!<br>If your a restaurant owner this is a must have product line- have it stocked! Gf/CD is not going anywhere. The demand for gf product is not to have just anything it&#39;s to have the highest quality gf product as possible. If you have not had Everybody Eats you have to get some today!<br><br>Tips: If you just got diagnosed as CD or need to live a GF lifestyle you will love this company!",

"reviewcomment":"I can&#39;t say enough good things about this place, both as a cafe and bike shop. I&#39;ve been in several times for bike-related things. First, as a super plus size woman, I was having trouble popping spokes on my new bike&#39;s back wheel. Brian, who I think is the owner, recommended a new wheel to me and explained why patiently and in detail. It turned out to be a great investment. I&#39;ve been back with other minor issues, for a tune up and for various accessories. Their prices are great as well as the quality of service - both technically and in terms of customer service. All of the technicians have been super friendly and helpful. I&#39;ve never gotten the sense that they do anything but the best job.<br>Turns out, the cafe is great, too! They make a great latte and all of the handful of baristas that have served me have been friendly. They also carry yummy baked goods, I think from Blue Sky bakery? Delicious fruit bars and what not. <br>Its got a fantastic neighborhood feel, especially on the weekend when Brian&#39;s wife (I think?) is around. She&#39;s super friendly and is fun to chat with. I always feel great spending money to support this business.",

There&#39;s plenty of space in the back of the cafe for quiet studying or reading (bring your laptops/tablets - they have free wifi). In the front of the cafe, there&#39;s a space where no laptops are allowed (sweet!). It&#39;s great for quiet conversation or reading. <br><br>The baristas are really friendly and approachable, unlikely some other Brooklyn coffee shops that I&#39;ve been to where they will scoff at you for not knowing the difference between a macchiato and a cortado.<br><br>The baked goods here run out really quickly by early afternoon. I&#39;ll have to come back to try one of their muffins! The coffee itself is really rich and bold. Gotta love that Stumptown. I also got a chai latte, which was delicious and creamy, but not too cloyingly sweet. <br><br>This is how coffee shops should be!",

Why? Because every argentine bakery that I&#39;ve been to makes solid pastries, however this  makes the best ones I&#39;ve ever tasted. Even when comparing to any kind of bakery like Balthazar or the overpriced trendy places in the city, this is up there and above, for a fraction of the price. their croissants are better than the French bakeries, what does that tell you?<br>Everything is the right kind of fluffy not heavy dough.

I will buy it in CA because I can&#39;t wait till May to buy it here and read it! <br><br>It&#39;s very well laid-out and I think the manager&#39;s picks are excellent.<br><br>Independent bookstores are dying as we all know.

"reviewcomment":"This place has it all, and as the name suggest at affordable prices!!! <br><br>Last minute I had to purchase a large number of jelly beans for a baby shower I was helping to host. This candy store had the most variety of jelly bean flavors (Jelly Bellys yum!) for the cheapest price per pound compared to other candy stores in the city. Of course I couldn&#39;t help getting a few personal treats for myself! Like mallow cups, i LOVE MALLOW CUPS!!! I can never find them anywhere this place is seriously heaven! I ended up buying cotton candy and cheese cake flavored jelly beans which were perfect for our theme. <br><br>It can get a bit difficult to look through the isles as they are a bit cramped and it can get packed, but I still think its worth it if your a kid with a sweet tooth trapped in an adults body. <br><br>Aren&#39;t we all?",

Of course you can&#39;t bring your dog in here. But would ya like a cup of coffee and wouldn&#39;t you like to shoot the breeze outside? <br><br>I like the gruff deadpan, but wait are you joking? Oh I see. You are funny, but yes that was a joke wasn&#39;t it? kinda of vibe. I don&#39;t need to be coddled when I order my coffee.

She was surprised when I said I&#39;d never been despite growing up in that &#39;hood and babysitting over there also. I wasn&#39;t expecting much honestly. She mentioned that if I&#39;d planned on taking some home for my family I should at least get one big one for myself. <br>Today as a &#34;pre snow&#34; snack I decided to make to short trip. When I walked in I was greeted by a lovely smell. I was literally in heaven from the start. I immediately noticed that today they only had Vanilla and Chocolate filling so for the minis I got both and for my regular sized I got vanilla. The staff was nice and answered my questions. I also got a coffee (it&#39;s MUD). My coffee was tasty but I saved the treats for when I got home. My brother tasted his first and he was instantly obsessed. Because he couldn&#39;t stop talking about it so I tasted mine. I died, was revived and died again off of that heavenly taste. I honestly don&#39;t know how anyone could give this place a bad review. Inexpensive, delicious and a friendly enough staff - sometimes finding all 3 in New York is hard. <br>Thank you Beard Papa, I will be back far more than I probably should!",

Cheap too and they pack the cup full.<br><br>We feasted at one of the terrific Polish joints a few blocks away the other night, but saved some room to waddle over here for dessert. Super friendly gals working the counter of this small window only spot that let us try a bunch of flavors before settling on a few. The Coconut Crave and Black Razzberry were insanely good.<br><br>Enjoy a great dinner at one of the fine Polish restaurants in the area, but skip dessert and come here for a real treat.",

"reviewcomment":"We ran across Top Hops on accident even though it was on my list of places to try to hit while we were visiting NYC from California.  WOW!  I&#39;m glad we did.  I LOVE this place.  I love it so much we keep talking about maybe needing to open one here at home!   <br><br>The ambiance is cool and beercentric, you have a bar and then cases of beer for sale in bottles, cans, kegs, or fill a growler!  Not many places around here that have those multiple services except for maybe that actual breweries that are serving THEIR beers.  But, these beers are from all over the world.<br><br>At the bar, there is a selection of beers on tap and while we were there Bell&#39;s had just gotten to town so there were a lot of Bell&#39;s beers on tap.  You have an opportunity to do four tasters or purchase a pint.  We did both!  What I realllly loved was the snacks for sale!  An amazing cheese selection and delicious olives- they locally source the cheeses, meats, breads, etc.  LOVE THAT.  <br><br>Enjoyed chatting with the bartender, who seemed knowledgeable about the beers he was serving.  <br><br>I definitely recommend Top Hops if you&#39;re looking for a great place to drink beer and try some new beers.  Just note that there ins&#39;t a lot of seating, so if it&#39;s crowded, it will be a standing situation.",

"reviewcomment":"I love Gowanus Wine Merchants. This is a great little wine shop on Third Avenue between 10th and 11th streets. The employees are super friendly and available to answer any questions you have about wine. They personally select what they carry by tasting everything before buying in bulk so their meticulous care is what crafts their stock. That said, you do not need to be a wine aficionado to shop here. You can walk right in, select a bottle within your price range and you&#39;re pretty much guaranteed to be happy with the result. <br><br>It&#39;s my favorite wine shop in all of Brooklyn and I am so happy they are in Gowanus! :)",

"reviewcomment":"As a start-up publisher, fiction editor, and freelance writer, coffee shops and I have a long and complicated relationship. I love supporting local coffee shops, but I also have crippling social anxiety over mispronouncing menu items. I have googled how to pronounce varieties of wine under the table at dinner, and I have walked out of snobby coffee shops when I&#39;m befuddled by the menu. I usually end up banishing my inner coffee critic and holing up at Sbux, mostly because they don&#39;t complain much if I get lost in edits and hang around for an hour. Or more. Let&#39;s be honest. <br><br>I had some critiques to finish before a fiction workshop this morning, so I walked into Birch. So glad I did! Friendly employees who weren&#39;t the least bit West Village Chic (it&#39;s like lemon juice has permeated the water supply), an amazing cappucino, and they didn&#39;t run for the hills when they saw me pull out a laptop. I&#39;ll only stay for half an hour y&#39;all, don&#39;t worry. <br><br>New Saturday morning tradition! I might come by after workshop for some grilled cheese and tomato soup.",

"reviewcomment":"Similar to Sugar Club grocery store in Elmhurst, Inthira has a wide range of Thai ingredients from Fresh Holy Basil to Frozen Salted Crabs. I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve been looking around for this, and this store is well-stocked with them!<br><br>You can also get all sorts of Canned Thai Curry Pastes, Chili Pastes and Thai Instant Ramen Noodles. Pretty impressive I might say. <br><br>Every time I enter this store, I always make my way to the fridge in the back to grab a bunch or two of Thai Holy Basil. You may wonder what&#39;s a big deal about this. Pad Gaprow (Stir Fried Meat with Spicy Thai Basil Sauce) is supposed to cook with Thai Holy Basil instead of Thai Sweet Basil. It has a distinctive heat and aroma to it. <br><br>The store is easy to get to from 7 train&#39;s 69th Street stop, and they also take credit card with $10 minimum of purchase.",

Yes, they are that good!<br><br>You may think this is vegetarian food, but you would be severely limiting yourself. This is food, but more importantly, it is good food.

I just want more.<br><br>There are some folks that will toss a bunch of vegetables together, have it taste like cardboard, and eat it with a begrudging smile on their face.

Please, show them this place, it will be like discovering Atlantis.<br><br>The masterminds at Chickpea and Olive are a little bit different. You give them ingredients, and they know how to make it taste good!<br><br>I had the Bacon Ranch Cheeseburger. The entire ensemble was more akin to a work of art on a plate. You bite into the burger, past the bread, past the eggplant bacon, past the ranch dressing, past the avocado spread, and right into the charbroiled beets. As those flavors co-mingle and flirt with each other in your mouth, you also have the crunch from the lettuce and the crispiness of the charred exterior of the beets starting up a little rave party in your mouth. <br><br>Like, all great food, it will leave you wanting more, and if you&#39;re anything like me, it will compel you to take a picture, and write a story.

My friend ordered the pulled pork waffle. I ordered the Brussels waffle with Dulce De Leche, whipped cream, bananas and walnuts ($8). I also ordered the Belgian hot cocoa in a large ($4).

How did THAT happen?! :) <br><br>The cafe is inviting, comfortable and spacious. You can grab a spot at the picnic table or at one of the private tables. I opted for the table with a teapot of their sencha special blend which was delightful. <br><br>After a several sips of tea, my meal arrived (I like my burgers well done!). Everything was delicious - full of flavor! And when I realized that I still had room in my belly, I browsed the desserts display - from the macaroons to the madeleines. After some debate, I decided to try the Mille-feuille (French Napoleon). I&#39;m so glad that I did - the thin layers of flaky sweetness with the delectable custard was amazing. It posed as a slight challenge to eat neatly though - you can make a mess but that&#39;s ok as long as you don&#39;t drop the pastry on the floor :)",

"reviewcomment":"My favorite place to come for Japanese take out food. The food court has variety, the employees are nice, and the food is amazing. Kayaba is where I usually go to eat. I highly recommend the Gyu-don. Organic meat and unbeatable sauce. After I eat I usually check out the marketplace. Fair prices and they have most anything to suit your Asian grocery needs. The bakery closest to the marketplace has delicious cream puffs, and used to sell these AMAZING mochi donuts. I&#39;m not sure why they stopped making the mochi donuts, but they should definitely bring them back. Oishinbo is a great place to go for dessert, as well. You can watch them make the taiyaki before/while you order it. <br><br>The Mars shop across the street from the marketplace is great! They have products there for children and adults alike. My boyfriend got me a beautiful tea set from there last Christmas. The book store is also nice, but I wish they had manga in English. lol. <br>Overall, I love Mitsuwa and wish I lived a little closer to it!",

"reviewcomment":"Went here on the second to last Sunday before they head indoors and I wasn&#39;t disappointed after all the hype I heard from my friends Garreth G. Mary Grace T. If there was ever a place that exemplified what a smorgasborg is, then this is it. Types of cuisine ranged from BBQ to Filipino egg rolls (lumpia shanghai). My siblings and I got there around 3 pm and some of the vendors were already cleaned out (!!!, they open at 11 am) and were already closing. We sampled a BBQ stall (I&#39;m so sorry I forgot the name) but we had the pulled pork and brisket sandwhiches which were both amazing. They were topped with these perfectly pickled pickles and fresh peppers which added that extra zing to such rich and decadent sandwiches. Then we had the Filipino spring roll sampler platter which were filled with pork, truffled mushrooms, and peking duck. I can&#39;t believe I didnt think of creating different fillings before but it was genius! We also had whoopie pies, Salted Caramel Banana, Peanut butter and chocolate, and Pumpkin Spice, all of which were excellent. I also got cornbread from Ched Bred which I took home and reheated the next day and it was awesome. So many different flavor options all of which enhance whatever you want to eat with it. To end the day, and to help with digestion, we had coffee from this Mexican stall and it was good. Would&#39;ve been better if it was piping hot I&#39;m sure but as we got there relatively late, it wasn&#39;t really their fault.<br><br>Overall, the experience was excellent. If you wanted something to do on a Sunday and were hungry, then this is the place to go. Pretty much every type of cuisine was available so even the pickiest eaters should not have anything to bitch about. Oh and don&#39;t forget to bring loads of cash as that is the only way you can purchase all the delicious food available there! Going back again soon and I hope to see you guys there!",

"reviewcomment":"Coffee Foundry is the best. A couple friends and I met up here for the first time a couple months ago to just catch up over coffee and do some work. It&#39;s very cozy and quiet, as most people are usually working on laptops or doing reading, etc. You can sit at the bar, or on tables lined up by the wall. There are also private rooms for karaoke, but the bartender/coffee maker/AWESOME person will let you study in the room if you need more space. We timidly asked if we could possibly pay to use the room for a few hours, and he got it cleaned up for us and said we could have it as long as we needed for free (unless a horde of karaoke-goers came all at once....spoiler: they won&#39;t). So we went back, and did the same thing the next week. <br><br>so you have the best service, great coffee in glasses and mugs (none o dat plastic/paper cup business) for a good price, and yummy treats that he is very good at convincing you to try. (those little mint cupcakes doe) <br><br>love coffee foundry! should be everyone&#39;s go-to work spot. (but not really because that would suck for us.)",

The shop is a little hole-in-the-wall north of Canal street. When I walked in, I was surprised to see the lack of sponge cakes in the front display. Where were all the delicious cakes people kept raving about?? <br><br>Then I looked up and towards the back. HELLO plastic storage boxes stacked upon storage boxes of freshly made sponge cake! I tried one of each flavor - original, green tea, and chocolate. The cakes were lightly sweetened and you got the essence of green tea without too much bitterness. The chocolate cake had tiny bits of chocolate chip baked in - yum.<br><br>I also ordered their Vietnamese Iced Coffee for $2.50 since I figured a little caffeine kick to get through the afternoon wasn&#39;t such a bad idea. The girl behind the counter warned me that the drink would be super strong, but the strong coffee was nicely balanced out by the gallons (I exaggerate, but you get the point) of condensed milk mixed into the coffee. Did it wake me up? Sadly caffeine never has that extreme of an effect on me, but I did have a nice drink to sip on as I walked back to the courthouse.",

"reviewcomment":"It&#39;s been two years since I moved from New York to Houston, and I can honestly say that I would give my left ovary to have Taim in walking distance from me again. Needless to say, this place is most definitely worth the hype. <br><br>Like everyone else&#39;s praises that have been sung, the stand-out star of this place is the falafels. Never having had a falafel before coming here, one bite of that succulent sandwich is all it took for me to declare the falafel my Lord Jesus and Savior. Well, not really, but it was definitely a religious experience. First off, everything here is made from scratch. Even though I&#39;ve never confirmed that, my taste buds have. Everything that goes into their falafel sandwich is so expertly crafted, and beautifully melded together. Their pita is doughy yet fluffy, the falafels have an ever so delicate crisp on the outside, yet are surprisingly moist in the middle, and their hummus is some of the most smooth and creamy hummus you&#39;ll ever have. All of that paired with their refreshing cucumber based israeli salad, and pickled cabbage is what dreams are made of. All in all, this is probably the best sandwich I&#39;ve ever had, which is confirmed by the puddle of drool that is developing on my keyboard as I write this review.<br><br>Take heed though, this isn&#39;t a sit down restaurant, but more of a grab and go type of place. But don&#39;t expect to wait too long for your food, because the guys who work behind the assembly line are like a well oiled machine. If you&#39;re trying this for the first time though, my suggestion is to eat it as soon as you get it. Also, whatever you do, don&#39;t you dare let anyone talk you into sharing. I&#39;ve lost a lot of friendships because of this, but really who needs friends when you can have falafels.",

The main problem was finding clams fresh enough for the dish. The last time a friend picked up &#34;fresh&#34; fish at Whole Foods, he had food poisoning. Yelp reviews led us to Rosendo where we got a dozen little neck clams that were on ice. After washing and cooking, every clam popped open and proved to be fresh. <br><br>The place was a little tough to find considering the unassuming storefront and the wrong yelp address.

"reviewcomment":"Few bakeries can make the claims Glaser&#39;s does. It wins both for its baked goods -its product- and for its history. It&#39;s a simple storefront, with furnishings that hark back to its century-plus history. Would that we could preserve more of the best of NYC like this. And they have done it without charging an arm-and-a-leg. <br><br>Among the brilliant baked goods that I have had there, I will single out just a few. I often set foot just to pick up one of their pecan brownies, which I love because it is not overly sweet the way some brownies are, and because there are lots of big pieces of pecan in it. Best brownie.<br><br>They make a german chocolate cake that is, to my mind, the ideal of that cake. The icing has a crunchy-chewy coconut throughout. the proportion of icing and layer filling to the cake layers is just right. Please try it if you like German&#39;s chocolate cake (that&#39;s the old way to say it and tthis is, after all, Yorkville -old germantown NYC).   <br><br>But the single best thing they have there, in my opinion, is REAL rainbow cookies: the several-layer multi-color cookies with real dark chocolate on the outside and separated by layers of marzipan on the inside. No one makes them the traditional way anymore! Most bakeries and all store-bought rainbow cookies use raspberry jam filling rather than the more expensive, harder to work with, marzipan. But what a difference! Go here, try these, and don&#39;t think you will ever be satisifed with the ersatz rainbow cookies ever again. But you can&#39;t get them in Summer: they only make them in the cooler months because the chocolate doesn&#39;t hold up well in Summer. (Honestly, it&#39;s better this way: its a three-season treat that, by the end of Summer you really can&#39;t wait for them to start making again.)<br><br>Just last week before I went down I called the shop and spoke with Tez (sp?). I wanted to make sure they&#39;d be open (they are idiosyncratic, closing early sometimes) and still had some rainbows. She put away four and I split them with a close friend. Thank you!",

"reviewcomment":"This review is for all the Rita&#39;s in the world in terms of flavors. Flawless. I wish this place was open in the winter as well just for the cravers of this delicious Italian ice. It hits the spot during those hot summer days. It&#39;s like they used 5 star quality ice and mixed in 5 star quality ingredients to make the variety of flavors they offer.<br><br>My favorite is the Mango with the Vanilla frozen custard. When I first had this concoction for the first time I was intrigued that oh its only ice with soft serve ice cream. First bite together I was like damn I need to share this place everyone who I care about. Then I was sad for a minute because I thought there was no more soft serve until I saw there was more on the bottom and I was like&#34;What!! Say What!! This place is Dope!!&#34; So as a result I bring everyone I know who doesn&#39;t live in Jersey to this spot because it&#39;s more amazing than Carlo&#39;s bakery. <br><br>I also have tried the bubble gum, strawberry starburst, cherry, Swedish fish, and root beer. They are consistent every time I come back to try it again. Rita&#39;s 4 Life!",

They always serve a generous portion and their staff is always kind and friendly.<br><br>I finally stepped into JoJu for the first time yesterday and purchased a sandwich and used the coupon (1 free order of Kimchee fries with a purchase) they dished out at the Elite Event: Yelp&#39;s Lunar New Year in February. The Kimchee fries were really good. The fries had a nice crunch and the kimchee gives it a real nice flavor. <br><br>I ordered their bulgogi sandwich. It comes with a decent amount of beef and veggies. The bread is really good. It&#39;s not the most filling sandwich I&#39;ve had for $6 bucks but its certainly a good sandwich for what it&#39;s worth.<br><br>Verdict - If you have an interest in Viet sandwiches, look no further in Elmhurst. JoJu is your spot! They have check-in offers, good fries, great tasting variety of sandwiches, and good service. Be sure to check them out if you&#39;re in this area of Queens.",

"reviewcomment":"Since the spouse read the NYT article a few months. ago this has become our go to bakery for croissants and baguettes. We live 30 miles away. The croissants are fresh flaky buttery and 2.00, a refreshing change from the stale 3.25 croissants you get elsewhere . The creme filled croissant is unique and lighter than it sounds. One of the nicer items  is a large roll suitable for pan bagnat. Actually I wish they made this Tunisian sandwich.If you&#39;re there to eat on the spot , pick up a baguette slathered with good butter, which seems to be the favorite of the taxi drivers in the area. If you have time enjoy your croissant at the sunny table in the front secure in the knowledge that you have had an experience more authentically French than in the high priced places a few blocks to the South.<br><br>Update 2.10.14 - confirmed they do indeed have a pan bagnat on the menu, my bad. Used to seeing these pre-made and on display in France - they are best that way so the oil soaks into the bread. New favorite is the ficelle with bacon and cheese. Pain au chocolat was great this weekend.",

They also have a great selection of wines across all price ranges and their liquor prices are better than most in the area.

I&#39;ve never had someone try to up-sell me anything- in fact Roger recommended a cheaper bottle of vodka than what I was planning on purchasing because it tasted better- he was spot on. <br><br>As another reviewer said, the name is misleading because they are actually located on 55th street.",

I&#39;ve been coming here faithfully for 6 years.<br><br>Pros:<br>* Great selection of meats<br>* Meat is pretty fresh (so long as you cook it or freeze it within 3-4 days)<br>* Inexpensive prices relative to the chains<br>* Decent selection of other groceries<br>* Fast checkout<br><br>Cons:<br>* Narrow aisles and stairs (but guess what? that helps them keep the prices down)<br>* The shelf-life of the milk can tend to the short side, so I buy it elsewhere<br>* Variety can be limited (e.g., you&#39;re not going to find 7 flavors of fat-free salad dressing)<br><br>Bottom line. If you live in Hell&#39;s Kitchen, this place is close enough that you can pop in here a couple of times a week to pick up most of what you need (and really, what&#39;s more important than the meat?), and you&#39;re in and out of it fairly quickly without dropping a lot of coin. There are plenty of other options around for the one-off specialty items that BAMM doesn&#39;t carry.<br><br>I give it 5 stars because I hardly consider the cons meaningful enough to offset the awesome meat selection, ease of shopping, and low prices.",

Being from LA, I&#39;m still annoyed by the fact that wine cannot be sold in supermarkets. Or that all liquor cannot be sold in supermarkets. But I digress...<br><br>Anyway - this place is sweet. First of all, any place that offers free dog biscuits is a plus in my book (even though I don&#39;t have a dog, but I think it&#39;s very considerate). Every time we go there, whoever is behind the counter always has a smile on their face, easy going, helpful (a couple times I see them nursing their own glass or having a very party-like &#34;wine tasting&#34;), and the prices are reasonable. <br><br>One time we were specifically looking for wine with a screw top and they handed it to us saying, &#34;have fun in the park.&#34;<br><br>My only complaint is that I wish they were closer to our house!",

The Financial District all but clears out once the Wolves of Wall Street have gone home, and the closest train is the 1 that ends its route at the Staten Island Ferry terminal. Not exactly the sort of spot you just stumble upon - when you end up here, it was by no accident. I guess the R is pretty close too, but still - it&#39;s in the boonies, so to speak. <br><br>I tend to shy away from the typical Irish bar settings because I think they&#39;re lame and lazy. Throw some Guinness on tap, add a few bros wearing green shirts, and boom - you have a bar. But Dead Rabbit reinvents the Irish bar in a way that all others of its ilk should replicate. It&#39;s got that warm, broken in feel though it&#39;s only been operating for the better part of a year, their menu extends way beyond the usual fried pub grub, and their mixed drinks are second to none. Throw in an impressive scotch and whiskey list, three floors with a different vibe at each one, and you have yourself a tier 1 destination for alcoholic indulgence.",

Yeah!!!   Candy boxes filled with chocolates on shelves and mounds of self-serve candies on the counter.  There are also cookies and lollipops, chocolate bars and other sweet treats stashed all in this wonderful Polish candy store.  Don&#39;t ask me to pronounce the name for you, I couldn&#39;t even begin to try.  Just know you&#39;ll be getting a treat when you step in.<br><br>The shades were drawn to protect the chocolates and candies from the sunlight and heat.  The store also has tinted brown glass windows.  I cannot for the most part read what is on the packaging.  I try to find English whenever possible, but if I can&#39;t, then I look for any identifying pictures that gives me a hint of what flavors I might be getting.  <br><br>I used to get the Prince Polo bars here.  It is a chocolate covered wafer and one version has hazelnut.  Oh hurt me!  But now since I can find those in my hood, I go for those items I can&#39;t get but here at Slodycze Wedel.  During the holidays, they have giant, very decorative boxes of gift chocolates, but when it is regular season, there are still a substantial amount of candies here to satisfy those with a sweet tooth.  <br><br>I spied Milka brand chocolates here as well as cookies and picked up a package of Milka chocolate chip cookies with raisins.  This cookie was delicious.  The raisins added a nice, different touch to the chocolate chip cookies.  It made the cookie richer and it blended well with the chocolate chips.<br><br>They also have candies by the pound, and you can grab a bag and fill up.  Candies vary in prices here.  Another candy package which I couldn&#39;t read had Zozole Musss on it.  Inside the candies are cherry and green apple and inside the hard candy there is a fizzy liquid.  It was quiet good and only $1.29 for bag. Workers here are nice and pleasant.<br><br>If you want to satisfy your sweet tooth and are wandering Greenpoint, Brooklyn make sure you stop off at Slodycze Wedel.",

"reviewcomment":"This is a less expensive alternative to KungFu Tea and with better service and a better selection of drinks.  It&#39;s more suited for traditional tea-ists and/or tea aficionados. <br><br>Kung Fu offers a hot beverage for $5 (even though it says $4.50 on the menu...).  You can&#39;t pick the size of your cup.  I generally find KF&#39;s hot beverage container size to be too big for me to finish.  Teado, on the other hand, offers a range of sizes, and you can even customize the strength of your drink..<br><br>FYI: All milk products use are Lactaid.<br><br>There&#39;s very limited seating, so take your drink to-go and walk around the park down the block.",

"reviewcomment":"Shaikh&#39;s Place / Donut Shoppe. How I love thee. Let me count the ways.<br><br>1. Their donuts are INCREDIBLE. Freshly baked all the time. Never stale. Cheaper than Dunkin Donuts. Their chocolate glazed are my favorite. <br><br>2. They&#39;ve got tacos. I don&#39;t know how many types of tacos, and I&#39;ve always stuck to chicken. But their chicken/ tomato/ onion/ cilantro tacos that come with a lime wedge, and salsa roja + salsa verde = HEAVEN! And for $2! Can&#39;t go wrong. I don&#39;t think they have any sour cream, but when I asked for &#34;white sauce&#34; (akin to the St. James white sauce in Astoria) they gave me, when seemed to be, something along the lines of Miracle Whip. No bother, though. <br><br>3. They&#39;ve got delicious melt-in-your mouth pancakes. 3 huge ones for $4!<br><br>4. They&#39;re open 24/7. That&#39;s right - 24/7 - so if it&#39;s 3am, and you&#39;re oddly like me, and craving a late-night pancakes, tacos &amp; donut fix (that happens *far* more often than it should) - then you&#39;ve found the perfect spot.<br><br>I hear they have other items offered aside from the 3 listed above, but I&#39;ve never seen an actual menu - whether in-store, or for take-out, so I&#39;m not sure. <br><br>But man, you&#39;re really missing out if you&#39;ve never been here!

"reviewcomment":"Being a fan of doughnuts since the age of 3, I can honestly say these doughnuts are probably the highlight of my doughnut career. From the moment I spotted it across the street I INSISTED to my girlfriend that we check it out and I was not taking a NO for an answer. The minute I walk inside I&#39;m shocked to realize this is a dream I once had, doughnuts on a whole different level. These guys turned the classic 90&#39;s vanilla frosted, glazed frosted, and chocolate frosted to a whole new ball game. It&#39;s more than just food, it&#39;s the art of taste buds. Amazing !! The server was awesome with great vibes, kept making these awesome recommendations for my girl and I which we  both insisted we tried. After paying and enjoying the company of my girl and my other girl (the doughnut) we sat in these &#34;to go&#34; seats where people come in and out to not sit too long and obnoxiously so that other people can enjoy their doughnut indoors with their coffee or hot chocolate. <br><br>Finished eating our doughnut we were surprised by one of the workers handing over a complimentary bag of two mini doughnuts for my girl and I. Just when I thought it couldn&#39;t get any better. <br><br>Good vibes with good food. Looking forward to coming here again and again and again and again and...etc <br><br>Peace and love.",

"reviewcomment":"Quaint and cozy decor of being in a small farm-to-table Italian countryside. We opted to head in here for dessert and coffee after dinner in Park Slope. We had a double chocolate mouse dessert that was out of this world - creamy, fresh, rich and decadent. We sat the corner of the back of the place, and enjoyed peeking through the restaurants plethora of cookbooks that decorated the walls, shelves and tables. It was great fun! I also had an almond milk hot latte and it was the perfect cup on that snowy evening. <br><br>The staff was friendly and attentive, and you could tell each dish, cup and plate was created with an elevated level of care, like you were in someone&#39;s personal kitchen. <br><br>I can&#39;t wait to go back  in the summer, I hear the outdoor patio is exquisite!",

"reviewcomment":"I am a major bargain hunter, especially when it comes to grocery shopping. I&#39;ve also lived in the 23rd street part of Gramercy for almost 4 years now. Living in the area, I know that Morton Williams is where you go to get Shop Rite brand groceries (which for some reason are $1-$2 cheaper than more popular brands), and D&#39;Agostino&#39;s is where you&#39;re likely to get deals on dairy. For some reason though, I&#39;ve always been too intimidated by Trader Joes&#39; long lines to give it a shot.<br><br>After this weekend though, I&#39;ve become an instant convert. Trader Joe&#39;s has HEALTHY FOOD! It has so much variety! It has ethnic food!... Thai... Indian... Over ten different varieties of hummus! It has lots of healthy (and not so healthy) snacks. Its fruits and veggies are cheaper than those at smaller scale grocery stores in Brooklyn, like Netcost. And best of all, pretty much everything is $1-$4, with a few exceptions. <br><br>I also think that this location of Trader Joe&#39;s handles its biggest problem, the LONG line to check out, pretty well. Both times that I went here, the line almost reached the entrance, but it went extremely fast. I believe my wait time was about 4-6 minutes here. It is way better than the Trader Joe&#39;s location at Union Square- there, the line winded between isles so much that it was impossible to see or reach anything on the shelves (and the wait time was about 15 minutes). This location handles its checkout issues much better.<br><br>I see many trips to Trader Joe&#39;s in my future.",

So after an early breakfast we put on our walking boots and faced the snow to walk from W29st down to Christopher street. Yupp, quite a walk .. but it was a good one and WELL WORTH IT!<br><br>The store is super fresh, super clean and SUPER white inside. They have a good selection of candies and it&#39;s the same way as in Sweden. You pick a bag, grab a spoon and go to town. <br><br>They also have some swedish food for sale which is always appreciated when living in the US. The candy itself (beside of course being awesome) is indeed pretty expensive, but what else could you really expect from imported candy? <br><br>They have a webside too with a selection that you can order for home delivery. Dangerous indeed. <br><br>I wasn&#39;t disappointed at all with this store and wish I could go whenever I wanted too, but I might just have to go with delivery :)<br><br>BTW.

"reviewcomment":"When I first moved to New York, I knew nothing about the restaurants in my neighborhood. My mother would constantly bring me to this cafe, which was right across the street from our apartment. <br><br>For breakfast, lunch, and dinner, my brothers and I would order something different from here. We were poor, and the food proportions were huge as well as very cheap. The Hong Kong milk tea, span macaroni, and pork chop over rice are to die for.<br><br>When we moved to Brooklyn, the one thing I missed most about Manhattan was S.Wan Cafe. I had 3 free swipes on my metrocard provided by my high school. One was used in the morning to get to school, one was used to stop by S.Wan Cafe to pick something up, and the last was used to go to Brooklyn, happily clutching my food.<br><br>Some may find this routine tedious but I love the food so much that it was worth it.<br><br>I have since gone to a college upstate. For my fall break, Thanksgiving break, and winter break, I always made sure to stop by S.Wan Cafe no matter where I ended up staying.<br><br>Today is my last day in New York City for awhile. Needless to say, I am sitting in S.Wan Cafe at this very moment, enjoying my perfect Hong Kong Milk Tea and spam macaroni. <br><br>Until we meet again, S.Wan.",

"reviewcomment":"The hot chocolate here is beyond good. Does anybody remember when Starbucks had the Aztec hot chocolate in like 2005? It was really good, but they never brought it back after that one amazing winter and I was so sad. The hot chocolate here is like that, but even B E T T E R. It&#39;s rich, thick and 100% amazing. Personally I recommend the dark chocolate one, but I guess that&#39;s personal preference. <br><br>Also it&#39;s really cozy in here. There&#39;s not that many tables but if you have one, they never rush you. They also sell the cutest chocolates (in white, milk or dark) shaped like little mice and they make really good gifts!",

"reviewcomment":"Wha-what? Why? How!?<br><br>These are the questions you will ask yourself when you walk home with 10 lbs of fruit and vegetables with nary a dent in your wallet.<br><br>First of all, let me say this. There are many fruit stands in this area. You should only go to one. The stand that you should go to is fairly easy to spot given that it almost always has the longest line. The stand is manned by an old white guy with with white hair. He usually has a younger Hispanic man helping him out. The line moves a little slow so expect a wait. Make sure you know what you want by the time you get to the front of the line so as to not hold up everyone else.<br><br>The prices here are ridiculous. It&#39;s almost as if you&#39;ve traveled back in time to 1985. You can get entire boxes of fruit for five dollars. You can get enough fruit and vegetables to feed your family for a month for less than the price of a drink at most bars in New York.<br><br>Personally, I purchased 3 pounds of tomatoes, approximately 4 pounds of grapes, and between 10 to 20 peaches for a total of eight dollars. <br><br>On the way home, I had a thought. What if all these fruits are rotten on the inside? It certainly made sense. How else could they afford to sell at such cheap prices? This worry was laid to rest 20 minutes later as I cut open a perfectly ripened peach on my kitchen counter.<br><br>I don&#39;t know how they do it, but living in a city as expensive as New York, you learn to count your blessings and not ask too many questions when you encounter something that is this inexplicably wonderful. <br><br>Thank you, Chinatown.",

"reviewcomment":"Probably the best butcher in Queens and almost certainly the best in Astoria. The house specializes in lamb, which runs the gamut from rib lollipops to the whole shebang. The lamb souvlaki almost always seem to be out of stock, so they make them up fresh while you wait. If you don&#39;t want to wait pork and beef are also available. Veal is also well represented both as sliced to order cutlets and bone-in cuts for Greek stews.<br>Hamburger is freshly ground to your order from what look likes well trimmed chuck - I would say it&#39;s on the lean side. The strip steaks are choice, about an inch thick and well-trimmed -- probably the best you&#39;ll find for this price. They do a specialty aged prime rib steak on a long bone (something like a Chicago Chop House tomahawk steak) that is well worth the steep price. I would choose that over the porterhouse. The house chickens are good, but you can plump for D&#39;Artagnan free range if you are so inclined. Overhead, Greek sausages are drying. There are gourmet D&#39;Artagnan products (foie gras, etc.) in the case at the back, near where the owner, John, holds court while breaking down larger cuts.<br>The oiled pita breads and Greek tomato products are good additions.<br>In general, the price quality ratio is what makes this place great - you can get better steaks at some of the top Manhattan and Brooklyn places, but you&#39;ll pay quite a bit more for them. I don&#39;t think you will find better lamb in NYC. I have made numerous visits, and all of the butchers that have waited on me knew their trade.<br>About the only con is that the place can be a bit hectic on Saturdays and I need to check that everything has made its way to my bag. Highly recommended.",

First of all, Leonidas chocolates are the best anywhere, but what I like can only be bought from the New York store. During the holidays marzipan shaped like fruit is a standard as are liquor filled chocolates. There are imitators, but the real booze and smooth deliciousness are only found at a Leonidas store. The Grand Marnier is Grand Marnier and goes perfectly with the dark chocolate. The chocolates are filled to the brim with the exquisite authentic liquors and there is no skimping. these are just perfectly made and just right all around.<br><br>This review is for mail order services as much as for the chocolates. They get stuff out the same day, package it wonderfully and my candy comes in perfect shape fresh as the day it was made right to my desk.

"reviewcomment":"Ummmmmmmmm did I just get a glimpse of heaven? I&#39;m exaggerating but places like Ellary&#39;s Greens honestly make me so thrilled that I moved to New York! I came here yesterday night with a group of girls and had the most wonderful experience. <br><br>First of all, the place smelled like a vegetable garden. I may have been over-caffeinated, but I swear that the place gave off a slight cucumber smell. <br><br>The food here also makes me want to redefine my conception of &#34;soul food&#34;. At the end of the meal, I just felt very content and.....dare I say....&#34;well nourished&#34;. I honestly only say that after family meals at my grandmother&#39;s home and she lives on a farm. Additionally, I felt like the menu and portion sizes encouraged for communal eating which made the experience that much more satisfying. <br><br>It looks like other yelpers covered off on many of the plates that we tried - all of them were wonderful. I very much enjoyed the glazed salmon, the marinated beets, the roasted zucchini and the raw chocolate mousse. <br><br>Thank you to our waitress and manager. I can imagine that our group was a little overwhelming with eight giddy women, but we received warm and attentive service throughout the entire dinner!",

Maybe that&#39;s why the tarts taste so much more delicious because of the extra effort I have to put in to get them. <br><br>The tarts are a dollar each but it&#39;s worth it because of the yummy custard goodness and the crust is soft and the edges have a crunch but it doesn&#39;t fall apart like other tarts I&#39;ve tasted. This tart is definitely crumb free. <br><br>The flans here are good too and they come in cute little foil cups. I also bought a Filipino style empanada but I have yet to try it.",

"reviewcomment":"I recently moved nearby and have been on the lookout for a place where I can grab a hot beverage, a snack and settle in for a couple of hours of reading. I was here this past Saturday, and the chai latte was delicious. The guy making the late was also great- so nice that he made my drink twice, because I missed the first call for my drink (being my first time there, I didn&#39;t know the system and it was about ten minutes before I went looking for my drink). The atmosphere was also conductive enough that I was able to get a lot of reading done. So I guess I will become a lingerer (like another reviewer cautioned), because I do plan on going back to spend some more hours reading; however, I promise to always be welcoming enough that someone else can take the other seat if I happen to occupy a table with room for more.<br><br>Ps. They also serve wine, which comes in handy on a late afternoon café sit down.",

"reviewcomment":"I actually took a wines class in college (it was one of the most popular classes for credit and everything!) but I sadly and unfortunately don&#39;t remember much other than the major wine regions and varietals (&#34;But shouldn&#39;t you know this stuff?&#34; says everyone). So, I was more than relieved when I walked into Sutton Wine Shop and was greeted and guided towards the perfect bottle for a dinner at a BYO restaurant. <br><br>I asked for a medium-bodied, preferably French red that would work well with poultry and pork. With a twinkle in his eye, the staff member (I should have asked for his name!) led me to the Pinot Noir section and went on a very easy-to-understand spiel about the sorts of wines he recommended, as well as some personal stories. He also actually pushed for wines in the $15 to $25 range, and said that there really was no reason to spend money when a perfectly wonderful wine could be purchased for cheaper. <br><br>They have a wide selection of wines and a smaller selection of other spirits. There&#39;s a whole shelf near the entrance that features wines that are &#34;buy 1 get one 50% off&#34;. They make deliveries within NYC and will even gift wrap. Online shopping is also available on their website, but the warm helpfulness of the staff is something worth coming in for. <br><br>There&#39;s a 10% off check-in offer! <br><br>Likelihood of another visit:<br>&#34;Have a nice dinner! Come back and let us know what you thought!&#34; <br>Will do.<br>They also have weekly wine tastings!",

"reviewcomment":"It&#39;s a shame I found one of my favorite yogurt shops I&#39;ve come across so far in all of NY, and it&#39;s way out in Staten Island.<br><br>True to it&#39;s location in a little mini-mall in Staten Island, this place doesn&#39;t have all of that flash and the bright colors and funkiness you see at other places like 16 Handles. The yogurt speaks for itself here - they have 14 flavors, with several of the great sweet ones on rotation at most of the chains (peanut butter, red velvet, cake batter, cheesecake, etc.), and they all tasted awesome. I know, because the sweet old guy running the place gave us a bunch of sample cups and just told us to help ourselves.<br><br>Aside from the great tasting yogurt and the most important sample factor, the other aspect of a self-serve shop, the toppings, was on point. They had several different kinds of crushed nuts, as well as all of the chopped candy bars and other stuff you can think of that they should have.<br><br>As mentioned above, the guy working the register was super nice too, and made some very pleasant conversation while I weighed my tub of yogurt.<br><br>If I ever set foot on the island again, I&#39;m definitely coming here for a really satisfying, refreshing, lighter dessert.",

The gentleman was of great assistance with showing me the different blends of Oolong teas they had in stock. They even had some non-blends that sounded pretty enticing as well. He suggested that I purchase a specific type of infuser so the oolong can open up. That&#39;s not how he said it... of course he made it sound very poetic. Don&#39;t expect a &#34;Tea-Depot&#34;-type feel of this store. Its small and adorable and is great for a tea lover. Don&#39;t come here expecting to get tea-bagged, they have the herbs by the ounce.

"reviewcomment":"Thanks to the Co-Op, I can eat affordable, fresh, local food and be part of a diverse (and sure, sometimes weird!) community, and I am incredibly grateful for that. It&#39;s easy to take for granted, but co-ops like these just don&#39;t exist in most parts of the country and I&#39;m privileged to be able to have it.<br><br>This is one of very few co-ops where everyone works as part of their membership and that keeps prices way down. This gives access to not just high income folks who would otherwise be shopping at Whole Foods, but also to those with lower income who has far less to spend and the prices are cheaper than the average NYC grocery store.<br><br>There are a lot of shameful injustices when it comes to food today -- one in 5 New Yorkers doesn&#39;t have enough money to put food on the table, while the richest 3 New Yorkers have a combined income of 150 billion dollars, enough to feed the whole city for free for a year (I didn&#39;t do the exact math on that one but you get the idea!). Not too get too preachy on that, but just wanted to make the point that we are lucky to have a place that cares about local farms, food that is accessible to all, healthy, etc.",

They also had fresh brewed coffee which was really good as well. Everything was exceptional and very reasonably priced.

"reviewcomment":"Don&#39;t be fooled...this is anything but your average NYC food truck. El Rey has been dishing out some of the best, if not the best, tacos and authentic Mexican faire in all of queens for years! Using only the freshest ingredients and cooking/preparing everything to order, there&#39;s honestly nothing that they don&#39;t do right in my mind. The best part...they even except credit cards! So if you&#39;re like me and never carry any cash around, no excuses. <br><br>The best things to try here, and I&#39;ve had the whole menu, are the Torta, the Tacos, the Platillo, and the Nachos. Frankly, everything is amazing regardless, but those are definitely must haves! The nachos in particular are incredible, and is basically the Platillo dish with nachos underneath. It&#39;s a monstrous amount of food for $7!<br>The tacos can get pretty interesting once you start choosing from the different meat options on the menu. My favorite has always been spicy chicken. Which is essentially pulled chicken that&#39;s lightly marinated with traditional Mexican spices, and is cooked perfectly tender. All served within a warm corn tortilla, and topped with a mountain of fresh cilantro, diced beets, lettuce, onions, tomatoes, and limes. At the whopping price of only $2 each, you&#39;ll find it extremely hard to limit yourself to just one!<br><br>Overall, El Rey&#39;s value and quality can&#39;t be beat, and it&#39;s the reason why so many people visit them everyday! I absolutely recommend this place to all of my fellow Yelpers!",

I had their seasonal sundae with the regular yogurt. It had the right pitch of creaminess with a touch of honey. And their homemade vegan hot fudge added a nice warm chocolate flair without being too rich or runny. Plus, those toasted slices of almonds have that oomph to complete the sundae.<br><br>The affogato was also yummay! It had the right amount of thickness and was perfectly mixed with minced cocoa bits. Oh hot damn!<br><br>Perfect ending to the night, especially when you want something cool to hit the spot. Loved it!",

BUT what is cool about them is that you can leave them for a few days and they soften so they are still delicious even if you have a lapse in memory! :)<br><br>The bf hates going to KP, but i like to come here and Gretel&#39;s pretzels for my overly expensive snacks :)<br><br>*proud :)",

They also offer a student discount and loyalty card that be used simultaneously. (Free drink on your 10th purchase) And their staff is super friendly and welcoming!<br><br>Their seating is simple and clean. It&#39;s a cozy place to hang out with a friend or two during the summer and or winter. They do offer hot/warm drinks in both sizes. You can stay and even do some work with their free wifi.<br><br>I definitely recommend to go here for all your bubble tea needs and cravings. Happy eating! :)",

"reviewcomment":"Well this place is just wonderful! First off the olive oils are fantastic. They have an awesome selection of flavors like Basil (so good), Sun-Dried Tomato Parmesan, Rosemary, etc! They also have some amazing Balsamic Vinegars. A lot of people were digging the White Peach, but I enjoyed the traditional one the most. In addition to the amazing oils and vinegars - they sell flavored salts and kitchen gadgets.<br><br>The atmosphere is really cool and the shop is the perfect size. An olive oil shop is such a great store for a town like Montclair. These are the types of shops that attract people to the lovely town of Montclair. I also had the pleasure of meeting the owner while there and she was a very engaging person. I hope this business does well in years to come!",

All of the flavors are the perfect mini indulgences and really impressed guests at a party i hosted. I also love how they are not too girly, as cupcakes tend to be and these are in their own category of &#34;grown up cupcakes&#34;<br><br>The ladies that work here are so nice and attentive to detail.

Just why would you say this is part of that god awful tourist trap Little Italy. <br><br>Lets get past that because I&#39;m about some clean and jerky knowledge on you. THIS ISN&#39;T JUST JERKY. ITS A REVELATION TO THE TASTE BUDS. <br>They don&#39;t use conventional methods to make jerky the way we&#39;re all used to. They heavily season, marinade and grill the meat. Somehow this defies all jerky laws and is extremely moist and breaks apart in your mouth. The muscle fibers are broken down so you don&#39;t get a stringy, beefy or porky mess. <br><br>I gotta say its quite pricey for 1/4, 1/2 and a pound but that&#39;s why I eat it maybe twice every year. It&#39;s truly magical and be sure to get the spicy ones. I could stand there grinning like and idiot and inhale the beautiful aroma for hours.",

I&#39;m not a native New Yorker but I recently visited NYC with the intention to find the best coffee in the world.  I asked a lot of coffee enthusiast friends, I used coffee blogs, and yelp of course and formulated a list of around 15 different coffee spots.  My wife and I went to 10 of them, and after our grand tour the prize goes to Rex. <br><br>The friendly baristas, the high quality espresso, and the simple yet stylish decor did it for me.  If I lived in the area this would be my spot. <br><br>What made it stand out above the rest?  They use Stumptown&#39;s beans which are arguably the best beans available.  Although the specific blend that they were using when I was there was unlike Stumptown&#39;s typical espresso, there was a subtle hint of fruit, delicious.

I&#39;m not a big coffee fan but after I tried a sip of his black, I decided I needed to get one for myself because it was so good!<br><br>I walked around the store to explore every inch of it.  Everything seems to be local.  They have unique ice cream flavors with handwritten flavors on them (now that screams local/mom pop shop).  They have amazing cheeses, charcuterie, chocolate, and everything good basically.<br><br>I sadly but not so sadly left with their well brewed iced coffee.  If I lived in that neighborhood I think my most of my salary would go to that store.<br><br>Also, I got try some Stinky Brooklyn dip when I went to a suite at Barclay&#39;s Center for Nine Inch Nails. They had 3 of Stinky Brooklyn dips-- one was white bean, another hummus and the last one a spicy cheese type.  I loved the white bean and hummus.  They were so simple and good.  They each had about 5-6 ingredients. I&#39;m a minimalist (sometimes) when it comes to food-- the less processed, the better.  The white bean dip is basically white beans, dill, garlic, and a couple of other ingredients.<br><br>Love Stinky Brooklyn!",

Right around the corner and stays open relatively late considering this neighborhood doesn&#39;t have many stores that stay open past 7 or 8. <br><br>It&#39;s small but I guess once you find a couple wines you like does it really matter if all you&#39;re trying to do is relax with your cats, Netflix, and popcorn? Yeah no. <br><br>The staff is really sweet... everyone I met was really nice and helpful. I just wish it were bigger and open until 10 but other than that this is my second home.",

"reviewcomment":"Quality beer &amp; draft offerings in a place that doesn&#39;t take itself seriously and isn&#39;t hipster nirvana.<br><br>I love good beer, and I love places that offer good beer.  Breukelen does exactly that in a somewhat convenient location when in that area or waiting to go dine at an overly full tiny restaurant in the neighborhood.<br><br>The bottle selection is pretty good and I have seen some lesser available items here on previous visits.  No, you&#39;re not going to find KBS growing dust but you&#39;ll find winning items at reasonable for NYC prices.  Whole Foods on Houston is a bit better, but for singles this place wins.<br><br>The draft though is really what sets Breukelen apart though.  Quality offerings which I often have to look up on my phone on RateBeer, see a great score, and then order and consume with confidence and joy.  For its area of town it&#39;s probably the best beer option and nowhere as pretentious as Spuyten Duyvil (which I love as well).  <br><br>Great beer at reasonable prices in Williamsburg - that gets 5 stars from me.",

My man Omar behind the counter sees me coming before I even walk in the door, and has my Americano in the works regardless of the line. I&#39;ve never come across a barista with the positive attitude he&#39;s got -- and it brightens the place up. My girlfriend also happens to think Penny House has the best lattes in the city -- it&#39;s basically the only reason she&#39;s willing to come out to Prospect Heights. <br><br>The food is great too -- standard coffee house stuff, done well.

"reviewcomment":"I&#39;ve been coming to Varsano&#39;s for 10 years now. I discovered the store as it was en route from my apartment to law school every day. Though dangerous for my waistline, some Varsano&#39;s treats can make any bad week better. I order gifts for every special occasion and they even did my friends&#39; wedding - 300 beautiful champagne truffles - and it was excellent. Mark is always making fresh chocolate and inventing new delicious treats to try. Some of my favorites are the swirl patties (milk or dark with caramel and marshmallow swirls); pretzels (I especially dig the white chocolate); and the caramels, both regular and sea salt. Run by true professionals who genuinely love chocolate and their customers. Even just writing this review is giving me cravings!",

"reviewcomment":"My family and I have been loyal customers of calandras for almost 15 years. What can I say about this excellent bakery. I mostly visit the Caldwell location as it&#39;s closer to my house, and the new expansion is beautiful and was much needed! The staff at all 3 locations are always smiling and friendly no matter how many people are in the shop. And I have never seen a more spotless bakery, they obviously pride themselves in cleanliness and I always see the girls cleaning up and straightening out things!!<br>The pastries are literally to die for. The orange crust, ganache covered chocolate mousse, and lobster tails are things I always get going here. Everything is delicious! The bread is freshly baked and the baker is such a sweet heart! Everything is made fresh all day every day, and you get this old time feel from the place. I get my birthday cake every year from here and it&#39;s always just as good as the year before. <br>You won&#39;t be disappointed coming here, I drove nearly 25 miles to come here and it&#39;s worth the trip every time, even if it&#39;s just to stop in and get a cup cake and chat with the girls behind the counter!!

Some may think pricey but it is the quality &amp; of course it is also made by such a master pastry chef. Read his credentials &amp; you will know why. Best chocolate I ever had, store has great gifts for various holidays.  Hot Chocolate was much better &amp; richer than going to Serendipity 3 for their known frozen hot chocolate.<br>I would highly suggest to go try some of his goods &amp; one can always visit the store again or order online.<br>Hot chocolate or other goods may seem high in price than going to a corner store but some people pay premium prices for coffee as well.",

Teixeira&#39;s tart is both fluffy and warm when I got my order. It had a perfect balance of sweet and savory., It really brought a big smile to my face when I had my first bite. <br><br>The staff here were just wonderful, serving mostly local Portuguese patrons.

I even bought the $25 glass jar of it to bring to school with me when I can&#39;t have it. <br><br>My second favorite is the soda kind, it&#39;s got some sort of sodium bicarbonate within it that fizzes in your mouth :)<br><br>On the bottom of one of the shelves there are some huge pieces of candy chunks that have either been broken, deformed, etc. They&#39;re really cheap, but if you just buy it and crack it into pieces with a hammer, you could still salvage it and have something really artistic.<br><br>Lastly, the packaging is lovely! It&#39;s sleek and classy, the $5 candy packs are resealable and the shopping bags are clear, but the handles are a bit sharp and can cause cuts.",

"reviewcomment":"Alas, Broadway Bites is no longer in Herald Square. ***UPDATE! I asked the vendors and they said that they will be re-locating to Union Square. So if you&#39;re looking for these bite sized treats, head downtown.<br><br>Take a little detour away from the madness that is Penn Station/MSG and you&#39;ll find yourself in the little foodie wonderland known as Broadway Bites. I was lucky enough to sample some of their offerings before the moved south. There&#39;s a decent selection of booths carrying a wide variety of foods/drinks (including beer and wine!). Rush hour lures in a LOT of people, so I made sure to get there as soon as I could to avoid the long lines. There&#39;s some seating provided, but most people stand around, nosh and socialize. <br><br>I tried a few of the booths which were all equally delicious:<br>-Bangkok Bar: LOVED their pork and veggies dumplings. $1 each or 6 for $5. They were made quickly and came with the most delicious (and spicy!) thai chili sauce. The thai iced tea: standard and just the right amount of sweetness.<br><br>-Seoul Lee Korean BBQ: Their Bulgogi Bimbimbap was a pretty hefty portion for $12. There was kimchi mixed in which was a nice addition. While we were waiting they gave us a free shot of soju. Thanks lady behind the counter! Also, their sweet/spicy chicken and bulgogi tacos were quite tasty as well.<br><br>-My friend had the grilled cheese (Pop&#39;s original) and one of Sigmund&#39;s pretzels which were pretty good too. The grilled cheese was the perfect balance of cheesy, crispy, flaky, tart goodness. <br><br>Broadway Bites was a fun, casual place to socialize. Some of those bites were a little pricey in my opinion for such the small portions. But I guess you&#39;re paying for the big taste! I wish that the vendors would have stuck around a little while longer. Oh well, I guess I&#39;ll be making more trips to Union Sq. after all. For food, I can go the distance.*<br><br>*Really random insert of a Disney quote/song.",

"reviewcomment":"This is a very nice little shop. The staff are friendly and helpful, the store is clean, and they pack a lot of stuff into a very small space. You should go here with the understanding that it&#39;s more like a Japanese convenience store than a big Asian market.<br><br>Most of the negative reviews seem to be comparing it to much larger stores, which I don&#39;t understand. Would you say a convenience store is bad because it doesn&#39;t have as much stuff or is more expensive than a supermarket? No, convenience stores are always smaller and more expensive than supermarkets. So those reviews are pretty lame. <br><br>I would prefer it if it were a little larger and a little cheaper, and the prices are like 5-10% higher than Sunrise Mart on some things, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s expensive, and  the rents are very high near Bedford, so I don&#39;t think they are gouging. They aren&#39;t responsible for the size of the space they can afford to rent, and it would be tough for them to pack much more into the space. <br><br>Some things there are cheaper than anywhere else in the neighborhood, including tofu, miso and Ito En iced tea.<br><br>I&#39;m happy there&#39;s a nice little Japanese shop in Williamsburg. Sure, I&#39;ll go to bigger stores when I&#39;m near them, but for most of the products I need regularly, they have them and it saves me the trip into Manhattan.",

I had been frequenting a different fro-yo place on 30th ave (no, not 16 handles) and felt some sort of loyalty, as well as preferred their lower price per ounce. <br><br>Over the summer I had a project I was working on outside of work and decided to just go to this closer frozen place than walk the three avenues in surface of the sun heat to my other place on 30th Ave. Not to mention they finally had coconut yogurt, which they didn&#39;t when I first tried them out after opening (anyone who knows me knows my coconut fixation). <br><br>I grabbed my delicious cooling treat, tossed in a few fresh fruit choices (kiwis, strawberries, and blackberries FTW!), and maybe one or two gummy bears, and parked myself in the back to hammer away at my project. <br><br>The atmosphere in the back is great, but only when there are no screaming children. It can echo back there is all I&#39;m saying. Anyway, plenty of comfy seats, plugs, and free wifi make this a great place to get stuff done. <br><br>Oh! And they make AMAZING coffee!!

The market is to be found in East River State Park every Saturday and has over 50 food vendors selling their fares. <br><br>If like me you love food then this place is literally heaven. Try and think of any type of cuisine you could fancy and the chances are you will find it here. Lobster rolls, S&#39;mores, pulled pork, cheesecake, doughnuts - too many tasty treats to mention. With so much choice it was tough to decide what to sample but being a massive falafel fan I opted for a stall that sold various types of falafel - it was the best I have ever had.<br><br>When I was visiting New York was in the middle of a heatwave so the views across the River to the Manhattan skyline were breathtaking.

Classic chocolate chip cookie with great flavor. <br><br>The staff is made of entirely class acts.

"reviewcomment":"I had heard a lot of hype about Quality Meats leading up to my visit, yet friends and YELP reviews don&#39;t do this place justice. <br><br>From the decor to the knowledgeable staff to the wine and food, this place is simply sensational.  I started with the steak tartare. As someone who orders steak tartare whenever it appears on a menu, this was about as succulent, tender, and flavorful as a Tartare can be. The ability to mix in your own ingredients was a great touch as well. <br><br>For an entree, I went for the 24oz bone-in Rib Eye. While the bone is very large, the size of the steak will push any respectably hungry adult male to his limits (sorry ladies, this is a mans steak). Seasoned and cooked to perfection, it was easily the best steak I&#39;ve had in New York. <br><br>Already itching to come back ASAP!",

(somebody stop me).<br><br>And they make wonderful sandwiches.  We ordered a prosciute, muzzarel, roasted peppers, and basil sangwich on italian bread.  Firstly, the muzzarel is homemade.  Perfect texture and not too salty.  Second, their prosciute was buttery soft.  Sometimes, prosciute can bee too tough.  Not here though.  This hero was one of the better sandwiches I&#39;ve had in a long time.  Save for the corn-meal crumbs on the italian roll (dang corn-meal crumbs making a mess), it would&#39;ve been the perfect sangwich.<br><br>Moreover, the service was warm and welcoming.  The lady behind the counter who made our sangwiches really plays up the role of a typical Italian-American mother.  A lot of sass.  But she was nice and funny.  <br><br>So yeah, check this place out.",

As both of my parents are Chilean, I knew that this is exactly the place to pick out a wonderful bottle of wine for them!...it certainly didn&#39;t hurt that I purchased a nice one for myself as well. The selection was outstanding as you encountered the &#34;generic&#34; wine most often found in your local liquor store but, of course, had the more expensive bottles ($100+) for those looking for a memorable experience.  According to my uncle in Chile, I was able to purchase a very good bottle of Cabernet Sauvignon for only about $25!

I have tried a lot of froyo and can say I prefer this place for their tart yogurt. If you just want a mound of plain froyo, this is THE place. The portion is bigger than other places and the tart flavor is just the right blend of creamy, tart, and sweet. It was thick and not icy. This is NOT the place to go if you want self-serve, lots of toppings, or a big flavor selection though, so be warned (and there&#39;s definitely a time and place for that).",

"reviewcomment":"Polar Vortex, what? My frostbitten fingers may barely be able to grasp the spoon, but I can't help but crave Culture constantly. Th flavors are creative, seasonal, and incredibly delicious - it's honestly the best fro yo I've had. Ever. From watermelon cilantro, lemon thyme, and strawberry basil in the summer, to pumpkin pie, caramel apple, and egg nog in the colder months... I've never had a thing I didn't LOVE. They always have some more familiar flavors on rotation every day, like triple berry, mango, banana cream pie, nutella, and original, which is always a sure bet. Everything's fat-free except for the organic, full-fat flavor of the day for $1 extra, and I hear it's worth every penny and every calorie.<br><br>Culture's yogurt is the perfect amount of creamy and tart, and it truly tastes like healthy frozen Greek yogurt. The prices are sweeter than the yogurt at $3.49 for a mini, with one topping included. It's a spacious spot with plenty of seating, and some of the BEST service in the entire city. Jonathan rocks and does everything with a smile, and I dare you to try to leave this place in a bad mood. You know what they say - you are what you eat - and he is as chill and cool as the fro yo here. <br><br>TIP: Have the best day EVER and get some Culture, then head directly across the street to Shun Fa Relaxing Center for an hour-long foot rub for $25. It really, really doesn't get better than that.",

Though it was a bit of a drive, it was so worth it!!!<br><br>Service: Out of this world, friendly! The guy behind the counter not only greeted us, but offered to explain what everything was since it was our first time at the bakery.<br><br>Pastries: We opted for the Italian cheesecake, pumpkin cheesecake, strawberry shortcake, apple turnover, and cannoli. The apple turnover was warm, chewy/crunchy, and perfectly flavored. The cannoli was crunchy and absolutely delicious. The cream is freshly piped upon ordering and was a bit on the sweet side, but paired with a cappuccino? Perfection! The pumpkin cheesecake was okay; I found the pumpkin flavor too subtle. The Italian cheesecake was AMAZING! Yum! A must try! Their award winning strawberry shortcake delivered as promised! So light and fluffy! Delicious! So good, in fact, that I&#39;m running straight to the fridge after this to finish it!<br><br>Price: Very fair for the quality of the pastries and service! <br><br>Everything here is fresh including their whipped cream! Will definitely have to come back here to try their cookies and other goodies!",

"reviewcomment":"Holy mother of breakfast sandwiches. What the what. THIS PLACE!<br><br>Was visiting a friend in NY and she had work on Friday, so I bummed around her area. First stop of the day? This place. Needless to say it started off my visit right. I got a bacon egg and cheese with salt and pepper on a roll. The line was long but quick. Two eggs wrapped around a generous helping of bacon and cheese, in a soft roll. Now, I would&#39;ve ordered the roll toasted if all things were even, but that would&#39;ve been a mistake, because this roll was fresh, soft and delicious.<br><br>This was hands down the best breakfast sandwich I ever had.<br><br>If I didn&#39;t have any pride or shame or fear of recognition, I would&#39;ve gone back for lunch in a heartbeat a couple hours later. I was mad I didn&#39;t. The next day, before my flight, battling time and a terrible hangover, I made my friend take me there before hopping in a cab to the airport. They couldn&#39;t do it twice, could they? THEY DID. I know it&#39;s pretty ridiculous how excited I am about the goodness of these breakfast sandos, but a bacon egg and cheese sandwich is singlehandedly the most important food in my life, and I haven&#39;t had one near this good since 2007. I know it&#39;s a simple thing, but they somehow make it magical.<br><br>I&#39;m so mad I don&#39;t live in NY. Do you deliver to San Francisco?",

It&#39;s super soft, with the perfect flaky outside with sliced almonds. I could seriously have three of these. (You can split one in half if you&#39;d like, but I suggest you just eat it all...it&#39;s hard to share)<br><br>The baguettes are super good when warmed up to perfection, having the cheese melt and fuse with the ham... omg. The Mango-Kiwi mini cakes give a nice boost of sweetness without going overboard. (So if you&#39;re diabetic, you&#39;ll be okay with one)<br><br>The napoleon...I could have everyday. It&#39;s so flaky, so fresh, so wow. Much yum.<br><br>Everything in here is great, really. I can&#39;t pick which is better. (The almond croissant. It beats everything.)<br><br>The line can get pretty long on Fridays &amp; Saturdays, especially during the morning. But it&#39;s worth the wait &amp; they attend pretty quickly. You can have a seat somewhere &amp; chat away if you&#39;d like.

"reviewcomment":"We noticed the shop on the way to the nursery down the street so we dropped in, and omg Mookie the pup stole my heart!!! He&#39;s perfection: territorial and protective of his human but super curious, sweet, and gentle. We played (aka i scratched) for a good 15 mins before I finally tore myself away from him to look around. Not only do they host the cutest pup in Red Hook, they also have a wonderful, varied selection of wine and liquor. AND the customer service is fantastic. We FINALLY located a bottle of Blanton&#39;s (tried 5 different shops this wk; everyone&#39;s out of stock due to Christmas sales). And we got some recommendations for Syrahs, which I&#39;m excited to try, from very knowledgable and friendly staff. It&#39;s a small-ish shop, but the layout is well-conceived and maximized so that it never feels cramped.<br><br>I&#39;m so glad we stopped by and can&#39;t wait to visit again. See ya soon, Mookie!!",

It&#39;s for French people, not Asians&#34; in a rather strong accent. Then opens the fridge and hits us up with &#34;wine for Asians&#34;. <br><br>IT WAS SO GOOD. And worth it. And hilarious.

"reviewcomment":"I&#39;ve been looking for a good place to buy quality suds since moving to the city from the beer loving Pacific Northwest, and I&#39;ve definitely found that place in Malt &amp; Mold.  My favorite thing about this place is the growlers, which you can fill from any of the taps which are always rotating with beer from local breweries and breweries around the country.  Also, in addition to the standard 64 oz growler and the half size 32 oz, they have 16.5 oz growlers (real flip top growlers, not silly mason jars).  These are great if, like me, you&#39;d rather try a small amount of a variety of beers than get a whole bunch of one thing.  The selection of bottled beer is awesome as well, with a lot of hard to find things in stock.<br>They also have a ton of high quality cheese, meat, bread, and the like.  Unfortunately artisanal cheese doesn&#39;t fit in my grad student budget, but it all looks wonderful.<br>And of course, the owner Kevin is helpful, knowledgable, and takes a genuine interest in his customers.<br>Definitely worth the regular trip from Harlem!",

I never give up an oppurtunity to try an italian style sandwich, and needless to say, I couldnt be more happy that I stumbled upon this gem of a food spot.<br><br>This was a long time ago, when Diso&#39;s was still working out the kinks. I have been going back to them every week, trying different things on the menu. I have yet to be disappointed. The quality of the bread, meats, veggies, and spreads are truly the freshest I have had in the city. Diso&#39;s continues to satisfy.<br><br>You truly get that neighborhood vibe waiting for your sandwich. The guys in the back are always talkative and happy to bust your chops. It is all around an experience you will seldom find outside the classic Italian neighborhoods.<br><br>This is the first (and probably only) review I will ever write, but Diso&#39;s is that worth it. There has not been a single trip here that I have been disappointed. and all this from a food truck! All said and done, Diso&#39;s deserves every bit of success coming their way. Bravo guys!",

I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll ever purchase meat from a chain grocery again.<br><br>The staff at Morscher&#39;s couldn&#39;t be nicer. When Rusty and I visited for the first time, one of the butchers gave us a tour of the entire establishment and walked us through all of the meats and other goods that they have to offer. Since then, we&#39;ve been regulars and purchase all of our steaks, pork chops and sausages here. <br><br>Having a party? Grab some of their &#34;tv stick&#34; sausages.<br>Smoked, not smoked, spicy, non-spicy, they really have something for everyone!<br>Huge pork tenderloins, thick bacon, delicious cheeses. Tons of European canned goods, jellies, cookies. Don&#39;t be afraid to ask questions and don&#39;t be afraid to leave with a bag full of delicious meats!<br><br>They take credit cards ($10 minimum).",

"reviewcomment":"This is the best tasting Blue Bottle location in NYC but my least favorite to get to, as it is hidden in an office building basement. I first discovered Blue Bottle in San Francisco and I can assure you this is about as close as you can get to the taste you get there. The baristas here really, really know what they are doing and the shots they pull are virtually the best I have had in NYC.<br><br>So yeah, this place is really small and intense and really hard to get to, but I promise the shots pulled here are MUCH better than the other NYC Blue Bottle locations. The espresso here is acidic, with a deep crema and an almost smoky bite. But that is Blue Bottle and, for me, that is heaven.<br><br>If you make the hike to bowels of Rock Center plaza (it is down the center lobby stairs and then down a hall to the left, by Wichcraft) make sure to get the Parmesan Shortbread. Oh my, this Parmesan Shortbread. I would happily eat myself to oblivion with this stuff if I could somehow get it near my apartment. <br><br>Anyway, I wish this wasn&#39;t the tastiest Blue Bottle outpost (because it definitely isn&#39;t the easiest to get to) but unfortunately it is. So, good luck and bring your compass!",

I found the prices to be a lot cheaper than Long Island and the quality authentic.<br>They have a full catering menu and it would be worth the drive from Long Island to get food for the Big Game.

It was a Red Velvet Cake and it was moist and delicious. It was decorated in Fall colors with leaves and flowers and it was gorgeous. The frosting was silky smooth and not too sweet.

"reviewcomment":"This is my favorite pastry shop in the area! Everything I have tried here from cookies, tarts, to Greek spinach pie (Finally, a bakery with savory breads!!), are all well made and delicious. Always make me want to go for seconds.<br><br>Tucked away in a plaza with parking in the front and very close to Ditmars-Astoria stop of N and Q train, Artopolis feels quite refined with the decor and the presentation of their goods. It is pricier but you can see that being reflected on the quality of the pastries and bread. There are decent chunks of hazelnut in the said nut cookies. Unlike store brought ones, where the nuts are chopped so small you&#39;ll never get the full taste of the actual hazelnut. <br><br>The front section of the shop has a selection of cookies by the pound. Their cookies turn into buttery crumbs when you bite into them and are not overly sweet. Yum! Followed by a corner station of savory breads, then pies, tarts and any other dessert that requires refrigeration e.g. tiramisu and cheesecakes. Being a Greek bakery shop, Artopolis has a wide selection of Greek specialties: melomakarono, baklava (different types!), kourabides, toulumbes, and a bunch more of other tasty looking stuff I have no idea what they are!<br><br>Artopolis also serves tea and coffee drinks, they have a limited number of seating in the shop. Everyone I brought here so far have enjoyed this bakery, including my in law (*pats off some cold sweat*).",

The selection is very good and the prices are in line with the stores of the area, but its the staff that sets this store apart. They are always super friendly and are very very knowledgeable about their product. They make great recommendations and are always ready to help. They may not look like your typical spittoon using wine connoisseur, but they can certainly explain the difference between a Mourvèdre and a Grenache. Salud!",

I started reading reviews while kids were picking their books and decided to try this place.<br><br>Like most of the reviews, I was able to try couple of flavors before buying it. And I liked everything i tried. I ended up with 8 cupcakes and they were great. Like other reviews, owner here is very nice and you can see he cares about customers. They have a small quarter size cakes for testing. I was looking for guava flavor (again looking from the reviews as one of their best flavor) but they didn&#39;t had any guava sample for testing. At this owner offered the whole cupcake to try it and it was delicious. 3 out 8  I picked were guava!",

A hot cup of it during the chilly winter always warms me up and keep me happy for the rest of the day. They also have a stamp card with a free drink after every ten stamps.

It is not dissimilar from drinking half a melted chocolate bar, slightly diluted (which is how I make it at home). You can feel the warm thick liquid as it goes down and makes everything right with the world (temporary effect).<br><br>Who cares that it also happens to be in a be in a beautiful space or that you are practically sitting on your neighbor&#39;s lap?

La Maison du chocolate to the rescue! I debated between here and teuscher but convenience won out.  <br><br>Service was impeccable and while I was suggested a bigger box of chocolates, the little &#34;diet&#34; friendly box won out.  This store is a gem and there&#39;s even a restaurant attached.  The manager even signed me up for the chocolate club where I will get special invites to events.

They&#39;re not for display, when you go up to the truck and order a wrap, he cuts up a tomato for you to put in the wrap. Takes the marinating chicken cubes or kibbeh balls or whatever you order out of the fridge, and puts it on the grill for you. Plucks a few fresh mint leaves off a stem and puts them in the wrap. It&#39;s all made to order, all unbelievably fresh, and top quality. And the wraps are all five bucks right now, although I can&#39;t imagine how he&#39;s going to keep that up. <br><br>I go out of my way to eat at this place, and in a neighborhood with lots of amazing food options, that&#39;s saying something. If you are craving a quick, fresh, healthy meal that you can eat with one hand, come by the Pita prince, this guy will hook you up. <br><br>I think he&#39;s mostly there afternoons until late night ...",

"reviewcomment":"I love this place.  I&#39;ve never really had a regular coffee shop, but I was fortunate enough to move in right around the corner from this place.  I was skeptical at first since there&#39;s a grumpy&#39;s down the street and I knew their quality but i eventually started coming here over there.  I&#39;ll only go to grumpy&#39;s (or others in the area) only if De Luxe is closed (mondays or if they are on vacation, which is rare.)<br><br>Even my sister that was visiting from Seattle who lives right down the street from a really good coffee shop there said this was the &#34;best skim latte&#34; she&#39;s ever had.  I had actually never heard her rave about something like she did with this skim latte.<br><br>Ya the place is small, but so what?  it adds to the vibe of the place.  Certain times of the day they have their rush so it might be tough to get a seat and sit (weekends, mid to late morning, typically).  If you go at the right time, then it usually isn&#39;t a problem.  <br><br>No wifi?  Meh. Sometimes it&#39;s great to be at a place where you&#39;re forced to disconnect (well, at least from your laptop, b/c you most likely have your phone, right?)<br><br>I drink mainly espresso and Andy puts a lot of attention into his craft of making a single shot (technically double per shot).  He&#39;s always switching up the blends, but they always taste great.  <br><br>Tina (she&#39;s the one with the beard) does a bang up job with the food.  The egg sammy is done with a hard boiled egg (which I thought was crazy) but tastes amazing.  The soppressata is mind=blowing as well.  Hell, they even have a sandoozle with some sort of truffle oil on it (fig and ricotta) that&#39;s definitely worth a try.  Ya the bread is a little hard, but I think that&#39;s kind of the norm for baguettes in the states (at least for me in recent memory), but it&#39;s still tasty.  I forgot, the hummus adam sandler is actually on whole wheat and some of best homemade hummus i&#39;ve had.  <br><br>For people complaining about the iced coffee - it is definitely cold-brewed and is waaaaaaay better than any crap star*ucks could make.  If you&#39;re comparing this place to there, then you really just don&#39;t care much about what you&#39;re actually drinking.",

Definitely some exotic flavors worth trying. <br><br>Just with the flavor options, the natural homemade taste and the attention and patience of Mariano this place get 5 stars and my continuous patronage.

To be able to get a jar for yourself without having to worry about trying to find a place to store it at home.<br><br>The people there are very nice !! It was a wonderful trip !! I also noticed that they sell soy-free eggs !!<br><br>Bulk sections include oil, molasses,  pasta, flour, nuts, shampoo &amp; conditioner, possibly loose tea leaves (and sucanat ?),  and ect. <br><br>You don&#39;t have to worry about GMOs here and knowing that they take credit cards makes it easier to shop instead of trying to track down an atm.",

"reviewcomment":"This place is awesome. Mariano is the best. He pleasantly allowed my wife to taste several flavors before she made up her mind, as there are about 15+ flavors available at a time. She ended up choosing the Nutella and Pistachio, which he scooped in a 3 scoop cone as a thank you for coming by, even though she only wanted 2 scoops. I had the Nutella, Guanabana, and Lucume. Definitely some exotic flavors worth trying. <br><br>Just with the flavor options, the natural homemade taste and the attention and patience of Mariano this place get 5 stars and my continuous patronage. El Unico Restaurant for lunch, the Cremas for desert, made our day off of work complete.",

"reviewcomment":"This summer was the first time I&#39;d shopped at Blue Moon Fish at the Tribeca market on Saturdays. I am hooked. Most of the fish is so fresh, that it can be served as sashima that day (and I have eaten seared and mostly raw the next day for lunch). I have gotten so spoiled for freshness that I feel only like eating fish on Saturdays... It has made the recent loss of the restaurant quality cuts at Bouley Market really liveable. I say that not because it is less fresh but because unless you&#39;re there by 3pm, its *sob* all over and they are leaving us for the winter, which is soon.<br><br>I love this place. I have eaten about 5 kinds of the fish sashimi style - striped sea bass, yellowfin tuna, tuna, scallops, makheral. and of course, the oysters which are of the east coast variety, a little dauntingly large on the half shell, but sooo fresh.",

"reviewcomment":"The first time I had a snoball was at the Hester Street Fair. I couldn&#39;t narrow down my selection so I asked if they could make some concoction that was colorful. I&#39;m pretty sure it was some sort of lavender color with condensed milk. It tasted great and when the weather was warmer I suggested a group of us go make the trip to their ever changing (it seems as though this is the case) location on Gansevoort. My brother had pineapple, my boyfriend had red velvet with condensed milk and I had a concoction of flavors (it was gay pride day and I was trying to create a rainbow, but instead it looked like a geode...it tasted fabulous nonetheless). It was a great way to cool off. Excellent service!<br><br>They&#39;re closed for now (cold weather months) but I believe they will be back in the spring. All their info is on their Facebook page.",

There are few cities in the US that offer such an unique shopping experience and the walking skyline path is amazing! I visited Chelsea Market with my friend and her mom to pick up some seafood from The Lobster Place and cake from Amy&#39;s Bread. Her mom will not buy her seafood from anywhere else! Well needless to say, a grocery run turned into a 4 hour shopping/sightseeing adventure. We picked up some spicy shrimp soup from The Lobster Place and got a hummus sandwich from Amy&#39;s Bread to complete the lunch. It was amazing! Also, we stopped at this random organic vegetarian shop and got mango lassies which were AMAZE-BALLS!!!! We finished the day off at a knick knack store across from The Lobster Place and bought the most amazing rose and lavender lotion. <br><br>I so love visiting Chelsea Market and it is the one place that I plan to take all my family and friends when they visit.",

I loved every flavors they have to offer - peach yogurt, a la mode, ferrero, ginger snap, chiquita, biscotti - just the few that I&#39;ve tried and can&#39;t get enough so far! <br><br>In addition, they are extremely generous (the 1 scoop is HUGE), so patient (sample as many flavors as you want), and they allow you to mix your 1 scoop with 2 flavors! For just $4, I get my 1 giant scoop in a waffle cone - so satisfying! (they are currently offering $5 paypal offer - on my first visit, my cone was free!)<br><br>Will definitely return to try the other flavors - heard about the goat milk ice cream - ah can&#39;t wait for it to return for the season!",

"reviewcomment":"Reaffirming most of my prior review, I want to upgrade this place as I have continued to come here and find the service consistently helpful, patient, and kind, and also relish the addition of some excellent items on the homemade snack bar. Check out the sunflower seed crunch, yogurt peanuts, and chocolate covered pretzels: the fifth star is because the chocolate is actually good-quality dark chocolate! For five bucks, you get a nice snack pack that will easily last the work week. <br><br>Top quality values here:<br><br>* Homemade pita (unlabeled)--this is the best thing in the store! But usually sold out by afternoon :-(<br>* House blend coffee<br>* Feta cheeses, $4-8 by the pound<br>* Homemade spreads (fridge section)<br>* nuts, snacks, and dried fruits (available self serve; check out the ~$5 boxes)<br><br>Still can&#39;t recommend the olive bar as consistent and since tasting is not allowed or courteous; I still don&#39;t usually buy here, unless I will eat a lot in a day or will cook with them.",

It was a little out of the way from my office, but it always provided such a wonderful break from work.  I would stumble over the broken cobblestone roads to La Colombe and forget about the world for a little while, and simply enjoy a rejuvenating coffee break.  Sometimes I would sit at the corner table by the window and close my eyes and fill my mind with coffee.  Nothing but coffee.  The taste.  The smell.  The feel of the rich warmth on my palette.  <br><br>I can&#39;t wait to go home to NYC to visit so I can enjoy this nostalgia again.  <br><br>Thank you for the best coffee breaks in the history of the world.",

"reviewcomment":"Lacryma Christi! Not a curse nor a lament, it&#39;s the name of my favorite red wine (literally means Tears of Christ), made from grapes growing on Mount Vesuvius in Pompeii. After my last trip to Naples, I was hooked and it wasn&#39;t so easy to find in NYC (I can&#39;t find it anywhere in New Orleans, sadly). Enter West Street Wine.<br><br>We go way back. When I worked at a bar nearby 5 years ago, this is where I&#39;d stop on the way to work to have my own provisions for the night (the bar I worked at had shitty wine) to share with my good friend, who was also the sound guy. We&#39;d drown our sorrows as we watched whatever shitty band or comedian I had booked on a Tuesday night, not unlike Christ crying over Lucifer&#39;s fall from heaven, lending divine fertility to the soil that would later be mixed with ash. Then we&#39;d drink another bottle as we walked home to Brooklyn, all the way from Downtown, through Chinatown and the LES and over the Williamsburg Bridge. Once there, we&#39;d be so sotted that one of us would climb to the top of the damn thing. Which one? Hint: not the one wearing platform boots. THOSE were the days.<br><br>I stopped in to West Street Wine most recently when staying with my friend who lived in the area, grabbed two or four bottles of Lacryma Christi and relived old memories. A reasonably priced red table wine, West Street charges a fair price, as I&#39;ve seen it sold for as much as $5 more a bottle elsewhere. <br><br>I also stopped in here on for my New Year&#39;s bottle of Nicolas Feuillatte, also at a good price. I figure they can charge more because it&#39;s pretty much the only liquor store in the area. And oh, they deliver, too.",

Moist and sweet, speckled with plump raisins and a crunchy oat topping! It was incredible.<br>Not stopping there, I also tried the oatmeal cookie, which was soft and exactly how I love my oatmeal cookies. I got some of the cookies and gave them to my carnivorous friends, who devoured them in seconds never having know they ate something vegan, because they&#39;ve repeatedly told me that they don&#39;t like vegan food because it&#39;s so bland and boring. <br>Their savory turnovers are also great, the rice and black bean one is my favorite. It&#39;s flavorful and has just the right amount of &#34;kick&#34; to it. <br>If you&#39;re vegan, vegetarian, or just like good food, check out the Body and Soul stand in Union Square.

"reviewcomment":"After seeing Magdalena T.&#39;s ROTD for this place a few weeks ago, I looked up Caprices by Sophie&#39;s website and was instantly intrigued by their menu specializing in &#34;Magic Choux&#34; (cream puffs) and &#34;Merveilleux&#34; (cream-filled meringues).<br><br>My friend and I decided to check it out one Saturday afternoon, and as we walked through the door, I immediately fell in love with the sunny, whimsical interior. There&#39;s ample seating along one wall, complete with pillows for added coziness. On the other side, all of the pastries are displayed in neat little rows, their pops of color lending to the colorfulness of the decor. There&#39;s an entire menu for coffee, breakfast, and lunch, but we decided to stick with the pastries (since that was what we had come for, duh).<br><br>They have several different flavors of Magic Choux and Merveilleux, ranging from the more commonplace (chocolate, vanilla, caramel) to the more exotic (champagne, speculoos, pink praline). We decided to get four different ones to try--<br>- Rose &amp; Raspberry Choux: I started off with a small bite off the edge and was hit with a very sweet rose flavor. On my second bite, I got to the raspberry filling, which was a little more tart. Overall, I really liked the combination of flavors.<br>- Champagne Choux: Not as sweet as the other choux, but texture-wise, it was definitely the most interesting out of all the ones we tried. The popping sugar on top tasted like Pop Rocks!<br>- Cappuccino Merveilleux: The meringue shell was incredibly light and airy. It was packed with cappuccino cream, which was delicious but started falling out of the shell and getting messy after a bite.<br>- Pink Praline Merveilleux: The outside was coated with candied pralines, making the texture a little chewier. This was the sweetest one out of the four we tried, and also my favorite - though it was so sweet that I don&#39;t think I&#39;d be able to handle more than two of these at a time. <br><br>We lucked out in terms of the weather that day, because it happened to be a whopping 65 degrees on the first day of winter... so we were able to enjoy our Choux and Merveilleux in the gorgeous outdoor garden! The garden was seriously huge - enough for plenty of tables and chairs, a giant communal table, and a large grassy area in the middle. The ivy-covered walls and sounds of birds chirping almost made me forget that it was the middle of December.<br><br>At $2.75 per Choux and $2.50 per Merveilleux, these treats might seem expensive for their size, but they&#39;re so yummy that you won&#39;t be able to resist buying a brunch to try. Combined with the charming atmosphere, Caprices by Sophie is definitely a place I wouldn&#39;t mind spending all day in.",

"reviewcomment":"After sampling bits and pieces of the amazing selection that La Maison du Chocolat has to offer, I have concluded that I would really only come back for the macarons, given that I am limited by money (else I&#39;d come here all the time).<br><br>Their macarons (6 for $16.50) are little (but not too little!) bits of chocolatey heaven. No matter which flavors you choose (champagne, vanilla, hazelnut, dark chocolate, pistachio, lemon, cocoa, and a few more...), they will be generously filled with rich chocolate goodness. I&#39;m a die-hard chocolate lover, which is why I prefer these over ones from Ladurée. <br><br>The hot chocolate (~$9.50 after tax) is also very rich and creamy. It comes with a piece of chocolate that you can drop into the hot drink to make it even more chocolatey, sweet, and thick--but only if you want to. Otherwise you can just eat it (though it doesn&#39;t taste very good on its own). It&#39;s nice that you have the option to semi-customize your own drink. <br>Though it&#39;s good, $10 for a small cup of hot chocolate is quite pricey. I would highly recommend hot chocolate from Jacques Torres (<a href='http://www.yelp.com/biz/jacques-torres-chocolate-brooklyn#hrid:QPDTWP8tT4iqgOfNcARtew'>yelp.com/biz/jacques-tor…</a>) or LA Burdick instead for half the price. The drink tastes about the same at all 3 locations, and it is even thicker at Jacques Torres than at La Maison.<br><br>Individual chocolates/truffles (~$1.50 apiece) here are pretty good, but my commoner taste buds probably wouldn&#39;t be able to distinguish between chocolate pieces of the same flavor from here and Godiva. One thing I do like, though, is that they have chocolate infused with mocha arabica. Yum.",

I come here about 5 times a week and get my usual hot coffee and a breakfast or lunch sandwich. The staff is so friendly and I have grown close to two of them. The owner Sam is my man and he keeps the atmosphere appropriately light with a great set of music and a whole lot of smiles.  I usually come here to do work and explore the internet and they have never ever made a comment to me about moving to make room for others. It&#39;s one of those coffee shops where strangers sit together and everyone is happy to be there. <br><br>Best stuff on their menu: <br><br>-Egg Sandwich<br>-Chicken Sandwich<br>-Thanksgiving Sandwich<br><br>I hope this place thrives and drives Le Pain Quotidien out of business next door.",

The tastings (on Friday) are truly a BKLYN must stop!!! <br><br>We had one bad batch of spirits from a local whiskey distiller and the owner was so caring about his customers and business you would of thought he owned the distillery himself..!! That&#39;s just how it goes at Grapeshot.<br><br> I know many who would give it TEN stars if they could. LOVE it!<br><br>Oh yeah, the prices are beautifully displayed in an &#34;eco fashion&#34; manner  on recycled cork labels-- RIGHT in front of you. Someone in one review said this is not displayed.. well, go look for yourself. This way no paper is used to clutter.<br><br>Finally, it worth a trip to see this how amazing this establishment is designed. WOW -- Steiner Studios and everyone is very lucky to have this super cool place in BKLYN.<br><br>Go Grapeshot!",

"reviewcomment":"One of the only Italian bakeries left in Sunset Park. <br><br>When you walk in, you are greeted by a lovely old Italian grandma who says, &#34;GOOD MORNING.&#34; <br>When I ask her what&#39;s good, she says, &#34;EVERYTHING.&#34; <br><br>Like the service, the pastries are sweet, but not overly sweet. Since discovering this bakery in the midst of Mexican restaurants of Sunset Park, I can tell it is very special. It delivers all you could want from a bakery like Veniero&#39;s, but it doesn&#39;t have the hype surrounded it. This keeps the prices low and our bellies full. After selecting a series of cakes, I must say I cannot choose a favorite. The strawberry shortcake was very rich, almost like a wedding cake. The strawberry jelly enhanced the flavor of the butter cream just a bit. The tiramisu was perfumed with liquor and had traces of salt and other spices. The chocolate mousse was light and airy and full of flavor. The cookies are fresh and delicious. This Italian family definitely knows what they are doing and have been doing it for years.",

"reviewcomment":"Red red wine...plus a great variety of whites, rose and sparkling wines! Plenty of spirits and liquors at super reasonable prices! :)<br><br>Stuff here is organized by location - so France, Italy, Chile, etc. all have their own special section. I&#39;ve been here a few times now as it&#39;s my neighborhood liquor store, but yesterday probably took the cake for me (so to speak).<br><br>I was literally down to the wire wish putting finishing details on a dinner I was hosting for my mom and boyfriend to meet each other when about 15 minutes before his expected arrival I realized, ALL I HAVE IS WHITE WINE!!! HE LIKES RED WINE ONLY!!! Not to mention my momma also prefers red. Being the selfish alchy that I am (my mom has a few glasses of wine like three times a year, lol) I only really stock whites/rose for my tastes.<br><br>Knowing already what type of red everyone would like wasn&#39;t the problem, it was wanting it to be something more special is what I was struggling with...and I&#39;ve got only 10 minutes to find the right bottle! ACK!<br><br>Normally the boy and I got for a Tempranillo or something similar - sweet, not too dry, not too spicy, a little smoky is fine. But when I went to France in September and brought him back a bottle of Côtes du Rhône, he absolutely loved it - as did I, and I knew my mom would too...I was determined to have a repeat experience and have a Côtes du Rhône with dinner.<br><br>I&#39;m also not the type of gal that goes into any store and immediately asks for help. I went in here, went straight to the France section, couldn&#39;t find it. Frowned since it&#39;s not the first time a place doesn&#39;t carry it so I grabbed a Tempranillo and hightailed it to the register. <br><br>The young guy there was about to ring me up and I decided to (nicely) blurt out, &#34;Do you guys carry any Côtes du Rhône?&#34;. This guy didn&#39;t even blink an eye, he was like - yep. Bolted for the France section and pointed out 2 types. He even chuckled at my original Tempranillo grab and enlightened my by saying that Tempranillo is simply the Spanish version of Côtes du Rhône and is made with a similar type of grape (I found it a little hard to believe with each country/city having such a vastly different climate) but at the end of the day, I was guided, given wine I wanted, a little more educated about the reds that I enjoy and all in what felt like 10 minutes. He was a lifesaver! :D<br><br>The wine was delicious and now I love Colony even more! Who0t!!!",

"reviewcomment":"It&#39;s big, it&#39;s organized, it&#39;s always stocked heavily and it&#39;s right up the street from my crib.  Therefore, this is my go-to liquor store.  If you&#39;re in the immediate area and want some funky cold medina, this is the place you need to go to.  There really isn&#39;t anything you can&#39;t find here.<br><br>The owners are extremely chill and are very amicable.  If you need assistance, they will be more than willing to help.  After coming in one night to grab a bottle of Ciroc Coconut for a house party, one of the owners, in his heavy accent asks, &#34;Why you buy that for? Because of the P Diddy?&#34;  He directed me to a cheaper coconut vodka called Pearl.  It was a good call.  There&#39;s a vast array of whatever your favorite poison is.  If you walk in on the right Friday night, you might even get lucky with a complimentary tasting of whatever new brand is on the scene.<br><br>However, I do most of my wine purchasing here.  Not for anything super fancy.  Just standard table wine to have in the crib when I&#39;m chilling or having dinner with my girlfriend.  They also carry my favorite prosecco, Mionetto (look for the big orange label).  It&#39;s perpetually in stock.  We use that instead of regular champagne for mimosas.  I&#39;ve been known to wipe the place clean of these bottles when I have brunch w/ friends at my apartment.<br><br>I&#39;ll gladly continue to give L &amp; P my money as long as my liver will allow me.  My only issue with the place is that I also play my Lotto here and I haven&#39;t won yet.",

Things we always get: Italian cheesecake by the lb., tiramisu, double almond croissant (YUM!), anything with chocolate in it, cakes, cookies, pies....  The list goes on and on; that&#39;s just the beginning.

Don&#39;t go to the one between 76th &amp; 77th; it&#39;s nowhere near as good. This one&#39;s between 77th and 78th. Even I have walked past it a couple of times. When you look in the window you just see little tables, because the bakery counter is toward the back.

I often call asking for recommendations, and every bottle they&#39;ve chosen and delivered has been reasonably priced and great. <br><br>I left my phone there once. They tracked me down, and then told me they would hold it until my party was over so I wouldn&#39;t have to leave the event early. So great!",

"reviewcomment":"I celebrated my birthday at Bosie Tea Parlor with several girl friends (+2 boys)! Bosie is an absolutely darling tea parlor nestled in the west village, and we all traipsed in dressed in our summer dresses (on a cold winter afternoon) for the occasion. <br><br>I ordered the Bosie Tea Service for 2, which comes with the following per person:<br><br>- 2-cup pot of tea (includes most teas on the menu)<br>- 2 mini scones with clotted cream and jam<br>- 3 portions of tea sandwiches<br>- 2 mini tea cakes<br>- Choice of two macarons<br><br>When you order tea service for 2, the food comes out on this adorable 3-tiered serving platter.  It might not sound like a lot of food but my boyfriend and I were actually stuffed by the end. <br><br>The cucumber sandwiches were yummy, along with my jasmine and rose macarons. I just love how delicate and dainty tea sandwiches look. The tea cakes were dense and moist, with green tea being my favorite. Since I usually order savory items for brunch, the sweet pastries became a little overwhelming towards the end.<br><br>Tea service is a bit on the expensive side ($29 for one, $55 for two), but very comparable to other tea parlors I&#39;ve been to in the city like Lady Mendl&#39;s Tea Saloon. If you&#39;re not in the mood for tea they also have a great brunch menu. I tried a friend&#39;s lorraine quiche - absolutely delicious! If I come back I&#39;m definitely trying the brunch menu.",

"reviewcomment":"This is my neighborhood wine store, Pour never lets me down. <br>Why is it so great? Here is why: <br><br>1. It is reasonable. You think if you go to a wine store that a lot of the inventory is going to comprise of more expensive wine, like $50 and up. At Pour you won&#39;t find a bottle over $40, and they&#39;re few and far between. You can get a great bottle of wine for $15. That is something special, and not enough props can be given for that.  <br><br>2. The service is super. If I need a recommendation, the owner always gives me a superb recommendation at my price point. I would drink anything he recommended at this point. <br><br>3. You get a lot for your money. I&#39;ve never had a bottle of wine here and thought, &#34;this wasn&#39;t worth it.&#34; <br><br>4. They have a rewards program, so if you buy a certain amount of wine, you get a little off your next purchase. At an already fair price. <br><br>I&#39;m very devoted to Pour, and would highly recommend it to anyone.",

The line is separated into the longer-cooking ramen and faster-turnaround udon. The ingredients are out and ready at 11:30 as before. I&#39;ve had three great experiences, and I&#39;m very happy that my old standby lunch is back to being a quick and delicious meal. Thanks!<br><br>OLD REVIEW:<br>Sorry, for the 1-rating, but I&#39;m actually just trying to get the owners attention. I used to think Manhattan Gourmet was a 5 for quick udon/ramen during the day. Unfortunately, the new soup guy is extremely slow, disorganized and inefficient. I used to be in and out in 3 minutes, but now I find myself standing around in a cramped deli for 10-15 minutes. PLEASE streamline the process and have all of the ingredients out by lunch service so we&#39;re not waiting.<br><br>Thanks!

It&#39;s so amazing, I bring most of my out-of-town guests here, hoping they will fall in love.<br><br>Features:<br>-Russian/Polish candies of all varieties (i.e. chocolate, fruit, marzipan, marshmallow, jelly, sugar-free) sold by the pound or boxed for gifting<br><br>-Every type of nut (i.e almond, cashew, peanut, hazlenut, macadamia, pistachio, pumpkin seed, sunflower seed) in every style imaginable (i.e. raw, salted, roasted, chocolate covered) sold in bulk<br><br>-All types of dried fruit (i.e. pineapple, peach, necatrine, strawberry, prune, date, fig, apple, sweet cherry, sour cherry, flavored cranberry, blueberry, and strawberry) also sold in bulk<br><br>-Specialty foods (coffee, tea, pastries, tahini, jam, cheese, olives, snack mixes, and beverages)<br><br>*All the above are unbelievably cheap, some as little as $1.99/lb*<br><br>Everytime I go to vintage, I get a little bit more than the time before, operating under the assumption that I will not be back in the near future. My basket usually contains 2 or 3 varieties of chocolates, raw hazlenuts, raw pumpkin seeds, dried sour cherries, dried nectarines, roasted cashews and chocolate covered cashews. A generous scoopful of each has NEVER costs me over $25, even when I am hell-bent on a splurge.<br><br>Drawbacks:<br>-Due to the cheap prices, this place can get EXTREMELY crowded, especially around the holidays<br><br>-Sometimes the staff looms over patrons. This is to deter people from snacking out of bins, which I have seen on almost every visit. <br><br>Overall, Vintage is the definition of a 5 star establishment; great staff, great product and great prices.",

"reviewcomment":"While the place might have two or more names (the sign says &#34;Bagel Supreme&#34; but this Yelp listing doesn&#39;t), I can honestly say these are some of the best bagels I have ever had, and I&#39;ve lived in Brooklyn my entire life.<br><br>Each bagel is handmade, and it shows. No two bagels are the same shape. The flavor that is embedded in these bagels is perfect. Each bite is doughy by not too doughy, slightly sweet, fluffy, and well-balanced for whatever spread you happen to choose. I have had their egg, everything, whole wheat everything and poppy seed bagels, and I have not been disappointed on any of them. <br><br>I almost always get their tuna salad, which also happens to be delicious and not over-dressed. You actually taste that it is tuna, as opposed to mayo with a little but of fish thrown in for good measure. Few things will get me to take the trip all the way to the end of the R line in Brooklyn just for the hell of it. These bagels are one of those things. HIGHLY recommended, 100%.",

Amazing coffee that they roast in Brooklyn, a cozy and comfortable space, nice baristas and they&#39;ll customize anything for you (dirty chai with a decaf espresso shot and soy milk - yes, I overheard this order once). <br><br>Oslo doesn&#39;t have wifi, but I actually like that. You don&#39;t have a hundred people getting on Facebook and surfing for three hours. This place is meant more for socializing and getting to know people. I know - socializing in real time in person and not online. Who would have thunk??<br><br>It&#39;s a total neighborhood spot, but I&#39;m a caffeine fiend and I&#39;ve tried virtually all the top coffee spots in the city (abraco, Everyman, La Colombe, Joe, Think, etc). Oslo ranks as one of the top places for me. It is just frickin awesome. <br><br>So save your taste buds. If you&#39;re in the hood, just go to Oslo. Support a local business instead of drinking burnt coffee in Starbucks. <br>PS: pastries are from Ceci Cela - get the almond croissant.",

A juice oasis in Hell&#39;s Kitchen!From out of town and was in dire need of a healthy dose of juice to reset from all the pizza and gourmet overload that the city has to offer. They offer both fresh pressed juices and packed ones to go. They also have a freezer case of all natural, raw and vegan grab and go food selections (cashew cheese ravioli, kale salads, chia seed pudding) I ended up buying a whole bag of goodies to stock up at the hotel: a few Super Citrus C&#39;s and a Very Veggie, a few shots to go (the E3 live and the vital shot) and a few gluten free cookies. Also picked Health Warrior Chia protein bars I&#39;ve been dying to try. Got a Hale to Kale freshly pressed and a PB acai bowl and wow, I&#39;m in heaven! The kale juice was super light and citrus-y, so tasty especially for a green juice. The PB acai bowl is a perfect light breakfast packed with protein, crafted with quickness and attention to detail (my bananas and cocoa nibs were expertly placed, I would have taken a photo if I didn&#39;t inhale it as fast as I did).

I hate, hate, hate Canal St for the obvious reasons, but decided to brave it since it&#39;s on the edge of TriBeCa, which means I only have to suffer 1-2 blocks of Canal St. <br><br>From the outside, the shop looked closed. Once I stepped inside, I was immediately greeted by the nice owner/manager? Who clearly knows everything in the store. I was shopping for a coworker.  We have a gummy bear semi-addiction in the office, so I thought I&#39;d step it up to the next level and bring a big gummy bear or an assortment of it.  They have the medium-sized gummy bears (not the 5-lb ginormous bear) and all sorts of gummy things, which was exactly what I was looking for. The guy was really nice and helpful, bringing more flavors from the storage drawers behind the counter when I was being ultra-nitpicky about my gummy bear. He put a bow around my prized gummy bear, which was a nice touch.  Love it.  Will be back to feed my gummy bear addiction next time.  Price seems reasonable.<br><br>It also looks like they have some old school candy I haven&#39;t seen anywhere else in a while.  Very cool, Candiworks, very cool...  I hope they get enough business to stick around for a long time.  $10 min charge for credit card.",

"reviewcomment":"What separates one coffee shop from another?  The coffee is usually always good, so for me it&#39;s the customer service, a welcoming atmosphere (incl many tables and good music-here, jazz), clean bathrooms, and a generous refill policy.  The Tea Bar has them all. <br><br>Yesterday I enjoyed a 20 oz cold-brewed coffee for 3.25.   But time passed and soon it was gone.   I looked over at my sad empty plastic cup.  As I plodded along on my laptop,  feeling sorry for myself and contemplating another visit to the counter, a young woman worker walked by and paused at my table.  I looked up.   Perhaps sensing my sadness at the prospect of paying full-price for another coffee, she cheerfully said, &#34;We offer refills.,&#34; which I took to mean, &#34;discounted refills.&#34;  Indeed. $2.  I will be returning.",

"reviewcomment":"Was walking past this place on Christmas morning and decided to stop in. So glad we did, b/c my fiance and I are hugeeee pickle fans. There was a sample plate of half-sours and after our first sample we ordered a quart of those! So good and just right. We went on to taste (and buy) the Spicy pickles (my fiance is in love with them) and the pickled mango. So glad we found this place and so glad they ship b/c we don&#39;t live in the area, but we will be ordering from them again and again. <br><br>The guy at the counter was suepr pleasant when it came to offering explanations for any and everything we wanted to try as well as offering sample after sample.",

"reviewcomment":"My boyfriend suggested this place after a misfortunate lunch at a unnamed Filipino restaurant down the street. He had been coming here for years with his family to get dessert after dinner. He did not disappoint. <br><br>Now this was what I&#39;m talking about when a mom and pop shop do it right! The whole place smelled of deliciously fresh baked pan de sal. When you step into the bakery you are greeted with lines, shelves and racks of Filipino pastries and breads, it&#39;s quite a beautiful sight to look at. <br><br>I will say get there early, cause the good stuff goes fast. This place was quite picked through when we got there, but it&#39;s ok cause it was the Sunday before Christmas. I know everybody was buying up the house for the holidays. <br><br>They also serve food in the back the portions are large, cost a little more than some Filipino restaurants down the road but it looked pretty good. Especially the half fried fish. All of the dishes are lovingly served on real plates which gives that nice home feeling and the tables and chairs in the back are nice and large, much like our diner table back home. <br><br>This place has been in business for more than 20 years and I can see why. Can&#39;t wait for the next visit!",

They have a huge selection of whole fish on ice, some really nice-looking fillets, and pieces of larger fish that they will cut for you into steaks. There&#39;s also some nice looking shellfish staples (mussels, shrimp, multiple kinds of scallops, oysters, lobsters, etc), although this isn&#39;t the kind of place that has 10 types of gourmet oysters. Staff are very attentive and will clean or fillet or do any kind of processing for you on the whole fish you select. I didn&#39;t look carefully, but there also freezer cases with really large packages of things like crab legs, etc. The prices overall are EXCELLENT, and the quality was great. We came home and cooked our bag of mussels and whole fish that night - not a single mussel had to be thrown out because it was cracked or had died (usually the supermarket bags are half dead and open!), and the fish was delicious and didn&#39;t have a trace of the &#34;fishiness&#34; that comes from unfresh seafood.<br><br>All in all, a great go-to fish market for your regular seafood needs!",

Although the strikingly similar logo to Pinkberry&#39;s initially turned us off (my advice would be to probably change that!), we decided to give it a go. And I&#39;m glad we did!! The frozen yogurt is the same brand as several small froyo places near our house in Chicago - it&#39;s a pretty common supplier to small businesses I&#39;ve seen. It&#39;s really good though!! Uptown Swirl has a lot topping selections, and the owner was a really nice guy. Also- come for the crepes!! We had the chicken, mushroom and Swiss crepe. The owner suggested to add pesto to it, and he was right. It was absolutely outstanding. We had to come back. I will definitely stop in the next time I am in NYC for some froyo and that stellar crepe!!",

"reviewcomment":"This review is mainly about the customer service but also about their brownie. <br><br>I recently moved to the UES and live down the street from William Poll. I&#39;m always walking by but usually never have time to stop in but this weekend I made it a point to go inside. I was really impressed with the prepared food selection they have in the refrigerators, as well as their deli counter. It was pretty busy when I walked and the owner (or owner&#39;s son) was busy tending to customers. After I spent a few minutes browsing the selections I was on my way out the door and the owner James greeted me. I told him I just moved to the area recently and he immediately welcomed me with a hug, kiss on the cheek and introduced himself. He told me about the store and how they offer catering services, etc. and then asked if I liked sweets. When I said yes he said I must have a brownie made from his mother&#39;s recipe and gave it to me as a gift. I had just come from brunch and wasn&#39;t the slightest bit hungry but took it graciously and thanked him. <br><br>The next day I finally got around to eating it and all I can say is WOW!! I&#39;m totally addicted now. The flavor is not too rich and has the perfect amount of sweetness. I also love that it has nuts and isn&#39;t gooey. I&#39;m looking forward to trying other food selections to get a more well rounded idea of their quality but for now I am so pleased to have such friendly neighbors. I truly appreciate James taking time to talk to me amongst the busy crowd and making me feel welcome to the area!",

"reviewcomment":"This is a godsend for Ft. Greene / Clinton Hill. Flavorful, super rich-tasting coffee made anyway you like it (10,000 or so brewing methods? yes please!). It is indeed some of the best coffee in NY or perhaps the universe, although I think every roaster and shop has a special thing going for itself that makes it hard to call any one of them the best (Toby&#39;s Estate for their pour overs, Cafe Grumpy with the Chemex, Blue Bottle for their New Orleans Iced Coffee, Joe Pro Shop in the city for their guest espresso, etc.). But even if you don&#39;t live in the hood, WTF is worth the trek, especially for their pour overs, siphons, and my personal favorite: the sock pot (I don&#39;t know of anywhere else in the city that uses this brewing method). It brings out so many flavors!<br><br>Great staff, too-- it&#39;s got that small-town feeling where they&#39;ll get to know your name and the way you like your order every time. Love it.",

And a little Parisian girl inside me dies every time you call these macaroons.<br><br>There is no seating. And Bisou Ciao serves no beverages. But they DO take credit cards, bless them, for goodness knows I have pushed my credit limit for these perfect cookies.<br><br>This is my FAVOURITE macaron shop in all of New York City. Yes, better than Ladurée, Bouchon Bakery, and Macaron Parlour. The delight of a macaron lies in its interplay of textures and senses when consuming. Tanya (pastry chef) has nailed a trifecta of texture, consistency and quality that is unmatched in other NYC patisseries. <br><br>On top of that, they taste bomb. Really. The following are my recommendations according to tastes preferences:<br><br>TRADITIONAL<br>Like classic flavours? GIANDUJA (zhan-doo-yuh) tastes like hazelnut chocolate, SALTED CARAMEL and their LEMON is creamy in flavor and perfectly zesty. <br><br>ADVENTUROUS<br>ROSE is a classic macaron and my standby flavour. Revel in a perfectly flowery and buttery sweet center that melts in your mouth. You have to try the JASMINE GREEN TEA at least once. (Although it&#39;s not a favourite for me...)<br><br>Those are some of the flavours that they carry year-round. They also have a menu of unconventional flavors that changes with the season and limited release flavours such as Thai tea and Vegemite. <br><br>You can get my absolute favourite flavour right now: VIOLET. It&#39;s one of their winter macs. But if you&#39;re reading this late, the summertime brings back my second favourite. HONEY LAVENDER. <br><br>Have a sweet day, and don&#39;t forget they also have a West Village location that&#39;s open even later. (;",

"reviewcomment":"UPDATE on 11/18 -- owner addressed shipping information in message below; dry ice provided. Thanks!<br><br>I had my food delivered to New Jersey. It came via UPS in a little more than 24 hours. The temperature outside was running in the upper 50s for the week. The contents of my box were cold, but pretty much thawed. <br><br>Being familiar with vegan food, I wasn&#39;t alarmed because I&#39;m&#39; not dealing with animal flesh, eggs and dairy in the products, so I knew there was nothing to be worried about. Though, I was a little surprised there was no ice pack or dry ice for the $26 shipping cost. <br><br>I had to spend at least $50 before I could have the items delivered, so I got all different products to try. (I&#39;ll edit my review as I try more, but so far the food is excellent). The chicken nuggets are tasty and have a real meaty texture, though, I wouldn&#39;t order it again. There&#39;s absolutely nothing wrong with these nuggets; they&#39;re just not my cup of tea. The citrus ribs are excellent; the soy protein is in small pieces and covered in a sweet, tangy, savory sauce. I&#39;m excited to try the drumsticks (which are featured on a youtube video with the Vegan Zombie -- love him! -- watch the video and you can see how he cooks it).<br><br>The soy-free chicken fried steak is great. I gave it a good pan fry and served it with stuffing and gravy.<br><br>If you are familiar with the Veggie Heaven restaurants in New Jersey (Teaneck, Montclair, and Denville) -- these vegan products from May-Wah taste just like those, so I think these restaurants must order from them. I love Veggie Heaven, so I&#39;m happy to have found this market. I researched May-Wah via feedback from their customers on Facebook and on general Internet sites. It&#39;s a solid, safe company in business for decades. I&#39;m so happy to have found them. I can&#39;t wait to try the vegan lobster!",

"reviewcomment":"I&#39;ve been living in Crown Heights for about 4 months now (but making weekly visits for the past year whilst living in Carroll Gardens), and Little Zelda is, without question, my favorite coffee shop in the neighborhood. I say this based on the quality of coffee/pastries, the friendly-ness of baristas, and the overall ambience. <br><br>Coffee: Their drip coffee is Toby&#39;s Estate, so obviously it&#39;s going to be great. Their cold brew is on point (a cold brew is NOT just drip coffee that&#39;s put in the refrigerator). Their espresso-based drinks are made with care; their mocha (I prefer it over ice) is my mocha-of-choice in all of Brooklyn. <br><br>Pastries: All their pastries are delectable - though there&#39;s not much I can really say except for you should give them a shot. The cheddar and chive biscuit is their most popular item; personally, I cannot get enough of the apple turnovers warmed-up. Flakey crust on the outside, thick apple sauce (chunky, not TOO sweet) on the inside. They&#39;re sold out half the time so you&#39;ll have a better shot at one in the morning. They also have a wide selection of gourmet pop-tarts. <br><br>Baristas: Some of the friendliest people in the neighborhood. <br><br>Ambience: Though I mention this last, the ambience is ultimately what earns Little Zelda a 5-star rating. Their round tables are just far enough apart that you can sit down (with a friend) comfortably, yet close enough that you can jump into your neighbors conversations (not in a creepy way please). There&#39;s always appropriate music in the background, and the lights dim in the evenings. The decor is accentuated by the tastefully placed antiques. Seriously, take a look around at all the little things. <br><br>Spend some time here, thank me later.",

"reviewcomment":"Great seafood at a good price! <br><br>Place gets crowded quick so be there a bit early for a seat. Its a pretty barebones restaurant. It really just looks like a fish market with a seating area, but you don&#39;t come here for the decor! <br><br>So as you walk into the restaurant, walk all the way to the back and you&#39;ll see all of the fresh fish and seafood on piles of ice. You pick the fish or seafood you want cooked and tell the gentleman how you want it cooked. Find a seat or ask the waiter/waitress to put your name down for a table. <br>You&#39;ll be waiting quite a bit, especially if you&#39;re with a big party. But the wait will be worth it! <br><br>The grilled shrimp is off the chain! Salt and peppered with squeezed lemon... Its good! <br>Ordered the grilled calamari, but next time I&#39;ll be getting the grilled octopus. <br>The Branzini (think its spelled that way) is tasty and the sea bass was really meaty. <br><br>They give you complimentary garlic bread and you can order the Greek Salad as well. <br><br>Its also BYOB!",

"reviewcomment":"Oh, Brooklyn Bagel, we love you. and by &#34;we&#34; I mean, Astoria. <br><br>New York City Bagels are iconic... and it&#39;s because of places like Brooklyn Bagel, bottom line. This place is always packed with good reason(s): the superb quality of the bagels, freshness of the MULTIPLE cream cheeses, piping hot coffee, speedy precise service, the several convenient locations... the list goes on and on. <br><br>However, here is what kicks this place up a notch (as if what I just listed wasn&#39;t all you&#39;d want from a bagel shop). Each week they have a &#34;cream cheese flavor of the week&#34; and they really let their imaginations run wild. I think I saw a red velvet flavor, a nutella flavor... I mean come on. It&#39;s like they know me.<br><br>Then, let&#39;s take this a bit farther why don&#39;t we. They have SPELT bagels for a healthier option, did they read my mind? No, they just know what people care about in their neighborhood. They also have tofu cream cheese that also come in unique flavors. <br><br>Just yesterday, I had a spelt bagel with tofu cinnamon, walnut, raisin cream cheese. It was decadent and delicious, without all the guilt of me scarfing down a regular bagel. Thanks, guys. You make me so happy.<br><br>Also, the coffee (however you like it) will impress. And that&#39;s all you really want to wash that bagel down with, right? Well even if you don&#39;t... they have a great juice selection including freshly squeezed orange. Awesome!<br><br>Breakfast sandwiches are also a popular option here. My husband&#39;s favorite is the bacon, egg, and cheese on a croissant. And why wouldn&#39;t it be... it&#39;s bacon, eggs, and cheese on a CROISSANT.<br><br>A++ for Brooklyn Bagel.",

"reviewcomment":"As the snow came down, I stopped in the middle of Saint Marks Place--the middle of the street--and wondered what I was doing.<br> The cars at the stoplight stared right at me as if they were the bulls in Pamplona bracing to take off and hunt me down like prey. The term &#34;deer in the headlights&#34; suddenly became apparent, and frightfully true. As yellow turned to red on the crossing signal, I scurried my way to the other side as the cabs sped forward, honking their horns and swiftly swerving to avoid my untimely demise. Safely on the other side, I exhaled and continued on my way to Sundae&#39;s and Cones.<br> I began to wonder how I had become the type of person that goes out to have ice cream by themself for breakfast. In the snow. On a weekday.<br> I guess I was just feeling sorry for myself. In the wake of being the happiest person in the world last summer, I had let myself slide into a creature of pure impulse. If anything could make me feel as slightly happy as I did back then, then I pined and begged for it. I used to go to Sundae&#39;s and Cones with Him, and it was an almost spiritual experience. I remember how I ravaged the cup of taro root ice cream with him sitting so close by my side on the bench outside. Our knees were touching, and even though it was starting to get cold outside I felt warm with content and the heat coming off of his body, which I loved every nook and cranny of. This also conjured images of the Christmas card he gave to me over a late night date at Coppelia before I left for California. On its front was a picture of two ice cream cones making out with eachother; the inside read &#34;You Make Me Melt.&#34; Then, in his child-like handwriting, &#34;The fact that we&#39;re still trying to make it work speaks volumes of how True this love is... I&#39;m committed to moving forward with you in a loving, caring, and honest way.&#34;<br> And yet today, he was nowhere to be seen. Just another memory that I relished, and hoped I could revive like I was giving it CPR, by ordering Him and myself ice cream even though he was nowhere to be seen. I ate my cup of taro root, and his just sat there melting. I prayed that at any moment he would walk through the door, and there it would be just waiting for Him. I knew it was foolish when I did it, but it didn&#39;t matter. <br> I stood at the display case and stared intensely at all of the beautiful ice cream cakes. They were so artfully minimalist, and beautiful, and I thought about how easy it would be for me to eat one in its entirety. There was one in particular that stood out to me that was different from the rest. It was a small cake with green frosting that was made to look like grass, with patches of little green icing that looked like shrubbery. Dotted amongst the shrubs were little piles of brown fondant shaped like piles of poop. At this, I laughed.<br> I wanted this cake with all of my heart, and wished that someone would buy it for me. I wanted this cake to be my wedding cake, because it made all of the sense in the world. Life is shitty. Shit happens. Shit hits the fan, but thank God there is ice cream cake in the world. My relationship Him was the absolute embodiment of this very cake sitting in the case before me. It looked very shitty--it really did. It was covered in poop, and probably not many people would consider it to be something worth craving. But I knew that in my heart that it wasn&#39;t really poop--it was frosting. It was all just freaking frosting. Beneath that shitty visage that the world is tricked into seeing was ice cream. And cake. And I love ice cream and cake.<br> My birthday is in August, but I wouldn&#39;t want this cake for my birthday. I really and truly believed that I wanted this to be the cake that the man of my dreams would let me have at our wedding. My parents would scoff, his would recoil in disgust, and all of our friends would think that we were the most tacky people in the world for turning the wedding our community fought so hard to make legal into a running poop joke. My grandmother would think it perverse, and faint on the spot. But I would get it, and it wouldn&#39;t be a joke to me.<br> Love is the hardest thing in the world to get right. It&#39;s not a piece of cake--pun completely intended. It&#39;s no walk in the park, and it hurts so badly sometimes that you can&#39;t imagine going on with life without it. It&#39;s shitty. It&#39;s ugly, and its beautiful, and it&#39;s more important that anything in the world. I wanted, so, so badly, to eat shit.<br> As I sat in the window with my two ice creams, I watched as the snow began to slowly subside. For a moment the sky was filled with flurries softly floating about, but the clouds had dispersed and made way for a brilliantly sunny sky. Finishing my cup of ice cream to the point of nearly licking the little cup clean, I looked over at the untouched scoop of cookies and cream that I had bought for him. I had half a mind to take to it too and eat every last bite, but I suddenly thought better of myself. I took it and threw it in the trash.",

Old men watching soccer, families sipping coffee with their empanadas, and not a single hipster in sight! <br><br>My favorite thing here is their Tres Leches cake, which is basically a cream-drenched brick of sugar. Imagine a piece of cake that has been marinated in sweetened condensed milk, topped with whipped cream, and filled with a thick layer of dulce de leche. <br><br>They also have an entire refrigerator case stacked with crustless white-bread sandwiches, which raises many questions. Why has the bakery stripped its loaves of their golden exterior? Are crustless sandwiches a cultural thing in South America? Inquiring minds need to know.",

I see that they now have a loyalty program, so you can get a free cookie after putting on 5 pounds and getting 10 cookies here.<br><br>This time, I tried the Oatmeal Raisin and the classic Chocolate Chip. Oatmeal Raisin is decent, but the Chocolate Chip is where it&#39;s really at. Here&#39;s a good tip: eat just half right away, since that will be more than enough to make you way too full to live already, and then heat up the second half when you get home. There is so much chocolate packed into this practically inch-high cookie, that it gets all gooey and warm and even better.<br><br>They also have a large variety of good-looking cupcakes, including a special Oktoberfest flavor, made with beer and pretzels and a pretzel rod sticking out of the top.<br><br>Seriously, you have to try these cookies.",

"reviewcomment":"My first love here was the taco, which is essentially a pajeon burrito. This is a gut buster - I mean, pajeon is a meal unto itself and here&#39;s just a replacement for a tortilla. It&#39;s bold and something that brought me back several times, but four years into a love affair, I&#39;m here to say it&#39;s not the only reason to come. <br><br>If anything, I&#39;ve started steering people away from the taco. It is a just a bit too heavy to recommend - that pancake perhaps should be a little thinner, or there should be a hotter sauce to help sop up the weight of this thing. <br><br>Also, the taco is probably the furthest thing on the menu away from cheese. Yes, there is queso fresco, but it is the fourth or fifth most dominant place in the dish. Go for the cheddar grilled cheese, which also brings serious Korean influences with the pork belly and kimchi, but leaves room for a sharp dairy kick. If not hungry (or very hungry and in need of an appetizer, tack on the freshly made and excellent beer cheese). <br><br>The taco may suck up the attention - and stand out the most when trying to order - but the menu makes no wrong foot. <br><br>Earl&#39;s is tiny enough that one large party can fill the place, so I never come here anything larger than a party of four. Otherwise, you may trek up to 98th street and find it impossible to eat cheese for an hour or more.",

A futuristic world where everything is lime green and pink and topped with whipped cream- it&#39;s a bit like being in Katy Perry&#39;s &#34;California Girls&#34; music video. With its neon decor, friendly staff and frozen yogurt toppings galore this is what I would consider a little piece of heaven.<br>I discovered this self serve frozen yogurt shop when an enthusiastic New Yorker told me &#34;its a no-brainier, you have to go!&#34; So, I walked the ten blocks from my house at the time and experienced it for myself. That was two years ago and I am still raving about this place and never miss my weekly stop for some sweetness. Thank goodness I discovered 16 Handles when I did because I just can&#39;t imagine my life without it.<br><br>What makes this place so freakin&#39; fantastic is unlike most fro-yo shops in NYC, this is self serve and you pay by weight. After you pile as many flavors of frozen yogurt in your cup as you like, you get to put your inner chef to the test at the toppings bar. There are over 30 toppings for you to create your fro-yo masterpiece. Everything from fresh fruit to wet walnuts. After you have reached fro-yo perfection you weigh it, pay then enjoy!<br><br>My signature is huckleberry yogurt topped with cheesecake bites, kiwi, mango, chocolate pieces and raspberry sauce. You haven&#39;t lived until you&#39;ve tried 16 Handles. This definitely one of my go to spots when I have a friend come to visit as well.<br><br>There are 16 Handles located all over the city. For a complete list of locations click here.<br><br>Check back daily for more of my favorite NYC hot spots and remember fro-yo melts fast- so go get some 16 Handles already!<br><br>Some images from: shopkentlandsdeals, tastethentel and yelp.<br><br>Follow me on social media: <br>Facebook: <a href='/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fconfessionsofahungrywhitegirl&amp;s=d2f809568db6386c46fb615ca7e54837f121500903e20a695593b5073aa9154a' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>facebook.com/confessions…</a><br>Twitter: @OCastriota<br>Instagram: OCastriota<br>Pinterest: Olivia Castriota",

Not only was the ice cream amazing, it made me feel like a kid again. It took me back to my childhood. It was so rich and flavorful. They definitely don&#39;t skim on the ingredients. They also offer a two pints of fresh ice cream delivered to your door for 12 months for a measly $120. I jumped on that deal. No more store-bought-freezer-burn-icecream for me!!",

"reviewcomment":"To get here, look for a green tunnel on the side of the shops at the loom. <br><br>I&#39;m a huge fan of this place! It&#39;s arguably the cutest cafe I&#39;ve ever been to. They have a great selection of drinks and cafe food, and there&#39;s a good amount of seating for people who are reading, doing work, drawing, or studying. Bring your laptops - they have free wifi! There&#39;s also a cute outdoor patio area that would be really nice on a sunny day and for your smoke breaks. <br><br>My favorite drink to get here is the lavender latte. It&#39;s a normal latte that you can make hot or iced and they add their homemade lavender syrup. On the weekends, be sure to get here early because this stuff runs out fast!  They also have a nutmilk latte that is made from almond milk. Apparently they make it themselves every morning. Intense. <br><br>I can already tell that this is gonna be one of my favorite lazy weekend afternoon spots.",

The eggs were perfectly cooked and the bun was divine.  I&#39;m not sure what cheese they use for the sandwich, but it paired very well with the arugula and eggs.  I also loved the side of olives served with the dish.  We arrived early, around noon and had to wait a few mins for a table to open up, but once we were seated it cleared out a bit.  My friend and I were catching up and lingered at our table for quite some time.  We were never rushed by the staff to settle our bill and vacate the table, quite the contrary in fact, which I really appreciated.  If you&#39;re in the area definitely come for brunch as Rucola throws down some of the best quality brunch food I have had recently.",

I have been getting whole beans by the half-pound/pound for the better part if a year now and, admittedly some are much better than other, but the choices are rather epic, for lack of a better word.

"reviewcomment":"Great low-key bar on Franklin, at the end of a string of decent low-key bars.<br><br>First thing, GREAT beer selection without being a pretentious craft beer bar. They have a lot of my favorites here: Brooklyn fire and ice, Brooklyn East IPA, Koelsch, Schneider Weisse, and then a lot of beers that I didn&#39;t know would soon be my favorite. The beers are also well categorized by ABV percentages. <br><br>Also, in the winter time I love their mulled wine. They also have shuffleboard, darts, a nice outdoor area. They also have a lot of events, karaoke new years party (free!), ski trip + mac and cheese dinner, chili nights, and a hawaiian shirt party? for some reason, yes. <br><br>Overall, great casual atmosphere. Its a little off the beaten path so it&#39;s never too crowded to comfortably order at the bar. <br><br>Great service, go out of your way to go here.",

I love Yelp and my fellow Yelpers!! <br><br>It&#39;s a quaint bakery with plenty of seating for those who are swinging by for a quick bite to eat or for those who are planning on getting some studying done. There aren&#39;t any outlets but there were plenty of people with laptops and headphones when I walked in early on a Wednesday morning. That&#39;s not to say that there wasn&#39;t a family of 4 enjoying their morning juice, coffee, oatmeal, and croissant. <br><br>Their selection may seem limited at first glance, but it&#39;s such a substantial collection of treats from vanilla creme bombolini, savory brioche, macaroons, donuts, quiche, and holiday cookies. <br>Their cappuccinos are strong and their soda and tea collection is beyond belief.<br><br>Their Wifi PW is chocolate.",

"reviewcomment":"I first visited Madison Square Eats on opening night (Sept 27), and I can&#39;t believe I waited this long to attend! MadSqEats (as it is affectionately called) is in its 5th year, and I think we can all agree that I&#39;ve wasted 4 years of my life not attending this joyous foodie festival.<br><br>Short version: <br>The vibe is festive. The crowd is hungry. The vendors are amazing. The chefs are hyper-talented. And the food? The food is unbelievable.<br><br>Long version: <br>Most of the vendors have extensive menus that will cater to your every need, from just a small taste ($3-5) to a larger meal of their best creations ($10 and up). There&#39;s literally something for everyone -- there are so many types of food available! This year they offer from Mexican to Thai to Japanese to Korean. BBQ, donuts, sliders, crepes, cannolis, empanadas, lobster, noodle bowls, &amp; even something called Mighty Balls! Beer, wine(!), soda, or water. <br><br>And MadSqEats is perfect for lunch, dinner, and/or dessert. You can load up on small plates &amp; try something from a bunch of different vendors, or you can go all out &amp; order a giant meal from your favorite. Options, options, options!<br><br>Are you on your way yet?!<br><br>It&#39;s open for a month, so that&#39;s more than enough time to get there a few times to try all of your favorites -- and discover new ones! There are some restaurants or chefs you&#39;ve already heard of, and some you&#39;ll never forget. Don&#39;t wait until 8:00-8:30 pm to show up either; the best &amp; most popular items go quickly!<br><br>So far, I&#39;ve only tried the food at two places: Seoul Lee Korean BBQ &amp; Hong Kong Street Cart. Both were amazing, &amp; I&#39;m counting the days until I can go back &amp; try something new.<br><br>Pro tips:<br>1) Finding a seat is difficult, but you can easily walk across the street to the park &amp; pop a squat on a bench to enjoy your meal(s). (Super pro tip: don&#39;t sit next to the dog run -- stinky.)<br>2) BRING CASH.<br>3) I recommend doing a lap first to see everything MadSqEats has to offer, but if you&#39;re running late, or supplies are running low, make a beeline for exactly what you want!<br>4) Bring friends. (Extra friends = extra hands, plus one aggressive buddy to guard a table for you!)<br>5) Connect with the vendors! Twitter, Facebook, YELP ... Let them know how much you love their food!",

"reviewcomment":"I came in here looking for something for a potluck dinner once and I&#39;m really glad I did. Everyone on yelp talks about the currant rolls and the coconut bread, which I&#39;m sure are good, but one thing keeps me coming back here: the guava turnovers. I love turnovers and usually you can only get the ones with apple filling. If you haven&#39;t had a turnover before it is like the calzone version of an apple pie. A triangle of puff pastry with fruit inside. Combine that with a delicious guava filling and you have the perfect pastry. This is the only place I&#39;ve seen that has the guava flavor, but they also have pineapple and the traditional apple. The first time I went they only had one left so it&#39;s a popular item. Get there early or go on a weekday!<br><br>Also, when I went this kid (maybe 10) was sent to get bread at Allan&#39;s by his mom and he got pretty confused about how much bread he was supposed to buy. The people at Allan&#39;s were really sweet about it and helped the kid out. I like a store that takes the time to help all their customers even when there is a line.",

"reviewcomment":"Hands down the best bagels in NYC. Tell me where there is a better one and I will personally go there myself. <br><br>Don&#39;t let this little deli feel throw you for a loop. Yes, this place is small, it&#39;s New York so it&#39;s old, not new or shiny and the line is usually to the door. There are only a few small tables inside to eat at, so if you are with another person and a table frees up, my suggestion is to have one person hold the table while the other orders. <br><br>Bagles though get a 5 star! These bagels are hot, fresh and melt in your mouth delicious. How do they get the bread to just melt like that. Bagel lovers know what I&#39;m talking about when you order and your jaw hurts from having to chew?! These are just the opposite. Not sure why I can&#39;t find bagels like these outside of New York...trust me I&#39;ve tried. They do not exist. Please someone prove me wrong though because I&#39;d love a bagel like this in Nashville. <br><br>They have every cream cheese you could want and every type of bagel you want. They of course make lox and sandwiches as well. Go here, only go here. You will not be disappointed. I literally dream of these bagels.",

"reviewcomment":"OK, they&#39;re among the Coffee Elite in Manhattan. This is established. They&#39;re not a roaster, but they always have top notch beans. Given that, the pastries are from Blue Sky Bakery, and amazing. I never in my life expected to be excited about muffins, but try them. You&#39;ll understand. And be warned: the afternoon cookies are larger than they appear. I struggled to finish one.<br><br>This is also my go to when buying my own beans. They&#39;re always fresh, within a few weeks of the roasting date, and seem to cycle them out before they&#39;re past a month from roasting (give or take). After buying them, and stowing them in my bag during work, I can smell them through the bag, and end up craving another cup all day. They&#39;re so fresh and wonderful.<br><br>I also like going here to get some work done on a day off, although the counter space is tight.

"reviewcomment":"Tucked away deep in the heart of alphabet city, is Alphabet City Beer Company. This charming little craft beer bar/craft beer seller/cheese shop is one of my happiest finds to date. I had been meaning to try this place for quite some time, and truly regret not having stopped in sooner.<br><br>Let&#39;s start with the ambiance. The store front -because that&#39;s exactly what it is- houses fridges PACKED with craft brews. They come from breweries that you&#39;ve heard of, and unless you are a true beer pro, breweries you haven&#39;t.  The giant light fixture houses some really old school looking bulbs, and sets the tone for the place. Moving past the beer fridges, you find the cheese counter. They offer up some awesome craft cheeses that are 100% worth trying. We had the beer cheese, it was absolutely phenomenal. The bar is super cool, made out of metal. The back is communal seating in the form of a long country style bench and a few comfy couches. The have a little yard in the back, but it being winter I&#39;ll have to review this in the spring. You can count on the fact that I will, there&#39;s no doubt I&#39;ll be back.<br><br>The draft selection is wonderful. Last night they ranged from a smoky English ale to a jalapeno IPA that was super unique. The bartenders are cool, super laid back, and knowledgeable. They let us know that they don&#39;t duplicate kegs, once a keg is kicked, they replace it with something totally new. I LOVE that. <br><br>All in all, this place deserves all 5 stars I could give them, and more. Super happy I finally had a chance to check it out, worth stopping by and chatting about beers with people who really know and love them!!!",

I like that you have three locations around NYC, so I know that I don&#39;t have to travel too far to get my sweet tooth fix. Your shop is quaint, classic and has that home-y feeling. I know that I can always look forward to the highest of quality products at your store.<br><br>As for your breads... hearty, crusty, chewy and (using the European method) shaped by hand. I must admit, I could probably eat a loaf by myself. But I won&#39;t. I can always expect a good variety since you make over 20 different loaves a day. All carefully handled with love and care.<br><br>And we cannot forgot about the desserts and pastries. Your cupcakes were moist and flavorful. So far I&#39;ve tried: carrot, red velvet and vanilla -- all delightful. The muffins (Zucchini Carrot Apple Walnut &amp; Blueberry) brought me on a trip down memory lane. And that Pain Au Chocolat... heavenly. <br><br>So what I&#39;m trying to say is thank you Amy. Your food brings smiles to many faces and adds inches to many people&#39;s waistlines.

"reviewcomment":"Toby&#39;s Estate is the best coffee in Williamsburg and probably the best I&#39;ve had in New York City.  The espresso is very nearly always spot on.  None of the West Coast coffee giants have successfully translated their quality to their NYC transplants; so props to Toby&#39;s for doing so on a different continent.<br><br>The food is also excellent and I&#39;ve never felt like the slightly high prices were unjustified.  I have thoroughly enjoyed everything I&#39;ve consumed.  The donuts are heart-arresting.  The other baked goods are excellent.  The atmosphere is well done with huge windows and a nice big mirror adding to a spacious feeling that is rare in New York.  The roaster also must have some epic ventilation.  I have never experienced any roasting smoke inside.  That&#39;s impressive considering it&#39;s right next to the bar.<br><br>While there is plenty of room, both on the floor and vertical - it gets used!  It&#39;s very busy most of the time.  If you get offended by trendy yuppies then this place might bug you out.  If so, what are you doing in Williamsburg?  It&#39;s not as superficial as it looks at first blush, though.  There are some genuinely interesting people hanging out there if you give them a chance.<br><br>My only complaint is the difficultly in finding a spot to sit (or even stand) and, combined with this density, the music volume is sometimes overstimulating.<br><br>To me a five star review means I consider it to be a world class place.",

"reviewcomment":"Oh, Mud. Mud, Mud, Mud. I cannot say enough good things about you. You&#39;re cozy, comforting and always delicious. Whenever my friends are in town and I want to please them with a good brunch - this is my pick.<br><br>The coffee is supposedly great (I&#39;m not a coffee drinker, but it smells good!) but I can vouch for the tea. They have a great tea selection and huge mugs! Definitely try their food - this place is so much more than a coffee shop (I&#39;m a big fan of their &#34;build your own omelette&#34; option!) Enjoy eaters!!",

They&#39;re always making fresh cupcakes, cakes, brownies and cookies right in the back, and I&#39;ve seen them do designer cakes for large events or parties. <br><br>I usually get a bunch of different flavored cupcakes and that cake pudding stuff they have, but I&#39;ve also had some of their regular cakes too. Oh, and their brownies are really good. I just wish they had ice cream to go with their tasty, unhealthy goodies.",

A futuristic world where everything is lime green and pink and topped with whipped cream- it&#39;s a bit like being in Katy Perry&#39;s &#34;California Girls&#34; music video. With its neon decor, friendly staff and frozen yogurt toppings galore this is what I would consider a little piece of heaven.<br>I discovered this self serve frozen yogurt shop when an enthusiastic New Yorker told me &#34;its a no-brainier, you have to go!&#34; So, I walked the ten blocks from my house at the time and experienced it for myself. That was two years ago and I am still raving about this place and never miss my weekly stop for some sweetness. Thank goodness I discovered 16 Handles when I did because I just can&#39;t imagine my life without it.<br><br>What makes this place so freakin&#39; fantastic is unlike most fro-yo shops in NYC, this is self serve and you pay by weight. After you pile as many flavors of frozen yogurt in your cup as you like, you get to put your inner chef to the test at the toppings bar. There are over 30 toppings for you to create your fro-yo masterpiece. Everything from fresh fruit to wet walnuts. After you have reached fro-yo perfection you weigh it, pay then enjoy!<br><br>My signature is huckleberry yogurt topped with cheesecake bites, kiwi, mango, chocolate pieces and raspberry sauce. You haven&#39;t lived until you&#39;ve tried 16 Handles. This definitely one of my go to spots when I have a friend come to visit as well.<br><br>There are 16 Handles located all over the city. For a complete list of locations click here.<br><br>Check back daily for more of my favorite NYC hot spots and remember fro-yo melts fast- so go get some 16 Handles already!<br><br>Some images from: shopkentlandsdeals, tastethentel and yelp.<br><br>Follow me on social media: <br>Facebook: <a href='/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fconfessionsofahungrywhitegirl&amp;s=d2f809568db6386c46fb615ca7e54837f121500903e20a695593b5073aa9154a' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>facebook.com/confessions…</a><br>Twitter: @OCastriota<br>Instagram: OCastriota<br>Pinterest: Olivia Castriota",

"reviewcomment":"Walked in as I was wandering in the neighborhood. Tried the hot chocolate for $3.75 and it was mind-blowing. It was like drinking silk, so smooth! I ended up buying a can of hot chocolate mix. Can&#39;t wait to make my own! Also got a few pieces of chocolate, they were all great. Love the one with gold, precious metal on a piece of chocolate, and it&#39;s the same price with all the other chocolates, what a steal!<br><br>Btw, the staff said their product never go on sale, so no need to wait.",

"reviewcomment":"I had been meaning to try this place for awhile now and just never got around to it... But I&#39;m SO glad I did. I have needed a real coffee shop in the area for awhile now (Starbucks/Dunkins/Coffe carts just don&#39;t cut it sometimes) and Taszo delivers with this trendy shop. <br><br>The coffee is great, and they serve some real food too (pastries, paninis, salads). I didn&#39;t try the paninis but I did grab a few of the baked goods from Balthazar and they were delicious. Give this girl a latte and a croissant and I&#39;m happy as a clam. <br><br>Lastly - the space. It surprisingly seats a lot of people, although it was packed when I ventured in. There was a sign stating that they were under renovation, so I&#39;m curious to see what they&#39;ve come up with when I revisit, but the space as is really as perfect as it could be for a coffee shop. Large windows, high ceilings, GREAT music (I meant to ask the baristas who made the mix!). This is going to be a regular spot for me.",
