"reviewcomment":"I live around the corner from Nimba and discovered it shortly after I moved in. We immediately loved it and felt so welcomed by the staff.<br><br>Their espresso machine has been broken for about two months now and I felt so bad for them - we started coming more frequently to try and support them. HOWEVER, the machine has been FIXED!! This is great news. They make amazing mochas and cappuccinos (according to my coffee-drinking boyfriend - I come for the tea).<br><br>Nimba is a lovely cafe. Their donuts are outstanding, not just dry sugar-bombs; their breakfast sandwiches are simple and delicious; and they have lots of shelves with excellent books. One time, my boyfriend ordered a coffee, only to find that he was out of cash. No problem, they said, just pay next time. We came in two days later and got some more drinks and paid for the coffee. Small-town service in NYC? I&#39;ll take it!",

"reviewcomment":"OMG, I am truly on &#34;cloud 9&#34; when I make it over from the Chelsea Market!  There are so many farm fresh, salads, and appetizer bar options! Not to mention Hemispheres has three main entree stations to choose from, that offer hot and unique dinning options for lunch and dinner. It&#39;s hard to name exact dishes since they change the menu every week, but in the past their fish/seafood is spot on, pork loins are tender, and their soul food side dishes are exactly that... food for the soul! Even though, they have this burger station available everyday, they are something not to miss when you visit! They have like 4 different bread options to choose from, three types of cheeses, and a vegetarian option. I love mine on Pretzel Bread and topped with pepper jack cheese!<br>Another tip for my fellow Yelpers lucky enough to dine at this private paradise is...LEAVE ROOM FOR DESSERT!  It&#39;s almost overwhelming how many options they provide every day. From cheese cake and apple crumb cake, to freshly baked/prepared cookies, pastries, and parfaits! <br>Something to consider as well is, the adjacent cafe &#34;Truck Pit&#34;. Yes, there&#39;s a legitimate food truck that they&#39;ve transplanted to the middle of the 8th Floor cafeteria! You must try the frequently original FroYo flavors that they churn out through the week. Simply addicting and heavenly!<br>Overall, Hemispheres, combined with the Truck Pit, on the 8th Floor of Google&#39;s NYC office location, is hands down one of the best-kept secrets in the Chelsea area!",

"reviewcomment":"This guy is awesome.<br><br>I came in for some B12 and D vitamins (most people are lacking those in their diet, and low levels could cause irreversible neurological disorders), and I figured a stop through would be just as confusing as when I peruse the aisles of Whole Foods. You see labels upon labels and just take a guess as to which is the superior product. But here, you&#39;re greeted by a super nice fellow who takes the time to help you find what&#39;s best for your needs, tells you how the vitamins are supposed to work in your body, suggests things to eat to ensure you absorbs the vitamins properly, etc... I suppose if you&#39;re in the vitamin business you&#39;re expected to have a pretty vast knowledge of your area of expertise, but I was still quite impressed.<br><br>It&#39;s a bit of a trek if you live anywhere except Upper West Side, but it&#39;s worth stopping by if you find yourself in the area.",

There&#39;s also a small bread section with pitas, bagels, french bread, and rolls. You can also get olive oil, pasta, and milk here too. <br><br>This location is a bit camouflaged and if you weren&#39;t looking for it - you might just walk past thinking it&#39;s an abandoned shack. It&#39;s situated right next to a parking lot - just walk through the narrow entry way and through the plastic covering - tada produce market. If you&#39;re closer to port authority - I know there&#39;s another stiles farmers market right across the street from there next to a pizza joint.

I was buying a present for some friends who had put me up for a couple of weeks, and I wanted to treat them to some good wine. They know more about wine than I do, so I thought that this would be a tricky mission. <br><br>In fact it was extremely easy. I walked in, described their taste, mentioned my budget and voila, I had 12 different  bottles of very decent wine - one or two a little unusual and cheeky, and all for less than the budget I had set. I thoroughly enjoyed the experience - at no time did I feel like I was being dense or that I wasn&#39;t quite good enough for the &#39;club&#39;. The owner was charming, engaging and just so very knowledgeable. <br><br>My friends loved the selection - every single bottle of it, and I got all the kudos for my brilliant taste in wine.

"reviewcomment":"If there are restaurants in heaven....this is what they must be like!!! <br><br>Let me start by saying that, though I was raised as a vegetarian, I have always been very picky about my vegetarian food. My dad is a Chef Master so I&#39;m a little bias. With that being said....this is probably the best vegetarian food that I&#39;ve ever had that has not come out of my family&#39;s kitchen. My carnivore friend told me about his obsession with this place and when I came to visit....he brought me here. We came back 3 times in the 5 days I was in Brooklyn lol. It&#39;s really that good. Let me bullet so i can avoid writing a book about it: <br><br>PROS<br>-Great tasting, fresh vegetarian food! Honestly amazing! Try the falafel. Try the black bean burger (best I EVER had). And for God sakes, try the juice!!!!<br>-Great price. Lunch special is like $6 for a burger and fries, $8 for a burger and a fresh squeezed juice. Great portions...substantial nourishment!! You&#39;ll be full for hours! I ate half of my burger and was stuffed.<br>-Friendly (and handsome!!) staff. Rasta vibe...you can taste the love in the food! <br>-Healthy. Yes. Healthy food can taste great if it&#39;s made right!! <br>-Great selection! I am going to go back and try everything on the menu...you know...if i ever get tired of eating black bean burgers!!! <br><br>CONS<br>-If you&#39;re in a rush, call in your order. Everything is made fresh to order so it takes a few minutes to prepare. <br>-No seating...standing room only. Which apparently is not uncommon in NY. <br><br>That&#39;s honestly the only Cons I can think of. This place is a diamond in the ruff. <br><br>Anyway, stop reading this and go try it already.

That was really sweet of them.<br><br>Then I got there, and everyone was so nice! I&#39;ve come to the factory before and met Sara and didn&#39;t expect anything but sweetness. It&#39;s a family affair here, folks. Makes me want to start a family business. They were so pleasant and funny. Added bonus: Everything there smells like marshmallows.<br><br>As if it isn&#39;t clear, I love the product, admire the people, and love it when I have time to pick them up at the factory instead of grabbing some from Duane Reade*. <br><br>*Who else is super excited they can get these delicious bits of heaven at the city&#39;s most common drug store? Between the number of Starbucks and Duane Reades per block, I can now pick up marshmallows for the hot cocoa I get down the street at Starbucks. :)",

"reviewcomment":"Great liquor store. Maybe a little bit pricey but everything in this store is worth its value. Also, excellent excellent selection in whiskeys. I was planning on making rum balls for new years yesterday and realized that I haven&#39;t bought fancy dark spiced rum since I lived in my Bayridge Apartment. And by &#39;fancy&#39;, I merely mean not Captain Morgan&#39;s. I&#39;m sorry, but Church Avenue wasn&#39;t going to cut it. I&#39;ve been in here a few times before with the ex and knew they would have something great. Note to self: They have Laphroaig. Which I personally think is nasty as hell. But the amount of rare scotch and whiskeys in here is delightful and my Dad would be mesmerized. I asked the guy at the counter about dark rums and he pulled out 3 different bottles. I went with the tried and true one that I&#39;ve made all of my rum balls with and drank the rest of: Kraken. It&#39;s hard to trump that one on sweetness and spiciness and even he agreed with me.",

"reviewcomment":"Surprisingly inexpensive and a huge variety of loose-leaf teas (the oolong selection in particular is great). Flavored teas contain the real herbs and flowers, not just powders. You can also shop for tea pots and other naturally-derived products (herbal soaps, etc.) up front. <br><br>As other reviews mention, the owner gives one-on-one time to every customer, so expect a bit of a wait if there are people before you. The first time I went, I expected to just pop in and pick up a few bags of tea--and then had to wait 20 minutes because of the two customers ahead of me. But the guidance is worth the wait, otherwise you may be overwhelmed by the 100+ varieties. <br><br>Overall, I definitely plan on stopping by whenever I&#39;m in the area.",

I came here looking for a nice big slice of steak to grill for myself on V-day (Spoiler - it turned out amazing).<br><br>My favorite part is that they display most of their cuts along with the prices, so you can look and decide how much marbling you want and what is within your price range. I ended up buying a 1.5lb slice of the bone-in cowboy steak (and I will be going back soon to try the porterhouse cut). The butchers were extremely helpful in helping me decide (tenderness, marbling, price, etc), and even offered tips on how to best cook it.<br><br>Tip: If you want to cook the steak in a skillet instead of broiling or grilling it, don&#39;t buy the bone in. I like my steaks rare, and while most of the steak cooked perfectly, the meat attached to the bone ended up raw.",

The staff was extremely accommodating and helped us custom-build our set of 6, filling the bottles before our eyes. Less than a week later, our family was so enamored and crafting so many excuses to use these guys that we were almost out and they drove down from CT to get some more! A few favorites: Strawberry, Espresso, White Peach + Garlic Olive Oil is a great base for almost any dish!<br><br>This is definitely a staple for our family now.

"reviewcomment":"The 5 year old inside me is jumping for joy - a real candy shop exists in Jersey City! :) They sell a large variety of sweet treats: chocolates, candy, cupcakes, ice cream, gelato, etc. They even carry my personal favorite, chocolate covered gummy bears. yessssssss!<br><br>My boyfriend and I came here after seeing a sign on the corner that said &#34;Buy 1 cupcake, get 1 free.&#34; We just finished eating brunch at SAM A.M. and decided that we would get our dessert fix here.<br><br>The store is super cute. They have a chocolate counter up front, candy against the wall, and cupcakes toward the back. I started to explore and found the gold mine - ICE CREAM AND GELATO! The owner told us that he just received a fresh batch of gelato, but the ice cream flavors really caught our attention. My bf loves peanut butter, so he was pretty much set on getting the PB Fudge. The sweet owner offered us samples of the flavors we were interested in. We first tried the PB fudge, and it was delicious. It was a PB ice cream with fudge ripples throughout. He also let us sample the oatmeal cookie. YES, oatmeal cookie in ice cream form. It was heaven. We almost tried the apple crumble flavor but we didn&#39;t want to be torn over so many choices. So nice of him to let us sample so many flavors! (Most people would just get annoyed.) We chose the oatmeal raisin cookie. I swear there were little pieces of chocolate chips in it, but after looking closely, it was small crushed pieces of raisins. Could&#39;ve fooled me!<br><br>I went ahead and grabbed my bag of chocolate covered gummy bears and a couple of malt balls. The owner also let us know of the cupcake deal, but we declined since we didn&#39;t have anymore room.<br><br>Our total came out to less than $7. A bit pricey, but I&#39;d rather support my local neighborhood shop any day (especially since the owners are so nice!). We&#39;ll definitely be back.",

"reviewcomment":"It&#39;s like dinner theatre.  There&#39;s an open kitchen with 18 people sitting around it.  After eating here, I wondered why couldn&#39;t all restaurants do this?  It felt so natural.  The atmosphere wasn&#39;t stuffy at all (as I would have expected from a 3-Michelin star place).  Part of this was probably due to the background music, which consisted mostly of the Doors that night, making the ambiance casual.  Also, despite the close proximity of diners to each other, people weren&#39;t afraid to converse during the dinner.  <br>The service was so fantastic.  It was a perfectly choreographed show involving all of the servers. Someone went around collecting the utensils after each course, the hostess in the middle collected the dishes.  The chefs plated each course in a line.  It was so fascinating to watch the efficiency of it all.<br><br>The food, of course, was amazing and beautiful.  The starting courses were my favorite of the night.  There was this uni dish that was probably my favorite.  (I don&#39;t even like uni normally!!)  A good number of the dishes had freshly shaved truffle on them.  One of the desserts was a truffle-flavored ice cream with truffle shaving!!  Chef Ramirez started with a huge truffle at the beginning of the night, and by the end it was shaved down to almost nothing.  Oh man, every time he went at it with the truffle, I felt like a star-struck teen at a Bieber concert.  <br><br>My partner and I shared the wine pairing (since neither of us are big drinkers).  I&#39;m not sure if it added much to the meal, except for the sheep&#39;s milk cheese which was paired *amazingly* with a sweet wine.<br><br>Overall a FANTASTIC experience.",

"reviewcomment":"Words cannot describe how incredible this italian speciality store really is. First of all, the store is pristine and every worker is well groomed and tidy, (my mom insists they all get manicures! ha). The workers never fail at greeting their customers with a smile. Secondly, the food is always fresh. I would not recommend buying meat from anywhere else. You won&#39;t be disappointed. The chicken cutlets are sliced thin, perfectly cut, and ready to be fried or baked. If I&#39;m having a bad day, Faicco&#39;s is definitely my &#39;go to&#39; for comfort food! They make a ton of yummy appetizers, which are always a huge hit at parties. Be ware- holiday time can be totally chaotic so plan accordingly! <br><br>What to get:<br><br>-Chicken tenders (with a hint of lemon flavoring) <br>-Potato croquettes<br>-Rice Balls<br>-Prosciutto balls<br>-Fresh mozzarella<br>-Broccoli Rabe bread <br>-Eggplant bread <br>-Olive bread<br>-Stuffed mushrooms <br>-Cold Cuts (they slice so thin!) <br>-macaroni and potato salad <br>And so so much more!<br><br>Faicco also makes the most spectacular sandwiches. My favorite sandwich: Roast beef, fresh mozzarella, shredded lettuce, mayo, and tomato! I also love their desert freezer, which always has tartufo, tortoni, and sorbet. <br><br>I can&#39;t say enough good things about Faicco&#39;s.

"reviewcomment":"Brooklyn how I have missed you and your yummy goodness! Norfolk kidnapped me and forced me to eat bland food that was hailed as greatness. <br><br>So it only makes sense that on my trip this weekend I visit every restaurant and get all the foods that I have longed for. I started with A&amp;A. <br><br>On a nippy Saturday morning there was a line, a long one, but I  didn&#39;t care. I spent 8 hours in a car to get here and a line was not going to stop me. <br><br>What I got? My usual for breakfast; bake and saltfish. It was heaven. The bake was crisp on the outside and piping hit goodness on the inside. The saltfish was well seasoned and the pepper that I had added gave it an extra kick. <br><br>My cousin got an aloo pie. The aloo pie was crisp and the chana was seasoned to perfection. Topped with pepper and tamarind and you have greatness. <br><br>Thanks to A&amp;A I am already dreading returning to Norfolk.",

They melt a fat chunk of chocolate (or fudge?) with warm milk (you do the stirring yourself), and then pour a shot of espresso in the chocolate milk mixture. To top it off, they freshly grate chocolate on top of the drink. The ultimate indulgence! <br><br>The place is really, really tiny. 3 people can be in there comfortably, 4 is pushing it. The first time I came here, I went in, felt too squished, and left. Many customers like to linger and chat with the barista (-o?) and among themselves, so I never know who is in line or not in this small space. <br><br>Anyway, great place to grab a quick drink to go.

Awesome.<br>- Honeycrisp apples: I know you can get these in some supermarkets but it is just the greatest all-time apple and they&#39;re the best when they&#39;re fresh, local, and organic.<br>- Farm eggs, raw milk cheese, free-range meat, Long Island wines, lavender, pickled everything, IPA cider, apple cider donuts, a rainbow of beans, carrots, cauliflower, tomatoes, actual flowers, everything everything everything I love.<br>- Bring your compost! I always forget, but it&#39;s something you can do!<br>- If you don&#39;t have cash, you can buy tokens with a credit/debit card, which also takes EBT.",

The tea selection are the usual suspects you would find in Chinatown but with better quality. It also helps that there are formal tea sets and utensils all over this place. The tea we ended up choosing was light and aromatic. I noticed the tea leaves were very hefty (?). The leaves looked like they were just dried (not the shriveled kind that still says kind of shriveled after brewing).<br><br>The hostess was very diligent throughout our visit, from helping us select the tea to showing us the proper way to drink tea (by warming the cups with the first brew and pouring it out). She came to pour at least four more times to refill the pot. The tea cups were tiny - enough for a small gulp, but one pot was enough for four people.",

"reviewcomment":"I was so excited the first time I stepped in here, I squeaked. I found Labneh! FYI: it is a Middle Eastern fresh cheese made with strained yogurt. One way to eat it is to spread it on a toast and drizzle it with honey.... Drool! <br><br>Parrot Coffee specializes in Balkan and Mediterranean foods. I come here regularly for their coffee beans (not always the freshest though...), cheese, cured meats and random goodies. The spices they sell are of good quality and Parrot Coffee&#39;s prices are competitive. If you think the paprika powder you got at a regular supermarket works just fine, that is because you haven&#39;t tried the Hungarian ones they sell here.<br><br>The staff here are always very pleasant and never give me weird looks for lurking around, reading the labels off every ethnic goods they have on the shelves. Or peeking into other people&#39;s purchases, because that&#39;s what any normal person would do when he/she is in a store that sells products not of his/her ethnicity, right?<br><br>They are open until 10pm and accepts credit cards, with a minimum of $5.",

Thirdly, it&#39;s without a doubt the best staffed wine/liquor store I have ever been to.<br><br>In a time crunch? Just need something that goes well with a hearty ribeye or is perfect for a housewarming celebration? Well, you&#39;re in luck...  They have these little wine kiosks set up in the front of the store. The kiosks help you pair the wine accordingly with the meal or occasion. Super helpful. <br><br>When you check out they give you a little print out info sheet on the wine you selected. It has space for notes and such so you don&#39;t lose track of wines you especially like or dislike. Pretty neat little perk.<br><br>Also, it makes me extremely happy that Food &amp; Wine rated it as being among the best of the best.",

It was a lemony, red colored tea. Perfectly sweetened. Next time I&#39;ll have to choose my favorite sweetener, honey. <br><br>I grabbed a seat at the long table by the window. Ended up staying for about 1.5 hrs to get some work done on my laptop. Chatted up with some folks at my table. Friendly crowd. <br><br>My iced tea came in a long glass chute personally delivered to me by a waiter. Payment is made at the end, not when you order. I was expecting my bill to come to $7. Nope. My yummy iced tea was only $3.50. Pleasantly surprised. Had to tip.  <br><br>What could improve the experience:<br>-Get a menu board instead of the weird pamphlet thing with the menu <br>-Collect payment at the register. Makes things easier. Less formal. <br>-Maybe display your Balthazar goodies on the counter so people remember to order some. Yum!<br>-I found out about this place on Yelp. From the street, it&#39;s kind of hard to tell that there&#39;s an awesome tea place inside. Find some sensible way to draw attention to your storefront. <br>-Simplify your wifi info. <br><br>New fave tea/coffee place in the nabe.",

"reviewcomment":"Since my first time at Jahlookova, I&#39;ve been back more times than I can count. Everyone is so welcoming and you really get the sense of community in here. <br><br>My visit today was what really prompted me to update my review. I&#39;ve had a stressful day and just really needed to awaken my body with a fresh juice and didn&#39;t feel like dealing with the hassle of it at my apartment. This time I ordered a green juice (can&#39;t remember what it was called) that had apples, lemons, ginger, kale, cucumbers, cilantro and parsley. I asked to hold the cilantro and replace it with extra ginger. Substitutions are never an issue in here. I grabbed my juice and decided to get a veggie patty. The total was around $11 (the patty is $2.75 and the large juice is $7), but I digress. Let me tell you about this patty. My god, it was heavenly! Just when I thought I came here way too much, they&#39;re gonna see a whole lot more of me. Next time I&#39;m here, I&#39;m buying all the veggie patties they have. It was loaded with vegetables in a green sauce. The sauce was just the right amount of spice without overbearing the flavor of the vegetables. Definitely a keeper!<br><br>Side note: I do have to say, I avoid the prepackaged juices. I&#39;ve tried 3 of them and didn&#39;t like any. I don&#39;t know if I&#39;m just used to Blueprint or Suja when it comes to bottled juice or if these were just poorly executed. <br><br>Last time I was here I picked up some lipgloss and I&#39;ve never had my chapped lips heal faster! They sell flavored sticks, incense, oils, and other natural items. I just saw tonight that they have alkaline water for a suggested donation of $2/gallon. Definitely beats making your own!<br><br>Until next time, Jahlookova...",

The woman behind the counter carried on a soft conversation with a tired businessman while two young ladies that looked like they could have just stepped out of Ginza giggled over a story. Retro Japanese tunes played softly.<br><br>Having been to Tokyo a few times, I can safely say this is the closest feeling I have ever experienced in NYC to being abroad in Japan. Beautiful decor, surprisingly authentic and traditional food (Umeboshi!!) and really excellent coffee. <br><br>Sit back, order some siphon coffee (They have two varieties) and maybe a Katsu sandwich, and watch as they prepare your drink from a really stunning set of gold siphons. I think this is where the old Rai Rai Ken used to be and, now outfitted with cool Japanese screen doors and cherry blossom branches, I can safely say this is a pretty awesome next step.<br><br>I almost didn&#39;t want to review this place because it is so chill and so small and I am worried it will be overwhelmed in the coming warmer months.

"reviewcomment":"We did the Greenwich tour. It was so much fun and perhaps more importantly, all the food was delicious. Seriously, I loved everything we tried - I don&#39;t think I could even pick out a favorite! For Italian food lovers (or just food lovers period), this is a must. I don&#39;t get to go to New York all that often, so the opportunity to try so much good food in one fell swoop was seriously appreciated. <br><br>Our tour guide was great. I particularly enjoyed all the history of the neighborhood, especially since it provided nice breaks in between all the eating. The tour group itself was just a whole lot of fun - everyone was chatty and happy and the energy was buzzing. <br><br>Though I know other food restrictions would get tricky for them, it was definitely vegetarian friendly. There was only one meat item on the tour, and while I would have still been content just skipping it, the tour guide was kind enough to provide an alternative, which in this case were some of the sweetest sundried tomatoes I&#39;ve tried. They definitely went above and beyond there, and hey, I loved having my own personal tasting.<br><br>The portions were perfect - it was enough to get a good sense of everything and leave feeling satisfied, if not bordering on stuffed. Overall, it made for a wonderful afternoon and I would love to try one of their other tours next time I&#39;m in New York.",

"reviewcomment":"Sake is the new wine, oh you didn&#39;t know? Ya better ask somebodeeeee!<br><br>I fell in love with sake about a few years ago and Sakaya is one of the best stores to feed my habit. <br><br>Small and quaint, Sakaya defines the essence of Japanese culture which is beauty by simplicity. A great selection of sake which is placed on a wooden wall. Also labeled by name along with tidbits of information such as prefectures as well as acidity levels. <br><br>The real bonus is that the store clerk which I&#39;m also assuming is the owner is VERY knowledgeable in his craft. If you don&#39;t see the brand or type you like, you can even place an order for it! <br><br>Please skip the sake selection at a general liquor store and come here. I won&#39;t steer you wrong.

"reviewcomment":"The gem of all gems in the East Village. Russo&#39;s is not a restaurant, but an Italian market specializing in two things: homemade pasta and cheese. WIN.<br><br>Walking into Russo&#39;s felt like I was back in Italy. Established in 1894, Russo&#39;s is the real deal and the closest to authentic Italian you are gonna get in NY. It&#39;s a tiny place right next to Venieros on 1st and 11th, with a few large refrigerators housing lots of cheese, and fresh pasta. They have an entire fridge devoted to fresh ravioli with fillings including sausage, goat cheese, spinach, mushroom, butternut squash, lobster and pumpkin. They have a large variety of different pastas, gnocchi, and even whole wheat options. <br><br>Russo&#39;s also has imported olive oils, marinated olives, as well as pepperoni, sausage and anchovies behind the counter. And just like authentic markets in Italy, they have a small menu of sandwiches. The Italiano or Caprese are a crowd favorite.<br><br>For my first Russo&#39;s trip, I bought fresh pasta (only used half of it tonight), a 1/4 pound of ricotta, and 1/4 pound of their house blend of grated cheese made with parmesan, asiago and pecorino. All for $9. I made an arugula-basil pesto for dinner with their pasta, and topped it with pine nuts, fresh arugula and dollops of their ricotta cheese, which was so fresh, flavorful and outrageously delicious. Ricotta takes any pasta dish to the next level.<br><br>Next trip I&#39;m trying their ravioli and bufala mozzarella. While I usually go to Eataly for fresh pasta and cheeses, Russo&#39;s is my new go-to. It is even more authentic, feels Italy, and is half the price.",

"reviewcomment":"This place is an amazing gem hidden on the side streets of Williamsburg. <br><br>When you walk in there are cases of so many different raviolis and fresh cut pasta.  The day I went , my boyfriend and I really wanted some spaghetti and didn&#39;t see it in the cases.  All we did was ask and the man went in the back and cut fresh sheets of pasta into spaghetti for us.   Yesterday when I went and it was pretty empty in there, I asked the owner if it would be ok if i came in the back and watched her cut the pasta and she let me and talked to me about the shop.  A wonderful experience!<br><br>But most importantly, the pasta is AWESOME! I made it with a home made marinara the other day and let the pasta finish cooking in a little but of sauce and it really soaked up the sauce. It cooked to a beautiful consistency and you can really tell the difference between fresh pasta and the kind in the box.  <br><br>I love this place!",

"reviewcomment":"Amazing.  I LOVE chocolate (fine, all sweets, but esp. chocolate).  In a city filled with so many delicious options from chocolatiers and chocolate confectioners local and otherwise, this is easily one of my top picks for gift giving.  The NAMA chocolates are incredibly unique and unlike any other chocolate I&#39;ve ever had before.  When I first read about them I was intrigued - so many great reviews and yet I had never heard of them (what?!)..  So obviously the next day I went to the store to check it out.  After trying the samples, I purchased 3 boxes.  A few days later I was back to buy 2 more boxes.  I simply had to share this new finding with my family and closest chocolate loving friends!  Needless to say, they were hooked, too.  I think I probably purchased around 8-10 boxes within a month of first discovering them.<br><br>So what are they?  Well, if you love that creamy, melt-in-your mouth feeling - these are a must.  They&#39;re semi-soft chocolate squares that have to be kept refrigerated. Imagine a cream/fudge/icecream/chocolate orgy.  That&#39;s what NAMA chocolates remind me of.  They do have a &#34;dark chocolate&#34; one but it&#39;s still rather creamy and not so bitter.  Of course, you can ask for a sample and decide for yourself!  The white and matcha ones are yummy, too, but (for me) not as delicious as the milk varieties.  **PAY ATTENTION TO THE EXPIRATION DATE ON THE BACK**.  In my opinion, they taste exponentially better when they are fresher - so plan accordingly to buy AND consume within a few days.  Also - look before you buy and buy the ones with the expiration date that is furthest.  <br><br>Service?  Wonderful.  Every time I have been there the employees have been incredibly sweet (no pun intended) and very happy to help and give out samples.  The packaging is very neat/clean and they will give you an icepack or two depending on the temperature outside and how long it will be before you can get them to a refrigerator.  Plus, free giftwrap upon request!<br><br>I can&#39;t say much as to their other treats.  The chocolate covered potato chips were surprisingly yummy, but I really think the NAMA chocolates steal the show.  I haven&#39;t tried their other chocolate items - I mean, when that money can go towards another box of NAMA chocolates...",

"reviewcomment":"There&#39;s a reason why Nasto&#39;s has been in business for more than 70 years.  Everyone who&#39;s grown up in the Ironbound knows this is a local hidden gem.  There&#39;s no place in Northern Jersey that serves better old school homemade ice cream than Nasto&#39;s!<br><br>Service is very friendly and quick.  And the best part, prices are awesome! For a couple of bucks, you can get a pretty good amount of your favorite thick, creamy, rich, buttery, homemade, high quality ice cream!<br><br>There are tons of different flavors to choose from.  I&#39;ve tried several flavors and everything is simply amazing. My favorite though has to be the chocolate peanut butter.  So much goodness in each and every scoop.  The chocolate is perfect, not too sweet, but rich and creamy in content.  The same goes for the peanut butter: you can taste the rich natural goodness of the peanut butter. Together, it is perfection.  Sure, you can buy good ice cream elsewhere, but I guarantee you won&#39;t find ice cream as smooth, rich and creamy as this one.  And if you don&#39;t know what to choose from, they can give you samples of flavors to try.  And now, you can buy a gallon of your favorite ice cream to take home with you! <br><br>They also have a wide array of Italian deserts to choose from: sorbets, tartufos, tortonis, cannolis, tiramisu, and gelato.   They also have the best ice cream cake ever!  Yes, getting an ice cream cake from Nasto&#39;s was always a staple for anyone who grew up in the ironbound.<br><br>Hands down, Nasto&#39;s has the best ice cream in Northern New Jersey,",

"reviewcomment":"Old School Italian Butcher Shop<br>Delicious Homemade Chili<br><br>Take a trip back in time, and visit Italy when you&#39;re on the Upper East Side.  Walking down the street one fine afternoon, I couldn&#39;t help but notice a &#34;Delicious Homemade Chili&#34; sign, which tugged at my taste buds. With high hopes, i decided to venture in and grab a bowl. Two chicken fingers, one container of chili, and a mixed green salad later, I found myself sitting on their bench watching people walk by. <br><br>The chili was DELICIOUS!! Not too thick - hearty. The roasted red peppers balanced out the flavor perfectly. Their chicken strips, are entirely too addicting. Thin and long, the strips have a nice consistency. They are fairly thick and have a crunchy texture, with just the right amount of saltiness. If you like chicken strips, this could become a regular addiction. The green salad was decent, thankfully it did not have iceberg lettuce.<br><br>The food here is served cold, and available for pick up / delivery. If you ask nicely, the guys will gladly heat up your soup, and there is a bench outside. As this is a butcher shop there is no seating, their drink selections are limited.  I had visited Ottomanelli many years ago, and was glad to re-discover it again. <br><br>Great job guys!! <br>Thank you for being so sweet - I&#39;ll definitely be back.<br><br>The Scene: Traditional, Italian<br>Destination Rating: 5<br>Date Rating: N/A   (Perfect for ordering in)<br>Hob Nob Potential: 4<br><br>Strong Suggestion: Try the chili - it&#39;s delicious!",

We have ordered another themed cake this year! The photos do not do the cakes justice - they were splendid looking and we were loathe to cut into them! We might have given Betsy a few headaches with the Star Trek one as it was fiddly to arrange, but we never knew it if so. She was unflaggingly positive and encouraging with our ideas - she was really excited by suggestions and you felt she absolutely enjoyed making her creations. It was a pleasure to work with her and we felt the contributions we made were genuinely welcome. A lovely experience for us..thank you Betsy.",

The baristas are coffee masterminds, but in an unassuming way.  There&#39;s nothing that irks me more than smug baristas who make me feel like I should be honored they&#39;ve come down from their coffee pedestal among the gods to make my cortado. At Everyman they can nerd out about coffee as well as anyone, but they can also listen to me complain about the stress of picking our cabinets for my apartment remodel (read: privileged people problems), which I appreciate.  And from listening to some of the idiotic things that I hear people say or ask for (while stationed at the community table with my coffee and mac), they should get a medal for staying cool.<br><br>They also have cool combos you can order - last week I got a cortado with a shot of espresso on the side for 5$. Pretty sweet (not actually sweet, but... you get it).  I&#39;ve never succumbed to the sweet treats, but when my remodel really gets out of control and my stress level skyrockets beyond the need for espresso, I&#39;ll update and letcha know.<br><br>Well done Everyman.",

"reviewcomment":"I was looking for fun treats to bring to customers yesterday.  I turned to Yelp and found the Cookie Jar.  When I got there, I found a dizzying array of cookies.  I knew from the reviews that I absolutely had to get some slutty brownies, but I needed some advice on other options.  <br><br>Fortunately, the young ladies at the counter were super helpful and friendly. The nut cookies, they told me, were also among the most popular.  So, I loaded up on these and headed out to see my peeps.<br><br>At the last stop of the day, my customer offered to let me try some of the treats in the box.  So, I took a sliver of the brownie.  And then another... and another.  So much for a sliver, but these slutty brownies are amazing... chocolate chip, oreo, and brownie layers of amazingness.  No, really, if you are anywhere near Staten Island, putt down your phone, tablet, laptop and head to the Cookie Jar and get all slutty!<br><br>And if you&#39;re far away, they deliver. They were filling an order when I walked in and they let me know they ship anywhere.  I needed to send a gift, so I ordered online last night.  The next afternoon, to what did my wondering eyes did appear?  The box of cookies sitting on a counter in Boston!!  It&#39;s like they were teleported, it was so fast!   My friends were sending me texts all afternoon how much they loved them.  I got similar messages from my customers.  <br><br>If you&#39;ve got a cookie craving, check out the Cookie Jar.  You will not be disappointed.  As for me, they will be my go-to delivery treats.  Unfortunately, I cannot go there for business anymore since they don&#39;t take American Express.  Oh well, I can always get a few for myself on my way to another bakery!",

They have a smaller selection of spirits as well, a few interesting liquors and liqueurs I haven&#39;t seen elsewhere. Also wine/liquor accessories and mixers. The owners are very friendly, and the service is great; they can recommend a good wine for just about anything. <br><br>They also have tastings and events which are fun. Last time we tasted a white chocolate almond vodka that is made locally. My wife wouldn&#39;t let me leave without a bottle. Good times.",

At my first experience there, I was 21 and after some mindless browsing I asked the clerk for something cheap and red and Californian. She laughed and pointed me towards a blend that I loved. She didn&#39;t look me snidely because I looked young or because I wasn&#39;t looking to spend $50 for a bottle of wine, which I sort of expected from the name and decor. <br><br>These are real people who love wine and love helping people find wine they love. They also have a record of every transaction so you can come in and say &#34;I got a bottle of cabernet here 6 months ago&#34; and they&#39;ll know exactly what you bought. Super smart.

"reviewcomment":"I&#39;ve been going to Dolly&#39;s since I was a little boy when my family visited King&#39;s Plaza.  During a nostalgia trip last year where I hit King Plaza and the Cookie House there, I decided to look up Dolly&#39;s as well.  It&#39;s sad that they lost their original location to the hurricane, but great to see them staying strong.  Actually their new location is even better in a way, being right by Mill Basin Kosher deli (I just missed the pinstripes).  The owners who served us that day and other times after were very friendly in an old school Brooklyn way; just know what you&#39;re going to order before you bother them.  Pretty simple concept, ehh?  Seriously, some of the people who wrote reviews here need to get over themselves.<br><br>Just like the old days, they haven&#39;t given us spoons (not sure if they even have them).  You just squeeze the wax container of ice to eat it.  To me it&#39;s part of the charm, but I&#39;m sure not all would feel that way.  My girlfriend is addicted to their mango ice.  As it&#39;s studded with chunks of real mango and has tremendous flavor, I can&#39;t blame her.  My go-to is the same it&#39;s always been: the rainbow ice.  With lemon, cherry and blue raspberry, it&#39;s a blend of fresh fruit flavor with just the right amount of sweetness.  I&#39;ve also had their rainbow cookie ice (yes, that is a real thing), a raspberry cheesecake ice, and a few other more gourmet ices, all of which were consistently amazing.  Prices aren&#39;t dirt cheap but they are very fair for a gourmet Italian ice.  There&#39;s a reason Dolly&#39;s is still open, and the reason is the quality of their ices.<br><br>Whether you keep it simple or go for something more ambitious, Dolly&#39;s always delivers.  Just like it always did.  If you don&#39;t like this place, get your taste buds examined.",

Being a very amateur wine somalier like myself (2 Buck Chuck - what what!), the staff threw me no shade for my limited knowledge on wine. They were super helpful in helping me narrow down my choices and gave me great recommendations based on the flavors I liked. Speaking of that, if you&#39;re a frequent shopper or live in the neighborhood, they can put you in their database to keep a record of your previous purchases to help guide you on what to pick on your next visit. <br><br>Their later opening hours are great for picking up a bottle to take home after you&#39;ve already had 2-3 glasses from your after work event - not that I know from personal experience or anything...",

For anyone who hasn&#39;t tried Pumking, it is hands down the best pumpkin ale out there, which I can confidently say after conducting a side-by-side tasting of 27 different pumpkin beers. There&#39;s no way to know when it&#39;ll get tapped except to follow their website or social media, but totally worth it.<br><br>Not sure how my review turned into a self-righteous sermon about pumpkin beer, but the moral of the story is that if you love beer (of any sort), then you&#39;re bound to love this place.",

"reviewcomment":"I had been dreaming about trying this falafel so I couldn&#39;t wait for lunch time to come around.  To my chagrin I had to wait in a 25 person line.  But it moved pretty quickly and within about 15 min I was placing my order.  <br><br>Here&#39;s the lowdown:<br>-Falafel Sandwich (green falafel + hummus + Israeli salad + green cabbage + tahini sauce + everything (S&#39;rug traditional Yemeni hot sauce with cilantro, chili, garlic and olive oil, amba picked mango chutney &amp; pickles Israeli style): maybe I was just hungry out of my mind but this falafel was one of the best I have ever had.  The whole wheat pita was so soft and yummy and held the falafel sandwich together very well AND never got soggy.  The falafel was so fresh and was the right type of spicy.  The sauces are at the very top and as you keep going through the falafel sandwich you leave most of the sauces and head into the hummus portion which is not as creamy as most--which I loved.  It mixed so well and didn&#39;t overpower anything.  The sandwich was also extremely filling.  <br><br>-Date-Lime-Banana Smoothie (3 Dates, 1 Banana,  1/2 cup soy milk and 1 freshly squeezed lime): Just like everyone said, it tasted just like a banana smoothie.  But in my experience with smoothies that have bananas in them, they all taste like that.  I did like the chunks of dates that would come up through my straw from time to time but it wasn&#39;t something I&#39;d ever order again.<br><br>FINAL VERDICT: I&#39;ll be looking out for this truck more often as the wait is worth it :)",

If you&#39;re willing to spend a couple minutes extra to get a FRESH cup of coffee then mod cup is a must.  The owners, Justin and Travis, roast the beans themselves a few blocks away and even directly trade with farms to ensure the freshest of coffee. Before drinking Mod Cup, I was a huge fan of Dunkin Donuts. They may have made me a coffee snob now, but once you&#39;ve had good coffee it&#39;s hard to go back. Definitely worth a try.

They have an entire upstairs dedicated to these evenings, and they taste around 6 wines each time. You can drink glass after glass while listening to the owners tell stories of each of the winemakers, from high level wine lingo, to what was paired for lunch with each wine on his last visit.

Be prepared to immerse yourself in Aussie culture and order in Aussie ways (Flatwhite, Piccolo, Long Black) from good-looking baristas in light-blue shirts and dark-blue apron. You will leave with a desire to come back for an authentic coffee experience more than the caffeine itself. <br><br>You can&#39;t go wrong with a soy flatwhite (or almond milk latte) and avocado smash. <br><br>Even if you are not there for coffee, try a Chai Latte, B-Green cold-pressed juice, some Balthazar bakery, or hand-crafted vegemite toast.  I did not previously associate café with good juice, but Blue Stone Lane&#39;s B-Green juice does it right.",

This is my go to place for Valentine&#39;s day, Mother&#39;s Day, and Father&#39;s Day. You can&#39;t go wrong with absolutely delicious goodies from Rispoli&#39;s. <br>Their lobster tails are OUT OF THIS WORLD! I feel bad for anyone who has never indulged in a famous rispoli lobster tail. My mouth is watering just thinking about them! <br>Closed on Mondays.",

"reviewcomment":"I&#39;m a student at Columbia and have been making the 7 block trek from campus to this spot for the last 4 months.  Although this might seem far/kind of on the tricky side or Harlem, It&#39;s totally worth it... Quality of fruits/veggies is better than anything else in the Columbia area and about 2/3rds to half the cost (I.e. 4 bucks).  The produce isn&#39;t advertised as organic but it always seems fresh and after talking to the owner/manager about how he sources the produce, it seems like he tries his best to get top quality for mid-price. <br><br>One more thing... I&#39;m a proponent of eating food/drinking juice made by happy people.  People at organic ave/juice gen are always so ornery.  9 out of 10 visits Oasis is a very happy place.  :) cheers (with my wheatgrass shot)",

Surprisingly not too sweet and just the right amount of everything. My friend got the hazelnut iced coffee which was also delicious. Their iced coffee really is the best! The proof is also in the newspapers displayed on the walls.<br><br>But what makes this quaint little cafe so charming are the workers.

The Tuna with Prosciutto is great, so is the Egg Ham, Cheese and Tomato on Ciabatta. And don&#39;t forget to pick up one of their Prosciutto Bread loafs.<br><br>Seriously, this place is a breath of fresh air, with some amazing food and a fun atmosphere, go grab a sandwich.

"reviewcomment":"Table Wine has been in the neighborhood for four years now. It is great that Jackson Heights can support a small, characterful store like this. They have kept true to their original model; they only carry good wine, they have bottles for all budgets, they have regular tastings, and everything is from small producers. They seem to do this because they love wine not simply to make money. The staff are all knowledgeable without being intimidating, and the hand written labels on every bottle are always spot on. If it says &#34;bacon&#34; or &#34;green pepper&#34; then, amazingly, that is exactly what you will taste. They carry organic wines, Long Island wines, a great selection of rosé wine in the summer. They will also speed chill a bottle of white for you. <br><br>The layout of the store is really clever and helpful. The wine isn&#39;t piled up by region or price but is arranged in racks by taste. So they start off at the door with whites and reds that are crisp and flinty and light and as you go down the wall the wines get gradually richer, heavier and more complex. Brilliant idea! They also have a central table for wines that are under around 12 bucks, another section for New York State wines, another for for more prices wines at 20 bucks plus, and a sparkly section. Finally, on the back wall, they have an amazing selection of spirits. They have a particularly wonderful Irish single malt, Tyrconnell, which I highly recommend. <br><br>The only slight quibble is that because they get wines from small producers something that becomes a favorite can disappear. But that seems to reinforce the nature of wine as a living thing, something that is seasonal and local, rather than something that is produced a gigantic industrial pipeline, which is the impression that I get in your average wine store stacked with boxes of the same anonymous brands. Table Wine&#39;s racks store most of the bottles horizontally, apart from the ones on display at the top. Going past after they have closed I have seen them lying these bottles on their sides. Talk about dedication, but it means that I have never had a bottle from them whose cork was difficult to remove. Another store that flies in the face of commercial anonymity.",

"reviewcomment":"Came here on a rainy day looking for a cup of coffee. What I found here instead wasn&#39;t the normal kinds of coffee, but rather an interesting menu of Hispanic influenced drinks. Their beans are from Stumptown, but unfortunately it seems like they&#39;ve stopped selling the beans because of lack of demand.  <br><br>I chose to go with what looked like their best seller, the café con leche. The café con leche is much more than the Spanish translation, coffee with milk. It&#39;s creamy and foamy with a pinch of butter and salt, which makes it sound kind of gross, but it&#39;s actually quite wonderful! I had a sip of my friend&#39;s Cuban espresso, and it was also really good. The consistency of the drink was creamy and it had a sweet, smoky taste. <br><br>They serve you at a window, but there&#39;s seating inside and outside. I will definitely be coming back to try the other drinks on the menu.",

"reviewcomment":"It&#39;s hard to make a grab-and-go lunch seem like anything more than a transaction, but somehow the incredibly friendly folks at GoGo Grill make it so. <br><br>Despite the raves of a former colleague, I waited for months before trying this cart parked outside of my office most weekdays. My excuses are in hindsight ridiculous - the cart was too small, I&#39;d heard they served hamburgers on English muffins. I really don&#39;t understand English muffins. <br><br>On New Year&#39;s Eve, I front ran a resolution and tried GoGo. The wind was howling off the Hudson, turning my exposed fingers an unhealthy shade of pink after less than a minute. How these people could prepare soup or bread or anything else in this weather is a feat practically superhuman. <br><br>Then there&#39;s the food. In the month since my first visit, I&#39;ve mostly had falafel, and it is exceptional. Although not quite the same thing you would get in a Arab restaurant - the mashed chicken peas are quite rough and much more lightly fried than that - the taste is standout. <br><br>The stand is incredibly flexible in how you take your lunch. There&#39;s no boxing into certain combos or serving things in expensive packages. The falafel can come with a salad, in bread or even as a side with yogurt and hummus. This is how I&#39;ve come to get it, a side with an extra two balls.

Sure, it&#39;s a little expensive, but that much is expected for a higher quality of food. <br><br>On top of that, the folks who run the place couldn&#39;t be nicer. Like a huge dumbass that I am, I leave my laundry bag there all the time. They think it&#39;s funny, but it&#39;s always there. They laugh at me, like they&#39;re in on the joke. I half expect them to play a prank on me. <br><br>But, I digress. <br><br>This place is the best grocery store on Graham Avenue. Hands down. They&#39;ve got a great beer selection, a great cheese selection and great fresh vegetables. Plus, they don&#39;t have shit brands.

"reviewcomment":"I always see Wafels and Dinges parked in Cooper Square and have been a few times now. IT is pretty tough to resist the urge to stop when you can small the freshly made waffels fro ma block down the street, sometimes accompanied by the smell of delicious bacon.<br><br>The first time I went I had the bacon maple wafel and it was out of this world. Just as you would expect, bacon makes everything better, including the classic waffel and syrup combo. The salty sweet combo is perfect, and they don&#39;t overdo either one.<br><br>The next time I went I was looking for something purely sweet, and also somewhat refreshing. I ended up on the wafel ice cream sandwich, with dulce de leche on top. It was amazeballs! Two piping hot, hand-sized wafels placed around a ginormous serving of home-made (truck-made?) ice cream, with a generous helping of dulce de leche on top. It was too big to eat as a classic sandwich so I had to attack it middle-school stle and lick the ice-cream from the sides until I could squeeze it enough for a full bite. Very rich, very decadent, but refreshing from the cold ice cream, I loved it, even in winter.<br><br>I will try to resist the urge to stop here on a daily basis for more deliciousness, but will probably  fail :/",

"reviewcomment":"These guys know what they&#39;re doing! <br><br>In a car-less NYC, it seemed almost impossible to be able to have a nice Christmas tree unless we lugged it home from one of those sidewalk vendors. A quick Google search brought us to the NYC Trees website, where for a very reasonable $109, we got a 6 foot tree, next day delivery, installation, and stand...ALL INCLUSIVE!<br><br>In addition to our tree looking way more beautiful than any of those 2nd rate sidewalk ones, we felt good knowing that our tree was a sustainable one that was sourced from regional farms. The quality is top notch too - the tree looks very healthy, with &#34;full&#34; branches and very minimal needle shedding.<br><br>One of the co-founder brothers himself (Lou) came to deliver and set up our tree and he was super friendly, offering to help move around things to place the tree and trimming the branches so our tree looked perfect. He even watered the tree and gave me tips on how to take care of it - now that&#39;s what I call excellent service!<br><br>If you want your own hassle-free NYC Christmas tree experience, look no further than NYC Trees!",
