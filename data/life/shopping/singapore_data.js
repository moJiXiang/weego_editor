It is also a reasonable and yummy place to buy food for take out - Japanese, Korean, Western, etc. <br><br>This isn&#39;t just a standard supermarket. They have loads of themed fairs like Hokkaido Fairs, USA Fairs, European Fairs, etc. Here, they offer really great quality produce and and pre-made food and wine. <br><br>But what is great here is that they consistently have a great selection of Japanese products unrivaled to most supermarkets in Singapore.

"reviewcomment":"I love Tangs! Besides being one of the oldest departmental stores still around in Singapore, it is also a local store where it is still majority family-owned by the Tang family. With that came its tradition reflecting its owner&#39;s Christian faith ~ Bible verses in its Christmas decoration and there was a Bible verse outside its store previously (not sure about now). It also used to be closed every Sunday. Now it is open everyday except for Christmas and the first 2 days of Chinese New Year. <br><br>After its latest renovation and revamp, I must admit it takes some time to get used to the new layout. Level One is now solely a Beauty Hall with a huge range of products and brands, including Tom Ford Beauty, YSL, Nars and many artisan fragrances like Annick Goutal and Creed. There is also a new cafe-bakery at a corner facing Lucky Plaza (Tiong Bahru Bakery).<br><br>Clothes, shoes, accessories and travel stuff are still on Levels 2 and 3. I love the shoes section from Tangs + Co where it carries shoes from Italy and Spain (Unisa, Jamie Mascaro, Repetto...), besides some designer stuff like See by Chloe, Vivienne Westwood and Marc by Marc Jacobs. <br><br>Level 4 still houses Island Cafe, a great place to rest your feet after many hours of shopping and serves a mix of local and simple Western food.<br><br>The Basement has become a mix of home wares (for the bedroom, bath and kitchen) and food. This has to be the most confusing section as the food stores are  scattered around. I would liken its &#34;food hall&#34; to be similar to Food Republic in pricing and in bringing in pretty well known hawkers or eateries. <br><br>Something new is Level 7 where it is a place for respite and relaxation with several brands offering facials and massage - La Mer, Shiseido, SK II, etc, plus a massage place and hair salon in there. I love that!<br><br>Other plus points will be the bank of ATMs outside the basement and Level one, close proximity to the Orchard MRT station and bus stop, as well as being right next to Marriott Hotel. <br><br>Bought too many things? You can arrange for local home delivery (for a fee or free based on certain amount spent) or if you live overseas, you can also DHL the items homes. <br><br>Other services include personal shoppers, free alteration (except during sale period or on sale items) and a shopping tag which allows you to have all your items consolidated in one location instead of you lugging them everywhere you go.<br><br>Can you tell I love Tangs? <br><br>The only area for improvement could be having more staff or cashiers during their 12% rebate promotion days. It can be insane then, with the hordes of shoppers milling around, and long lines at the cashier points. Otherwise it is generally a pleasant shopping experience at Tangs. <br><br>Yelp Feb 2014 Challenge: 6/28",

"reviewcomment":"After an off-site at the Grand Hyatt, I tried to venture to Takashimaya&#39;s excellent Kinokuniya bookstore to purchase a travel guide for an upcoming trip.<br><br>I&#39;m usually a big ebook reader but a travel guide ebook is just not the same. Sometimes you need that physical book to flip through and dog ear during your research and travels, call me old school.<br><br>Anyhoo, I failed miserably trying to navigate from the Hyatt to Kinokuniya due to all the construction happening in the Orchard/Scott Rd area and some of the MRT corridors I&#39;m used to taking to get to Takashimaya being blocked. Somehow I ended up at Ion Orchard and just gave up, looking for a bookstore or some kind of store that might carry travel books.<br><br>Well, there&#39;s no bookstore in Ion which surprised me but there is a store called The Planet Traveller which sounded promising on the 4th floor.<br><br>Alas, they have a whole wall dedicated to travel guides and maps. They didn&#39;t have the Lonely Planet guide I was looking for so I picked up an Insights Guide book and I&#39;m very happy w/ my purchase. Staff was friendly and there&#39;s also a 10% discount for PPS club members, bonus!<br><br>I didn&#39;t pay attention to the rest of the store but it looks like they carry a lot of high end travel and outdoor gear reminiscent of a North Face or REI back in the states. <br><br>Cool store.",

Yes there is a beauty hall but not as extensive. There also aren&#39;t much home appliances. There are loads of fashion products for men and women though.

So I only find it fitting that I spread the word and share it with my favorite Yelpers (yes, I&#39;m talking about you!)<br><br>For those who don&#39;t know, Daiso is a Japanese dollar store chain, located at (one) of the ends of ION. This isn&#39;t the only outlet; there are a few around the island so there&#39;s a possibility you can find one near you. <br><br>They offer a wide variety of items like housewares, food, beauty products etc. You guessed it, my favorite section is the make up section! They have some great tools, like mascara guards and tweezers that help you attach fake eye lashes. <br><br>Is the merchandise good quality? At $2 per item, you be the judge. But it&#39;s always a fun time browsing through the store, as you&#39;ll see items that you never thought would exist! I love how the Japanese think of EVERYTHING.<br><br>No matter what time of day it is, there are always long queues at the registers. They go by quickly, though. Enjoy your $2 finds!",

If you don&#39;t have a car it&#39;s a little difficult to get to, but it is worth the trip. It has an excellent selection of craft beer, of course, at the best prices you&#39;ll find in Singapore. And there are little cards to describe the flavor profile, etc. That is a great tool to use when deciding whether to try out a new beer. If you are a beer nerd like me, you&#39;ll love grabbing one from the cooler to enjoy as you browse the inventory. The hours have been pretty limited since the soft opening, so you should check out the Facebook page before going there.

"reviewcomment":"What a beautiful store, and it&#39;s evolved wonderfully since I last visited a year ago. Previously, the focus was largely on a mishmash of pre-loved items and a handful of jewellery, but there&#39;s a far more extensive selection of items on display these days. Most of the jewellery is sourced from Korea, and the colours and materials used are unique and definitely interesting. There&#39;s also a good selection of clothing in the back, ranging from pre-loved pieces to pretty vintage dresses. <br><br>I certainly got good vibes from the place, both from the hospitality and the lovely array of items for sale, and I can foresee returning whenever I&#39;m back in the Tiong Bahru neighbourhood.",

For the male apparel, at least, the sizing of the garments are just too big for those among us who are slimmer. The suits offer very good value though, with clearly hand-stitched buttonholes on the lapels, unlike machine-sewn ones that look more like keyholes than a straight slit.<br><br>Customers visit M&amp;S not so much for the clothes as for the food, which does not surprise me.<br><br>The food section gets a lot of love thanks to immaculate packaging and the painstakingly detailed provenance and description of products. The pasta, for instance, was made in the Italian Alps from select wheat, and the tuna steak in spring water was caught in accordance to sustainable fishing practices. Almost everything is fair-trade, which strengthens the appeal of the products.",

As you can see from the picture, his shop is stocked so full of stuff that I cannot take a picture of his signage without some items blocking it. Trust me, it will take you forever to find something you are looking for and it will be faster to just ask him. He sells any household items you can imagine (think toiletries, kitchen items, cleaning equipments, shopping trolleys, vases, plant containers, soil, curtain rails, clothes rail and hangers...the list is neverending). He also carries out services like the cleaning of curtains (you just bring the curtains to him and he will send it for cleaning for you) and orders items that cannot be found in the shop.

"reviewcomment":"Does anyone else love grocery shopping as much as I do? Seriously, I have an illness. There&#39;s something about the bountiful fruit and vegetables, stacks of cans, and bags upon bags of.. you know.. stuff.. that makes me a little more excited than normal. While it&#39;s not as fancy schmancy as Cold Storage or Jason&#39;s, FF leaves an impression because there&#39;s more stock to check out than the regular Fairprice. Imported goods, organic selections, and even a rack of sugarless chocolate (oh, the travesty!). <br><br>And here&#39;s the awesome-y of Fairprice Finest- there&#39;s loads of aisles to wander about. Plus there&#39;s enough space for a skinny hippo to meander while at it. Get your fresh stuff, meaty stuff, seafoody stuff, canned stuffed and then some. If you&#39;re hungry, there&#39;s a tiny grab and go sushi counter, a rotisserie counter, and a robust cheese selection. If you&#39;re thirsty, there&#39;s a wine section. If you&#39;re just bored, go play with the Lock &amp; Lock tupperware. Which are now at 25% off, mind you. <br><br>I drop by a couple of times a week, just because. Sometimes to pick up some ice cream and apples, sometimes to grocery shop, sometimes just to enjoy the well serviced air conditioning. And I never leave empty handed, like.. ever.",

"reviewcomment":"I love the newly revamped Robinsons which replaces the old Hereen. I only had less than an hour to walk through the entire building but was pretty impressed by what I saw. The interior design is such a refreshing change from the usual run of the mill malls along orchard road. Think open shelves, quirky furniture accessories, funky wall colors and fixtures. The basement level looks similar to the also newly renovated Tangs Plaza basement, so I guess this must reflect the latest trend in ID.<br><br>They&#39;ve also brought in a lot more brands, e.g. my favourite Sergio Rossi! There is also a section showcasing vintage/2nd hand Hermes/Chanel bags. Although the price tag is way beyond reach for me, its nonetheless satisfying to drool over! The accessories/Jewellery section still carries some of the familiar &#39;cheaper&#39; brands but I must say the new minimalistic display and layout really elevates these pieces. I would not have bothered to give them a 2nd look if they were all chucked together in a shiny messy pile like they so often are in the Jewellery section of most shopping malls.<br><br>The downside to me is the location which takes a bit longer to walk to. Other than that, I&#39;m looking forward to returning soon to have a more leisurely look the 2nd time round.",

"reviewcomment":"Knowing K-pop has been popular among Singaporeans for sometime, it takes a while for me to realise that other form of Korean influence has also reached the shores of Singapore. Being used to local establishments like NTUC FairPrice, Shop N Save and such, other foreign mini-mart have also sprang up. Apart from Japanese ones that I visited before, I came across a Korean mini-mart called &#39;Sol Mart&#39; for the first time. <br><br>Going inside the mart, the atmosphere was no different than any other mart except heaps of foodstuff and utensils are available based on Korean brands. Snacks, food seasonings, assorted cooking flavours and other things Korean populate the mart. It was quite refreshing to see such stuff other than the usual Japanese or Thai mini-marts abound. I bought some items to try adding a Korean flavour to my amateurish cooking back home. The staff was pleasant enough to answer some of my queries while she packed my purchases into the grocery bag. I don&#39;t mind coming back for more, as I become accustomed to the Korean flavour. Sol Mart&#39;s opening hours: 10am -9:30pm.",

"reviewcomment":"CK Department Store is known as a place to get cheaper items. It is probably Singapore&#39;s answer to a Walmart or Target. <br><br>This store occupies two to three shop units, so one side is devoted to the toiletries and household products. The other side sells clothing I think as I have never walked to that area to browse. It also makes use of the space in front of the shop to display more clothes and other household stuff. <br><br>Generally you can get shampoo, shower gel, soap, toothpaste, cleanser etc at a much lower price than the usual Watson&#39;s or Guardian Pharmacy or supermarkets. The bathroom tissues, detergent, dish soap prices are low, but can be comparable to those on sale in supermarkets. I guess you really need to know your prices well in order to get a good bargain. <br><br>The place is not a joy to shop at as the aisles are narrow. You cannot really have two persons standing back to back, so you literally have to wait for someone to exit the aisle before you can get through to the end. There are no signs indicating &#34;household products&#34;, &#34;toiletries&#34; etc, but it is a small enough place to browse. Or you can always ask the sales associates who do ask if they can help you with anything when you enter the store. <br><br>The range is not wide, with the basic common brands in stock. <br><br>What delighted me on my last visit was to discover it has Febreeze air effects. I have emailed Cold Storage about stocking it before but there was no reply. And I have also emailed P&amp;G about it, and again no reply. In the end, I found out Ambi Pur is actually Febreeze in Asia. Different brand name, but the same product. In any case, the Febreeze (or Ambi Pur) air effect costs only $3.95! Ambi Pur air effects is going for over $7 in Cold Storage. <br><br>Some prices here for comparisons (subject to shop&#39;s price change, of course):<br>Nivea lip balm - $3.50<br>Neutrogena On The Spot treatment - $8+<br>Neutrogena Foaming Cleanser (blue bottle) - $9.90<br>Kleenex bathroom tissues - $5.95<br>Gillette Mach 3 Turbo Sensitive - $9.20<br><br>At least now I know where to go when I need to get a new bottle of Febreeze air effects. <br><br>Note:<br>Bring cash or bank card. Payment by cash or NETS only.",
