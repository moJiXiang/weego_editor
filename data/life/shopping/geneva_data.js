"reviewcomment":"It is always a treat to step into a Globus.  I don&#39;t go often as it is at the high end of the department store and grocery shopping experience in Switzerland, and thus a bit more pricey. I would compare it to a Nordstroms for those from the US.   If I do buy anything it is usually from the supermarket as they have gourmet items that you can&#39;t get at other places.  The store is just beautiful and they do such a great job of how they present everything.  It is just fun to explore and look around.  <br><br>I also really like the food court here for lunch time as they have a variety of items to select from and several benches and tables to sit at.  Just be ready to jump on a place as it can get hectic to find a seat sometimes during the lunch hour.  I have always enjoyed their panini sandwiches here.",

"reviewcomment":"I initially went in here due to the cute name for this store. As an added bonus I was superhappy to find the long-gone-from-the-US fragrance &#39;D&amp;G&#39; from Dolce &amp; Gabbana. I bought a bottle for a close friend back in the states as a surprise, and he was stoked.<br><br>Yes, it does have that semi-department store feeling similar to a Sears but with some more upscale items. I don&#39;t speak fluent French (okay, I don&#39;t speak it at all) but I was able to get by quite well with the associates who worked there. Or, I think I did...<br><br>I ended up visiting a couple more coops while staying abroad, but I enjoyed this one due to the vast selections of products (I even did some light grocery shopping here) plus their cafe/takeaway food area as Mindy H. pointed out below. <br><br>Not sure of what the difference between coop vs. coopcity is, but I&#39;m guessing the coopcities are specifically in largely populated areas, similar to how target has city target in more urban dwellings?<br><br>Be sure to check out your neighborhood coop while visiting the country of Switzerland.

"reviewcomment":"I was impressed to receive a refund for a pack of tomatoes with fungus and a bag of oranges with mold - I bought them yesterday and, though I&#39;ve accepted that food, especially produce, in Geneva is nothing but subpar, I was upset to find stuff growing on my food. Having misplaced the receipt, I was doubtful that I would be able to exchange the veggies. Instead, I got a refund, and the woman at customers&#39; service was apologetic and friendly. I also met a French woman getting her groceries who understood my heartbreak about the awful food scene in Geneva after I&#39;ve lived in Paris, Rome, NY, and Madrid. She said she spent her first month in Geneva crying for real food - (she&#39;s from Beaune and went to school in Lyon). She inspected my grocery cart and approved of the French cheeses and other French items I&#39;d selected (sorry, the Swiss cheeses are not for me, and I like my imported Swiss muesli in the US - they must export the high quality stuff). My dinner - a nice French wine and cheese. Not as good as what I had in Paris of in Burgundy, but close enough for now. I spent 29 francs for items that would cost me 15 USD and maybe 17-20 Euros in Paris, but not bad.",

"reviewcomment":"Out of all the apple stores I&#39;ve been to this is by far the most interesting from an architectural standpoint. apple stores always seem to have a signature look about them. This is true no matter where you go. I think you could even go as far as to suggest that they are extremely obsessed (understatement) with the style and image of their locations. Many stand out in a very sublime sort of way. Others, the big store in NYC for example, hit you like a ton of bricks. The store in Geneve is a grand departure to me from all the others. It is obviously designed to fit into the local environment seamlessly. So much so that you could almost blink and miss it. The best way to approach it is from Rue de Port and then you can&#39;t miss it. You run right into it. As you enter it is nicely understated. The day I visited, on a Saturday, it was very busy but because of the design there weren&#39;t a lot of people bunched up at the entrance. There is a narrow space that you pass through where I think people can receive instruction from the staff on operating their new product or just a space where you can sit and use your device. I really wasn&#39;t sure. After you pass through you find yourself in a large room with a beautiful high ceiling. I have never seen an apple store like this. It must be great on a sunny day. All of the products are on display in this space. This is very typical of all other stores. If you&#39;ve been to any other apple store you know exactly what I&#39;m talking about. What is very nice though is there is an alcove on the right end that has all of the accessories. It&#39;s great to have them all in the same place. Then, on the left end is the genius bar.<br><br>I didn&#39;t have any technical issues on this occasion but I did observe people receiving competent instructions on the set up of their new iPhones etc.. People who complain about the competency of the staff at apple stores I find are only trying to feel self important. apple staff receives excellent training. Not that they all receive the same training however. That&#39;s why apple has the Genius Bar. But usually if you have a problem I&#39;d suggest you try the apple support communities online first. Of course, if you can&#39;t get online then you have a good reason to visit the apple store. I think you&#39;ll enjoy the one in Geneve.",
