Almost every brand I could think of for makeup, perfume, shoes, clothes, and even paper, I found here.<br><br>The Parisian metro makes it easily accessible. The view from the terrace is incredible.

It&#39;s affordable, open late (11 pm or midnight), carries clothing, accessories, cosmetics, housewares, and has a full fledged grocery section downstairs. We stocked up on French supermarket goodies to take back home, including chocolate bars (they have a large selection of Cote D&#39;Or brand), jam, chestnut cream, Nutella in the glass jar, strangely flavored Pringles, etc.<br><br>For French skincare and beauty products, I actually found Monoprix to be more expensive than cosmetics store chain Marionnaud (just down the street), although cheapest of all of course is City Pharma (review coming soon).

"reviewcomment":"This Monop store (Monoprix) was the closest grocer &amp; convenience shop to where we were staying. While it&#39;s fun to be right in Bercy Village, be prepared to spend an extra euro or two when shopping at this nicely located shop. <br><br>Since this isn&#39;t one of their usual humungous department store size locations, they offer a moderate selection of goods; prepackaged convenience foods, groceries, wines, products (kitchenware, makeup, body/face/hair care, clothes and books/magazines) and even as a cafe on premise. I must have stopped in everyday, if not twice a day, to pick up things for dinner, or random things that I would occasionally need. They did not stay open very late, so make sure to plan your trips well if you are short on your hotel fridge grocery items.<br><br>All in all, this one was a lifesaver to have right around the corner. Sure, I probably overpaid, but as my friend says, &#34;it&#39;s Paris.&#34;",

Every district has either a Herald Sqaure or SoHo vibe, or both!<br><br>In our desperation, we ended up at Le Bazar de l&#39;Hôtel de Ville .. BHV. From the outside, and all the ads, I imagined some kind of Parisian Macy&#39;s. I was kind of right, but throw in some magic as well.<br><br>This place literally has everything. Just the stationary/crafts/gifts department took up almost an entire floor. I just have no words to describe the magic that was their stationary department.<br><br>We ended doing a lot of our shopping here, and if I go back to Paris, this is probably where i&#39;d go again. We bought things for ourselves as well as gifts. The store has plenty of everything.<br><br>Note: The men&#39;s store is in a separate smaller building across the street from the main store, but the men&#39;s shoe/accessories section is pretty good.",
