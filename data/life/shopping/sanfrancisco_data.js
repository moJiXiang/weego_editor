"reviewcomment":"Driving to work yesterday, I whipped my head around to check my blindspot and hurt my neck. This taught me two important things: 1) I am old, and 2) I need a new pillow. <br><br>I have a squashy synthetic down pillow, which is fine when you&#39;re in college, going to head banging concerts (that&#39;s what the kids call them, I&#39;m sure), but once you hit 30, things start to go rapidly downhill. Things like your neck. And your metabolism. <br><br>Anyway, I went to Keetsa, where Michael greeted me and let me sample every pillow on the floor (the mattresses were really nice, too). The store itself was very peaceful and quiet, tucked away off of King Street. Michael answered all my questions and didn&#39;t pressure me into buying anything. It didn&#39;t feel like a typical mattress store. <br><br>I got two pillows -- one to fix my deteriorating neck/head situation, and one to replace the stinky Tempurpedic pillow that my fiancee loves. I had him try the Keetsa pillow, and the Tempurpedic one went quickly into storage. Huge success! <br><br>I was also pleasantly surprised by the prices. Less expensive than Tempurpedic, and without that gross chemical smell. There is no off-gassing at all with my Keetsa pillows -- they are ready to be used right out of the box, no &#34;airing out&#34; needed.",

"reviewcomment":"If you think that the Daiso craze was just happening in SoCal, you&#39;re dead wrong. Even in San Franciso, people flock to the handful of locations that are available. WHY? Cause, everything inside the store is a $1.50 or otherwise stated. This along with a few conditions are plastered all throughout the store, even in different languages. Here&#39;s one in Spanish (<a href='http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/daiso-japan-san-francisco-3?select=E7sDIIAaNQevsuioL1qftw#E7sDIIAaNQevsuioL1qftw'>yelp.com/biz_photos/dais…</a>).<br><br>Located, at the Japan Center (East Mall) of Japantown, the green colored sign outside pretty much gives it away (<a href='http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/daiso-japan-san-francisco-3?select=1l029DR0Y-TE0sDix78puw#1l029DR0Y-TE0sDix78puw'>yelp.com/biz_photos/dais…</a>). It&#39;s a decent sized venue, with enough room to move around comfortably. One thing I like about Daiso locations are the consistencies in the products they sell. The main issue is the quick turnover of merchandise, so employees constantly have to stock the store for their popular items.<br><br>THE RULES OF DAISO<br>- Everything inside the store is $1.50, unless otherwise marked.<br>- They don&#39;t accept $100 dollar bills.<br>- Credit Card minimum is $10. Debit Card has no minimum.<br>- VISA &amp; MasterCard are accepted only. Purchases over $20 with a credit card requires a valid ID.<br>- All sales are final. No returns or exchanges.<br>- They only sell BRAND Goods, not Closeout or Factory Second Merchandise.<br><br>The one thing that&#39;s different about this location is the security, which results in a few additional rules. This is the first Daiso location that I&#39;ve seen, which has a guard present. I assume that there&#39;s a lot of 5 finger discounts happening. Shown clearly outside the store is a sign stating the following.<br><br>- Monitored by security camera.<br>- Shoplifters will be prosecuted.<br>- No public restroom.<br><br>Talk about harsh. But, I don&#39;t make the rules and they&#39;re supposedly made to protect you and me. Either way, Daiso will continue to take my hard earned money, on shit I don&#39;t need or sometimes want, regardless of the location. I hate to love you Daiso.",

"reviewcomment":"I had called in advance to see if they had certain products (being as I have tiny feet and I did not have any time to waste). Basically, I&#39;m a size 4 in Women&#39;s and a size 1-2 in Kid&#39;s.<br><br>Mico P, from the Kid&#39;s shoes dept., had directed me towards the wall for my new Nike Elite Socks. His warm and friendly greeting allowed me to feel comfortable enough to ask for help BUT at the same time, he didn&#39;t hover over me like usual sales people. Upon purchase, we had a nice chat (while no other customers were around) about other products he suggested. I&#39;m definitely coming back to him the next time I&#39;ll be purchasing TOMS &amp; Nike Elite Socks in the Kid&#39;s Dept.<br><br>After my purchase, I headed upstairs to meet my mother, as she was in search for shoes. After under going surgery, she definitely needed a pick me up. James, from the BP Shoe Dept., tended to her every question. I really appreciate how he took the time to take out so many shoes and sandal pairs for her, even suggesting shoe styles and sizing -especially since she just got out of surgery and her mobility is some what limited.<br><br>Recently purchased a few items from the dress department. Justine was very accommodating and truly made my search for dresses a whole lot easier. She even gave advice and suggested a few things I could get that would go along well with the dress I selected. Needless to say, I bought them all. Later, my mother was helped by Jalen of another department (also located on the 3rd floor).<br><br>It&#39;s customer service from people like these who make customers want to come back over and over agin.",

"reviewcomment":"This is a great store, with 3 floors with displays/merchandise.  Most of the bigger items (furniture and such) can be found on the upper two floors.  Good place to buy nice glasses, plates, and other kitchen or household items.  Super convenient location a short walk from BART or Muni.  Also, if you buy something big that needs to be picked up with a car, they have a little garage area where you can pull into to load up.<br><br>I recently bought a big cabinet, floor model (clearance), and had it delivered.  I had some issues with it (some minor damage while in transit).  It took several weeks, but eventually it got repaired to my liking thanks to the attentive efforts of my salesman, Rand.",

She apologized that I was not provided a MEN&#39;s gift with purchase and offered to mail me some samples. A few days later I happily opened up some MEN&#39;S samples to use, and now they have themselves a devoted Shiseido customer for Macy&#39;s.",

Artsy, Empriente, Delightful.  <br><br>I got the DELIGHTFUL PM handbag for $1060 and the MINI POUCHETTE Monogram for $295.  LOVE!!!!!!!!!!  The sales associate, Benjamin, was so helpful, sweet and kind.  He pulled out 8 handbags for me and was patient.  There were 2 SA&#39;s when I went in and the other was helping another customer.  There was some foot traffic but they were overall courteous and just nice people.  Good job NM and LV!<br><br>The LV store at Valley Fair was great to me too after test driving many many handbags after 3 visits down there.  My purchase at NM was not planned and felt a little guilty buying here than back near my home in SJ.    <br><br>FYI:  If you&#39;re coming in to browse at luxury stores, just dress a little decent and don&#39;t look like a shmuck.  It&#39;s not Starbuck&#39;s or the local public library.  I wore leggings, nice boots, and a long vince top. Nothing fancy and they totally treated me with respect.",

This taught me two important things: 1) I am old, and 2) I need a new pillow. <br><br>I have a squashy synthetic down pillow, which is fine when you&#39;re in college, going to head banging concerts (that&#39;s what the kids call them, I&#39;m sure), but once you hit 30, things start to go rapidly downhill. Things like your neck. And your metabolism. <br><br>Anyway, I went to Keetsa, where Michael greeted me and let me sample every pillow on the floor (the mattresses were really nice, too). The store itself was very peaceful and quiet, tucked away off of King Street. Michael answered all my questions and didn&#39;t pressure me into buying anything. It didn&#39;t feel like a typical mattress store. <br><br>I got two pillows -- one to fix my deteriorating neck/head situation, and one to replace the stinky Tempurpedic pillow that my fiancee loves. I had him try the Keetsa pillow, and the Tempurpedic one went quickly into storage. Huge success! <br><br>I was also pleasantly surprised by the prices. Less expensive than Tempurpedic, and without that gross chemical smell. There is no off-gassing at all with my Keetsa pillows -- they are ready to be used right out of the box, no &#34;airing out&#34; needed.",

Otherwise we would have no other motivation to enter the premises. In fact, we saw the cakes and promptly sat outside in their sidewalk patio area where we wouldn&#39;t be mistaken for shoppers. I was tempted by the $7 slices of cake they offered on their menu with the Pineapple Coconut particularly alluring (photo: <a href='/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1caesI8&amp;s=00da76db5c8904d098aa093ca360d20d4128d3b6fffa3ce7a50726aa66c681cb' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>bit.ly/1caesI8</a>).

Well-heeled foreign tourists followed our lead and took charge of the remaining patio tables. they offer salads and sandwiches that wouldn&#39;t look out of place at a country club luncheon.

"reviewcomment":"Best Ross in SF!! Such a large selection of clothes, accessories, and home decor. The line moves fast and the clerks are friendly and helpful.<br>I bought a hair straighter for $17 and it&#39;s 10000 times better than the $60 I had. <br>I always come to Ross for pjs and slippers too.<br>They also have a lot of pet clothing! Not that I dress my poodle, except for the occasional sweater when it&#39;s unusually chilly.",

They lasted me a few days! I was surprised. I also picked up a bottle of (brand name) soda for only $1!!! woooo!",

"reviewcomment":"A couple weeks I was here looking for a bathing suit.  Michelle, the sales associate covering the department at the time was super helpful and patient.  I came across a swimsuit from the Juicy Couture Spring 2009 collection which was ticketed a regular price of $173.  Just an hour earlier, I was at the Juicy Couture store admiring the same suit, which was on sale there for $105, size XS.  When I mentioned how it was on sale elsewhere, Michelle right away mentioned that Nordstrom matches prices of other retailers.  Of course, when I heard that I nearly jumped for joy.  I asked Michelle to see if another store would have size small available.  She checked the system and to my luck, yes a size small was available.  As a gift, my mom ended up ordering the swimsuit which should get to me within a few days.  Next time I&#39;m in the swimsuit/athletic wear department at Nordstrom Union Square, I will definitely be back to purchase from Michelle.  She was so very pleasant to deal with.",

"reviewcomment":"First time at a TJ Maxx store!<br><br>This location is located right in the shopping square across from Burger King. There&#39;s a parking lot right outside so finding parking should be easy peezy! <br><br>The store itself is 2 levels. Women&#39;s clothing, shoes, and bags are all downstairs while upstairs has kids&#39; clothes, men&#39;s clothes, toys, and house supplies (i.e. Pillows, blankets, clocks..). The bathroom is also located upstairs, but the dressing room is located downstairs.<br><br>The store is also pretty small and limited on selections, but that doesn&#39;t mean there isn&#39;t anything worth looking for! It just takes time and who knows, you might snag a good deal on something. Although their shoes are quite limited for women who have smaller feet than a size 6. <br><br>Workers were friendly, but not all that helpful. Then again.. This place is pretty much easy to maneuver in so help wasn&#39;t all that needed. Overall, good place to shop for deals. I saw a lot of clearance racks around~",

Best Buy wanted $75 from me, which sounded ridiculous so I decided to head down to the mission. <br><br>After searching through the goodwill and thrift town with no luck I stumbled upon this store.
