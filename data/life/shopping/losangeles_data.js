"reviewcomment":"I love this store!! I&#39;ve always kept up with their products online, but never decided to purchase anything. I don&#39;t know why, because Johnny Cupcakes is an awesome brand.<br><br>The storefront is adorable. Every review mentions it, but the shop walls are lined with cute little ovens, that occasionally open and spew out smoke. The door to the back room is also a huge kitchen appliance. If I had a bit more money, my house would look something like this! <br><br>Enough fantasizing now.<br><br>The shirts are kept in little &#34;refrigerators&#34; which I think is an adorably nice touch. My visit to the storefront was in October, so Johnny had just released his Halloween shirts.<br><br>They had all of the classic horror movie monsters converted into Johnny Cupcake&#39;s fat little boy logo. It was super cute and I wanted them all!<br><br>I finally ended up deciding on the Leatherface shirt and the horror sticker pack. The man who rang me up was super friendly and had a great personality.<br><br>My only complaint is that my shirt (fresh out of the store) has some sort of oil stain on it that won&#39;t come out.",

"reviewcomment":"Love this dollar king location. Better than the other 2 on Foothill. They have everything!!! Great selection of beauty products, holiday items, gift wrap, etc.<br><br>I&#39;m writing this review because I had a great experience there yesterday. I went in with my cousin and picked up a few christmas items. When we got to the register to pay, I realized I was missing $30 from my purse. My cousin ended up paying. I got to the car n didn&#39;t find my $30 anywhere! We got home then decided it was a long shot but maybe, just maybe we woild be able to find my cash at the store where I assumed I accodently dropped. <br><br>Got back to dollar king and looked everywhere and of course didn&#39;t find it....I saw a few employees and randomly decided to ask one of they had foumd any cash. He looked right at me and said &#34;$30??&#34; And I was soooo surprisedddd....I said &#34;yesss&#34; he took me to another female wmployee and asked her about the cash that ahe found earlier. Long story short, she explained that she found it and some customer was present at the time. She gave the $30 to the manager jist incase someone claimed it. She said the lady who saw her pick it up off the rack went up to the manager and pretended it was her $30 she lost. Basically, a lying desperate customer claimed the cash and the manager believed her. Anyway, they calles the manager and he came back and explained the situation to me again and said &#34;we are sorry! He had the other employee take out $30 and gave it to me. WoW!!!! <br><br>I thought this was one of the nicest things a person has done! I mean I dropped my cash Â in the store. It was MY fault. However, the really nice young female Armenian employee found it (did not pocket it like most ppl would do) and gave it to the manager. Thennnnn the really nice Armenian male wmployee or possibly the owner not really sure, was nice wnough to call the manager and explain the situation and try to get my money (well not really because another customer took it) and give it back to me. <br><br>Hope my story was clear..anyway, this is probably the best customer service I have ever experienced. Its one pf those stories ill share with others. <br><br>Thank you Dollar King!!!! A special thanks to the Armenian girl who found the cash and was furious another customer took it lol!!! I wish I got her name....she was too nice! I even saw her interracting with another customer and she was greatttt! I mean u don&#39;t expect to get much service from a dollar store but this girl was treating customers as if they were shopping at neiman marcus.....as for the two male employees (armenian and hispanic) they were excellent as well. GREAT service....chivalry is not dead I guess! :)",

"reviewcomment":"Bam. Â Five stars all the way goes to this store and it&#39;s all because of the awesome customer service I received. Â William, the department manager for watches and jewelery helped me with a return and was beyond courteous, patient and knowledgeable. Â A prime example as to how and why people work their way up totem poles within companies. Â I&#39;ll be sure to continue shopping from this location and it&#39;s all because of the customer service, rather than the product. Â Night and day difference between this dept within the shop and the one at the grove :/ Â Sorry guys, but customer service goes a long way, despite it only being a phone inquiry.<br><br>Would also like to mention the manager of the sunglasses dept. Â Can&#39;t quite remember her name, but once again, great customer service.<br><br>Thanks for the pleasant shopping experience, guys :) keep it up",

"reviewcomment":"Well Hello there New and Improved Nordstrom! Â <br>My official and favorite Nordstrom is at Topanga, but I had a hankering for traffic and congestion so I came out to this one. Â Strangely, this Nordy&#39;s in the &#34;cool&#34; part of town had a really lame shoe department and the layout was a big dud....it didn&#39;t even come close to the offerings at Topanga. Â But on this last visit I walked in to see a very bright and refreshed Nordy&#39;s! Â <br>The shoe department is much better, carrying all the top lines and sprawling over a big portion of the main floor. Â The cosmetics department also seems to have gotten a Â good dose of Restalyne too! Â The second floor had the women&#39;s, athletic, and lingerie departments as well Bar Verde (a great little bar and restaurant). Â The service was as expected, pleasant and helpful. Â <br>This store resembles the new Glendale location, and has an interesting flow that doesn&#39;t seem to distinguish between departments; Â they all just kind of flow into each other. Â It&#39;s sort of feels like Barney&#39;s....<br>I still prefer my Topanga Store and will remain faithful to it, but this was a nice surprise to walk into after 50 minutes in the Grove parking lot.",

I passed by a few Givenchy&#39;s on display and many more fashion house labels. <br><br>Parking is great! The parking structure is free, and no validation is needed. Macy&#39;s is located downstairs and there is an array of stores just across the street (Anthropologie, Pier One, Aaron Brothers... etc). <br><br>I love that they offer gorgeous selections to people with high end taste. It&#39;s a wonderful haven of finely made materials, gorgeous quality bags and wallets and your day-to-day awesome finds for clothing. <br><br>Great experience!",

I needed some and they had what I needed and then some. Great prices too! I also picked up a shirt - $3.98! that then turned out to be 20% off on top of that. So, basically FREE. <br><br>What I found really cool was that if you are paying with a credit or debit card they have people with mobile checkout devices that will check you out while you are in line.

The staff is great... <br><br>One more thing... when I was getting ready to try stuff on I noticed they had those fitting rooms that are single stalls covered with just a drape as a door. I really hate those types of fitting rooms just because it&#39;s very easy to see through the sides..

"reviewcomment":"In terms of Marshalls in the area, this is the best one yet if you&#39;re looking for designer clothes &amp; shoes. I read about the opening on <a href='/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fla.racked.com&amp;s=e0805408e7297527b71c7ae9876e9fe2c4f4ccbf862a8cb49aacb99f72ee08be' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>la.racked.com</a> in which they showed a bunch of designer shoes at this locations so i had to check it out.<br><br>Overall the store is pretty small but I can appreciate that. I love shopping but I do not love combing through racks &amp; racks of stuff so I can appreciate a compact store with good quality stuff.<br><br>The shoes &amp; handbags are on the 1st floor. Handbag selection is standard issue, nothing you wouldn&#39;t find in any other Marshall&#39;s but the shoe collection is on another level! It&#39;s small but they have more high end designers than I&#39;ve ever seen. I spotted Christian Dior, Valentino, Saint Laurent but my jaw dropped when my eyes locked on the only pair of Christian Louboutin&#39;s in the store! Thankfully they were my size and naturally I scooped them up. They were more than half off the original price which is still hefty but I wasn&#39;t about to leave a pair of Louboutin&#39;s on the rack!<br><br>I happily took myself (and my shoes) upstairs to check out the clothes. Lots of Michael Kors, J Brand, James Perse, etc.<br><br>The one con is that the dress selection is 2 racks. I&#39;m more of a dress girl than the t-shirt &amp; jeans type so i was pretty saddened by this.<br><br>In general, the 2nd floor was pretty well organized but again, small.<br><br>I purchase a lot of gym clothes from Marshalls because I go through them so fast. Either they rip or fade so I don&#39;t like to spend too much on these items as the turn over rate is kinda high :)<br>This location had a nice sized selection of gym clothes - better than most Marshall&#39;s.<br><br>All in all I would highly recommend visiting this new location in Glendale.",

The store size is big enough that you can see everything you want within that one hour. <br><br>The clothes are quite expensive and to more worth it with that 70% discount going on for past 2013 year trend. <br><br>I got some handy supplies for on the go and stationery. A pen can range from $1.50 to $3.75.

The location is as random as possible, but for we locals that is perfect. It&#39;s your average, run-of-the-mill Target, which includes a Starbucks inside. The major bonus points for this store stem from the size of the store in comparison to the average ratio of shoppers at any given time. I enjoy being able to actually move around inside the store without having to look around for some a-hole&#39;s unsupervised brat darting in front of my shopping cart.
