"reviewcomment":"Sabon,<br><br>One of my girlfriends flew into town from California and we were shopping in Soho when we discovered this store! Wow! I must say I&#39;m very impressed by the set up of this store and it&#39;s customer service. We were instantly greeted by a friendly employee and were invited to go wash our hands at the sink. The customer service lady asked us what are skin types were and what fragrances we liked. We got to wash our hands with soap and water and then were instantly pampered with nice lotions and a few sugar scrubs. I mean talk about amazing customer service! What a hands on job! <br><br>I ended up buying some facial towels with SPF 30 in it and the lady at the register asked me for my email. When you give them your email with a first purchase (at the time) you received a free hand lotion! Awesome! I love freebies! I really enjoyed stepping into the store and I would definitely visit again! <br><br>Sincerely,<br>Blake H.",

"reviewcomment":"I am sooooo happy that I found this place! <br><br>If you have any type of situation that makes buying bras that fit impossible, go here! My issue is a very narrow ribcage. I need bras with a 28 band, which I could never find before. Cristal did my fitting and she was so patient and wonderful and really commited to finding me something that worked for my body type.<br><br>As others have mentioned, you have to make an appointment to be seen here. They take your credit card number and if you cancel within the 24 hours leading up to your appointment or don&#39;t show up, you&#39;re charged $100.00. This made me nervous, because I didn&#39;t know if I would even find anything there, but I am SO happy I made an appointment.  <br><br>Buying bras has been a hellish experience for me my entire life. I have been to more specialty lingerie stores across the five boroughs than I can count on one hand. Even the well known ones in Manhattan. But this was the best experience I have had shopping and being fitted for a bra and here&#39;s why:<br><br>- I thought I was getting good service at other lingerie stores because every single one of them told me that my body was unusual and bras weren&#39;t really available in my size, but that they would work with me to find something that I could use. At the end of these other fittings, I&#39;d drop ridiculous amounts of money on bras that were then altered (and then inevitably stretched out of shape in a few months) or stabbing me with underwires or not supporting me at all. But each time I was told that this was all normal and that the bra fit great. Today, I learned that there absolutely are bras in my size that will give me support and they come in fun colors too!<br><br>- Cristal was so thorough in fitting me. She really cared that what I was buying actually fit me and even had me do things like sit, stand, jump, etc to make sure the bra was doing its job!! If something didn&#39;t fit even a little bit, she would give me something else to try instead until we got it right. This was a stark contrast to any other fitting I&#39;ve been to where the fitter would look at me in a way that let me know they didn&#39;t know what to do with me, then they&#39;d hand me a few ill fitting bras and disappear for ages while working with other customers and then return to say that everything looked great and that the underwire was exactly where it was supposed to be after I complained of it stabbing me.<br><br>- The prices here are what I expected. They are in line with other specialty lingerie stores. I thought that this was great because the fitting is so much better than at other places. I was very relieved that the bras weren&#39;t more expensive because of this. I have come to accept that I will never find a $20 bra in my size, so I just understand now that if I&#39;m going to wear a bra that works for me, unfortunately, I will have to shell out a bit. It&#39;s very worth it to me to feel comfortable though.<br><br>All in all, I won&#39;t be going anywhere else now to buy bras. This is the only place I have found in my life that carries my bra size! And on top of that, I left with styles that fit me well and even ended up with a bright blue bra, woohoo!",

It was a number of amusing automated puppets with lettering on the windows telling the story. There was also a video projected on the side of the building that could only be seen across the street at Rockefeller... it didnt hurt that we were headed that way anyways! <br><br>Who doesnt like a good journey story!?!??!<br>;D",

"reviewcomment":"This is purely for the Christmas window display...<br><br>I dont normally check out window treatments however this was but one of many setups I would see over the course of the night... and to be quite honest with you, I enjoyed this the most because of the interaction. Yes, I know its a marketing ploy but it was a fun one. The most fun I had out of all the windows seen. <br><br>As we were walking by I had thought that the mannequins looked odd. And they did with good reason because they were real people. So she decided to do whatever it took to get inside there since it looked like it was a photo opportunity with Barney&#39;s version of Mr. and Mrs. Claus. As it were our luck didnt falter this part of trip because there was no line oddly enough. And there was no cost to boot! We walked through the side entrance and we were guided to the set. Mr and Mrs were cool people who were having a great time. We took four shots... 1 was cold, 2 looked like we were raving, 3 was staring off into green screen wonderland, and 4 was a group hug. <br><br>It was fun! And then we proceeded up to the top floor to get a physical copy. Now who doesnt like a free picture?!?!?!<br>;D",

I do go here Weekly to purchase all my houshold/beauty/cleaning/cooking/even electronic needs! <br><br>I admit that there is a lot of Junk here but it&#39;s definitely better priced than your local target or even Duane Reade. I have scored countless bargins here and I prefer this location over the one on Broadway. <br><br>When times rough and you are tight on cash - it&#39;s definitely a place for all your shopping needs. <br>I&#39;ve scored yoga pants for $5 - they are decent quality and will not become transparent when you bend over from behind.<br>I&#39;ve scored salon nail effects for $3 - but they are last season&#39;s designs. <br>Actually a lot of the stuff is from the previous season<br><br>they have John Frieda shampoo and conditioner for $2 - that&#39;s crazy cheap.<br>You can get a lot of the other herbal essence type shampoos for around the same price too.

"reviewcomment":"Hands-down, the BEST maternity and nursing wear store in New York. Why? Selection - it is clear that the owner is careful and knowledgeable in her purchasing, as there is a good selection of all the better products out there for maternity and nursing wear. They stay true to their slogan of &#34;give up wine, coffee and sushi, but not fashion!&#34; They have such a great selection that I am always left with a stack of clothes that I actually really WANT to purchase, rather than - ugh, that&#39;ll do. Which is a wonderful way to feel during pregnancy, when you are rapidly expanding and feeling less than chic. The brand selection is extensive and different from other stores and Destination Maternity. Definitely head here is you want some other options than the somewhat plainer offerings from H&amp;M and Gap maternity (nothing wrong with either of these - they are great for extending the wardrobe a bit less expensively). Yes, they stock the some of the more expensive maternity lines, but if you purchase carefully you can use most of the items for entire maternity period, including breastfeeding. Some of the dresses I have from here are so nice I will definitely want to continue wearing after that. Also, with the higher price point comes better quality items, so they are all holding up nicely to lots of washing an wearing.<br><br>All the staff are extremely helpful, always offering their opinions and styling advice. I love going to this store - I just have to save up a bit before I go!",

(and gentlemen in some states)..They have a Husband for Sale set of mugs + remote control.  Only a few left!<br><br>Finally, last but not least, Alex McCord onion chopper and other kitchen items.  Does Alex want us to think that she is the next Martha Stewart?  Doubt JC Penney and Macy&#39;s would fight for exclusive rights to sell her licensed kitchen aids.  If the Alex McCord items are already in Lot Less (haven&#39;t seen any press about the new line even though I read AM New York and Metro religiously), is that the kitchen aid version tantamount to a straight to DVD movie?  (Btw, I&#39;ve also seen Skinny Girl by Bethenny body lotions at Lot Less).<br><br>Do not purchase:<br><br>Crystal Light Peach Bellini drink mix-- even though the big display states than it was seen on the Apprentice with Donald Trump, it has a very chemical taste.  Who ever made this:  you&#39;re fired!<br><br>Stash Mango passion fruit tea-- tastes weird, like poupouri (how the heck do you spell that word?)<br><br>This store is popular, and there is a line at the checkout most of the time.  However,  they have a guy watching and yelling &#34;next customer!&#34; to move the line along.  The cashiers are polite and thank you for your purchases.  Making it easy to give them money for things you might or might not need before your change your mind: capitalism at its best.",

It was, however, hard to find a cart and I had to lug a few boxes around. <br>I came here a few days before Xmas and found really cute ornaments (other Targets are usually sold out). Their intimate apparel section was empty - I guess everyone bought their mom pajamas for Christmas. Wish it was properly stocked cause I love me some jammies.",

"reviewcomment":"Hands-down, the BEST maternity and nursing wear store in New York. Why? Selection - it is clear that the owner is careful and knowledgeable in her purchasing, as there is a good selection of all the better products out there for maternity and nursing wear. They stay true to their slogan of &#34;give up wine, coffee and sushi, but not fashion!&#34; They have such a great selection that I am always left with a stack of clothes that I actually really WANT to purchase, rather than - ugh, that&#39;ll do. Which is a wonderful way to feel during pregnancy, when you are rapidly expanding and feeling less than chic. The brand selection is extensive and different from other stores and Destination Maternity. Definitely head here is you want some other options than the somewhat plainer offerings from H&amp;M and Gap maternity (nothing wrong with either of these - they are great for extending the wardrobe a bit less expensively). Yes, they stock the some of the more expensive maternity lines, but if you purchase carefully you can use most of the items for entire maternity period, including breastfeeding. Some of the dresses I have from here are so nice I will definitely want to continue wearing after that. Also, with the higher price point comes better quality items, so they are all holding up nicely to lots of washing an wearing.<br><br>All the staff are extremely helpful, always offering their opinions and styling advice. I love going to this store - I just have to save up a bit before I go!",

Claustrophobics and clutter-phobics, you may want to take a Xanax upon entering, but I promise - the low prices and lovely service will make it all worth it!<br><br>I had done a lot of shopping around for furniture when I first moved (and tried almost all of the highest rated furniture &#34;outlets&#34; in the neighborhood), but I always found the best prices here. After taking a few trips, I ended up buying frames, a hanging mirror, and a dresser. When I asked about their delivery policy for the dresser, the guys at the store offered to build and deliver it - same day and FREE OF CHARGE! I got it a few hours after I&#39;d paid for it. Hard to beat that!<br><br>It&#39;s hard to know what they&#39;ll have at any one time, so it can be hit or miss.

"reviewcomment":"I usually HATE 99c-type stores because they tend to sell things that are manufactured specifically for those stores (e.g., no-name brands or brand-name items that simply contain less).  By contrast, Mr. Closeout carries &#34;legitimate,&#34; brand-name household and beauty items at a hugemendous discount. <br><br>You&#39;d pay double, triple of even quadruple for the exact same items at CVS or Duane Reade a block away--but WHY?  In fact, since the prices are so low here, it has become a habit of mine to first check Mr. Closeout before going anywhere else.<br><br>I&#39;ve visited similar stores in Brooklyn, Queens, etc. and none of those stores appear to have the balance among quality, price, and inventory Mr. Closeout offers. Highly recommended.",

"reviewcomment":"I love this store more than life itself.  <br><br>I&#39;ve been here a couple of times already and I can&#39;t even... there&#39;s just no way to describe it other than asking, &#39;What planet did this place drop down from?&#39;  I really think it&#39;s best experienced with a friend, though, for optimal hilarity.  I also think it&#39;s fine to wait a few months before going back because sometimes I&#39;ve gone weeks after a visit and there wasn&#39;t any new stock yet.  Some of the things I&#39;ve purchased:<br><br>- Fake plastic danishes [yes, the food - cheese filled and apricot filled]<br>- Happy Purim gift boxes<br>- Fancy Karen Millen shirts [by the way, you may not know this - because I didn&#39;t the first time I went - but there&#39;s a fitting room at the back of the store near the diapers/housewares - you have to ask an employee to let you in]<br>- A tiny box with a shoe polisher for $.10<br>- Itty bitty miniature bottles of Tabasco sauce and ketchup for $.25<br>- Compact mirror/comb with a smiling potato on the outside<br>- Miniature t-shirt shaped stickers - which, I swear to you, I was actually looking for something similar and couldn&#39;t believe out of all places I found them here<br>- Huge nice purse totes for $7; made good carry-on luggage because they zipped shut [though the strap eventually broke on one, aw]<br><br>Just a few of the many other things I&#39;ve seen but had to regrettably pass on:<br>- A basket of broken saxophones<br>- Throngs of Kira Plastina clothing<br>- Tiny hotel bottle toiletries<br>- Jesus tapestries<br>- Food items you probably never knew existed<br>- VHS tape sets of MTV Jams/Rock/Pop videos<br>- South Park talking plush dolls of the people with butts for faces<br>- Giant Microbes<br><br>Now do you see why this store is indescribable?  <br><br>Most items are very cheap or reasonably priced.  I had to exchange a shirt once for a smaller size [before I knew about the dressing room] and they gave me no problems with that.  Oh and they have plenty of useful home items too but I prefer the useless.",
