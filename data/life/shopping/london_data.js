"reviewcomment":"Eclectic, well curated, and utterly idiosyncratic, Liberty is the only department store I can stomach--on either side of the Atlantic.<br><br>The building is part of it. There&#39;s something about shuffling up those well-worn steps that lends an air of history to the whole enterprise. I love the nooks and crannies and the sense that interesting items might be lurking around every corner. More often than not, they are.<br><br>For me, the heart of the establishment is the scarf section, conveniently located on the ground floor. Yes, it&#39;s expensive and exclusive, blah-blah-blah. Go when there&#39;s a sale (the one after Christmas was 50% off) and head straight for the iconic Liberty prints in beautiful silks. Choose wisely, because you&#39;ll have these timeless items forever.<br><br>I always expect snobby service here, and I&#39;m always surprised. Most recently, my purchases were rung up by a lovely girl who graciously chatted about my hometown while she wrapped each item. She even made sure my mother&#39;s scarf got its own Liberty bag. If you&#39;re going to spend this kind of money, it&#39;s nice to feel like a lady while you do it.",

"reviewcomment":"I&#39;ll be honest. I only really came here to visit the Pet Kingdom, and also a little bit of the Toy Kingdom because I have vague recollections of squealing at a mountain of toys when I was little. <br><br>Imagine my disappointment and distress to find that the Pet Kingdom CLOSED on the 31st January and is being replaced with yet more clothes. You suck, Harrods.<br><br>Ah hem.<br><br>Anyway. Harrods itself is pretty special. Take my advice and pick up the guides they give you at the reception desk. Do NOT make the mistake of thinking &#34;It&#39;s just a shop&#34; because it&#39;s something else entirely.<br><br>It has a department for everything (except pets, grr). Technology, homeware, technology, women&#39;s fashion, food, perfumes, men&#39;s fashion, everything (except pets, grr).<br><br>It kind of works like a giant doughnut with a bit in the middle. You go up the escalators or lift and step on to the floor and walk left... if you keep going round, you&#39;ll end up back where you started. If you detour into the bit in the middle though, who knows where you&#39;ll end up. You&#39;ll be lost forever... or at least a good half an hour.<br><br>Everything is expensive of course. The cheapest cushion there was £59.95. You can get four at Next for the same price. I won&#39;t even go into how much the clothes are either. Just don&#39;t look unless you&#39;re on 100K a year. This is a hard and fast rude throughout Harrods except for two places: the Toy Kingdom and the Food Hall.<br><br>The Toy Kingdom is a place of wonder and magic. It has different sections within it to cater for every type of child or adult refusing to grow up, from reading rooms to lego play areas, to racks of princess dresses and even the sciencey power-a-light-with-a-potato kits. It&#39;s incredible. They even have a section for Harry Potter collectables! Not just the books and toy broomsticks, but actual wands and time turners etc, like the ones on sale at the experience in Watford. Amazing!<br><br>The Food Hall is chock-full of everything you could want. Chocolates, jams, cheese, cakes, fresh fruit and veg and the highest quality produce for only a little more expensive than Waitrose. The cheese is amazing, the jams are varied and delicious, you can get sushi chocolate if you&#39;re prepared to spend £32 for a box and we even saw apples with little hearts actually on the fruit as a special treat for valentine&#39;s day. SO cute. <br><br>To sum it up, if you&#39;ve never been, go. It&#39;s stunning. The architecture is beautiful, the store is shiny and so glossy and if you want to buy something, you&#39;ve got some reasonably priced toys, mementos and food that&#39;ll net you a coveted Harrods bag. But if you&#39;re going there to genuinely do some shopping, go to Selfridges. It&#39;s cheaper, probably a bit more impressive and the dress code is a lot more casual.",

"reviewcomment":"I could not find a location for the M&amp;S Simply Food at Marylebone Station, but this is what I am reviewing rather than the Oxford St Location.<br><br>We stayed across the street at the Landmark for a week and did lots of snack and small meal shopping at M&amp;S Simply Food. In addition to wine, beer and the not so healthy stuff, they also offer a fantastic array of healthier choices like vegetables and hummus, lovely salad with wheatberry or quinoa, nuts and other inspired toppings. Easily warmed entrees and tasty sandwiches and wraps.<br><br>Most of the food is very reasonably priced and of excellent quality. I was impressed.",

"reviewcomment":"Kingston can boast a really great shopping choice nowadays. The High Street stores upgraded themselves when the new Bentall centre opened several years ago .I believe that this is one of the biggest Marks and Spencer stores in the country.Now we don&#39;t live near Kingston I am really missing it. There are two sites ,meaning that Menswear and Home are separate from the fashion and kids, etc.Not too far away from each other though. My favourite department has to be the &#39;shoe&#39; dept and &#39;Per Una&#39;. A great selection in both and by far the largest range I have seen.<br>Kingston is a great place for shopping but don&#39;t take the car at Christmas time.Use the train.",

Ah well...maybe one day I&#39;ll have thousands of pounds to spare!?<br><br>I saw a gorgeous ceramic teapot for £20 and a fruit basket for £14 that were both affordable...but most things were at least 10x the price of similar items in habitat. I can understand this for most of their items, they look fantastic and are original or clever designs. I was just a little shocked a few examples (there was a paper lampshade IN THE SALE for £576...but it looks almost the same as the habitat version that only costs £3.)<br><br>We ended up buying a fruit basket (although as my kitten has fallen in love with it, it seems to be more of a kitten basket than a fruit basket so far...)

"reviewcomment":"This shop is the kind of place where it is fun to imagine all the amazing possibilities for your flat or future dream house...until you see the prices and remember that these beautiful things are not quite in your price range. Ah well...maybe one day I&#39;ll have thousands of pounds to spare!?<br><br>I saw a gorgeous ceramic teapot for £20 and a fruit basket for £14 that were both affordable...but most things were at least 10x the price of similar items in habitat. I can understand this for most of their items, they look fantastic and are original or clever designs. I was just a little shocked a few examples (there was a paper lampshade IN THE SALE for £576...but it looks almost the same as the habitat version that only costs £3.)<br><br>We ended up buying a fruit basket (although as my kitten has fallen in love with it, it seems to be more of a kitten basket than a fruit basket so far...) So...despite the lack of affordability, I can&#39;t remove a star, because the shop is just so stylish and pleasant to explore.",

"reviewcomment":"For the ultimate in masculine grooming (and a bit of Mayfair pampering), the Barber at Alfred Dunhill offers <br>an exquisite and relaxing wet shave and hot towel face massage.<br><br> For £60, Dunhill&#39;s Deluxe Shave is a sure thing for when you need to feel like a new man. Just settle back in the barber&#39;s chair and leave the rest to the professional (who at the time of writing this piece was an affable gentleman with more than 50 years experience as a barber). Booking is recommended but my experience has been that, unless you try to go at lunchtime, you should be able to slide right in without an appointment. However, I must confess that waiting a little while in this establishment committed to advancing the pursuit of male indulgence is pretty nice.<br><br> Ease into the plush leather sofas and crack open the day&#39;s paper. Enjoy your complimentary drink and admire the décor  particularly the shrines to man&#39;s men icons, featuring clean shaven photos of Steve McQueen, James Coburn and Oliver Reed. One of only three Dunhill homes (the other two are in Tokyo and Shanghai), the Davies Street Alfred Dunhill location in the heart of Mayfair (just a catty-corner skip from leafy Berkeley Square) is in Bourdon House, the former London residence of the Duke of Westminster.<br><br> Obviously, sixty quid ain&#39;t cheap, and equally evident is the fact that you&#39;re paying for the fancy and historic real estate. But, the Deluxe Shave is a worthy luxury if you can spare the cash (there is a £40 Classic wet shave option  sans the towels and massage). I mean, on my last visit, there was a moment when it felt as though I were melting into the chair. The hot towel face massage is wonderful  gradually going from tepid to super hot in a process of several towel changes with the last towel being icy cold. Aaahhh! Refreshing! And with results too! My cheeks were smoother than a baby&#39;s butt (the wifey certainly noticed). Nice.<br><br> Unfortunately, this isn&#39;t the sort of thing I can afford to treat myself to with any regularity. But I&#39;m definitely keeping it in mind for the future. Every single second of this luxury wet shave and hot towel face massage is a pleasure.",

"reviewcomment":"Zara, as a store, stocks a good range of work and casual basics. I&#39;m not a big fan of their shirts as they tend to be difficult to iron, but the blazers looks as if they&#39;d function well in a formal office setting, and their bags seem very much on-trend. The shoes have regularly popped up in style features, but, having tried one pair on, am baffled as to why anyone would think they&#39;re comfortable. Still, maybe that&#39;s just me.<br><br> In any case, rather than hunt through the various Zara shops (not that that&#39;s not fun in itself), I tend to shop online and have my orders delivered to this store for collection so as to save on delivery. Both times I&#39;ve done that, I&#39;ve received a text informing me when my order was ready for collection, giving me a five day window to collect it, and - this is a nice one - telling me that I can tell any member of staff, and not have to queue up at the counter to get it. I can confirm that this is indeed true. Great for the time-starved shopper!",

There are also a few beauty therapists on site offering eyebrow threading and shaping at a decent price.<br><br> As well as fashion, there&#39;s a really handy home section upstairs where you&#39;ll find everything you need to kit out a kitchen, plus a wide range of bedlinens including designer brands like Orla Kiely.

Expensive, but worth it cause they last 8 years. <br><br>Clothing is so-so, some years good, some bad. Depends on who they&#39;re having design that year. <br><br>Over all... I LOVE M&amp;S!",
