"reviewcomment":"Beautiful restaurant located in the historical district near Chinatown. We were visiting Singapore but had my uncle book a table for me in advance. The olive tree in front of the building reminded me of South of France, the restaurant was minimalist and tastefully designed more like what I expected of a restaurant this caliber versus Iggy&#39;s. <br><br>When we checked in we were sent upstairs, we were seated in this narrow hallway with a bunch of tables it was quite crowded considering the experience we hope to have. We were seated next to this couple the lady looked like she just woke up in shorts and Tshirt. The man armed with a giant camera clicking away at the dishes, and they kept asking for extra things. The server explained the concept quickly and they started bringing in dish upon dish. Our sommelier was very knowledgeable I narrowed a few choices and he provided more information each one. We opted for a cailbourdin pouilly-fume triptyque for the courses. <br><br>Each course was beautifully presented, designed and taste-wise most of the courses were light and subtle. The various elements and textures were very intriguing. There was a course of charcoal - a fried fritter that looked like one of the charcoal pieces in the dish it was very tasty. My favorite dish was Chef Andre&#39;s signature it was a foie gras &#34;chawanmushi&#34; and a black Perigord truffle coulis - absolutely amazing dish! <br><br>Overall I wish the service was a bit slower it felt rushed. Also the tables were too close to each other, I was distracted from my meal because people on the left and right of us talked loudly and frequently. <br><br>Our server he was very nice he took us on a tour per our request we saw the kitchen and we met with Chef Andre.",

Here at Tian Tian, the food is hawker-style - no fancy platings or decorations on the dishes. Just plain good chicken and rice. The rice was very flavorful - good enough to be eaten alone - and the chicken was very tender. I usually don&#39;t like to eat the skin but with Tian Tian&#39;s, it didn&#39;t even matter.

"reviewcomment":"On a recent trip to Singapore, did my pilgrimage to the local DTF. Partially, because you can never get enough of what may be the best Xiao Long Bao dumplings in the world -- but also as a fan I wanted to compare to the Taiwan and L.A. versions.<br><br>I will say that they aren&#39;t QUITE as good as those two. Mainly because, I understand, these are franchises rather than direct original family owned like in Taiwan and L.A. Also, they&#39;ve opened a mind-boggling number of them in Singapore. We were eating in a DTF that was mere blocks from another branch in an adjacent mall.<br><br>Even considering that, it is still 5-stars, because even a lesser XLB dumpling from Din Tai Fung by far trumps the best from anywhere else I&#39;ve ever had. There is no comparison. I also am an advocate for the thinner, lighter skins they use versus the more traditional thicker wrapping. It highlights the filling.<br><br>I will say the Singapore restaurants (and Taiwan) have somewhat larger variety than the L.A. branch. However, the juicy pork and juicy pork and crab are unbeatable so it&#39;s &#34;gilding the lily&#34;. Actually, I personally didn&#39;t like the truffle dumpling -- which seems to be only available in Asian branches -- very much. I also had the opportunity to eat some other, non-dumpling dishes since my in-laws like the variety and I have to say that DTF also excelled in those as well. Of course, while well executed, these dishes aren&#39;t the revelation that their XLB are. <br><br>I will shamelessly quote another reviewer, Mel P., because they said it perfectly: &#34;Din Tai Fung should be some kind of universal translations for &#39;best dumpling ever&#39;&#34;.",

"reviewcomment":"Looking for fresh seafood and fine Japanese dining? Look no further! <br><br>Aoki is located on the side of shaw center. Walk further up from the taxi stand and it is next to the French dining. <br><br>Came here with a friend at around 2 pm. First of all, I did not know it was fine fining area and I did not notice the two timings for lunch.. And we are supposed to reserve cause the place is pretty condensed. (3 small rooms 2-4 people, 1 large room and sushi bar 10 people).<br><br>When we were seated, a tray with an appetizer was placed together with the soya sauce. The cutleries were placed in the same manner and in a perfectly neat arrangement. If you are a perfectionist, you will notice the soya sauce container is different from tray to tray. And chopsticks have two ends too.<br><br>Called bara chirashi and the lunch special 7 piece nigiri set. <br><br>After the appetizer we were given salad. Then the main dish arrived.<br><br>Bara chirashi contains a mix of sashimi, tamago (egg), Ikura (salmon roe), uni (sea urchin), and a small teaspoon of homemade wasabi. The sashimi are fresh and tasty. I&#39;ve been looking high and low for this kinds of sashimi restaurants in Singapore. The rice was soft and they mixed a vinegar like sauce so it made it to be tangy.<br><br>The sushi set came in smaller portions. It is bigger slice of sashimi than the bara chirashi. They also placed the homemade wasabi inside.<br><br>Next the waitress served us miso soup (one by one in an orderly manner). <br><br>As it was almost closing at around 2.30, the waitress reminded us of the last order. My friend and I still had 1/2 of each dish we called but we were extremely full. Consumed too much rice. <br><br>At the end, they gave us a cup of dark roasted green tea with three small cups of desserts consisting (caramel pudding, mango ice cream and aiyu jelly). Like I mentioned earlier, they are detailed in terms of arrangement. <br><br>Overall, coming here for lunch is a wise choice but next time I will know the timing for the lunch. Reserve it if possible :)",

I dont need to buy a plane ticket to Athens anymore! i can just take a bus or cab if i am feeling rich to reminisce my love of all things Greek.<br><br>And the dessert course - i have to admit greek desserts are VERY VERY sweet but it is memorable with the way they are served. loved the touch that they do special dessert for special days like valentines.<br><br>Service - impeccable.  server&#39;s attention to detail and attentiveness to all the queries is impressive. patience is also top notch. i was probably asking the dumbest questions but he never once got mad. he even brought me a rose cos its valentines! #aww! he even gave recommendations and advised us from over ordering and he was right! also told us about the special dessert for the night. the owners also came by to check on us and asked for our opinions.<br><br>truly an experience worthy of michelin stars right here in the heart of Singapore.",

"reviewcomment":"this is my favorite japanese restaurant in singapore. <br><br>for the price and quality, you would be hard-pressed to find another place that can offer you both... or either, at times. the downside is that dinner is strictly omakase (though it doesn&#39;t break bank, waiting time hits an upwards of 5 months?) and they don&#39;t take reservations for lunch. it&#39;s also tiny (less that 20 seats, all by the counter) so the lines can be very long. however, if you do get a slot for either, go for it! <br><br>went there for lunch on on a saturday. since the line starts at around 11.30 and stays pretty lengthy till 1+, the 2 of us got there around 1.45pm and only had 2 other people in front. score! we ended up going with the barachirashi ($16, the most popular dish), which was a HUGE portion of sashimi marinated in sauce on top of japanese rice (specially flown from japan). it also comes with japanese tea and miso soup. was fun to watch the chefs preparing the meal and their overall camaraderie. always nice to see folks who care about their craft and making a good meal. <br><br>the sashimi was incredible and paired very nicely with the delicious rice. i believe if you pay $5 more, you can add on toro and tempura flakes, something we only discovered by enviously staring at our neighbor&#39;s bowl. it also came with complimentary sides (veggies, salmon broth, pickles, which change daily) that were in communal bowls shared with the other customers. overall, it was a complete steal for the quality of fish and definitely sets the bar high for a good japanese meal. also the staff is super friendly, total plus.<br><br>can&#39;t wait to try the omakase next!",

"reviewcomment":"It&#39;s been awhile since my last visit to Flor Patisserie but that doesn&#39;t mean I can&#39;t write a review about it based on my previous few trips and unique experiences. <br><br>Let&#39;s start with the food, or in this case, pastries. <br><br>Cakes! Tarts! Cookies! This place is a haven for all with a sweet tooth. Not only will you be able to satisfy your dessert craving here (minus ice-cream though, you&#39;ll have to go to a Cold Stone or a 7-11 for that), you&#39;ll be getting your money&#39;s worth for the quality of each heavenly delight you put into your mouth. Why? Simple, if you&#39;ve been to Japan, you&#39;ll know that their pastries are to die for and lo and behold! Flor Patisserie is a Japanese-styled patisserie serving authentic Japanese inspired French pastry and that&#39;s a mathematical combination that every living, breathing person would know the answer to. <br><br>Personal favourites for me would be the Earl Grey Choco ($6.95), Marron Pie ($4.50), Madeleine ($2.15/pc, any flavour) &amp; of course, Flor&#39;s signature Ice Cheese Tarts ($3.40/pc, 9 flavours to choose from -  for all cheese lovers, its frozen cheese on a tart, heaven! )<br><br>According to the description on the website, the Earl Grey Choco is a &#34;Delicate earl grey cream piped onto swiss roll of dark chocolate meringue and sweet banana&#34; - it&#39;s pretty much that except this written description doesn&#39;t exactly give you the idea of how soft and airy the texture is, despite having a meringue casing around it. The Earl Grey cream is not too rich which makes it easier to go with the candied bananas. I actually raved about this one slice so much that my friends got me a whole roll for my birthday one of the years, much to my delight - we should all embrace getting a year older with some good cake! <br><br>The Marron Pie (it&#39;s muffin sized)  was an interesting surprise for me personally. I&#39;m not much of a chestnut fan so when I first discovered that there was a chestnut in the heart of this, I pretty much passed on the idea. But my friend, who introduced the place to me, kept raving about it and described how she would savour this (nibbling on it for hours apparently), I thought I&#39;d give it a go and if i didn&#39;t like it, my late-mother was a fan of chestnuts so she could have it. Unfortunately for her, it never made it home. <br>&#34;&#34;Description: Buttery fragrant almond cream baked in crunchy puff pastry cup with sweetened japanese chestnut center.&#34; Damn right, it&#39;s as tasty as that! But don&#39;t let the word &#39;buttery&#39; fool ya, it&#39;s not overwhelming, unlike some other baked goods I&#39;ve tried. Instead, the butter is more like a coat over the crunchiness of the puff pastry and the almond cream which combined together, does a good number on your taste buds, that just leaves you yearning for more. Not fantastic for the waistline because this thing is HUGE but if you have a little fat girl inside you somewhere, you should be nice and treat her to a something every now and then &amp; I highly recommend this to be it. <br><br>Madeleine. This brings me to my unique experience as well but first,  these are not at all dry and the chocolate ones are moist, almost similar to a brownie or a chocolate lava cake minus the lava. Back to the story, at one point,  they were selling the Madeleines in the shape of bears, individually wrapped which was adorable and so, I decided to buy some back. That same evening, I discovered mold on one of the bear&#39;s ear and decided to let them know about it. I wasn&#39;t expecting anything but I just thought I&#39;d let them know of my find. I called the very next day and to my surprise, I got a tonne of sincerely apologetic replies back, it almost made me feel bad for making the call. They offered to give me something for free on my next visit but I wasn&#39;t gonna be going back anytime within that week so I just left it. On my next visit however, the Madeleines were back to being the shell shaped ones and so I briefly mentioned the bears and that I found mold on one of them once. THAT immediately sparked an wave of acknowledgment around the room and after discussing amongst themselves, the lady serving me apologized and gave me another Madeleine free to make up for it, shortly after, the chef himself came out from the kitchen to apologize and explained that it was an error on their part for not sealing the packaging properly, resulting in the air to enter the pack and thus, mold. I thought that that was VERY professional of them to acknowledge this and to even have the chef himself come out personally. Needless to say, as with all Japanese service staff, everyone (including the chef), saw me out of the cafe before resuming their respective duties. <br><br>Like I said, it has been awhile since I&#39;ve been back there &amp; i do believe the prices have increased a little. However, after writing about it and reliving all these amazing  memories about the pastries and the place, I&#39;m pretty sure i&#39;ll be back there soon, this time with a good book, to chill, enjoy some cake, have a good cuppa tea......and then hit the gym after.",

They mainly serve eggs; but offer a various range of dishes. They all look good. Sit on the counter and you will have the opportunity to chitchat with the owner.

But if you&#39;re taking it away, then head straight to the main counter, and tackle that massive menu sitting before you. I got a little lost today - I&#39;ve been fortunate to have people buy this to parties so I&#39;ve never had to buy this myself before this experience, but I knew what my end goal was, so I did not allow myself to be fazed. After all, I had this chicken in my sights.<br><br>First-timers? You&#39;ll want a two-piece meal. Hungry? Try the half-spring meal. Me? I&#39;ll have both please.

"reviewcomment":"After my previous visit to Ramen Keisuke Tonkotsu King Four Seasons , I found myself craving for their ramen again. This time round I went to the one situated at 100AM, which specialised in their chicken broth ramen. <br><br>The Green Tea Cola tasted a bit like Sprite. It&#39;s refreshing to drink this especially after finishing the ramen.<br><br>The Tori King Ramen with All Toppings is their signature ramen that comes with a chicken thigh, 2 half-boiled egg, a big piece of chashu and a big piece of seaweed. The chicken is tender, the egg tasted invigorating and the chashu was chewy. The greatest credit goes to the soup. It is flavourful, not too salty and accompanies well with the nice-cooked ramen (I didn&#39;t finish the soup as per what I did at Ramen Keisuke Tonkotsu King Four Seasons though).<br><br>The Black Spicy Tori King Ramen with All Toppings is the black pepper variant of the original ramen. It is nearly the same as the Tori King Ramen except with a little spice. If you do want your ramen to be slightly spicy, this should definitely be ordered.<br><br>Don&#39;t forget to have your ramen with the marinated beansprouts!<br><br>Definitely will come back here again if I&#39;m craving for ramen. If you are around the Tanjong Pagar area, this is one place to visit (the other being Ramen Keisuke Tonkotsu King, under the same company)",

I had been wanting to come here after having it recommended to me so many times... and I finally did! :D so without further ado, here&#39;s what we had:<br><br>Smoked quail eggs white truffle - it&#39;s good, but for the price of $12 PER EGGS i wouldn&#39;t get it again. i thought they&#39;d at least give 2-3 eggs for that price, but no. it was really $12 for a spoonful of quail eggs and truffle - yummy, but not worth the price tag!<br><br>Squid, sweet corn and paprika sauce - this is an excellent dish. i was pleasantly surprised by how juicy and soft the squid was, and the spicy yet sweet creamy paprika sauce. even the slightly charred green onions that was probably just a garnish (but I ate anyway) was tasty as hell.<br><br>Onglet, onion and bone marrow - soOooO sooooo good. the chef came out and showed us the meat before it gets cooked, but i was too busy eyeing the wine list so i didn&#39;t pay too much attention. they didn&#39;t bother asking us how we&#39;d like it done, but it came out just perfect. the meat was perfectly seared on the outside, and so juicy and so pink-tender on the inside.<br><br>Burnt End&#39;s Sanger (pulled pork burger) - ok, could you tell I saved the best for last? cause I totally did. this was so good that when I first bit into it, I practically trailed off whatever conversation I was having, and all the excellent dishes we had before hand just seemed to pale in comparison. and then we got seconds - it was THAT GOOD.<br><br>Banana with Caramel - this was a lovely dessert, though not much could be said about it because i was still in shock after the sanger - i felt like it really stole the show for me....<br>anyway, i digress. the banana was nicely done and flavorful, though i feel like at that point i could have gone without dessert. thankfully it wasn&#39;t massive or anything, so we didn&#39;t struggle with it.<br><br>Totally would come back here again - there were many dishes that caught my eye that I just didn&#39;t have the stomach space to try.<br><br>Update (Feb 5): went back and had the following dishes:<br>- uni with cauliflower sauce<br>- leeks, hazelnut<br>- corgette<br>- toast and tomato with pancetta<br>- sanger<br>- flank, onion and marrow<br>- banana caramel<br>Will update properly when i have the chance.",

Delicious xiaolongbao, with different kinds if you&#39;re looking for some variety. It&#39;s not exactly cheap, but the quality&#39;s pretty good. I personally think it&#39;s worth it. There are also a few other dishes, but I didn&#39;t get to order them this time around. We just ordered a lot of different kinds of XLB hahaha.",

If the heat outside is too much to bare, than the upstairs is where its at. take your shoes off and smoke some hookah inside. The drinks are nice and it&#39;s the only hookah joint I know that has Sam Adams lager beer. <br><br>Another good thing about this place seems to be the location. It&#39;s close enough from the main area with all the hookah bars and restaurants, but because it&#39;s surrounded by shops that close early, people think that part of Haji Lane is dead.

"reviewcomment":"We all have our favorite restaurants that we *almost* don&#39;t want to tell other people about - Buko Nero is one of those places.<br><br>This tiny, family run restaurant seats at most about 23 and the intimate space and small staff (only the chef, wife as hostess, mother in law as hostess) add to the cozy ambiance.  The hostesses may not crack a smile, but they are informative and quick. The food is modern Italian and is worth the wait (you can only get a table with luck or by planning a few weeks in advance!)<br><br>The food:<br>The small, but tasty menu has a few regular items encompassing cod, a few meat dishes, mushroom soup with truffle oil, pastas, and starters (the prosciutto and mozzarella is a refined ham and cheese!)  But keep your ears open for the specials which may include anything from a charcoal crusted cod (no it doesn&#39;t taste like dust!) to a seafood ragu.  I&#39;m simply amazed that the chef is able to create so many dishes by himself!<br><br>We&#39;ve had everything from the set menu (which isn&#39;t priced above S$55) to fish and pastas. The fish always has a crispy skin while the meat remains tender (I love the crispy cod with SE seasonings!) and the pasta is cooked al dente with a variety of tomato based sauced.  The food is comforting and well executed.  The sticky date pudding is reliably gooey and delicious as well.<br><br>I&#39;ll keep coming back to this restaurant for its great food and hope not too many more people find out about my secret place!",

We found this place from food blogs and Yelp so we decided to take the bus to this food court and check it out. The food court is not as big and crowded as the other ones we&#39;ve been too. This place must be good if they specialize in one thing. I didn&#39;t get to see how the chef prepared it because I was getting us something to drink. OMG when the noodles arrived I dugged right in. The flavor of all the ingredients were sooooooooooo good. My husband enjoyed the little pieces of crispy pork in the noodles. The cockles were super fresh. We ordered the medium size plate and it was plenty for us since we just ate an hour ago. I would definitely come back here the next time I&#39;m in town.",

It&#39;s the best fine dining in Singapore and the food was up to par compared with all the top restaurants&#39; in New York.  The restaurant is very private, with only up to six tables in the whole restaurant. it overlooks an amazing view facing the Suntec building and you&#39;d be at awe being on the 70th floor of the Swisshotel. It was a perfect birthday dinner surprise dinner by my hubby.<br><br>They&#39;re known for their pigeon meat- I tried for the first time and I&#39;m not sure what to think of it. It&#39;s tender and really tastes like chicken, but it&#39;s pigeon. My mind and palette were going at each other and my conclusion is that it was delish and at least i&#39;ve tried it once in my life and not sure if I&#39;d try again. I&#39;m an adventurous eater but eating a pigeon was a bit too much. All other dishes were made to perfection and I loved each and every one of their 14 course meals. Hopefully I&#39;ll return again soon!",

"reviewcomment":"I love Tim Ho Wan. Great tim sum at affordable prices! Like everything in life that is awesome, there&#39;s gotta be a catch and at Tim Ho Wan it&#39;s the queue. Sadly, one of the things I hate most in life is waiting. Such a waste of time when we have such fleeting lives! I think of all the unproductive hours people waste in queues and it makes me want to cry!!! I do my best to avoid them... But I really do want those Baked Bun with BBQ Pork!!! They taste like perfect little bo lo baos - a pillowy soft bread with a crunchy and sugary top crust which looks like a biscuit. So I go either super early (before they open) or super late (just before they close). This means having an early lunch or late dinner (9pm) but that&#39;s a sacrifice I am willing to make. <br><br>You know it&#39;s not dim sum until there&#39;s Har Gao, Siew Mai and Chee Cheong Fun (Prawn) on the table! These are a few of my favorite items for dim sum. They do it well but I wouldn&#39;t say they are lightyears ahead of their competitors here. These are pretty standard simple dishes to make and most decent dim sum places make these well too! <br><br>Service-wise, I am thoroughly impressed with the lighting speed of their servers and chefs. It&#39;s scary how efficient Chinese people are (especially those working in Chinese restaurants). The only other place I&#39;ve witness such efficiency is at Ding Tai Fung. I am convinced the bottleneck is not in the kitchen or with the service... it&#39;s simply that customers cannot chew and swallow their food fast enough! Hence, the lines. Sadly, if only humans had wider esophagus and didn&#39;t feel the need to make small talk over meals. Just kidding!",

"reviewcomment":"It must have been years since I last visited Katong Shopping Centre, and when I did I had to try what is arguably one of the top few chicken rice stalls in Singapore.<br>The price of the chicken rice here is slightly above average but the queue is still very long, so there must be something that they&#39;re doing right.<br>Anyway, I managed to get my chicken rice after a bit of queuing, and suffice to say that I was indeed blown away by the chicken rice here. The rice here is really smooth and fragrant, and the chicken is oh so tender. I ordered the roast chicken and the skin was very flavorful. Another thing was that the serving size here also seemed to be larger than at other places (in terms of the quantity of meat and the rice), so perhaps this is to compensate for their slightly higher prices. The chili complemented the chicken perfectly as well.<br>Overall, I would definitely rate the chicken rice here among the top 5 in Singapore.",

"reviewcomment":"Let&#39;s see... how do we summarize our dinner at Melben? <br>Yum. Yum. Yum. <br><br>Let&#39;s just jump straight to the crabs. First time having salted egg yolk crab for me and I think I just found a new favorite preparation for crab. The savory salted egg yolk elevates this fried crab dish and brings out the sweetness of the crab. I just wanted to gather the crab roe and salted egg yolk to make a &#34;crabonara&#34; sauce to throw with some pasta. The crab with tung hoon dish had a nice fragrance and this peppery preparation of crab was truly delicious too. As before the crab is incredibly sweet and nicely counterpointed by the black pepper. Lastly, the crab bee hoon soup was just sublime. I could drink that sweet and savory broth for days on end. Honestly can&#39;t remember too much about this crab because the broth was just that good. All in all, we had a nice variety of crab preparations and they were all yummy in their own unique ways. <br><br>You would think other dishes would suffer when you are known for one thing, which in Melben&#39;s case is crab, but their other dishes are pretty decent too. From the garlic veggies to salt and pepper pork chops to the cuttlefish youtiao, the dishes were pretty pretty tasty although relegated to playing back up to the crabs. <br><br>My aunt called ahead to reserve a table and our crabs and I think y&#39;all should too. As everyone has mentioned, you need to come early otherwise you&#39;re out of luck. Or as I would like to think, feeling really crabby for the rest of the night.",

"reviewcomment":"I&#39;ve heard so much about Hai Di Lao so I definitely had to give this a try.<br><br>I tried making a reservation for dinner but it was fully booked. Thankfully, I happen to be part of the vacation-ing class of Singaporeans who have nothing better to do on a Monday at lunchtime than to indulge in some authentic ma la hot pot. There was barely any crowd at lunch and we managed to get a table without any wait. <br><br>The pork belly slices were very good. They were so good that they managed to con us to order a second serving, in which the quality of the meat noticeably dropped :(<br><br>The sliced pork was ok, but I&#39;d recommend going for the pork belly instead.<br><br>The US beef slices were yummy too. My only qualm with the meat slices were that they were cut slightly too thick. I&#39;d have preferred it better if they were just a tad thinner.<br><br>The $4/ pax cost for sauces seemed a little overpriced at first, but we soon realised that it included the appetizer peanuts and post meal fruits/ desserts, making the price seem justifiable. We didnt know that the drinks were free flow at $3/pax. We stuck to ordering water/ tea, but being kiasu Singaporeans, would probably have expanded our selection if we knew it wasnt going to cost more.<br><br>The handmade prawn paste was interesting, as the paste curled up to look like shrimps after they were cooked. For $3 per serving, you can watch a live demonstration of the chef pulling the la mian noodle. And here I say that you&#39;re paying $3 to watch a show, since I definitely wouldnt pay that money for the very average noodles.<br><br>The Mushroom medley was delightful for mushroom lovers. <br><br>The ma la pot is pretty thumb numbing-ly spicy. You&#39;ve been warned!<br><br>The bill came up to be about $50/pax which was kinda expected (given all the $$$ ratings), but still a tad pricey considering that we didnt order much food.<br><br>Still, I&#39;d say that it is one of the better hot pot joints around!<br><br>PS. Sharing a friend&#39;s recipe for the sauce station: Hoisin sauce, korean chilli, garlic, dash of sesame oil. Pretty good combination I must say!",

"reviewcomment":"I love Tim Ho Wan. Great tim sum at affordable prices! Like everything in life that is awesome, there&#39;s gotta be a catch and at Tim Ho Wan it&#39;s the queue. Sadly, one of the things I hate most in life is waiting. Such a waste of time when we have such fleeting lives! I think of all the unproductive hours people waste in queues and it makes me want to cry!!! I do my best to avoid them... But I really do want those Baked Bun with BBQ Pork!!! They taste like perfect little bo lo baos - a pillowy soft bread with a crunchy and sugary top crust which looks like a biscuit. So I go either super early (before they open) or super late (just before they close). This means having an early lunch or late dinner (9pm) but that&#39;s a sacrifice I am willing to make. <br><br>You know it&#39;s not dim sum until there&#39;s Har Gao, Siew Mai and Chee Cheong Fun (Prawn) on the table! These are a few of my favorite items for dim sum. They do it well but I wouldn&#39;t say they are lightyears ahead of their competitors here. These are pretty standard simple dishes to make and most decent dim sum places make these well too! <br><br>Service-wise, I am thoroughly impressed with the lighting speed of their servers and chefs. It&#39;s scary how efficient Chinese people are (especially those working in Chinese restaurants). The only other place I&#39;ve witness such efficiency is at Ding Tai Fung. I am convinced the bottleneck is not in the kitchen or with the service... it&#39;s simply that customers cannot chew and swallow their food fast enough! Hence, the lines. Sadly, if only humans had wider esophagus and didn&#39;t feel the need to make small talk over meals. Just kidding!",

"reviewcomment":"It must have been years since I last visited Katong Shopping Centre, and when I did I had to try what is arguably one of the top few chicken rice stalls in Singapore.<br>The price of the chicken rice here is slightly above average but the queue is still very long, so there must be something that they&#39;re doing right.<br>Anyway, I managed to get my chicken rice after a bit of queuing, and suffice to say that I was indeed blown away by the chicken rice here. The rice here is really smooth and fragrant, and the chicken is oh so tender. I ordered the roast chicken and the skin was very flavorful. Another thing was that the serving size here also seemed to be larger than at other places (in terms of the quantity of meat and the rice), so perhaps this is to compensate for their slightly higher prices. The chili complemented the chicken perfectly as well.<br>Overall, I would definitely rate the chicken rice here among the top 5 in Singapore.",

"reviewcomment":"The Riders Cafe is decidedly one of my favourite brunch places in Singapore. You don&#39;t get too many awesome poached eggs around here (or maybe I just haven&#39;t tried enough), but they do it pretty good here. Coffee&#39;s also good, and being in the middle of nowhere is fantastic. It&#39;s a great way to get away from the skyscrapers and clogged roads that characterises much of Singapore these days. Smell a bit of green grass, smell a bit of horses.. it&#39;s very therapeutic. If you&#39;ve eaten too much of it&#39;s good food, you can always loiter around afterwards and explore a bit. A very nice way to spend a morning. <br><br>The only gripe I have is that it&#39;s extremely inaccessible. Even if you are up for a bit of a trek. It&#39;s quite impossible to walk in from Dunearn Road, or I haven&#39;t found a way yet! Then again, it&#39;s a small price to pay for the wholesome experience.<br><br>Oh and I never never manage to squeeze in a reservation for weekend brunch unless I call at least a week in advance.",

"reviewcomment":"Ippudo is its name; ramen is its game. <br><br>And ramen it does quite well indeed. We lucked out to get the last seats before the line was out the door. Was tempted to get the salmon ikura rice (because the picture looked good... rookie mistake I know) but was quickly corrected by my friend that I should get ramen so ramen I got. Ordering the Akamaru Shinaji, I enjoyed their take on &#34;modern ramen&#34; because it originates with the traditional tonkotsu broth but adds elements like garlic oil, black fungus, and a special miso paste. The broth is wonderfully rich and flavorful and the noodles had great spring-back texture too. Paired with a tall glass of beer, I was a happy camper. <br><br>Despite being a busy eatery, the staff are still really attentive as they churn out bowl after bowl of ramen to hungry patrons. Afore mentioned line did grow but the wait isn&#39;t that bad so don&#39;t let that stop you from trying Ippudo.",

"reviewcomment":"Let&#39;s see... how do we summarize our dinner at Melben? <br>Yum. Yum. Yum. <br><br>Let&#39;s just jump straight to the crabs. First time having salted egg yolk crab for me and I think I just found a new favorite preparation for crab. The savory salted egg yolk elevates this fried crab dish and brings out the sweetness of the crab. I just wanted to gather the crab roe and salted egg yolk to make a &#34;crabonara&#34; sauce to throw with some pasta. The crab with tung hoon dish had a nice fragrance and this peppery preparation of crab was truly delicious too. As before the crab is incredibly sweet and nicely counterpointed by the black pepper. Lastly, the crab bee hoon soup was just sublime. I could drink that sweet and savory broth for days on end. Honestly can&#39;t remember too much about this crab because the broth was just that good. All in all, we had a nice variety of crab preparations and they were all yummy in their own unique ways. <br><br>You would think other dishes would suffer when you are known for one thing, which in Melben&#39;s case is crab, but their other dishes are pretty decent too. From the garlic veggies to salt and pepper pork chops to the cuttlefish youtiao, the dishes were pretty pretty tasty although relegated to playing back up to the crabs. <br><br>My aunt called ahead to reserve a table and our crabs and I think y&#39;all should too. As everyone has mentioned, you need to come early otherwise you&#39;re out of luck. Or as I would like to think, feeling really crabby for the rest of the night.",

"reviewcomment":"OK, as far as the roast quality and barista-ship goes, I&#39;m a fan of Papa Palheta. I think the coffee here is probably the best in Singapore. That&#39;s where it ends for Chye Seng Huat however. I get that it&#39;s trendy &amp; cool, with the pseudo-industrial layout and the name that harks back to Singapore&#39;s roots. I&#39;m down with all that. But the place on weekends is a madhouse. <br><br>No table service means long queues to order coffee. I&#39;ve sometimes had to wait 15 minutes in queue just to get an order in. Hell if they were serving $1 kopitiam stuff I&#39;d probably be fine with that but considering the prices here, a bit of table service wouldn&#39;t be too much to ask. But if people are willing to queue then table service would probably be bad business.<br><br>Similarly, I assume, comfortable seating with ample space would be bad business. Why give people space &amp; comfort when you can pack them in &amp; contort them like sardines? Turn those covers! Good business, Papa. Good business.<br><br>Related side-note: I once saw two rather portly gentlemen and one very large lady try to squeeze themselves onto their bar-stools. It was... uncomfortable to watch. I actually had to look away.<br><br>I&#39;m also not a huge fan of the food, which is 90% misses with very few hits. I frequent this joint reasonably often as it&#39;s near where I live. On my last visit I ordered a benedict. The eggs were overcooked and the ham... my God the ham. It was that radioactive pink colour. I&#39;m not even sure that it was technically &#34;ham&#34;. Well maybe technically but it sure didn&#39;t taste like it.<br><br>So what&#39;s a four star rating doing accompanying a review that sounds this bad? The coffee is that good, guys.",

"reviewcomment":"I absolutely love Din Tai Fung! The food is excellent, and the service is great. I have been to a few of their locations, and I have never been disappointed.<br><br>If you&#39;re a meat eater, I highly recommend the crabmeat and pork dumplings. They are the juiciest dumplings you may ever eat! There&#39;s a very nice portion of meat in there too, which is nice. They&#39;re a little pricey, about $7 for 6 dumplings, but definitely worth it!<br><br>The buns are also delicious. My top choices are the steamed pork buns and the steamed vegetarian buns. Unlike most buns I find around here that have very little filling and very thick skin, the buns at Din Tai Fung are the perfect balance (apparently there is a very precise formula!). Not bad for $3.80!<br><br>The other menu items, are also good, depending on what you prefer. I&#39;ve gotten the wonton noodles a few times, and they are always good. Their rice dishes seem to be pretty popular, too. <br><br>To top it off, the staff is always very friendly and efficient. The cooks and servers all wear masks, and make sure that the food is steaming hot when it comes to you. The waiters never rush you or bother you during your meal. <br><br>All in all, you&#39;re pretty much guaranteed to leave happy.",

The smell of garlic has been tempting me to try this. I actually asked once, what is that garlic smell and they said that is the pasta. I keep coming in the morning and today I fly backs Australia so even though it was 11am I asked can I try the pasta. The staff were more than happy to make it .

"reviewcomment":"It&#39;s been three years since my wife and I officially moved to Singapore. This date only came to our attention while we already sitting in the DB Bistro Moderne. We could not have chosen a better place to celebrate. <br><br>After a long thirsty afternoon walking around the city, we ended up at MBS. It&#39;s hard to select a place to eat in this are due to all of the many and high end gourmet restaurants in The Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands, but we checked a couple of reviews on Yelp and decided that DB was the place of choice. <br><br>We got a table without a reservation without a problem, ordered two iceberg lettuce salads, a DB burger and some French Onion soup. Drinks were a Brewerkz Pale Ale and a mint, lime and ginger lemonade. <br><br>The service was very good, it was very friendly and a casual glance at our fellow diners indicated people were really enjoying themselves. <br><br>The bread they brought out before the salad, was great, but then the salads arrived. Wow. The lettuce was very fresh, crunchy and not too big (being a confirmed carnivore, I tolerate salads, just) the blue cheese dressing with bacon bits added had great flavors. , and before we knew it they were gone. <br>My wife was not as hungry as I was, so she ordered the French Onion soup. It arrived complete with the Gruyere cheese melted and floating on the top. Taste was wonderful. My DB burger was stuffed with short ribs and foie gras. I had never tasted foie gras before and despite some countries banning it, I decided to give it a try. The burger was cooked to perfection, medium, just like I had ordered. The short ribs and Foie Gras were spectacular. The French fries tasty, with a portion size that was the right side of &#34;not too big&#34;. <br><br>Washed down with the Pale ale from Brewerkz it really did hit the spot. Can you say that a $42 burger is good value? Maybe not but the taste was truly exceptional. <br><br>We let the food settle and followed it with some excellent coffee. <br><br>It was a great experience here.",

"reviewcomment":"I am not ashamed to say that this is my first time at Morton&#39;s Steakhouse, despite their legendary status among my beef-oholic friends. Their price tag is also equally legendary.<br><br>Excited yet apprehensive about the quality of the steak and the size of the hole it will burn in my pocket, I accepted my partner&#39;s invitation to have dinner with him at Morton&#39;s.<br><br>A few things sorely lacking in most F&amp;B establishments in Singapore is the quality of service provided. At Morton&#39;s, you can expect the best, personalised service ever (Well, comparable to Black Swan, I would say).<br><br>Stepping foot into Mandarin Oriental (Morton&#39;s is at Level 4), I gave 2 thumbs up to the antiquated-like settings with deep maroon and brass finishing. Somehow in my mind&#39;s eye, I always have this vision that good steakhouses will have these kind of furnishings. Anyway, I digress.<br><br>The two waitresses greeted me with a warm smile and without hesitation I mentioned that my friend is already inside. To which, they confirmed my friend&#39;s name and one of them walked me to my table. The self-independent woman in me wanted to decline for her to walk me to my table but she was walking too purposefully for me to stop her. I spotted my partner in one the booths and he gave me a mischievous smile. We reached the table and next thing I knew, the waitress pull out the table with effortless Herculean strength to let me in. Wow. I guess this is part of their service to diners who sit at the booths which I feel was adequate for one person to slide in, slowly.<br><br>Having checked out their menu online, I was still undecided on what to order so we decided to seek the recommendations of our waiter. He gamely and cheerfully recommended me a Center-Cut Fillet Mignon 8oz as he felt that the 12oz onwards would be too huge for me - if only he knew of my appetite for beef, having ate 2 Jack&#39;s Place steak in one sitting! For my partner, he recommended the Chilean Seabass Fillet a La Nage. We ordered the cream spinach after our waiter commented that the sauteed spinach and mushrooms are meh.<br><br>The crowd was picking up by that time and I was impressed when our food came in record time. <br><br>Verdict:<br><br>1. Center-Cut Fillet Mignon - I was singing praises with every gentle slice of beef that I savoured - &#34;Wow, very soft, melts in your mouth. This is good.&#34; - to the point my partner was highly amused. The 8oz would be more than sufficient to most ladies, but not to me. Almost to the point where I was tempted to order another one! Served simply on a white plate, the steak oozed flavourful spoonfuls of beef juice!<br><br>2. Creamed Spinach -  The dish looks overwhelming at first sight but it goes well with my steak as I had no sides on my plate. The delicious butter-filled aroma that it exudes is simply appetizing. Though it is &#39;creamed&#39;, it is light and easy on the palette.<br><br>3. Chilean Seabass Fillet a La Nage -  Fresh, that&#39;s one word to describe the fish. The portion is somewhat larger then what most steakhouses would serve but we are not complaining. The sauce may seem a bit too light for those who are used to creamy, buttery sauce but I feel that it acts as an excellent foil to bring out the freshness of the fish. <br><br>4. Key Lime Pie - This tops my list as the best ever, dethroning the Key Lime Pie at PS Cafe. Light and tangy with just the right amount of sweetness, this is a good choice for a desert. Best savoured with after-dinner tea (without milk).<br><br>The manager stopped by our table to chat and check on our satisfaction and though I usually dislike chatting with the staff during my meal, I was infected by his good sense of humor and charm.<br><br>Would I return again? Hell, yes! On special occasions though..<br><br>Service: 5/5<br>Humor of staff 6/5<br>Food: 5/5<br>Price: 3/5 (only because it would burn a huge hole in your pocket if you start craving for the Fillet Mignon 8oz every two weeks!)",

"reviewcomment":"My first intro to Peranakan cuisine was at Blue Ginger many moons ago.  And I always make a point to return to this place everytime I&#39;m in SG.  Peranakan food is a melange of Chinese and Malay food, derived from the Penang and Malacca region of Malaysia.  <br><br>On to the important stuff.  My favorite item from here is a chicken stew made with the Buah Keluak, which is a relative of the betel nut.  The nut is apparently poisonous but after  many hours of preparation and fermentation,  it yields a very smoky, bitter taste.  It&#39;s cooked with various spices like turmeric and galangal.  <br><br>I also love the beef rendang, a curry made with coconut milk, turmeric and lemongrass.   I&#39;ve had my share of beef rendang, far and wide, but I still prefer the rendang from Blue Ginger.  The meat is tender.    The spices are subtle but pungent at the same time.<br><br>For dessert, I can&#39;t say enough about the durian chendol.  It&#39;s a dessert made with crushed ice, pandan jelly noodles, coconut milk, durian puree.  Think distant relative of Filipino halo halo or Vietnamese che.  It&#39;s a lovely cool down from all the spices of the entrees.<br><br>Blue Ginger is gentrified, I must admit.  White table cloth.  Great service.   Cozy and intimate.  It&#39;s made for tourists like me.  And I love it, every time.<br><br>If you are curious about Peranakan cuisine:<br><br><a href='/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FPeranakan_cuisine&amp;s=843b6b0594aa947a70905dbfbfb18e6af3d14da0c980376d49427401f3b41610' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pe…</a>",

"reviewcomment":"Great new-comer to the restaurant scene. Picked this for a special date and couldn&#39;t be more satisfied with my choice. First things first, this restaurant is a little out of the way so be prepared to take a cab or have a ride. Located right at the heart of Labrador Park, it isn&#39;t anywhere near the main road. But that&#39;s exactly what I love about it. When the cab driver dropped us off, all we could see was a flickering trail of tea light candles marking the way.<br><br>The restaurant sits amidst lush greenery and gives you the wonderful feeling of escaping the humdrum of the city. The dining area is perched out into the trees and well-ventilated by ceiling fans. I seem to be rambling on just bout the decor but you have to see it to know why I am raving about it.<br><br>Food-wise, I am very finicky when it comes to fusion but Eco does it perfectly, marrying various flavours without a glitch. Had the Tuna Tataki for starters and the seared fish paired well with the hints of ginger and orange. This was followed by the sea bass and the freshness of the dish easily made it stand out. Partner had the squid risotto and couldn&#39;t stop raving about it, so that will be a good bet too.<br><br>Great place for a long dinner with someone you don&#39;t mind having a 3 hour conversation with.",

"reviewcomment":"Outram Park in Singapore has become a mini coffee hub recently, with at least 4 cafes (Nylon, Highlander, Oriole and Strangers Reunion) serving artisan coffee. Highlander was one of the first (if not the first) third wave cafes to open in Singapore, and is still roasting and serving interesting blends of coffee on Kampong Bahru road.<br><br>The espresso shot that I ordered came with a light brown crema, and the volume was spot on - a good single shot should not fill up an espresso mug. It had a interesting acidic taste - not tart, but the right amount of bitterness. The biscotti which come with all coffees in Highlander are sweet, and balance out the acidity.<br><br>The house blend in Highlander is a combination of beans from Brazil, Ethiopia and Sumatra, which is a good combination for lattes, cappuccinos etc. The stronger, lasting aftertaste ensures that there is still a definite taste of coffee, and that the steamed milk does not mask any flavour. Highlander house blend uses a specific ratio of beans from these different countries to ensure a very specific taste. <br><br>There is a retails space also, with coffee accessories available, such as grinders, filters, aeropresses and vacumn packs to store ground beans. Pricing is good - consistent with other cafes, beans are slightly cheaper. well worth visiting for well executed coffees and some very good shots.",

When I told them I would still like to order duck, they tried everything to convince me otherwise since the duck would be too much for one person to eat.

Is there anything better than perfectly roasted duck, carved table side, and served with all the right accompaniments? It was so scrumptious! I ate a little more than half (once carved, you actually don&#39;t get as much meat as you would think) but it was absolutely worth paying full price.<br><br>Other notes...

"reviewcomment":"My favorite Italian restaurant with a buffet spread. Tucked away from the bustle of Orchard Road, on the 2nd level of Regent Hotel, Basilico offers a warm, soothing respite from everyday life. The entrance of Basilico belies the fact that it is actually a pretty big place which can accommodate about 200 persons. It is also not very noisy as the tables are placed in different sections, affording some semblance of privacy and cutting down the noise. There is also a private room near the wine cellar if you have a big group. I have found the staff to be very accommodating, thoughtful and helpful. <br><br>We had the &#34;royal&#34; treatment on my first visit because of a friend&#39;s incident at the restaurant previously. The service recovery included the private room, glasses of limoncello for everyone, special food (e.g. grilled lamb chops, foie gras and a truffle bread thing) and a birthday cake as my friend decided to have her birthday celebration at Basilico despite the incident as she loved the food. <br><br>But subsequent visits on my own with other friends have found the service to be consistently good. So it is not a one-off thing. Likewise for the quality of the food. <br><br>Sunday buffet has a larger spread as it includes the foie gras, lamb chops and other stuff. <br><br>Saturday buffet spread is also good enough with grilled meat station, pasta station, pizza, the awesome antipasti bar, dessert spread and a smaller selection of Asian food for those who just need to have Asian cuisine. <br><br>What I like is the dinner where you get a choice of main to go with the antipasti bar and dessert buffet. The selection is not overwhelming but what they have is all of good quality. Quality over quantity. <br><br>I love the duck rilette, selection of cheeses, truffle honey, chili honey, balsamic honey, truffle cream, truffle salt to go with the cold meat and seafood. Seared tuna was very nicely done, the Angus semi-rare beef slice was fabulous with the truffle cream. Parma ham with melon slice, pimento, olive dip, grilled vegetables and different types of bread were just so good.<br><br>I could basically dine happily on just the antipasti and dessert. The panna cotta was creamy and excellent. Likewise for the bread and butter pudding. <br><br>So far I love everything I have tried at Basilico. The mains were equally good, not overcooked or dried out. <br><br>I will definitely be back when I am in the mood for good Italian food.",

"reviewcomment":"fantastic italian execution (not the head sort) at this packed restaurant in chinatown. reservations much required - tables run out quickly, and the place is well popular even on weekdays. it&#39;s been lauded as a great place to grab some italian and lives up to that reputation (living up to reputation seems to be a problem these days), with good service and reasonably prices.<br><br>it spans that rather comfortable spectrum of cosy enough for date night but bright enough for family night, and the good food helps conversations flow.<br><br>I&#39;m not a huge fan of the mostly carb-heavy cuisine, but this side of it is right up my alley. lots of fresh seafood and ingredients simply done up and plated without too much fuss, enough to show detail and attention, but not enough that my food gets cold.<br><br>it&#39;s also a fair portion size (barring the fish, which we&#39;ll talk about later), and I&#39;ve realised recently how important this is for me. I&#39;ve grown rather tired of poncy food in small dabs and dibs on a spartan place (unless it&#39;s truly meant to be that way - and what does that even mean?), and I want very much to feel satisfied and happy at the end of a meal.<br><br>it was a meal of three starters and one main - and for good reason. the starters sounded more interesting and more creative than the mains (which were mostly plates of some seared meat-or-other), and were also cheaper (perhaps two or three starters were equivalent to one entree) - and they turned out that way too.<br><br>we started with insalata mediterranea di verdure alla griglia, a warm salad of grilled grins topped with a light creamy cheese sauce and caramelized walnuts. I loved the sweet tender pumpkin with the crunchy nuts - and even though I usually eschew rich sauces, this was very tasty.<br><br>and then the rather transcendental calamari alla griglia, or grilled squid coils with a lovely chop of garlic and herbs. delicious, plain delicious. seafood sweet and tender, these were salted just right and utterly fantastic.<br><br>we had to round off the starters with some bruschette (it does, after all, take up a fair half page in the menu), and ended up with the etna, which had a slice each topped with chopped tomatoes, a grilled eggplant slice, parma ham and a slab of mozzarella. alright - but perhaps the most average dish we had. it was just a bit of toast with stuff, and not wholly inspiring (though the cheese was good).<br><br>our nominal main was the day&#39;s special of salt-roasted fish, a slim specimen of a white type simply roasted with large grains of salt and served alongside a small salad. it was well cooked (and I don&#39;t mean doneness), with the flesh flaking off with a slight push - but it was also the most expensive dish at more-than-sixty for a slip of a fish, and not quite worth it considering what we had got as starters.<br><br>it&#39;s definite that we had to finish with something sweet, and this time we had two. a tiramisu al pistacchio di bronte was a green layered rich concoction, with a very mild pistachio flavor - but at least it wasn&#39;t too sweet. a delizia al ciccolato was less interesting, and not flowy so much as moist - but it came with some delicious pistachio ice cream.<br><br>I haven&#39;t mentioned service, and it was pretty good: just friendly enough without being unobtrusive, and they knew how to handle the crowds and seat people efficiently. price are very reasonable for the quality of food, though that statement holds truer for everything but the mains - and I&#39;ll be back to give some of their lauded pizzas a go.",

Now I don&#39;t know my Peranakan food at all, so unfortunately I can&#39;t tell you what I ate (other than the ayam fish head and mince meatball soup which were divine), but what I can tell you is that every dish was awesome.

"reviewcomment":"If you fancy something different from the usual Chinese dishes you get at those Chinese restaurants, Bosses is the place you may want to give a try. The restaurant is furnished in black, and possibly had its name inspired by the mafia in Hong Kong, commonly known as Hak Se Wui (literally translates to Black Society). You will not only find Cantonese items on the menu, you will also find some Shanghainese food items. In particular, the dim sum items are hot favorites as what is served at Bosses is probably more exquisite than what you commonly get outside. I highly recommend you to try the signature flowy custard buns, as well as the seafood congee (forgot the exact name of the dish). The ingredients used are fresh, and definitely very very tasty!<br><br>What&#39;s more, it&#39;s got a pretty nice and relaxed atmosphere, contrary to its name. The staff are nice and attentive too, which gives the overall experience an A! The only downside is the cost. The things are slightly pricey, so be prepared to pay a little more.<br><br>Worth it or not? Well, you can be the boss.",

"reviewcomment":"If a shop calls itself authentic, then it must really have the good stuff to earn that name. And this Vietnamese hawker stall at Ghim Moh is a good example of cheap, delicious and authentic cuisine. <br><br>Honestly, I seldom try Vietnamnese cuisine (the last one being Madam Saigon from Millenia Walk). But after hearing a tip-off from fellow yelpers , there must be something worth checking out.  <br><br>A Must Try dish is Bun thit nuong ($4.50), a colorful medley of soft bee hoon crowned with grilled pork, fried spring rolls, cucumber and pickled carrots, chilli, mint leaf and toasted peanuts.  I thought it looked dry but it wasn&#39;t. <br><br>Once you tossed everything evenly, every bite is full of sweet and sour juices that is superbly appetizing and refreshing for a hot afternoon. The char siew pork could be more thinly sliced as it was slightly dry and not fully marinated. But that few pieces of pork would not refrain one from enjoying the bowl.  <br><br>For something hot, go for the Pho Bo- a slurpy piquant bowl of beef rice noodles ($4.50). This does not win points for complexity, but its simple ingredients--lean beef meat, mint leaf, corianders and a good beef stock bring out the flavours. Plus, it was not salty and so we emptied the bowl CLEAN. <br><br>Mango and Seafood Salad ($4.50) might sound and look a lot like the Thai Papaya salad. But no, this packs a much bigger punch and does not require a lot of teeth work to digest the dominantly raw greens as in Thai Salad. <br>Here, the mango are freshly grated into thin slices, then mixed with carrots and green papaya. The sweet-sour sauce tasted similar Bun thit nuong but this is so moreish that one goes for more helpings.<br><br>We were too full for the Spring Rolls ($2.50 for 2pcs), which is made of same components as Bun thit nuong. If you have limited stomach space, it is better to opt for the Bun thit nuong. All the food were prepared by the lady owner is a friendly Vietnamnese, who can speak in Chinese and English.<br><br>And every dish was excellent, from the noodles right down to the condiments. The light, non-greasy carbohydrates did not leave us feeling overstuff or thirsty.  With such delicious, authentic and cheap Vietnam cuisine, I hope this stall can stay after Ghim Moh closed for renovation next year.",

The cauliflower appetizer with purple mustard and a strip of bacon came together nicely and the flavors complimented each other well - the mild sweetness of the cauliflower with the smoky saltiness of the bacon and bitterness of the mustard. Chocolate ice cream came with creme anglaise and three segments of mandarin.

The parking was difficult as there are other restaurants and pubs nearby. Sitting outside while waiting for your table might make you sick of smelling the cigarette smells. The downside of waiting till you are seated is when most of your party have not arrive. They will only give you a table when most of the people in your party has arrived. The maximum amount for a party is 10.<br><br>This place served a lot of side dishes (kimchi, steamed egg, bean sprouts, anchovies, potato salad and sliced fish cakes). All of them are extremely delicious!! The taste, the texture are in perfect blend. You will at least ask for two rounds for the side dishes.<br><br>My party ordered pork belly, chicken and cubed beef. It was delicious!! The waitress will help you flip the meat and put on new batch of meat after you are done with it. The customer service was good here.<br><br>Overall, I like this restaurant and will be back for more with different batch of friends. It is highly encouraged if you use public transport instead of driving there yourselves. Like I mentioned earlier, parking was terrible. Enjoy your delicacy here :) Cheers!!",

"reviewcomment":"You know, I really want to like this place 100%, but with other vegetarian and even organic restaurants in Singapore that sell at a much cheaper price point, it&#39;s hard to go all the way and give it 5 stars. But with that, this place offers super tasty vegetarian meals, with faux meat dishes made of mushrooms. <br><br>I&#39;ve tried both their lemongrass tea and their floral tea. Both are wonderful and already sweetened, but not too sweet. I&#39;ve had their Tom yum soup, rand dang, olive rice and sweet &amp; sour chicken. All wonderful! The portions are also just right, for me at least. I wouldn&#39;t say great for sharing since it may or may not be enough, depending on how many people are with you or how big your bellies are. Considering I can eat quite large portions all to myself, I usually order 2 dishes and I still end up with take away. Take that as you will!<br><br>Expect to pay around $30 per person for 1 specialty drink, 1-2 main dishes and a rice dish. <br><br>Worth it? Yea, if you&#39;re willing to spend more for an occasional treat of vegetarian food.",

"reviewcomment":"I made dinner reservations for two while visiting Singapore. My friend couldn&#39;t make it anymore but I decided to go anyway because I was jonesing for Peking Duck. Because the restaurant prepares a limited number of Peking Ducks each day, you have to &#34;reserve&#34; your duck a day in advance. When I told them I would still like to order duck, they tried everything to convince me otherwise since the duck would be too much for one person to eat. I was so positive I wanted Peking Duck and there was no way I waited all day to not have Peking Duck (that I had to confirm the day before!).<br><br>What a heavenly Peking Duck it was! Is there anything better than perfectly roasted duck, carved table side, and served with all the right accompaniments? It was so scrumptious! I ate a little more than half (once carved, you actually don&#39;t get as much meat as you would think) but it was absolutely worth paying full price.<br><br>Other notes... Although the restaurant is inside a shopping center, it is actually pretty fancy so dress nicely. Also, reservations are a must.",

The downside is the price (well its in Orchard road, what do you expect), some dishes aren&#39;t too fantastic (e.g. Mexican), some of the portions are too small for my liking in relation to the price. Also you can&#39;t make a reservation for the mandarin gallery branch, although this is not a problem for the Scott&#39;s branch.<br><br>In conclusion: not perfect but always a reliable place to go for brunch.

"reviewcomment":"I only had scrambled eggs, smoked salmon, a cappuccino, a passion fruit tart, and an espresso. All were excellent and reasonably priced. The hours of this place are really weird, especially that most days they start serving breakfast at 11. It reminded me a lot of Jimmy Monkey, and the cappuccino in particular had almost identical flavor to theirs.<br><br>It&#39;s a little like they are trying too hard to be hipster, but I didn&#39;t really see anything to complain about, except the scrambled eggs were a little runnier than they are in America. I guess if you don&#39;t like your scrambled eggs runny, you should ask for them to be cooked more than usual. The food and coffee was great, especially the cappuccino and passion fruit tart.",

"reviewcomment":"People who know me would know that I don&#39;t give five stars very easily. I only ordered a few dishes but they were all very good. And I was blown away by the salmon belly sashimi. It is just so hard to find good salmon belly sashimi, and it is ironic that I find the best salmon belly sashimi not in california, not in japan (at least where I&#39;ve been) but here in Singapore. In general, my attitude towards japanese food in Singapore is &#34;jaded&#34;. I feel like in order to get decent sashimi, you usually have to pay an arm and a leg. And usually when I do, I am not impressed by the quality. This salmon belly is well marbled with fat, super fresh, and evey slightly sweet! Even at 6 bucks a slice, I am willing to pay it. The chef recommendation&#39;s seasonal dish, salmon roe with soy sauce and yuzu was another winner. The salmon roe was not at all salty (which means it&#39;s fresh) and lightly seasoned with soy sauce, and the yuzu just brings finesse to it. The grilled saba was decent, but not impressive. Will definitely come back for the omakase or chirashi or just a sushi meal. Thank you for making me believe in Singapore again!",

"reviewcomment":"(Let&#39;s put aside the fact that I&#39;m vegan. There are times I will socially eat meat. Don&#39;t hate.) <br><br>GETTING THERE: The restaurant is located in The Central Mall on the 2nd floor. Near the escalators. This mall is like a labyrinth so try not to get lost. <br><br>DEJA VU: When I saw &#34;8 Korean BBQ&#34; I immediately thought of Palsaik, a Korean bbq joint back in Ktown LA. The menu looked especially familiar. The flavors were the exact same as Palsaik&#39;s. Turns out the two restaurants are under the same owner. <br><br>TASTE: I used to be a hardcore carnivore. Meat and carbs all day. So I know a tasty piece of meat when I encounter one. 8 Korean BBQ is legit yo. I didn&#39;t expect much because if you&#39;ve dined at Koreatown LA many times before, you know what&#39;s hot and not. 8 Korean BBQ is hot. <br><br>Their pork belly is JUICY. Their kimchi is a bit salty though. At least the day I had it. So awesome they had brown rice instead of white rice. Puts a smile on a health nut&#39;s face. <br><br>INSTRUCTIONS: Take a piece of lettuce, place on a pink round radish, a slice of pork, then some kimchi. Wrap it up and into your mouth. Repeat. <br><br>PRICING: 8 Korean BBQ is pricier than Palsaik. The set of eight flavors at Palsaik costs $50. The similar set, if not exactly the same, is double in Singapore&#39;s sister location. But if love K-bbq, it&#39;s worth every penny. Their juicy pork belly will not fail to disappoint. <br><br>CONCLUSION: If you ever miss Koreatown LA, you know where to go... 8 Korean BBQ. Make sure you order a bottle of soju with your meal. Gunbae! Cheers! And if you get drunk, don&#39;t fall into the river. Those stairs are steep. Please have a designated walking buddy.",

If you are like me, just go there now now now!<br><br>Restaurant is not big so it does get booked up fast. I could be wrong, but I think if you are not a big group, you can do a walkin and sit at the bar.<br><br>Yes, they are famous for their oysters as the name indicate, but apart from that, they do have a good menu. Good quality food done properly, none of the fancy sauces and foams. <br><br>Between 4 of us, we shared:<br>- tuna tatare (love. One of the better ones I&#39;ve had in Sg. Perfectly seasoned with lots of flavors)<br>- crab cakes (so full of the sweetest chunky crab meat. None of those crap fake crab cakes)<br>- kurobuta pork chop (yummy and succulent)<br>- prime ribeye (my least favorite but still a good piece of meat and a very large slice!)<br><br>Special mention: OLD STYLE HASHBROWN. Whatever you do, order it. This is like nothing that you&#39;ve ever tried. A perfect side dish, more like a rosti than a hashbrown. Crispy on the outside, and they filled it with Boursin cheese and spring onion. Pure genius and perfectly done.<br><br>All the portions are really large. And when they heard that we are sharing, they actually served the dishes with 4 proper portions. No judgement for sharing dishes here. So we were all perfectly stuffed even though we did not order one main course each.<br><br>Service was also great by Singapore standard. Our server heard that we are celebrating a birthday and they served up an awesome dessert that is full of candied ginger flavor. So so good. <br><br>While it is not a cheap meal, we felt that it was well worth the money. Looking forward to returning for brunch as they serve up a brunch menu that has lobster roll....and yes, please also throw in the hashbrown.",

"reviewcomment":"Words like &#34;overrated&#34;, &#34;not worth a visit&#34; roll off the tongues of Tim Ho Wan&#39;s naysayers. Sure, you can cavil at its operations --long waiting time; service standards which at times can be sublime for a casual eatery-- but one thing you cannot deny: most of its dim sum dishes are laudable. Three other outlets have sprung up in just one year following the launch of the flagship at Plaza Singapura in April 2013. What was believed to be initial hype surrounding the then nascent outlet has yet to peter out. Snaking queues are still a common sight on a weekday morning and the establishment experiences an endless flurry of activity from day to night.<br><br>Surely the establishment is getting its dim sum right. The following dishes make me a willing repeat customer. <br><br>The Baked Bun with BBQ Pork ($4.50) is simply sui generis. The exterior is a sweet, crumbly dome. Pry into it and wisps of steam will billow --a positive sign. How hot a dim sum dish is when it is served is a litmus test: cold dim sum will never measure up.  What then ensues is the outflow of luxurious pork filling. Sweet but not cloying, the meat is diced into petite cubes.<br><br>I have been to Tim Ho Wan several times now and it is just so fun watching my friends take their first bites of the mother of all buns. A glint enters their eyes and excitement sweeps their faces... that is usually followed by coos and nods of approval. For all dim sum aficionados, this is the one dish you have to savour.  <br><br>One caveat: this bun has ruined all other char siew buns for me and it will do the same to you. Once, I feted it to my tutee; week after week he would not stop raving about it.

"reviewcomment":"My friend and I came here because we had heard that the crab here is pretty amazing.<br><br>We ordered the &#34;chicken with fruit sauce&#34; as an appetizer, and we also ordered chili crab and black pepper crab. The chili crab came with some fried buns, which complemented the chili crab nicely. They added some texture and also helped cool us down when the chili got too spicy for us (it rarely did, though; the chili in chili crab really hasn&#39;t seemed that spicy so far). I LOVED the chili because it was so rich and creamy, while my friend loved the taste of the black pepper. We ended up devouring the crabs quickly, thoroughly enjoying this meal.<br><br>We highly suggest this place if you&#39;re in town and looking for some chili or black pepper crab!",

"reviewcomment":"I had pulled an all nighter and went here for a set lunch to give myself an incentive to stay awake until an afternoon meeting. I had the tomato with lentils and duck pieces, the lamb with pureed potatoes, and the poached pear with chocolate ganache dessert.<br><br>The tomato filling was very carefullly seasoned and flavorful, and paired well with a fresh arugula salad. The lamb was a reasonably sized portion. I had asked for medium but the server said it was served medium rare, and, while not what I ordered, I think in retrospect that was probably a good thing because it was juicy and soft. It looked so good I forgot to take a picture before eating it. The dessert had slices of pear, little crispy piece of chocolate granola, a scoop of very good vanilla ice cream, a few berries, and three blocks of dark chocolate dusted with cocoa powder.<br><br>Overall, a great meal. Not cheap, but reasonable for the quality. The flavors all came together and they clearly paid attention to the details.",

"reviewcomment":"Tomo Izakaya at Esplanade Mall is a hidden gem. The location makes for quiet dining (sorta) with a slightly more sophisticated crowd and relaxing ambience. <br><br>Gyu Tataki ($13) is the beef version of sashimi. Lightly seared on the outside then marinated with lemon, vinegar and soy sauce after, it was served with pounded ginger and spring onions on top of the rare meat. Very big slices of beef which really worked our jaws. There is none of that bloodiness or heaviness of the red meat. Oishi.<br><br>Skewers were next. Who could say no to BBQ bacon wrapped anything? The smokiness of the fatty pork flavored the succulent and sweet hotate chunks ($10), giving each bite a burst of juices and flavors.<br><br>Shitake Mentai Cheese ($7) is a must order. The woody and juicy shitake goes perfectly with the crackling bacon and the mentaiko cream was simply the icing on the cake.<br><br>The Tonkujyou Chirashi ($36) is really the highlight of the meal. The special chirashi is worth every bit of that 36 bucks even though it&#39;s a small bowl. Tomo is very generous with the fresh sashimi. The fatty toro was creamy with fats and extremely well marbled. There was so much uni and salmon roe to go around that we had to finish all the vinegar rice (which was delicious on its own too). One of the best chirashi bowls in town and reasonably priced.<br><br>For reviews and more, visit my blog.",

Problem being, there are too many to choose from. Then I saw it, Tiramasu. Not with sponge, but with crepes. The waitress served me with a smile and then I queued to pay. Depending on the day, the queue can be big but it gave me a chance too look at their savoury items.<br><br>Once I sat down, the tiramasu was as good as I expected and a espresso coffee helped to wash it down. But how can I leave without trying something savoury.<br><br>Back to the cabinet, I picked up a croissant for breakfast the next morning.<br>Light and fluffy with a hint of sweetness.

"reviewcomment":"A short walk from Lavender MRT, this cafe has a real peaceful feel as it is set back some ways from the main road via a pathway along the Kallang River. You can catch a nice breeze in the outdoor courtyard and chill out with your coffee and food. Whoever chooses the tunes here has pretty decent taste, as I often find myself whipping open Shazam to see what they are playing.<br><br>In terms of hard product, the coffee is very good. The food is mediocre and could be improved, but the vibe of the place is pleasant enough to reach four stars. Dishes are generally bland and uninteresting, although the &#39;Big L&#39;s Breakfast&#39; is filling and does the trick if you&#39;re just looking for a straightforward big greasy plate of eggs, sausage and tomato. <br><br>Great spot for a lazy Sunday afternoon brunch. The real unique thing about Loysel&#39;s is the laid back atmosphere, which can be hard to find in Singapore at times.",

Feeling like Japanese BBQ, we decided to have dinner here. <br><br>It was an authentic Teppanyaki, albeit pricy, meal. The meats were juicy and so, so fresh. If you&#39;re here, try the aburi bacon. Don&#39;t leave the veggies sidelined; the assorted mushrooms with butter were my favourite accompaniment to the meaty selection. Not much of a chef? Don&#39;t worry, they recommend combinations of seasoning for your food. Everything I had went well with Asahi. <br><br>Service was great, as is usually expected from Japanese culture. The ambience was nice too. We ended up staying there for almost three hours, just the two of us. I&#39;m definitely coming back here, perhaps this time with my foodie family.",

Lesson learnt from the first time we tried to walk in.. <br><br>This gem is hidden in an obscure part of Far East Plaza - I can never remember how to get there and end up wandering around the 3rd floor. But just follow your nose :p Or else, come up the escalators which are nearer to Goodwood Park (as opposed to the escalators nearer to Grand Hyatt) and I think it should be on that side..<br><br>Aburi salmon roll ($14.50)!

Although thankfully there isn&#39;t an overabundance of it, I think Koh Grill and Sushi goes heavier on the mayo.<br><br>Chirashi ($24.90) is usually a gd deal too! Comes with a fair amount of fish and seafood. 3 Kind sashimi ($14.90) pretty gd deal too, fish slices are fairly large.<br><br>Oh, top up your own tea/water service.

"reviewcomment":"If you want vegetarian comfort food in Singapore, Raj is the place. From my 40+ family man perspective, the things that make it a winner are:<br>1) Clean and well maintained. No adverse post meal effects till date, and we have been there more than 50 times this past year<br>2) prompt and friendly service<br>3) child friendly- plenty of high chairs, and they provide plastic plates and spoons for kids<br>4) diverse menu covering North and South Indian cuisine<br>5) food is tasty and fresh, and does not use too much oil, thus obviating the need for mugs of hot tea after the meal. <br>6) Booze to dull the senses when the kids are acting up - this is a tad overpriced though<br><br>Our more commonly ordered items here include dosas, idlis, Chana bhatura, Rajma, and 2 dishes we have not seen elsewhere: palak kofta - which consists of kofta made with spinach in a tomato gravy<br>Phaldhari kofta - made from raw bananas, in the same(?) gravy - see below.<br>For weekday lunches their South Indian thaali is quite good, although a lot of food for a middle aged tummy.<br><br>The few minuses are:<br>1) No fresh juices or lemonade<br>2) many of their tomato based gravies taste suspiciously similar, making one wonder if they are just adding the potatoes/kofta/veggies to a ladle dished out from the same giant pot<br>3) No South Indian curries or veggies on their dinner menu, and thaali is only available for lunch on weekdays<br><br>Solid thumbs up from me.",

"reviewcomment":"Seriously the best wraps/salad I&#39;ve tasted in a long time. So glad I decided to pop by this humble joint. At first glance it looks rather ordinary (simple, no fuss, a healthy office worker take-out salad bar) ... but in reality MIND-BLOWING (&amp; healthy too). I think the secret is the a) sauce, b) meat. <br><br>1) Big Bird $10.80<br>- I had a wrap. Basically, turkey meat, some toppings (grape, celery, apples) mixed with roman lettuce and the secret sauce of course!The turkey meat was so soft!!! and succulent. I was hesitant to order turkey initially because its meat is usually dry but this was proved my stereotype wrong! <br><br>2) Hail Caesar $10<br>- My friend had this. Pretty good. Taste different from the former even though it&#39;s pretty much the same ingredients. Impressive a switch of 1) sauce and 2) toppings can have so much impact on the flavor. <br><br>Definitely looking forward to my next trip back!!! only sad thing is they are located near office areas, raffles place etc. Not typically places one would visit unless it&#39;s to go back to work on a weekend.",

Loved the high tea!! <br><br>My mom came to town from nyc and I took her to gardens by the bay so we stopped by here for champagne and high tea. Surprisingly reasonably priced for everything you get. I got 2 glasses of champagne, a flower tea, and the small bites from 1 order of the high tea menu, all of which was more than adequate for my mother and I. <br><br>I believe the bill came out to $80. Considering booze is expensive and Pollen is normally an expensive restaurant, I didn&#39;t think that was too pricey for 2 people with booze included. Definitely worth a try for the high tea menu!",

"reviewcomment":"This is one of my favourite brunch places for a few reasons: its accessible(for me) smack in town, the service and food quality is consistent, wide range of  menu, cosy ambience, delicious smoothies. The downside is the price (well its in Orchard road, what do you expect), some dishes aren&#39;t too fantastic (e.g. Mexican), some of the portions are too small for my liking in relation to the price. Also you can&#39;t make a reservation for the mandarin gallery branch, although this is not a problem for the Scott&#39;s branch.<br><br>In conclusion: not perfect but always a reliable place to go for brunch.

"reviewcomment":"If you want a burger, and I mean, a great burger, go to a place that serves nothing else. <br><br>My brother in law and I have been on the great beef hunt over the last year or so, this naturally includes great steaks and great burgers! In my opinion De Burg is way up there on the &#39;great burger&#39; chart.<br><br>The place is open air and self service. You grab a menu and order, come back to collect your burger when it is ready. I waited 10 minutes. The kitchen is also open and while ordering I watched as the cooks crafted each burger individually with TLC. <br><br>The menu is very extensive and with only burgers in mind. Beef, pork, seafood, lamb, chicken and vegan are all available. 50 to 200 grams and Wagyu on the 200g if you wanted premium. Price points were $5 to $30. Then they had signature burgers. The person next to me had a monster of a burger and I inquired which one it was. He said he ordered the &#39;Desiree&#39;  I looked at the menu and it was described as chips, bacon and cheese hidden between 200g Aussie strip loin and 200g Aussie Lamb!! I was amazed he finished it. Other burgers had portobello mushrooms, iberico chorizo, and even a deep fried Spam ring.<br><br>Lost with so much choice I meekly chose the bacon cheese burger with a side of fries and tatted tots. That first bite is heavenly. Crispy bacon. Lovely medium rare Australian strip loin patty, hint of BBQ sauce and greens. All stacked within 2 soft and fluffy buns. In my view this is near perfection. I will be back to try the other burgers but I can see this be a regular place to satisfy my burger cravings.",

The menu is mouth watering for anyone that loves Thai, Malay, Indonesia, etc. And, after a couple of Tiger beers I simultaneously wanted to not make a decision and order everything.

This time of year it gets a little cooler and the humidity drops slightly around sunset. So this evening was so pleasant.<br><br>Be warned, the prices are on par with Norway (rarely do I say that).

"reviewcomment":"Tsuru-Koshi, I will admit, was one of those secret places I try not to tell people about because the food is really good and seats are always in short supply when I&#39;m hungry. Selfish, I know. My love for this joint however, has started to waver a little and in my own twisted way of thinking, I&#39;m hoping if more people patronize the shop because they know about it, they&#39;ll tighten up the quality standards and everyone benefits.<br><br>So why do i like Tsuru-Koshi? It&#39;s the only udon specialist restaurant that I know of my side of town (it&#39;s sad but true, but that&#39;s the crabby restaurant landscape in Singapore). It seems like a classic Japanese restaurant transplant that I imagine had some amount of quality control done by the OCD Japanese owner or his Singaporean equivalent. The noodles have always been cooked on the cusp of al dente and the tempura items fried crisp. Lastly, the prices are decent given where the restaurant is located and the portions for quality.<br><br>What&#39;s wrong now? The restaurant is still by far the only means for me to get remotely Japan-standard udon in Singapore, short of going to one the high end places worthy of a business lunch. This place wouldn&#39;t stand out in Japan by any means, but for Singapore, it&#39;s great. However, on a visit yesterday, I noticed the cooks have become sloppy. The Asu Asu Tan Tan udon I normally order came in a little mess of a bowl - with the minced meat chucked to one side, the noodles un-artfully dunked in and the soft egg broken. The tempura sides we ordered - pumpkin, ebi and the fish cake tubes - left oily kisses on the tenshi. The latter is a cardinal tempura sin in my book. If I wanted a sloppy fry-up, I&#39;d head to Smith&#39;s.<br><br>So yes, this review is strange in that I am none too pleased about what&#39;s happening in the kitchen. But, the udon still beats the competition by far. So do me a favor, stop by and grab a bowl or two regularly and tell them to step it up, please? Or tell me if you know of any worthy alternatives.",

"reviewcomment":"Tea (the event) is the best thing that the English have invented. Nothing beats whiling the afternoon away in the garden with buttery and crusty scones, clotted cream and jam. Best place to do it in Singapore? Try The Halia at Singapore Botanic Gardens, a romantic and picturesque restaurant tucked away in in the lush foliage centrally located in town.<br><br>My frazzled nerves were soothed by the Chilled Halia Infusion, a lightly spiced tea sweetened with honey, while we waited for our tiered tea set to be served. You could pick other teas or brewed coffee as part of your set. I much prefered the chilled version over the hot one that i had during brunch the last time.<br><br>Always start with the scone when doing tea. It kind of sets the tone for tea (that and you really should eat it when it&#39;s hot) and i knew i was in for a great time when i bit into the crusty and dense pastry slathered with chantilly cream and a tinge of orange ginger jam.<br><br>There&#39;s a nice balance of sweet and savory bites in the tea set, which i alternated between. The Gorgonzola and caramelized onion quiche had an absolutely buttery tart with a light blue cheese filling. There&#39;s also the poached chicken and smoked paprika finger sandwich and the meh-ish Wagyu beef rendang samosa. <br><br>The sweet plate consists of the delicious scones, the towering coconut panna cotta with mango, passion fuit and lychee. I quite enjoyed the moist carrot cake with crème cheese icing and certainly wouldn&#39;t mind seconds. I was impressed by the Ginger flower macaroon which had quite the perfect candy shell and slightly chewy center.<br><br>For $28 per individual set, I have to say this is a steal for tea. I&#39;ll definitely recommend this for a tea party with the girls! Don&#39;t miss out on this lovely tea at The Halia, Singapore Botanic Gardens which is available every weekend and Public Holiday from 3 - 5pm. Reservations are not accepted for brunch and tea service though.",

"reviewcomment":"Thankfully our taxi driver recommended this to us when we asked for some good street food. Although again, not the easiest to get to with the MRT. We had to take a bus transfer, but thanks to the kindness of strangers, we managed to find it perfectly due to their instruction. <br><br>Plenty of open (and closed stalls), and a lot of them sell the same or similar items, so you just have to choose which one to go to. I tended towards the stalls with longer lines in hopes that also meant delicious food. I got a yummy and cheap wonton noodle soup and a beer, while my friend ordered a Singapore chicken rice and a lo po gao. All so very delicious. The dessert stalls were a bit lacking, but we managed to find one where I ordered a black rice pudding. Delicious and not overly sweet. Thank you, taxi driver! <br><br>P.S. You have to pay to use the bathrooms, bring your own tp, and don&#39;t forget the water to wash the waste!",

"reviewcomment":"It&#39;s been three years since my wife and I officially moved to Singapore. This date only came to our attention while we already sitting in the DB Bistro Moderne. We could not have chosen a better place to celebrate. <br><br>After a long thirsty afternoon walking around the city, we ended up at MBS. It&#39;s hard to select a place to eat in this are due to all of the many and high end gourmet restaurants in The Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands, but we checked a couple of reviews on Yelp and decided that DB was the place of choice. <br><br>We got a table without a reservation without a problem, ordered two iceberg lettuce salads, a DB burger and some French Onion soup. Drinks were a Brewerkz Pale Ale and a mint, lime and ginger lemonade. <br><br>The service was very good, it was very friendly and a casual glance at our fellow diners indicated people were really enjoying themselves. <br><br>The bread they brought out before the salad, was great, but then the salads arrived. Wow. The lettuce was very fresh, crunchy and not too big (being a confirmed carnivore, I tolerate salads, just) the blue cheese dressing with bacon bits added had great flavors. , and before we knew it they were gone. <br>My wife was not as hungry as I was, so she ordered the French Onion soup. It arrived complete with the Gruyere cheese melted and floating on the top. Taste was wonderful. My DB burger was stuffed with short ribs and foie gras. I had never tasted foie gras before and despite some countries banning it, I decided to give it a try. The burger was cooked to perfection, medium, just like I had ordered. The short ribs and Foie Gras were spectacular. The French fries tasty, with a portion size that was the right side of &#34;not too big&#34;. <br><br>Washed down with the Pale ale from Brewerkz it really did hit the spot. Can you say that a $42 burger is good value? Maybe not but the taste was truly exceptional. <br><br>We let the food settle and followed it with some excellent coffee. <br><br>It was a great experience here.",

"reviewcomment":"I have a love-hate relationship with Sushi Tei. It was like THE place for conveyor belt sushi years ago as it serves much better quality sushi than other conveyor belt sushi places. Over the years, I felt the standard has been dropping or maybe I started going to better Japanese/sushi places and so reduced the time spent in chain sushi places. <br><br>I did not have a good experience at Sushi Tei after it moved to this current location and so stopped patronizing it for the longest while. The last time I stepped foot in it was probably last year and what I had was average.<br><br>So it took me by surprise that what I ordered recently were actually pretty good. Maybe it was because I had the cooked dishes, and not sashimi, chirashi or raw stuff. <br><br>The yakiniku don was to die for. Very tender slices of beef (full of flavor) and soft sweet onions over the fluffy sticky short grain Japanese rice with a drizzle of sauce. Each mouthful was just so delightful and packed with flavor. Even the rice was good on its own. <br><br>The salmon belly soup was a big portion. It had many pieces of the melt in your mouth salmon belly, bits of tofu, wakame and mushrooms and something like dong fen (mung bean thread noodle). <br><br>So maybe I have been ordering the wrong stuff at Sushi Tei. What I had was pretty much value for money too.",

I ordered their Ayam Panggang (Grilled Chicken Set for SGD5.50), which consisted of grilled chicken thigh with a fried egg over rice and it was covered in this delicious black sauce.

Pellegrino Top 50 restaurants of the world.  Now, that&#39;s an achievement!<br><br>The experience of Waku Ghin starts the moment you walk through the doors and are greeted by the attentive staff.  To the left is an impressive sake bar and caviar lounge, perfect for pre-dinner drinks.<br><br>Continue through the restaurant, and you are greeted by a curved timber walled hallway, with private Teppanyaki rooms situated off to each side.  Understated elegance is the theme and though it is impressive to say the least, there is nothing ostentatious about the space.  Warm timber compliments features of slick silver, with ornate vases and ornaments cleverly lit to create the perfect ambiance , alongside glimpses of the Singapore skyline.<br><br>The restaurant seats only 25 people at a time, offering 2 sittings each evening.  Guests are seated in private Teppanyaki rooms.  This evening, Mr J and I have our own personal Teppanyaki chef, dedicated to creating our 10 course degustation menu.  We share our Teppanyaki room with another couple, who also have their own personal chef.<br><br>The 10 course degustation menu is tailored to your individual taste on the evening, and our chef takes the time to discuss our menu with us.  I should also note, you will not be disappointed with the extensive wine list.  If you can&#39;t find something to tickle your fancy, then you&#39;re not looking hard enough. With our wine and food sorted, we proceed to sit back, relax and soak up the amazing experience of dining at Waku Ghin.<br><br>Our menu:<br>* &#39;Like Oyster&#39; - Scallop with Daikon and Oyster Leaf<br>* Marinated Botan Shrimp with Sea Urchin and Oscietra Caviar<br>* Grilled Tailfish with Japanese Matsutake<br>* Pan-Seared Foie Gras with Kyoho<br>* Australian Abalone with Fregola and Tomato<br>* Braised Canadian Lobster with Tarragon<br>* Charcoal Grilled Australian Lamb with Couscous<br>* Japanese Ohmi Wagyu Roll from Shiga Prefecture with Wasabi and Citrus Soy<br>* Scampi Pasta<br>* Gyokuro<br><br>Our dining experience commences with our chef showing us the seafood we are about to eat.  I can&#39;t help but notice the poor little lobsters are still alive!  At least we know it&#39;s fresh!<br><br>Our chef then proceeds to expertly prepare for us each dish, one at a time, carefully explaining the dish as he goes along.  I love the personal interaction with the chef, and revel in the opportunity to watch the expert preparation up close and personal.<br><br>Each dish is perfectly presented and looks as much a piece of art, as a plate of food.  Each mouthful is accompanied by the raising of my eyebrows and an animated &#39;wow&#39; coming out of my mouth!  Time and time again, every one of those 10 courses achieves the same reaction.<br>   <br>Once our degustation is complete, we are escorted to a separate room to retire for our dessert.  The room offers spectacular views of the Singapore skyline.<br><br>Our dessert menu:<br>* Cold Soup of Dates with Tonka Bean Ice Cream and Orange<br>* Pistachio Ice Cream with Raspberry and Chantilly<br>* Coffee or Tea and Petit Fours<br><br>The desserts do not disappoint and cap off a perfectly enchanting evening.  We are each presented with a personal menu, dated and detailing our food and wine choices for the evening.  A lovely touch and memento.<br><br>Though pricey, dining at Waku Ghin is an amazing experience.  From the food, to the decor, to the service.  This is seamless top class dining.  This is an experience I am going to remember for a long time to come.",

Having scaled six flight of stairs just to witness the mob, I chatted up Nik T. and Linda L. who arrived before me to determine where we would head to instead...aaaaaaand...

But when you take a bite, WOW, they are amazing!  Apparently, they steam the bun first and then deep fry it!  It is like an unsweet donut.  <br><a href='http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/long-beach-king-seafood-singapore?select=TAGjeGbTizp3KXNErPAIIg#HM_iho3AR4JHCH14cR0VKQ'>yelp.com/biz_photos/long…</a><br><br>My personal favorite dish during this dinner was the Dong Bo Spare ribs.  These little gems were tender and flavorful.  I loved it.  You can tell they were slow cooked as the sauce reduced down to a sweet and savory glaze.  It had me thinking of trying to recreate it when I got home.  <br><a href='http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/long-beach-king-seafood-singapore?select=TAGjeGbTizp3KXNErPAIIg#m-uQmFvgKI8BFfx1eXInLQ'>yelp.com/biz_photos/long…</a><br><br>Long Beach King had a dish that I&#39;ve never seen before.  They stuffed tofu with minced prawns and then deep fried the whole thing.  Everyone loved it.  <br><a href='http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/long-beach-king-seafood-singapore?select=TAGjeGbTizp3KXNErPAIIg#ywd-su8WeqlKbv2Vb8eajQ'>yelp.com/biz_photos/long…</a><br><br>The service at this restaurant is impeccable.  We had our plates constantly changed and our teapot was never empty.  When we make it back out to Singapore, we&#39;ll definitely be back.",

"reviewcomment":"My favorite Hokkien Mee in Singapore by far. I think Nam Sing is one of the rare breed that cooks Hokkien Mee in a drier way. There isn&#39;t so much soup to the dish and the noodles had a slight crisp texture to it. Another thing worthy to take a note of is how egg-y the plate is. I have no idea how he does it but it was quite an amazing taste.<br><br>Do remember to CALL THIS PLACE BEFORE YOU COME!!! The uncle closes the stall as he wishes to without warning and I have been left disappointed way too many times. The phone number is 6440 5340 and if there is no one who answer the phone, don&#39;t bother coming. Also ask if there are still plenty of plates left because I had an experience when I called, reached there 15 minutes later, only to be told that they&#39;ve been sold out for the day.",

Only thing we noticed is that the Sashimi could&#39;ve been colder. Not a fan of the chef removing the salmon with his bare hands either.. but I assume his hands are clean since I did not get a stomach ache after. Lol.<br><br>A friend asked me to try the Seared Salmon Roll and it was good too.<br><br>Overall exp was good. But it got really crowded at about 730pm and thats when service went down. I think they are really under staffed and missed my orders a few times.<br><br>I had a glass of 1dollar sake to wash it all down at the end with my hot green tea.<br><br>What I noticed is that it is a little bit expensive if not for the promos. The prices on the menu did shock me a little.<br><br>I&#39;ll still return though if I get another salmon sashimi craving! Bon Apetite!",

The bamboo design makes you feel like you are in Japan itself.<br><br>Like many of other yelpers had commented, there are a lot of varieties of ramens here. I was attracted to the Hokkaido ramen store as it has more crowds than the other stores. I ordered Hokkaido tonkotsu king. The egg was very delicious. The ramen was alright but the soup base was delish!<br><br>There is a store for beverages too. Since I hadn&#39;t tried the Japanese fruit drinks, I tried Fuji apple berry drink. It was something similar to Ribena. Wanted to try the asahi draft beer but wasn&#39;t able to as I was driving later on. <br><br>This is something like marche whereby they swipe cards and pay it when you are about to leave.

Small restaurant but cozy. <br><br>For the side karaage (chicken) looks appetizing and chasiu, gyoza looks normal. It taste like Japanese popcorn chicken that you can get at boba places in California :) It will be much better if it is warmer.<br><br>Drink: tropical juice looks appetising but I felt cheated cause it&#39;s actually minute maid&#39;s tropical mixed fruit drink. <br><br>Overall, will be back :)",

"reviewcomment":"There&#39;s a lovely conservatory-style area at the back of the café, preceded by a dim but cosy seating area facing an open kitchen/bakery and chocolate display cabinet.<br><br>It was raining that day, and I actually suspect that they redecorate according to the season or occasion! My evidence: the staff were visibly buzzing around inside before they opened, and they could have been tweaking the decor! Also, I&#39;ve seen pictures of the café filled with little hearts, all posted in February, as well as other similar pictures with Halloween lanterns. I&#39;d be very impressed if they actually hung those raining clouds to reflect the weather outside! It really added a fantastic touch to Wimbly Lu&#39;s intimate and personal setting.<br><br>To make sure that my friend and I were having a legitimate lunch and not just stuffing our faces with desserts instead of having a proper meal, we ordered a double seafood and cheese toasty ($6) which was so-so.<br><br>Me made our next choice from having read other reviews and recommendations - waffle with salted caramel ice cream, plus a topping of maple syrup. ($8.50)<br><br>This waffle was pretty much perfect, it really hit that criteria of a crisp exterior and fluffy insides. From what I&#39;ve heard, every single waffle served is just as perfect! Talk about quality control.<br><br>The salted caramel ice cream was delicious - flavourful but not sickeningly sweet. We definitely could have had a bigger scoop. The maple syrup was a good choice of topping as well.<br><br>Now I&#39;m no expert on sticky date pudding, as this was my first one ever. I&#39;ve got to say that it was delightful! Warm, gooey, sweet, and addictive. I only got to taste dates in my last mouthful, though. I&#39;m not sure if sticky date puddings have to taste strongly of dates.<br><br>It would have made more sense for the dense, rich pudding to come with pouring cream or ice cream, but it didn&#39;t, so we ordered an addition scoop of honey cinnamon ice cream. ($3)<br><br>The cinnamon taste was a little stronger than expected, which was a surprise, but a good one - like apple pie in ice cream form! There wasn&#39;t much taste of honey, it was probably used mainly to sweeten. The ice cream flavour didn&#39;t go that well with the pudding. However, the texture was perfect in my terms. Not too icy, yet not too heavy and gooey - somewhere among that blissful in between. We found ourselves craving more of that honey cinnamon ice cream!<br><br>With service charge, the bill came to somewhere around $25 in total for the both of us, which is pretty reasonable for the great atmosphere and food. Wimbly Lu is definitely somewhere I&#39;ll return to for a relaxed dessert experience the next time I visit Singapore!",

"reviewcomment":"This place is just so darn cute!<br>The kitchen staff wear I heart pho t-shirts with the singapore flag in the heart, they have signs showing how to get a table &amp; order (pretty straight forward but it was quiet when I went, judging by previous reviews this isn&#39;t normally the case), and they even have little ceramic-y prison style cups to keep the ordering sheets and pencils in, even if the food was only so-so I&#39;d go back just for the look of the place! <br><br>I was very excited to be back on yelp soil, but not so much I couldn&#39;t stay away from more Bahn Mi! To be honest, I didn&#39;t expect a lot after spending the last couple of weeks in Vietnam, but boy was I wrong! <br><br>I has the cold meat &amp; pâté Bahn Mi without chilli (of course), and it was delicious! Ok, so not quite &#34;man up the end of the street from my hostel&#34; delicious, but as good as I&#39;ve had outside of Vietnam! There was a slight kick to the flavoured mayo, but anyone with normal taste buds wouldn&#39;t have even noticed. <br><br>I like the dim sum style fill in a form ordering, and you have to get your own utensils &amp; napkins, but they still bring your dish to you. <br><br>I also had a (small) bottle of water, and came to $7.50, which for what I&#39;ve experienced in Singapore (outside of Chinatown) is pretty good <br><br>You should check it out!",

"reviewcomment":"After my previous visit to Ramen Keisuke Tonkotsu King Four Seasons , I found myself craving for their ramen again. This time round I went to the one situated at 100AM, which specialised in their chicken broth ramen. <br><br>The Green Tea Cola tasted a bit like Sprite. It&#39;s refreshing to drink this especially after finishing the ramen.<br><br>The Tori King Ramen with All Toppings is their signature ramen that comes with a chicken thigh, 2 half-boiled egg, a big piece of chashu and a big piece of seaweed. The chicken is tender, the egg tasted invigorating and the chashu was chewy. The greatest credit goes to the soup. It is flavourful, not too salty and accompanies well with the nice-cooked ramen (I didn&#39;t finish the soup as per what I did at Ramen Keisuke Tonkotsu King Four Seasons though).<br><br>The Black Spicy Tori King Ramen with All Toppings is the black pepper variant of the original ramen. It is nearly the same as the Tori King Ramen except with a little spice. If you do want your ramen to be slightly spicy, this should definitely be ordered.<br><br>Don&#39;t forget to have your ramen with the marinated beansprouts!<br><br>Definitely will come back here again if I&#39;m craving for ramen. If you are around the Tanjong Pagar area, this is one place to visit (the other being Ramen Keisuke Tonkotsu King, under the same company)",

"reviewcomment":"Ugh. So good. I practically loved every single dish we got. I had been wanting to come here after having it recommended to me so many times... and I finally did! :D so without further ado, here&#39;s what we had:<br><br>Smoked quail eggs white truffle - it&#39;s good, but for the price of $12 PER EGGS i wouldn&#39;t get it again. i thought they&#39;d at least give 2-3 eggs for that price, but no. it was really $12 for a spoonful of quail eggs and truffle - yummy, but not worth the price tag!<br><br>Squid, sweet corn and paprika sauce - this is an excellent dish. i was pleasantly surprised by how juicy and soft the squid was, and the spicy yet sweet creamy paprika sauce. even the slightly charred green onions that was probably just a garnish (but I ate anyway) was tasty as hell.<br><br>Onglet, onion and bone marrow - soOooO sooooo good. the chef came out and showed us the meat before it gets cooked, but i was too busy eyeing the wine list so i didn&#39;t pay too much attention. they didn&#39;t bother asking us how we&#39;d like it done, but it came out just perfect. the meat was perfectly seared on the outside, and so juicy and so pink-tender on the inside.<br><br>Burnt End&#39;s Sanger (pulled pork burger) - ok, could you tell I saved the best for last? cause I totally did. this was so good that when I first bit into it, I practically trailed off whatever conversation I was having, and all the excellent dishes we had before hand just seemed to pale in comparison. and then we got seconds - it was THAT GOOD.<br><br>Banana with Caramel - this was a lovely dessert, though not much could be said about it because i was still in shock after the sanger - i felt like it really stole the show for me....<br>anyway, i digress. the banana was nicely done and flavorful, though i feel like at that point i could have gone without dessert. thankfully it wasn&#39;t massive or anything, so we didn&#39;t struggle with it.<br><br>Totally would come back here again - there were many dishes that caught my eye that I just didn&#39;t have the stomach space to try.<br><br>Update (Feb 5): went back and had the following dishes:<br>- uni with cauliflower sauce<br>- leeks, hazelnut<br>- corgette<br>- toast and tomato with pancetta<br>- sanger<br>- flank, onion and marrow<br>- banana caramel<br>Will update properly when i have the chance.",

"reviewcomment":"Love BBQ whatever style and Japanese is no different.  Happy to yet again Google and research last Friday for a place for a quick fix for a grill and found this place.  First impression was a picture of fresh ingredient. So i thought ok...lets do this.  Called up made a reservation for 3 and i was there at 6pm and was the first.  I was greeted Japanese style (kinda reminded me in Army where you are supposed to acknowledge orders given) by all the staff but i notice one thing peculiar - the staff if i am not wrong are all Japanese.  And in my mind I told myself &#34;you are gonna get it!&#34;.<br><br>Family came shortly after and i went on an ordering binge.  I ordered 3 orders of each of Shrimp, Beef, Asparagus,garlic, onion,  Mushroom, Sweet Potatoes, Fish, Scallop and can&#39;t remember the rest.  take away is everything is grilled to perfection!  The beef especially hits the spot as it was crispy on the outside but perfect medium rare on the inside....<br><br>then comes the home run the bill. Not sure if i could read everything i ordered but it came to i remember $640 without alcohol :).  oouch to the wallet but salute to the skill of the chef.  i could never replicate that even if i try for years.<br><br>take away is... if you got a business dinner and want to impress this will be the place to go instead of heading to japan.  On a personal level i would hold it back and go for shirokane tori-tama at Robertson Quay.",

"reviewcomment":"Really is THE best Cantonese food around. <br><br>Super authentic, mouthwateringly delicious and incredibly reasonable, I don&#39;t know what more you could possibly ask for. I have been coming here for years and often crave it when I&#39;m back in LA. <br><br>Sure, Singapore is full of delicious Chinese food - we are, after all, a food hub. However, every dish here is cooked to perfection... and that&#39;s what sets Hong Kong Street apart from other Cantonese restaurants, in my opinion.<br><br>There are so many yummy dishes here, I go through phases of &#34;favorites&#34;. My current favorite? The Pa Ting Yu (Steamed Silver Catfish - I ask for mine with their black bean sauce)... Firstly, the fish is steamed to perfection (moist, melt-in-your-mouth goodness). Secondly, the sauce is on point. (I tend to steer away from Black Bean sauces because of how salty it usually is) However, this one is anything but! You can tell they make their own sauces (or at least that&#39;s what it tastes like), not something out of the bottle. Bursting with flavor, yet, not salty at all. <br><br>Another dish I like is their Sum Lor Hor Fun (Sliced Fish Hor Fun) which, if you aren&#39;t familiar, is stir fried flat rice noodles with bean sprouts and sliced fish in gravy. Not soupy, but not dry noodles either. It isn&#39;t, however, the black singaporean Hor Fun you might be used to. (I like this one because I feel like it&#39;s healthier than normal Hor Fun - whether or not it actually is, might be another story haha) <br><br>A few other favorites include the Milky Fish Noodle Soup, Salted Fish Fried Rice, Prawn Paste Chicken, Deep Fried Cereal Prawns, Pork Ribs... <br><br>The place is clean with air-conditioning and the service is good. <br><br>However, I tend to always take my food to go (maybe I just like eating in the comfort of my home haha) But we usually buy a bunch of dishes from here to-go for dinner when we&#39;re too lazy to cook (or have guests over)... Just call ahead and they&#39;ll have it ready for you to pick it.",

Even the chicken feet, which I usually swear off, smelled and looked to appetising to pass up! Their Homemade Beancurd with Fish Fillet, Fish Gluten and Vegetables sounded super simple, but it was the BEST I&#39;ve ever had! The beancurd is perfect - soft and smooth inside, and slightly rough on the outside, and the fish fillet was tender, soft and fresh.

I brought my entire family to this restaurant when I received my first pay check. I would like to comment on their steamed salted kampong chicken.  They come with a really big portion costing only $8.80 to dine there and $6.80  for take-away. Smooth chicken! My family totally loves it. <br><br>Not forgetting to mention on their fish maw soup and shark fin soup. For the price you are paying, I would expect lesser ingredient and more soup. But that is definitely not the case at Pin Shi. They are really generous in their portion of fish maw. Love it to the max.<br><br>So I would definitely suggest to people who are looking for good food at affordable prices.",

A classic, classy, upscale, quiet, clean, warm, friendly French restaurant. <br><br>Be warned, they don&#39;t really have an &#34;A La Carte&#34; menu. They have 3 set menus from $150-$300 and several &#34;to share&#34; dishes. We each ordered the $150 &#34;Decouverte&#34; menu which included:<br><br>Steamed Blue Crab and Hokkaido Sea Urchin on Lobster Custard with Fennel Foam - Rich and delicious<br><br>Crispy Cornouaille Langoustine, with a mini caesar salad - Delicious<br><br>Seasonal Corn Soup with chives - served piping hot with a few caramel corns on the side, rich but balanced<br><br>Hungarian Charcoal-Grilled Pork Rack With Carrots Confit and potato puree - The pork was super tender, the puree impeccable and the carrots delicious. My co-workers opted for Wild Scottish Salmon, one confit and one tartare.<br><br>Dessert was Dark Chocolate Souffle with Tahiti Vanilla Ice Cream -ice cream was the most vanilla-ee I&#39;ve ever had.<br><br>I felt very satisfied with the meal, and felt it was actually good value despite the cost. A special note, they have FOUR kinds of butter and 3 kinds of bread: Baguette, sourdough and focaccia.  The mini baguettes were incredible. The butters are smoked (delicious), seaweed (salty), spicy and salted. I tried each and they were all good in their own way, perhaps the best butters I&#39;ve ever had. <br><br>Service was great, they explained each item since I didn&#39;t remember what any of the courses were. The wine list is as thick as a dictionary but they have affordable wines and wines by the glass. The restaurant is pretty small and intimate, and their wine cellar is a digital glass walk in safe-room. <br><br>I will certainly return next time I come to Singapore.",

"reviewcomment":"Not gonna lie, sometimes I don&#39;t know whether or not to trust the ratings on singapore&#39;s yelp because with 2 or 3 reviews, it can sometimes get bias (unless it&#39;s by the few singapore elite yelpers - whose reviews i love reading, but more on that another time)  <br><br>This however, REALLY is the best teochew porridge around and I&#39;m SO happy to have found it! <br><br>Located on Joo Chiat Road, the little coffee shop it&#39;s located in is super clean, well ventilated and cool (I&#39;m speaking to you tourists out there who can&#39;t stand the heat!) but more than that, they have hands down the best selection of dishes I&#39;ve seen so far (and I mean, teochew porridge is all about the dishes) <br><br>They have everything you could possibly want - from your usual selection of veggies to stewed duck, braised chicken, steamed fishes, tofu dishes, sweet &amp; sour pork and even steamed CRABS. <br><br>The uncles there are super friendly and parking is easy (if you&#39;re lucky, you might find street parking but otherwise, theres a nice big parking lot at the intersection of Marshall Lane and Joo Chiat that offers coupon parking)<br><br>My only wish for this place? That it wasn&#39;t so far from where I live!",

"reviewcomment":"I love the katsu sandwiches from Romankan Yokohama. The tonkatsu inside is a lovely golden brown with crisp lettuce peeking out from under the fluffy white bread slices. It is an appetizing quick lunch, and cheap too. <br><br>Their most famous dish perhaps, apart from the katsu sandwich, is their katsudon. While people commonly go to places like Ginza Bairin or Tonkichi for tonkatsu, I very much prefer the tonkatsu here which has been consistently tasty and good value for money at $13 and a huge portion. <br><br>Located in the basement of Ngee Ann City, aka Takashimaya, where all the food stalls are, I am quite glad to find this shop with their friendly staff is still around after so many years and numerous changes to the area. The only problem is cash payment only.",

"reviewcomment":"I only had scrambled eggs, smoked salmon, a cappuccino, a passion fruit tart, and an espresso. All were excellent and reasonably priced. The hours of this place are really weird, especially that most days they start serving breakfast at 11. It reminded me a lot of Jimmy Monkey, and the cappuccino in particular had almost identical flavor to theirs.<br><br>It&#39;s a little like they are trying too hard to be hipster, but I didn&#39;t really see anything to complain about, except the scrambled eggs were a little runnier than they are in America. I guess if you don&#39;t like your scrambled eggs runny, you should ask for them to be cooked more than usual. The food and coffee was great, especially the cappuccino and passion fruit tart.",

"reviewcomment":"Location &amp; vibe-wise, was my type of cafe - quiet neighbourhood, ample parking, large outdoor patio, breezy, and not crowded. Food-wise was average... not bad but not spectacular.<br><br>Came here on a weekend morning and had the Full Melba Cooked Breakfast for $25:  2 eggs, pork sausages, bacon, roasted cherry tomatoes, baked beans, mushrooms, hash brown &amp; toast. I was pretty hungry and considered getting the Mega Melba Cooked Breakfast, an upsized version of the Full Melba, which was $36. The Mega Melba doubles the portions of everything but the eggs, and what I really wanted was more eggs, so I stuck with the Full Melba.<br><br>It says on the menu that you&#39;re not allowed to share the Mega Melba, or in their words &#34;can&#39;t be splitted&#34;. That&#39;s not very nice... I wonder if they would have a problem with their customers sharing any of the other dishes? Is the Mega Melba too good a deal? If anything it would make their pricing a little more decent as $25 veers on the side pricey for breakfast. They did however provide a glass bottle of water and cups without us having to ask which I thought was nice considering how many cafes these days won&#39;t even serve you tap water.<br><br>Overall, I can see myself coming back if I&#39;m in the area. I don&#39;t mind paying a little extra to avoid the crowds.",

Although it must be noted that in my previous visit, another waitress seemed abit blur as to how much the beers cost at different times of the night.<br><br>All in all, a nice place to have gatherings because of its whole friendly vibe and American backyard patio (am I getting this right?) atmosphere.

"reviewcomment":"On my final full day in Singapore, I enjoyed a superb final dinner here at Founder Bak Kuh Teh.  Open from 9am to 10:30pm, it&#39;s a short walk from the Mustafa Centre (or Farrer Park MRT station) and they offer in my opinion the best Bak Kuh Teh and Pig Organs Soup that I&#39;ve tried in Singapore thus far.  Everything we tried here had superb quality, especially the broth.<br><br>I also tried two tofu dishes and an order of green vegetables served with fried shallots, very delicious.  The whole meal for two, which included dessert and tea cost just over $S35.  Quite reasonable.<br><br>The staff here are very reliable, courteous, helpful, fair, and friendly.  The atmosphere inside is spacious, cozy and comfortable with an overall social, relaxing and casual vibe.<br><br>Will definitely make this a regular place whenever shopping at the Mustafa Centre wheever I visit Singapore.<br><br>Be careful walking to this restaurant as the sidewalks are uneven and precarious at times.  At first, you might not think you&#39;ll be heading towards a restaurant as the street block or two between this establishment and the Farrer St. MRT look run down and dark.  But keep walking, you&#39;ll find this place and it&#39;ll be worth it.",

"reviewcomment":"Seriously anything fried tastes awesome! I&#39;m sure all of you agree with me. So think about it, fried yong tau foo and then this starchy thick braised gravy with minced meat is poured all over the golden brown babies.. I have arrived at YTH heaven, where fat cells expand and 6 packs abs are non-existent.<br><br>My favorite items are the ngoh hiang, tau pok (really great for soaking the gravy), toufu and fish cake you tiao! Not the usual yong tau foo fan so i don&#39;t have those fish cake filled vege or chili. They do have that though. Seriously i can finish up all the gravy! Say hello to cellulite!!<br><br>More gravy for the thick beehoon. I love the gravy because it&#39;s like the Taiwanese lu rou fan (braised meat rice) sauce. Ate tons of that in Taipei and i only found a comparable stall in Singapore (Full House at Central and Far East Plaza). Anyway, this is a twist to the rice but if you prefer rice they have that as well.<br><br>Fu Lin is opened daily so you can get it for breakfast, lunch or dinner which is pretty awesome to me. I wouldn&#39;t have this in the morning though because this is pretty sinful even for me. Cheap cheap must eat! It&#39;s usually about 6 bucks per person inclusive of a drink. :) Do holler if you see me eating there!",

"reviewcomment":"I have a love-hate relationship with Sushi Tei. It was like THE place for conveyor belt sushi years ago as it serves much better quality sushi than other conveyor belt sushi places. Over the years, I felt the standard has been dropping or maybe I started going to better Japanese/sushi places and so reduced the time spent in chain sushi places. <br><br>I did not have a good experience at Sushi Tei after it moved to this current location and so stopped patronizing it for the longest while. The last time I stepped foot in it was probably last year and what I had was average.<br><br>So it took me by surprise that what I ordered recently were actually pretty good. Maybe it was because I had the cooked dishes, and not sashimi, chirashi or raw stuff. <br><br>The yakiniku don was to die for. Very tender slices of beef (full of flavor) and soft sweet onions over the fluffy sticky short grain Japanese rice with a drizzle of sauce. Each mouthful was just so delightful and packed with flavor. Even the rice was good on its own. <br><br>The salmon belly soup was a big portion. It had many pieces of the melt in your mouth salmon belly, bits of tofu, wakame and mushrooms and something like dong fen (mung bean thread noodle). <br><br>So maybe I have been ordering the wrong stuff at Sushi Tei. What I had was pretty much value for money too.",

"reviewcomment":"Despite my strong opposition to seating with no backs, this is one of the few places with barstool only seating that I go back to on multiple occasions. The reason is the food is pretty damn good.<br><br>On this occasion we had four dishes: the spicy tuna &amp; salmon sashimi bowl, the tuna &amp; avocado tartare, the pork belly rice bowl and the avocado &amp; salmon sushi roll.<br><br>Only one was a dud: the sushi roll. It tasted bland and the rice was not well put together. Either it was the wrong rice or it was rolled in the wrong way. It was a very unpleasant dish.<br><br>But the other three were major hits and it was hard to choose a favourite. I would easily eat any of them again and again. The pork belly was probably my number one, delicious, moist, fall apart on your fork type pork. And it wasn&#39;t too fatty which I appreciated.<br><br>The two raw fish-based dishes were equally delicious. This is obviously fusion so don&#39;t come expecting your grandfather&#39;s sashimi. But both were well-flavoured, not to the point of destroying the texture and taste of the fish but enough to make them interesting. <br><br>This place gets my recommendation.",

I ate them quickly only as a matter if formality.<br><br>Will finish with the insightful philosophical message posted on a sign on the wall here that put my morning in perspective:<br><br>&#34;Teens: You have all the time and energy but no money.<br><br>Workers: you have the money and energy but no time.<br><br>Oldies: You have all the time and money but no more energy.<br><br>Lesson: Enjoy life and all the things you have at the moment because you can&#39;t have everything at once.&#34;<br><br>;)",

I do find it a tad too oily due to all the fat from the chicken skin though. <br><br>I love that their egg has the runny yolk. That&#39;s my favourite part about eaten ramen!

"reviewcomment":"A short walk from Lavender MRT, this cafe has a real peaceful feel as it is set back some ways from the main road via a pathway along the Kallang River. You can catch a nice breeze in the outdoor courtyard and chill out with your coffee and food. Whoever chooses the tunes here has pretty decent taste, as I often find myself whipping open Shazam to see what they are playing.<br><br>In terms of hard product, the coffee is very good. The food is mediocre and could be improved, but the vibe of the place is pleasant enough to reach four stars. Dishes are generally bland and uninteresting, although the &#39;Big L&#39;s Breakfast&#39; is filling and does the trick if you&#39;re just looking for a straightforward big greasy plate of eggs, sausage and tomato. <br><br>Great spot for a lazy Sunday afternoon brunch. The real unique thing about Loysel&#39;s is the laid back atmosphere, which can be hard to find in Singapore at times.",

We usually buy wines as gifts here for friends and the feedback has been great. Recommend the Juliussital Riesling, which is not too sweet and comes in a unique bottle.<br><br>Also amazing: Their wine menu, which is basically a chart. So many times I never know what bottle to order, but Magma lists out for you by taste/type/region/flavor, making the whole experience a little less daunting. <br><br>Food: my favorite dish is the &#34;Rheinischer Sauerbraten,&#34; 7 days pickled braised beef in red wine gravy, potato dumpling, red cabbage &amp; raisins. I usually am not a beef eater, but this beef is so tender, soft and delicious. <br><br>They also host tasting events featuring various German wine experts which are usually a great way to learn more about the region and it&#39;s wine, plus sample the food if the idea of German food is new to you.<br><br>Lastly, they allow my dog to sit with me on the outside porch, and never fail to give the little guy some water, all with a smile.

"reviewcomment":"There always seem to be a long queue and usually when that happens you can&#39;t get seated until everyone&#39;s arrived, but it&#39;s so so worth it!<br><br>There are four staples that I ALWAYS get when here. Start with the cockles - even if the thought of having them raw irked me a ilttle but I love this enough to get myself a hepatitis B jab so I feel safe chomping down on these babies. What really makes it so good is the sauce with lots of garlic, so make sure you drown your cockle in it before throwing it down the deep end!<br><br>My favourite is their three egg spinach, with salted, centuy and the normal egg, a dish I began to notice was in restaurants everywhere, but only after I had it here. To date I still find this the most well done, with such a yum  gravy you&#39;d want to get rice with it. <br><br>The butter pork is an absolute winner. It seems to be fried pork ribs (boneless) buried under a mountain of milk powder, yet the powder is so sweet my friend guessed that it would perhaps be condensed milk powder, if such a thing even exists? But the novelty and goodness of the powder aside, the pork ribs are fried perfectly - not too thick, not fatty, very crispy...it is best eaten hot of course.<br><br>I also always get the golden mushroom beancurd, even if it has disappointed me on a few occassions. It&#39;s essentially those japanese straw mushrooms in a thick minced pork sauce, a little sweet but very full of flavour.<br><br>I have genuinely never thought I&#39;d need to try anything else.",

"reviewcomment":"Really is THE best Cantonese food around. <br><br>Super authentic, mouthwateringly delicious and incredibly reasonable, I don&#39;t know what more you could possibly ask for. I have been coming here for years and often crave it when I&#39;m back in LA. <br><br>Sure, Singapore is full of delicious Chinese food - we are, after all, a food hub. However, every dish here is cooked to perfection... and that&#39;s what sets Hong Kong Street apart from other Cantonese restaurants, in my opinion.<br><br>There are so many yummy dishes here, I go through phases of &#34;favorites&#34;. My current favorite? The Pa Ting Yu (Steamed Silver Catfish - I ask for mine with their black bean sauce)... Firstly, the fish is steamed to perfection (moist, melt-in-your-mouth goodness). Secondly, the sauce is on point. (I tend to steer away from Black Bean sauces because of how salty it usually is) However, this one is anything but! You can tell they make their own sauces (or at least that&#39;s what it tastes like), not something out of the bottle. Bursting with flavor, yet, not salty at all. <br><br>Another dish I like is their Sum Lor Hor Fun (Sliced Fish Hor Fun) which, if you aren&#39;t familiar, is stir fried flat rice noodles with bean sprouts and sliced fish in gravy. Not soupy, but not dry noodles either. It isn&#39;t, however, the black singaporean Hor Fun you might be used to. (I like this one because I feel like it&#39;s healthier than normal Hor Fun - whether or not it actually is, might be another story haha) <br><br>A few other favorites include the Milky Fish Noodle Soup, Salted Fish Fried Rice, Prawn Paste Chicken, Deep Fried Cereal Prawns, Pork Ribs... <br><br>The place is clean with air-conditioning and the service is good. <br><br>However, I tend to always take my food to go (maybe I just like eating in the comfort of my home haha) But we usually buy a bunch of dishes from here to-go for dinner when we&#39;re too lazy to cook (or have guests over)... Just call ahead and they&#39;ll have it ready for you to pick it.",

"reviewcomment":"Came here with a friend from San Fran who was craving some authentic Cantonese food - and since we were willing to break the piggy bank (quite a few, in fact!), we went all-out and I got a table for two for us in Summer Palace.<br><br>We had the Chef&#39;s Tasting Menu for two (which came with 8 dishes, including dessert), and they were all spectactular! Even the chicken feet, which I usually swear off, smelled and looked to appetising to pass up! Their Homemade Beancurd with Fish Fillet, Fish Gluten and Vegetables sounded super simple, but it was the BEST I&#39;ve ever had! The beancurd is perfect - soft and smooth inside, and slightly rough on the outside, and the fish fillet was tender, soft and fresh. Wow!<br><br>Will be back next time (hopefully soon!) and try the rest of the dishes that we didn&#39;t see on the menu!",

I brought my entire family to this restaurant when I received my first pay check. I would like to comment on their steamed salted kampong chicken.  They come with a really big portion costing only $8.80 to dine there and $6.80  for take-away. Smooth chicken! My family totally loves it. <br><br>Not forgetting to mention on their fish maw soup and shark fin soup. For the price you are paying, I would expect lesser ingredient and more soup. But that is definitely not the case at Pin Shi. They are really generous in their portion of fish maw. Love it to the max.<br><br>So I would definitely suggest to people who are looking for good food at affordable prices.",

A classic, classy, upscale, quiet, clean, warm, friendly French restaurant. <br><br>Be warned, they don&#39;t really have an &#34;A La Carte&#34; menu. They have 3 set menus from $150-$300 and several &#34;to share&#34; dishes. We each ordered the $150 &#34;Decouverte&#34; menu which included:<br><br>Steamed Blue Crab and Hokkaido Sea Urchin on Lobster Custard with Fennel Foam - Rich and delicious<br><br>Crispy Cornouaille Langoustine, with a mini caesar salad - Delicious<br><br>Seasonal Corn Soup with chives - served piping hot with a few caramel corns on the side, rich but balanced<br><br>Hungarian Charcoal-Grilled Pork Rack With Carrots Confit and potato puree - The pork was super tender, the puree impeccable and the carrots delicious. My co-workers opted for Wild Scottish Salmon, one confit and one tartare.<br><br>Dessert was Dark Chocolate Souffle with Tahiti Vanilla Ice Cream -ice cream was the most vanilla-ee I&#39;ve ever had.<br><br>I felt very satisfied with the meal, and felt it was actually good value despite the cost. A special note, they have FOUR kinds of butter and 3 kinds of bread: Baguette, sourdough and focaccia.  The mini baguettes were incredible. The butters are smoked (delicious), seaweed (salty), spicy and salted. I tried each and they were all good in their own way, perhaps the best butters I&#39;ve ever had. <br><br>Service was great, they explained each item since I didn&#39;t remember what any of the courses were. The wine list is as thick as a dictionary but they have affordable wines and wines by the glass. The restaurant is pretty small and intimate, and their wine cellar is a digital glass walk in safe-room. <br><br>I will certainly return next time I come to Singapore.",

While people commonly go to places like Ginza Bairin or Tonkichi for tonkatsu, I very much prefer the tonkatsu here which has been consistently tasty and good value for money at $13 and a huge portion. <br><br>Located in the basement of Ngee Ann City, aka Takashimaya, where all the food stalls are, I am quite glad to find this shop with their friendly staff is still around after so many years and numerous changes to the area.

It had tomato, arugula, cheddar cheese, and caramalized onions in balsamic vinegar! The best part of it was the sun dried tomato bread! All the flavors work so well together! <br><br>My friends and I ordered the same coffee beans (Columbian) prepared three different ways (all I can remember right now is the siphon...it looked like a science experiment). The barista, Nora, was so patient and friendly, and came to our table to explain the different steps and temperature etc. I didn&#39;t know making a cup of coffee can be this complicated! The three different methods produced such different flavors from the same beans!! That was so incredible! They also provided us with wine glasses to drink the coffee in! It was a coffee tasting experience! You&#39;d think something like this would cost a lot but it was so reasonably priced! It&#39;s cheaper than getting a latte at Starbucks and so much tastier! Plus you&#39;re supporting a local cafe in a great location. <br><br>Highly recommended!!",

It had been much hyped online and, having lived in the area for a year, it seemed imperative that I try it.<br><br>The noodles did not disappoint. Very springy, great chilli and solid pork mince. Is this one of the best mee pok in Singapore? Hard for me to say but at $2-5 a bowl you will not leave feeling dissatisfied.",

"reviewcomment":"A birthday dinner reservation was made and confirmed with much professionalism. A text message on the day itself to reconfirm. I have heard many good things about Pietrasanta over the year and shall continue to spread its goodness. <br><br>It holds much authenticity with homemade focaccia bread, cheeses, and pastas. They are all very fresh and simple. I really enjoy the setting and hospitality. Everyone is so friendly and always smiling. <br><br>The food was without a doubt pleasing. We had the house special mackerel, lasagna and a starter. It was enough to keep us full but we persisted till dessert came. The fish was sweetly grilled and very fresh. It was as if they fish it out from the sea instead of flying it in from Norway. The lasagna is cheesy but yet hold substantial meatiness and well seasoned. A dark chocolate torte with sour cream and biscotti, much like a match made in heaven. <br><br>I would definitely come back again to try their wine and homemade pastas.",

"reviewcomment":"I&#39;m trying to think of reasons why I shouldn&#39;t give Jai Thai 5 stars... and there are only three I can think of: First, that they don&#39;t serve alcohol. How great would a beer be with that spicy green mango salad? Oh, and second: if Jai Thai delivered, I would positively be in HEAVEN. Thirdly: Jai Thai is cash only. Booooo for those nights I haven&#39;t had time to stop at the ATM on the way home from work. So, really, Jai Thai is nearrrrrly at 5 stars for me, but what they do have is crazy good. <br><br>It&#39;s true what&#39;s been said before -- the value for money here is second to none. The sign outside their door is correct: Wallet Friendly Authentic Thai Cuisine. I&#39;ve spent a lot of time in Thailand -- this is the real deal, yo. <br><br>They have plenty of dishes for diets of all kinds, including vegetarians, and so far everything I&#39;ve tried has been teh awsum. My current favorites are the broccoli with prawn, the aforementioned green mango salad, any/all of the squid dishes, and HELLZ YAH TO THE FISH CAKES. The prawn cakes are good too, but the fish cakes are wayyyyyyy mo bettah. You will be so missing out if you don&#39;t order these, trust me trust me trust me. <br><br>They have several set menus which are also great value, particularly for lunch or for larger parties. Thai iced tea is sweet and plentiful, and service is swift and friendly. What&#39;s not to love? Erhm, maybe the industrial fluorescent lighting is a bit... difficult. They don&#39;t get points for atmosphere. But you&#39;ll be so involved in what you&#39;re eating that I doubt it&#39;ll stop you from returning...",

"reviewcomment":"I love Kuriya Dining! It&#39;s my default dining destination if I happen to be at Great World CIty and have some time to spare. A meal at Kuriya is to be enjoyed at leisure, to rush through it would do neither you nor the chef justice. <br><br>We got the edamame (really fresh and plump), selection of sushi (very fresh) and some yakitori items (grilled prawn, scallop and wagyu beef), king crab (sweet but a bit difficult to extract) with plum sauce, uni egg rice in claypot (seasonal item), dobinmushi (really tasty) and chawanmushi (really smooth) Everything was absolutely delicious, though I prefer the king crab at Hide Yamamoto.<br><br>Service was really good and our server even offered to scrap the burnt parts of the uni egg rice for us if we liked.

"reviewcomment":"Where do you take a date for an afternoon sojourn and yet want a cozy ambiance to get to know him/her better? ReStore that is. Better yet, they might be impressed with the theme of the place. <br><br>Walked past this cafe many-a-time and never found the right time or opportunity to actually dine in. However, a cold rainy Friday afternoon seemed liked a good time to try this place. Coming straight from Drury Lane Cafe next door, I had enough of coffee and wanted to have more desserts.<br><br>I am a girl who likes to get quick service and be served fast if I know what I want and place my order upon walking in (without looking at the menu). I  also have certain favourites that I like to try at different cafes and than I&#39;ll mentally rank them on my Top 10 list of my favourite cafe with my favourite food. As I was still in search of the perfect Lemon Meringue Tart, I made a beeline straight to the cake counter. Well, no sight of my tart that&#39;s for sure but what caught my eye was the enormous, fluffy, topped-with-icing Bundt Cake. Upon confirming that it is a Lemon Bundt Cake, I told the lady that I&#39;l have that. I sounded pretty sure of my choice but nonetheless the lady told us to take a seat and she will come around and take my order. After waiting for 5 minutes, I saw her behind the counter busying herself and she didn&#39;t seem in a hurry to take my order. At that time, there was only another table besides ours and they had their orders served already. Puzzled, my partner walked over to the counter and placed our order again, more decisively this time.<br><br>Verdict:<br>-Lemon Bundt Cake - Moist, Soft, Fluffy with just the right intensity of lemon flavour. The icing capped the entire ensemble nicely and added a gentle sugary aftertaste.<br><br>The store was having a book sale at the time we were there and the piles of used books gave a nice touch to the antique-shop vibe that the owner wanted to achieve. Not sure if anyone will actually buy any of the furniture but it makes for a unique cafe experience.<br><br>If you want to impress your overseas guest with a one-of-a-kind cafe experience with chairs on the wall, or do some antique shopping at the same time, this place comes highly recommended.<br><br>Tip: Not recommended for big groups as it can get squeezy, maximum of 4 pax is fine.",

We shared two mains: a soba dish and a millet paella; and one red lentil soup and white fungus dessert for $20 total. The food was served very quickly -- I guess having a small menu allows for quick service and the owner was very friendly. Wish there were more of such places around the island!",

The bamboo design makes you feel like you are in Japan itself.<br><br>Like many of other yelpers had commented, there are a lot of varieties of ramens here. I was attracted to the Hokkaido ramen store as it has more crowds than the other stores. I ordered Hokkaido tonkotsu king. The egg was very delicious. The ramen was alright but the soup base was delish!<br><br>There is a store for beverages too. Since I hadn&#39;t tried the Japanese fruit drinks, I tried Fuji apple berry drink. It was something similar to Ribena. Wanted to try the asahi draft beer but wasn&#39;t able to as I was driving later on. <br><br>This is something like marche whereby they swipe cards and pay it when you are about to leave.

I like sitting on the counter though, you get to peek at one the cooks are doing through a glass pane.<br><br>Like everyone said, the decor of this place is super cute and cozy, modeled after a small B&amp;B or something. They also play this adorable jazzy french music in the background.<br><br>I got the sizzling hamburg steak since that seems to be getting rave reviews. It&#39;s not bad for $19.90. Tasty and fills me up - it comes with fries and a bed of bean sprouts. Kinda reminds me of a glorified pepper lunch. It was served in an interesting manner too - The waiter will pour some sort of liquid on your egg and burger, and it would light up for awhile before she pours another liquid on top of it to put the fire out.<br><br>After serving your meal, your waiter will give you a key which you will then take to the cashier to pay your bill and &#34;check out&#34; of this lovely B&amp;B. cute eh?",

There is a great truffle flavor with a nice savory bite and bits of parmesan cheese.<br>Otherwise, there is a wide range of brunch and lunch options here.  I&#39;ve had everything from the large burger with egg and steak cut fries to the &#34;leftovers&#34; lasagne with tons of vegetables, basil pesto and mozzarella (the vegetables are mildly overdone).  The sandwiches, including the turkey and brie sandwich with cranberry sauce, are savory and have interesting and complimentary flavors.<br><br>I ALWAYS want to have dessert here because the desserts are beautifully displayed by the entrance.  I may not manage to save enough room for dessert, but I have enjoyed them when I did plan ahead.  The apple galette is light and mildly sweet and the profiteroles have a nice chocolate sauce.  I really like the toffee sauce on the sticky date pudding, though I have found the dates to be a little overwhelming at times.<br><br>I don&#39;t hesitate to come here, except that it gets pricey.  Entrees are in the 20s while desserts hover somewhere in the teens.  Expect to pay up when you&#39;re here, but also expect good food in a lovely setting.",

Even back home in Melbourne there were better options than here.<br><br>Cherry Garden is the one exception. I will admit that I feel as if the standard has dropped a little since I first came here. But it&#39;s still the best dim sum I&#39;ve ever had in Singapore.<br><br>Their dim sum brunch deal is good value for all you can eat. There are a few mis-steps, eg. the skin on the har gau is too thick, the fried tentacles are bland and the hot &amp; sour soup also lacks punch.<br><br>But there are also a lot of hits. The char siu bao is very well executed, the loh bak guo is in the Singapore hawker style rather than the Cantonese dim sum style but tastes excellent, and I highly recommend the wasabi mayo prawns.<br><br>Service is professional and polite and the restaurant is a fairly comfortable one to sit in.",

"reviewcomment":"For full reviews and pictures, visit my blog!<br><br>This time, i had the brunch buffet at 10 at Claymore, a modern bistro grill offering a sumptuous collection of contemporary European cuisine, accentuated with some Pacific Seafood touches. <br><br>Fresh scallops, prawns, Alaskan King Crabs, lobsters and sashimi are available. And i loved the creamy and more substantial Canadian Fanny Bay oysters. <br><br>Can&#39;t say no to the Iberico ham that was the centerpiece display (till i devoured it whole). The cheeses that i love are available as well, and i spotted smoked cheddar and blue cheese too. The Whole Roast Wagyu Bolar Blade has a fine marbling of between 9 to 10 and it was quite juicy despite its dry appearance.  <br><br>There&#39;s quite a variety of Chinese dishes in fact and all are well executed. The Steamed Lotus Rice was fragrant though i wish for it to be more moist. Oh and that Kurobuta Pork should not be missed as well. <br><br>Organic Plates of Pleasure are available in Apr and May. You would be happy to know that you get unlimited servings of these petite plates and every dish was stellar.  <br><br>The Organic Pressed Home-Made Dou Fu was silky on the inside and the golden exterior was really aromatic. The green stuff is actually organic spinach which is compressed together with the toufu. Love the light tasting broth which is slightly sweeted by the Pacific Blue Crab.<br><br>While the Norwegian Wild Salmon in Imperial Bonito-Miso Broth may not have a strong miso taste (i&#39;m comparing it to Nobu&#39;s famed Miso Cod), i appreciated the light touch in flavoring, leaving the fish to speak for itself. The perfectly cooked meat gave way to a moist pink centre which was just of the right texture.<br><br>Our favorite dish was the New Zealand Grass-Fed Beef Tenderloin no doubt. The fork tender medallion had such an amazing texture that i hardly needed to chew on it. Chef Chris explained that the meat is roasted under low temperature (similar to sous vide but in an oven) to break down all the veins typical of grass fed beef. They do it for the lamb rack too. The creamy and starchy Mashed Organic Potato with Truffle was irresistible and Nutty Marmalade Crème was a great complement to the meat.<br><br>The sweet section was quite extensive as well with many cakes, puddings and more. We had the interesting Lemongrass ice cream from New Zealand that day. I quite enjoyed the bread pudding, as well as the petite mango pudding.<br><br>Do not give the crepes a miss. We asked for the extra crispy one with Mao Shan Wang Durian topping and it was out of this world. The puree is the real deal and it&#39;s a convenient way of eating durian really. Damn i&#39;m missing this already.",

I decided on the Oh Crab Lah! on a whole meal wrap which lured me with its Singapore Chili Crab Dressing. Not as spicy as I had hoped for but so flavourful and yummy! The wrap was massive and extremely filling. I didn&#39;t feel like I was eating just lettuce which tends to happen in poorly made Salads &amp; Wraps. They did an excellent job of tossing the ingredients together and making sure there was enough of everything.<br><br>This outlet at Suntec is on the smaller side, and they&#39;ve really packed in as many tables as physically possible.

"reviewcomment":"Inle Myanmar is probably the first time I really have Burmese food. The menu is interesting and there is quite a few dishes I want to try. But the Set Menu for 2 ($34.90) with 1 Side Dish, 2 Main Dishes+ 2 Drinks/Desserts caught my eyes.<br><br>We ended up sharing:<br><br>- Pickled Tea Leaf Salad<br>- Chicken Curry with Butter Flavoured Rice <br>- Seabass with Hot Sour Spicy Sauce - My sister loves this and she practically finished the whole order...<br>- Hpaluda &#34;Rose Scented&#34; Dessert<br>- Sour Plum Juice<br><br>Good value and we got to taste quite a few dishes which all really delicious!<br><br>Service was excellent and homey.",

Since then I have become a fan (especially of their sushi) and one day decided to try their outlet at Dempsey.<br><br>Well,... let&#39;s just say that I still prefer the outlet at Far East.",

"reviewcomment":"Good dimsum and insanely crowded on a weekend - even with reservations you still have to wait for awhile, and their front entrance is clogged with people.<br><br>Still when you do finally make it in, service is pretty prompt, and you can order off the various carts that get wheeled around, or off the menu. Bonus points if you can do it in Cantonese of course, but the service staff can do English decently and are quite friendly. Also, do drink the &#39;Gong Fu Cha&#39; in the tiny little teacups at the start and end of the meal - it&#39;s quite strong but supposed to be good as an appetiser and for digestion.<br><br>What&#39;s good: Deep fried fish skin, Custard buns (liu sha bao), the mixed plate had great BBQ pork (shao rou), duck and char siew. The congee was also very good - silky texture and tasty without being too much - you could walk over to the live station and order the more common congees, but the special flavoured ones had to be ordered.",
