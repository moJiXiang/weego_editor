"reviewcomment":"I was told by one of my coworkers that Sprungli was a must-visit for chocolates when I was visiting Zurich, so I made a point of coming here early on Saturday (don&#39;t come Sundays - they are closed) to have ample time to look around and check out all the chocolates. I brought back quite a bit of it with me to the US, but if I have to say one thing that stands out right off, it&#39;s the simple chocolate squares. A lot of places do these, but I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever tasted the pure quality of the chocolate in these kinds of pieces as I have from Sprungli. The most impressive, perhaps, are the dark chocolate pieces. I&#39;m usually not a fan of darker chocolates, as most places have pieces that are too bitter, too dry, and lacking in depth of flavor. Here, the 65% and 72% Grand Cru pieces are phenomenal - they just melt in your mouth, with all the richness and breadth of flavor that this kind of chocolate is meant to have. I also love the cylindrical cookies (gaufrettes is what the tag claims they are) filled with chocolate; I would probably go through boxes of these a day if I had gotten more of them - the lightness of the cookie, combined with the dense richness of milk chocolate is so freakin&#39; good.<br><br>The truffles and assorted chocolate pieces are also very well-done, with each piece seemingly hand-crafted and made to perfection. Now I understand why people like Swiss chocolates - and I&#39;m not just talking about Godiva, which seems to be mass-marketed as an upscale brand anywhere around the world. Sprungli&#39;s fare is truly delicious, and I&#39;d recommend getting several of their assorted collections of chocolate goodies, particularly if you&#39;re not from the nearby neighborhood.",

"reviewcomment":"Call me unoriginal for giving 5 stars after everyone else has. I don&#39;t always like to copy things. But also call me honest for pointing this out and giving my honest review which is also, 5 stars!<br><br>I have brought different friends here and each time we stopped by, all of them were very happy. You know they are overjoyed when they are already scouring the menu on a full gluttonous stomach and attesting what they will be ordering next. That&#39;s what real foodies do. Talk about eating your next meals while you are eating your current one.<br><br>You have to come here because the owner was so dissatisfied with the faux Mexican restaurants in town that he decided to do Zurich right by opening his own. He certainly got it right!<br><br>For appetizers I would recommend the Super Papitas, but make sure you bring your super appetitas too! It&#39;s fries topped w beans, cheese, sour cream, really fresh guacamole, cilantro and beef. It&#39;s a super size-ish portion and is simply so good that you cannot stop eating this even though your mind is saying - gosh, your main dish is even bigger than this one, slow down! All of your friends will fight each other to eat it all while downing their  Mexican drinks, and then before your main dish comes, you are already feeling a bit regretful as the stomach has reached a &#34;somewhat satisified&#34; feeling already.<br><br>Fret no more. All these emotions are erased when you see your main entree. Whether it&#39;s soft tacos (I&#39;d recommend getting a couple or few to try out), quesadillas or the Platos (I like carne asada, beef); you will manage to eat it because it is incredibly appealing to your culinary pleasures. The meat served here in the tacos is superb because it is marinated. Plus even the chicken is nice to eat because the owner properly chooses dark meat, which is juicer and absorbs marinades much better (the local restaurants tend to use white meat which is drier and more lean). Just go crazy, worry later. There&#39;s plenty of time to sign up for a gastric bypass later anyway. You are not going to find something like this in Zurich everyday (less you come here everyday!). Did I mention the prices??? VERY reasonable!!!<br><br>The last time we came, it was on a Friday and it was PACKED! Comparing to Zurich Swiss restaurant standards of timing, they were average-ish in that sense. But we knew how busy they were. The waiter later sincerely apologized and even comped us margarita classicas to show their appreciation of our patience (which seriously wasn&#39;t too bad, but who turns down free margaritas?). With such great food and an owner/wait staff that appreciates their customers in service and great prices (instead of many Zurich restaurants where the customer is wrong, the server is right for a high price!); you cannot go wrong here. The only wrong is that you are not here yet.<br><br>- Report card:<br>Food: 5 stars<br>Service/owner mgmt &amp; hospitality: 5 stars<br>Location: uber convenient, a few minutes walk from the Bahnhof Alstetten or Tram 2 stop.",

"reviewcomment":"This was a welcome find after wandering around Zurich in the rain. It&#39;s very cute coffee shop although both times we&#39;ve been (both midweek, once around 11am and once around 2:30pm) we&#39;ve gotten the last seats in the entire place. The crowdedness is a little exacerbated by the strollers as well.<br><br>Waffles were unexpected as well as excellent. A little pricey versus back in the US but this is Switzerland, people. <br><br>I would give it 4 stars just because it can be cramped if it weren&#39;t for the first time we went there my 2 year old was getting a little fussy while we starting the &#34;getting ready to go&#34; process (people with children will understand that). One of the waiters nearby saw, grabbed a plate and a squeeze bottle and made this really cute face cartoon out of chocolate on the plate for my little one. She loved it (and proceeded to lick the plate clean) and it struck me as such a nice, out of the way thing for him to do! So 5 stars, super waiter-- you rock!<br><br>Oh, also, dogs are allowed. I beginning to feel like this is common in Switzerland but was a nice little shock for me. If only my dog wasn&#39;t roughly 4,000 miles away.",

Or rather, the middle of Kreis 5. <br><br>There are plenty of tables and benches to relax in, whether you&#39;re watching your kids play in the fountain, enjoying a beer, ice cream, or dinner. <br><br>Boyfriend and I came in the evening and had a bratwurst and grilled chicken with salad. They had three options for salad- chickpea salad with herbs, macaroni, or tabouli. The chicken was delish and the salads were light, healthy, and also delish! <br><br>I love this area, because it&#39;s right by the Viadukt, so you can go shopping before, grab a drink here, and then get dinner at a fancier place, or stay here! The options are endless, and THIS GIRL likes options. You can even wander over to Garold&#39;s Garden, or the Prime tower! Or take a train somewhere else! So much to do. The location is wonderful. <br><br>If the seating is taken up, feel free to lounge in the grass. There&#39;s usually room, and as Sebastien said, watch out for kids kicking balls. :D",

"reviewcomment":"Wait, how the hell did I not review my favourite bar in Zurich?<br><br>I really don&#39;t have a lot of complains with that place. I&#39;ve been here so many times in the past year, so having complaints would actually contradict my own behavior massively. But really, this is a great place for various reasons:<br><br>* Very friendly staff, even under pressure and in the fact of adversity. I&#39;ve seen them deal with unfriendly customers in a way that would make zen monks envious.<br><br>* Great for groups. Call in in advance, reserve a lounge. No questions asked about how much you&#39;re going to consume or anything.<br><br>* Great selection of drinks. Here are some recommendations:<br><br>- Want something classic? Order a Bronx. You can thank me later.<br><br>- Hot summer day? They make a great Pina Colada. However, do NOT order a Strawberry Colada unless what you really want is &#34;Diabetes in a glass&#34;. That stuff is REALLY sweet, the Pina Colada is well-balanced though.<br><br>- Your girlfriend is asking for a sweet drink? Go for the Watermelon Fizz. Ask for a couple of extra cherries, it&#39;s always appreciated.<br><br>- Like Gin? Order a Gin Tonic, but ask for Monkey 47 gin. This whole thing will set you back 18 bucks, but it&#39;s worth it.<br><br>- No time to waste? Go for a Beachcomber&#39;s Zombie (16 CHF), it&#39;s a great, heavy cocktail and ALWAYS better than a Long Island Ice Tea.",

"reviewcomment":"I finally ate dinner here yesterday (Friday), and it was fabulous!  You can make reservations via their online system, but it only showed me the option for 8 pm, and I wanted dinner at 7 pm, so I had to call the restaurant to do that.<br><br>When I arrived, the staff was really friendly and accommodating to my English-only speech skills and even gave me an English menu.  They had a special daily menu that included a veal roast...  with a guy wheeling a cart around that served up the veal roast with mushroom sauce, carrots, and polenta.<br><br>The decor was really nice and the food was beautifully presented and tasted delicious.  I ordered the veggie salad, thinking it was a garden salad, but it was actually a yummy antipasto of cooked veggies, including pumpkin, artichokes, and slices of Parmesan cheese.  <br><br>To try something new, I got the pumpkin strudel as my main dish.  It came in a lovely flaky pastry filled with ricotta cheese, and you could really taste the amaretto in the sauce.  My friend got the meatballs with rosemary gravy and leek mashed potatoes.  I tried one of the meatballs, and it was tender and juicy.<br><br>Prices are typical for Zürich.  Dinner for two, including starters, main dishes, shared bottle of water, and 4 glasses of red wine (French Syrah Cuvée 2008, Château Haut-Blanville, Côteaux du Languedoc) came out to CHF 125.",

But hey, if you are dining at the Ginger, you are not there for the normal sushis, right?<br><br> Ginger is a guarantee for extravagant creations that make your heart beat faster.<br><br> Reservation is key !!!",

"reviewcomment":"Apart from Josef this place is really one of my favourites. <br><br>It is a Moroccan restaurant in Kreiss 5 (close to Riff Raff and Josef). The restaurant is divided in 2 parts, the left part is for reservation and le right part you can just come and try to have a seat.<br><br>If you wanna have a guaranteed table please book ahead (for a friday or saturday you should at least book 3 to 4 days in advance). In summer they also have tables outside in the backyard (and in front of the restaurant as well).<br><br>I like the &#39;mezze royal&#34; It is a big plate with different small dishes. you can share it with 3 - 4 people. It is really delicious, you have to try it for sure. Especially the hummus is really really good !! The restaurants offers a wide range (and good) range of moroccan wine.<br><br>I heart from friends that the brunch on sunday is very good. Unfortunately I never tried it. <br><br>I am a big fan of this place. The downside: the waiters have this hipster-unfriendly attitude.",

We were a bit intimidated by the intense cheese smell of the place at first but our fondue wasn&#39;t strong tasting at all. We also shared a salad, the dressing was a nice mustard balsamic. We had the pickles and onions and dipped them in the fondue, that&#39;s what the fondue experts seemed to be doing. Our server scrapped the cheese off of the bottom for us. Expert tip: turn the fondue off when you are at the bottom, the couple beside us didn&#39;t do that and had to scrape endlessly to get the crunchy cheese.<br><br>We went on a Sunday night and luckily we called for a reservation first -- they had to turn away a few people at 5:30pm. Probably a good idea to get a reservation on a weeknight too.<br><br>The service is attentive, fast, and friendly and everyone speaks excellent English. People also eat fast here, lots of fondue experts and hard core eaters -- we saw a couple polish off a fondue in half an hour! That said, they don&#39;t rush you.<br><br>It was a highlight of our trip and it&#39;s easily accessible from the old town.",

"reviewcomment":"My husband and I had to be in Zuerich for Christmas this year due to his work schedule and since we were away from all our family we decided to treat ourselves to a night out.  The Zunfthaus was one of the only places open for Christmas Eve and we made a reservation for dinner.  They saved us the corner table upstairs as requested and the service was beyond amazing.  The young ladies working there were so attentive and nice.  And I could understand their Swiss German!<br><br>The food and wine were equally impressive.  We chose the 3 course menu for 99- francs per person which turned out to be a decent deal considering Zuerich.  We started with a surprise appetizer of roast beef and peppers paired with a sauvignon blanc and then moved on to the lobster bisque.  It was foamy and a little thinner than I am used to, but very good. The all you can eat bread kept coming (you can dip it with the olive oil and salted coal if that&#39;s your thing)  and before the main course we decided on the Italian Chianti and the sugested Rossi red.  The beef filet was prepared perfectly medium and was accompanied by crisp fresh veggies, truffles, and a port wine sauce.  I could have done without the over salted potato noodles, but I think it was bad luck.  My husband&#39;s were fine.  For dessert was a plum compote topped with cinamon whipped cream.  <br><br>We thoroughly enjoyed our intimate Christmas Eve dinner and would love to go back again and try the outdoor fondue experience.",

Whether lobster in an orange, hot tuna sashimi, ....<br><br> The sushi cooks are situated in the middle of the restaurant, and are preparing the exceptional dishes right in front of your eyes.<br><br> The normal makis are manufactured at Shinsen (close to Sihlcity) and delivered to the Ginger. But hey, if you are dining at the Ginger, you are not there for the normal sushis, right?<br><br> Ginger is a guarantee for extravagant creations that make your heart beat faster.<br><br> Reservation is key !!!",

"reviewcomment":"Oh my gosh. I came here for my last meal in Zurich and man was it a good choice. Thanks to Simon... wooop. We had reservations for the buffet and you can either choose to weigh a first plate or just take the all you can eat for 28CHF. That is an amazing deal for the food that they have! I don&#39;t remember the exact names of the dishes but I&#39;ll do my best. <br><br>The soup was fantastic and was different from any type of soup I&#39;ve had before. It was at first quite sour but then creamy and amazing. Wow, I&#39;d love to have another cup of that. <br>The next several dishes were all different, with wonderful textures, temperatures, and spices. I really enjoyed this ground (beef?) that had an insane amount of flavor and was actually cold. I had seconds. <br>Then there was a chicken curry which was equally delicious. Creamy and bold but not too spicy. The chicken was cooked wonderfully and it was juicy as can be. <br>There was also a fish dish which I didn&#39;t even notice was fish. I thought it was chicken... which I think is usually a good thing with fish. Not too many people like really REALLY fishy tasting fish. But anyway, it was soft and mild and melted in my mouth. <br>They also had a spicy tofu dish. Just the right amount of spice but not enough to overpower the entire meal. And the tofu was tasty too!<br>Last came a nice vegetable dish. Just a bunch of wonderfully marinated vegetables to add a nice variety to the buffet without stuffing everyone over the edge. <br><br>The place was pretty packed during lunch hour, so I&#39;d recommend a reservation. It took us a little time to find the location because it&#39;s cozied into the side streets of downtown Zurich, but you&#39;ll have fun searching because everything is so cute and pretty. I can&#39;t wait to come back here again... it was truly delicious. <br><br>Ich liebe Thai Essen! Und ich liebe Ban Song Thai. Das Essen ist wirchlich toll. Ein Fruend und ich hatten den Buffet und es hat viel viel essen. Alles Essen sind lecker und fantastich. Die Kellner war nett und wir haben ein sehr gut Zeit. Ich mochte Ban Song Thai JETZT!",

"reviewcomment":"Decent place in the heart of the Old Town which feels like a typical wine hall (reminds me of the ones in Paris) to grab a nice Spanish house wine/Sangria with an assortment of tapas. Great place to come with a few friends when you want to snack but not indulge in a gluttonous pig fest. Our intestines were still suffering from the overdose of cheesy sticky spicy Korean food from the night before, so this place hit the spot.<br><br>Don&#39;t order the tapas from the tourist menu - typically this is a really big brown covered menu book which does not list the tapas for CHF 5-6/plate. When in doubt just ask and speaking in Spanish is a bonus (mira mira, Hablo Español!). Of course with my Asian-ish look here in Zurich, they gave me the big old tourist menu and the mixed group of us just laughed it off. I&#39;m not even sure if they have a real tapas menu (listing items of CHF 5-6/plate) so just ask to look or tell you what they have.<br><br>Tapas come with sliced bread and are all pretty decent, but I take liking to the chorizo and pulpo (they don&#39;t always have it though).<br><br>***My biggest pet peeve is this place is ALWAYS VERY WARM, in the winter and in the summer. I love being exposed to colder temperatures, so I&#39;m not a huge fan of staying here too long when I am here.***",

"reviewcomment":"Have been back several times now and still nothing short of a 5-star venue.<br><br>My last time back was with a reservation for two at 9pm on the Friday before Christmas break. Despite our reservation, we actually had to wait about 15-20 minutes before our table was ready, but it was understandable given just how busy it was. During our wait at least 4 - 5 groups of 2 - 4 people were being turned away because they had no reservation. It also helped our moods that the waiter brought over beers for us while we wait that we weren&#39;t billed for. Atmosphere was great again, a bit on the louder side, but conversation was still very well possible.<br>Burgers were once more delicious. They are sticking to only giving out limited amounts of the BBQ / Ketchup / Thousand Island sauces (all homemade) that come with the burgers, but they were happy to refill them on request. Meat has been nothing short of phenomenal each time and just overall a great burger, not to mention the fries that were great each time!<br><br>Looking forward to many more visits in 2014..",

"reviewcomment":"Very trendy, very &#34;in&#34;  some like it, some find it too pretentious and over-priced. It has a Michelin star and 18 Gault Millau points, placing it at the top of Zurich&#39;s culinary landscape. We were surprised by the youthful, relaxed service we received.<br><br> There is only one menu on offer. Seven (it&#39;s actually more like thirteen!) courses cost you CHF 220.-. All courses were very modern, showing incredible precision and perfect preparation of all ingredients.<br><br> The desserts were very good. You&#39;ve got to ask for more desserts, since their menu only has one dessert. If you ask, then the menu suddenly has three desserts. Chef de cuisine Marcus Lindner isn&#39;t just a culinary artists, but a lover of good desserts. He bombards you with friandises after the meal, including home-made macarons (filled with a Felchlin Grand Cru ganache, yummy!), marshmallows, chestnut gugelhopf, vanilla caramels and much more.<br><br> The real genius of his cuisine is that you&#39;re not feeling like an over-stuffed Christmas turkey after eating more than twelve courses. After having your senses pleasurably overwhelmed for four hours or more due to Marcus Lindner overload, the money seems well spent.<br><br> For a detailed German photo report, please visit:<br><a href='/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fdessertblog.ch%2F2010%2F11%2Frestaurant-mesa-in-zuerich%2F&amp;s=45bfb4ef07282129f178e1de1c9e2051deaf3d8b63340c0b25fe0b18cb7344bd' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>dessertblog.ch/2010/11/r…</a>",

"reviewcomment":"My boyfriend and I ordered take-away here. For 19.50 chf we got a large amount of Red Curry with chicken and a slightly smaller portion of rice. We walked in, ordered, and it was ready within a few minutes. <br><br>The Red Curry was absolutely delicious, and I would definitely come back for more. It was kinda spicy, creamy and rich. It went wonderfully with the rice. <br><br>The interior is very modern and beautiful, and even the menu at the front is really nice. <br><br>I&#39;d probably prefer to order take-away every time, just because it&#39;s fast, you can eat where you want, and it&#39;s cheaper. <br><br>For 19.50 it&#39;s definitely worth it, at least for the red curry. It was enough and probably the best Red Curry I&#39;ve tasted in a long time.",

"reviewcomment":"I love this place -- one of the best dining experiences I&#39;ve had in Switzerland.  I first came here for a work dinner in the summer, and loved the surroundings.  The garden is a beautiful place in which to sit outside and have a drink.  The building itself has a traditional charm, and is very elegant.  My second time back the weather was not as nice, but it felt warm and welcoming in the restaurant.<br><br>Everything I&#39;ve eaten here is fantastic.  On both occasions I ordered deer, and it is so so good.  Just a perfect cut of meat prepared perfectly -- juicy, tender, flavorful... perfection.  I&#39;m also a huge fan of Zürcher Geschnetzeltes mit Rösti, so couldn&#39;t help by try a bit from the others at my table.  Here you&#39;ll find a very good representation, and for sheer quantity is hard to beat (there&#39;s a round 2 after you&#39;re done with the initial serving -- my fellow diners were shocked at home much more they gave).<br><br>The dessert selections are fantastic; there&#39;s a trolley with many choices and you&#39;re able to sample half portions if you want some variety but are sated after the main course.  It&#39;s a nice presentation and memorable way to end the evening.<br><br>Service at the restaurant is fantastic.  As the restaurant is affiliated with a hospitality school, the servers are all very friendly and professional.  If only all restaurant staff could be trained here!<br><br>For a city as expensive as Zürich, the prices at Belvoirpark are quite reasonable.  The quality, quantity, and price are hard to match anywhere else in the city.  I can&#39;t wait to go back.",

"reviewcomment":"I can&#39;t resist Greek food, and when I saw the reviews for this place I had to give it a try.  First of all, the name is a bit misleading, it is not a typical tavern, it is a very nice establishment to eat in.  I loved the white washed stone walls, and what they have done to incorporate touches to brighten the space up, and give a hint of this space being located on a Greek island vs. Zurich.  The service was truly friendly and caring.  The Greek owner was also helping to serve and speak with people.  I was having a hard time with the menu, and even though the place was busy, the server  was very patient and took the time to walk me through the choices and provide some recommendations in English.  I ended up ordering some Keftedes (Greek meatballs), and a small Greek salad with some Tzatziki, and Greek house red wine.  Everything was amazing.  The Tzatziki was thick and creamy like it is supposed to be.  The feta cheese in the salad was spot on.  And the house Greek bread that came with the meal was good.  The prices add up, but are typical for a nice restaurant in Zurich.  Overall a fantastic meal, and I loved the Greek music they had playing on the speakers in the background.",

"reviewcomment":"I really feel the need to update my review for Don Weber, even if I won&#39;t change its full 5 stars rating.<br>We went there on a Saturday evening 8pm, genuinely hoping to get seats. Of course it didn&#39;t work, as they were almost full and there were many reservations pending. Instead, we were invited to sit at the bar and wait for free tables.<br>The service was well intended, but there were only 3 people for the entire place, including the bar, which made the service messy. After waiting for half an hour, we were finally seated. It was a bit frustrating I agree, but the lively atmosphere made us get over it quite quickly.<br><br>We then ordered the food and drinks. Drinks arrived quickly, but food took veery long. Then, after 45 minutes of waiting, they offered us a shot from the house, to apologize for the long wait. We found this to be a very nice gesture.<br><br>Food came soon after. I found bit weird that my quesadilla was with chorizo rather than chicken (as I had ordered), but I didn&#39;t complain as it was actually very tasty. Then, after we were finished with our meal, they came with a second serving... another quesadilla for me (chicken this time) and burger with fries for my boyfriend. We were really puzzled. They told us that&#39;s from the house as well, still apologizing for their delay in bringing us the food. My boyfriend was really full from his burger, so didn&#39;t have the second serving. Nevertheless, we got the chicken quesadilla, which we actually found to be not as good as the chorizo one. However, I wouldn&#39;t have ordered that by myself, so I am happy that it all happened this way.<br><br>I was particularly impressed with their way of apologizing. I enjoy the place, the food, the people.. Will for sure go back!",

"reviewcomment":"This restaurant isn&#39;t for everybody. There&#39;s virtually no light in the dining area. Eating in absolute darkness can be intimidating for some, for the others, it is a unique experience. Most of the staff is visually impaired. Your waiter will show you to your table and then the fun begins. I wouldn&#39;t recommend to take small children to this restaurant, as the darkness can be quite scary. I also wouldn&#39;t go there in a party greater than four or six people. Communication in the dark can be hard, if there are too many voices to listen to. And always ask the waiter to guide you, when you want to leave the room. Finding the way to the bathroom is an almost impossible task for the visually oriented. The food is quite good but also slightly more expensive than in normal restaurants. But after all, you&#39;re also paying for the experience. If you&#39;re up for an adventure, I&#39;d definitely recommend a trip to the Blindekuh.",

Be prepared to share your table with many other people though as they cram too many people on the quite small tables in my opinion. Service can be a bit chaotic too but not surprisingly as they are usually dealing with so many people at once..",

"reviewcomment":"One look at this building, and I was in love.  I&#39;m a sucker for old buildings.  If you tell me it&#39;s full of delicious gourmet food, well, just try to keep me away!<br><br>I visited Zunfthaus zur Waag as part of a large group I work with.  The restaurant sits in a building that dates from 1636, in the Münsterhof square in the old part of Zurich.  Sitting outside on the patio, I sipped wine while watching Zurichers walk home from a day at work.  It was a relaxing way to end a day spent in meetings!<br><br>When it was time for dinner, our group headed inside.  We were seated in the Zunft-Stube banquet room, where hundreds of glass coat of arms discs hang in the windows.  Like a dork, I spent a good amount of time looking for my Swiss and German family names among the coats of arms.<br><br>After the food was brought out, I left genealogy in the dust.  I had to focus 100% on this awesome food.  The starter was a salmon carpaccio with a nicely balanced tabbouleh, and wine.   That was followed by a tender and flavorful beef Stroganoff with spaetzle... and thus began my love affair with spaetzle!  Also, more wine.  Finally, a parfait of rhubarb and strawberries, which is one of my favorite flavor combinations.  In typical Swiss style, this was paired with that amazing strong espresso with a perfect crema that is so ubiquitous in Switzerland but so hard to find in the states.  <br><br>Though this was a work function and I didn&#39;t pick the restaurant, if going back to Zurich, I would definitely visit this place again.",

At oberer Letten on the right side (with your back towards the city).<br><br>This side is the more cool side of the Oberer Letten. The bar has two levels: the ground floor and on the rooftop of the containers. <br><br>You can also eat some thing here. Especially burgers. I love the chicken burger. It is really very tastfull. <br><br>The place is really nice, the bar and restaurant are in containers (Frau Gerold Garten Style).<br><br>And as of september you can have a cheese fondue here. It is nice to eat fondue at the limmat, but not the best one :)",

"reviewcomment":"One of my favourites in Niederdorf !<br><br>It is at the Zähringer place at the corner. It is very nice down to earth coffee place. It is actually one of the few places in Zurich where you don&#39;t feel that you have to belong to social group to go to. The place feels like a living room where everybody can come and read, play board games, just chat, or enjoy a nice beer. <br><br>The owner (an old Hippie) is a very nice guy. He likes to chat with people. You really have to talk to him. And he is very funny as well. The crowd is really mixed. You might find a lot of erasmus students or foreigners. <br><br>The desserts are good, but not especially good. <br><br>I have to admit that I am a bit torn. I had a burger the last time and it was 28 Sfr. What is not very cheap (and doesn&#39;t fit the social democratic ambiance of this place). And the burger was really not good. The bun (claimed to be homemade) was way to dry, the meat was overcooked and not juicy at all. And the potatoes were eatable, but still a dissapointement when you only get 7 sliced pieces on your plate. They added a asparagus on the plate, but again not well cooked...<br><br>Even with the very bad food I give it a 4 star because the place is really nice to hang out. I will go again and try again the food. Maybe later I will give a 5 star :)",

"reviewcomment":"I&#39;m from NYC so naturally I took it for granted that good inexpensive sushi is almost around every corner like dry cleaners. When I moved to Zurich two and a half months ago, I came face to face with the cold harsh reality that good sushi is not only hard to come by, but also very pricey. <br><br>I read some reviews about Yooji&#39;s and decided to give it a try (after holding out for nearly two months of no sushi). Since people say that the inside conveyor belt sushi is less than desirable, my husband and I opted to sit outside on a nice evening. The wait was a bit long, which was expected on a Friday evening. There was only one waiter servicing all the tables outside and the table next to us has 10+ ppl. I was slightly irritated that we sat at our table for 15 mins before the waiter came by only to realize that we never got menus. So another 20 mins elapsed after we decided on our orders and filled out the order forms when the waiter came back to collect it. But like I said, he was the only one covering the outdoor seating section so we didn&#39;t mind so much. <br><br>Eventually our orders came all together, the appetizer and the entrees. Wish we got our edamame first but we were pretty hungry by then so the more the merrier. I ordered 3 pieces of spicy shrimp and three pieces of rainbow inside out roll, a salmon chirashi, and a piece of kingfish nigiri. The fish were fresh and up to par, the salmon chirashi was especially delish. The spicy shrimp roll was a bit on the drier side but I juiced it up with the yummy and super potent wasabi. I was satisfied with my entire order. Ok, I went in with not so high expectation so as not to be disappointed. My husband was also happy with his chicken teriyaki bento (he&#39;s Swiss, not too adventurous on the food front).<br><br>I don&#39;t usually give 4*s easily but the waiter recommended a nice sake for me after asking what my preference is, which brings up my rating from 3.5* to a 4* :) <br><br>The bill for the whole meal was well under a hundred CHF with apps and drinks which was quite acceptable (considering where we are). I&#39;ll definitely be hitting up Yooji&#39;s again next time I need to come up for some (sushi) air.",

"reviewcomment":"One look at this building, and I was in love.  I&#39;m a sucker for old buildings.  If you tell me it&#39;s full of delicious gourmet food, well, just try to keep me away!<br><br>I visited Zunfthaus zur Waag as part of a large group I work with.  The restaurant sits in a building that dates from 1636, in the Münsterhof square in the old part of Zurich.  Sitting outside on the patio, I sipped wine while watching Zurichers walk home from a day at work.  It was a relaxing way to end a day spent in meetings!<br><br>When it was time for dinner, our group headed inside.  We were seated in the Zunft-Stube banquet room, where hundreds of glass coat of arms discs hang in the windows.  Like a dork, I spent a good amount of time looking for my Swiss and German family names among the coats of arms.<br><br>After the food was brought out, I left genealogy in the dust.  I had to focus 100% on this awesome food.  The starter was a salmon carpaccio with a nicely balanced tabbouleh, and wine.   That was followed by a tender and flavorful beef Stroganoff with spaetzle... and thus began my love affair with spaetzle!  Also, more wine.  Finally, a parfait of rhubarb and strawberries, which is one of my favorite flavor combinations.  In typical Swiss style, this was paired with that amazing strong espresso with a perfect crema that is so ubiquitous in Switzerland but so hard to find in the states.  <br><br>Though this was a work function and I didn&#39;t pick the restaurant, if going back to Zurich, I would definitely visit this place again.",

"reviewcomment":"Stopped in on a cold, wet night, and did very well with some hot food and a small shared table.<br><br>The vegi Masala Thosai (dosa) is excellent, and well-filled; I dug it immensely.  The vegi Paneer was good, but didn&#39;t grab me as much.  Each plate came with a variety of small sides --- some eggplant, some lentils, etc.<br><br>The most entertaining thing about the sides was that they had such distinct flavors --- I&#39;ve been some places where everything on the plate tastes the same, and that wasn&#39;t the case here.<br><br>We had a hankering for some raita; they were out, but were happy to provide some plain yoghurt.<br><br>Drink-wise, both the hot chai and lassi were good; if forced to choose, I&#39;d probably go with the lassi.<br><br>The chocolate cake was a win --- not the gulab jamun I&#39;d had in mind, but one of the better chocolate tortes I&#39;ve had in Zürich.  Rich, with a chocolate crumb crust --- a nice finish.",

"reviewcomment":"Burger Tour. A new Hope. <br><br>Wohl eine der klassischsten Locations, wunderbar gelegen im Herzen von Züri. Das letzte Mal war ich vor 20 Jahren hier, darum fiel mir die Aussenterrasse sofort auf. Sehr schön gemacht, gute Aufwertung des Lokals. Die Sitzbänke sind aber nach 2-3 Stunden etwas unbequem.<br><br>Das James Joyce lobt sich, den besten Burger der Stadt zu bieten. Den normalen Hausburger (Beef und Schwein gemischt) gibt es &#39;komplett&#39; mit Spiegelei, Käse und Röstzwiebeln. Ich entschied mich für den Saison-Burger, Kalbfleisch-Patty mit Eierschwämmli. Wie cool ist das denn?<br><br>Unsere Teller wurden schnell gebracht, alles duftete wunderbar und war ansprechend präsentiert. Mein Burger war dicht mit dampfenden Pilzen belegt, Hammer. Das ganze zu essen war etwas schwierig weil das Patty zu dick ist. Etwas weniger hoch und dafür mehr in die Breite wäre praktischer. Für das zarte Kalbfleisch hätte die Gewürzmischung etwas dezenter sein können, die Kräuter waren zu dominant. In dem Punkt war das normale Patty besser abgestimmt.<br>Was beim Fleisch wirklich gut ist (saftig) führt aber zu einer Katastrophe beim Unterteil des Brötchens, dieses ist nach kurzer Zeit soggy as hell. Ansonsten ist das Brötchen ein normales 0815-Modell, nothing to write home about.<br><br>Was ob den ganzen eigenen Geschmäckern nicht vermisst wurde, aber im Vergleich mit anderen Etablissements doch fehlte war eine Sauce. Im Burger würde eine würzige Sauce vielleicht stören, aber wenigstens zu den Fries hätte ich mehr erwartet als Mayo (kein Thomy?) und Ketchup (kein Heinz?)<br>Ahja, Fries. Dünn genug, ideale Länge, schön kross. Und das auch noch nach einer Viertelstunde, genial!<br><br>Alles in allem ein positives Erlebnis, auch die Bedienung war sehr freundlich und aufmerksam.<br>Für den REALLY best Burger braucht&#39;s meiner Meinung nach noch ein wenig Schliff, aber das James Joyce tschuutet sicher ganz vorne mit!",

It&#39;s such a wonderful hidden gem in the midst of Zurich old town. 1:0 ZH vs. NYC.<br>They have a rather small menu but it is due to the freshness and seasonality of the products.<br>You can truely taste that the vegetables, fruits and animals had a happy life before they got to make you happy.<br>I am mostly here in summer because of the garden, especially the area with the pergola and the big sunshades is very special to me. But I also went here in colder seasons, too. The inside is classier than the outside seating but still no starch alarm. I remember one dish I had in a colder season: spined loach (adorable fish) on lentils. It was outstanding!<br>The staff is relaxed and friendly.",

"reviewcomment":"My friend recommended this bar for a nice view of Zurich from the top of the Prime Tower.  It was quite crowded when we went on a Friday night, but there was a lot of turnover, so we got a place to sit after we ordered at the bar.<br><br>Despite the jokes about the Prime Tower being the tallest building in Switzerland (which pales in comparison to skyscrapers in L.A. or any other major city), the view IS quite pretty, especially overlooking the train tracks at night.  The view from the 35th floor is nothing to scoff at.  ;)<br><br>The drinks menu is quite extensive and almost overwhelming to look at.  The drinks are kind of pricey, too.  I got the Huckelberry Finn (Raspberry infused rum, blackberries, cranberry juice, lime juice, chestnut syrup), and my friend got the Georgia Mint Julep (Cognac, apricot liqueur, mint, sugar syrup, angostura bitter).  Each drink cost CHF 19.<br><br>I really liked my drink.  Sweet and fruity, it came in a huge glass topped with 3 luscious blackberries.<br><br>The servers were really nice and attentive, and they gave us complimentary spiced mixed nuts with the drinks.",

"reviewcomment":"I went there for a business lunch, I took one of their daily menus, they have many ranging from 22 to around 50 CHF though I did not look that much to the high prices. <br><br>I chose the second one, for 27 CHF, which did not include meet. It included a salad or a soup plus a main dish, which turned out to be spinach cannelloni with tomato sauce (I say, &#34;turned out&#34; because my German is still basic and the daily menu is only in German and Italian).<br><br>I chose the salad which was a small Insalata Caprese (would be less fancy to say tomatoes with mozzarella, right?), with a light dressing. You will of course find Italian balsamic vinegar and olive oil at your table, so it&#39;s not an issue to arrange the dressing to your liking. Onward to the cannelloni, portions are sufficient (you will get around 3-4) and you get plenty of sauce. The cannelloni are well cooked and tasty, same goes for the sauce and the parmigiano.<br><br>Regarding the overall appraisal of the place, the atmosphere is classy and the chairs are comfortable. Staff is friendly though not that much responsive which might have been cause by the amount of people present in the restaurant. It also led to a quite high noise level (acoustics do not seem to have been part of the construction design).<br><br>Overall, I would still give it a five due the decent service and price for the location.",

"reviewcomment":"I&#39;m only guilty of not ordering a larger portion of tasty soup.  I had the standard Dal soup with a smattering of cilantro as garnish. A tasty roll was also included.  The soup was flavorful, piping hot, and went down a treat with the bread roll.  After perusing their website, it would seem that NG is a part of the &#39;locavore&#39; movement, using, when possible, locally sourced ingredients.  Also nice, the service is friendly and prompt.    <br><br>One of the most interesting things about NG would be that they have three restos in ZH and one in Brazil!  Por que?  I aim to find out on my next trip to Not Guilty.<br><br>Note: the soup sizes don&#39;t read &#39;small&#39; and &#39;large&#39; on the menu board.  I forget what the cutesy language is...something like &#39;good day&#39; for a small soup and for a larger soup it&#39;s something equally silly.  Don&#39;t be discouraged as I was for a fraction of a second when trying to absorb the menu.  There are only two sizes: good and gooder. ;)",

"reviewcomment":"DISCLAIMER **** I visited La Scala twice and had quite different experiences. I would  rank the first one with 2.5 and the second one with 5. So I decided to rank it with a 4 overall, as the second visit convinced me to continue going there*****<br><br>First time I went there was for the birthday of a friend.. we wanted to take him out and treat him in a nice place and we chose Pizzeria Scala. We had reserved a table for 5 people, but we ended up being only 4. So, they basically fit 2 other people at the same table with us, as the place was crowded. We found this to be very rude. The waiter spoke no English and was completely unfriendly. We asked him to give us few more minutes for the order and he seemed so pissed about this that he ignored us for the next 15 minutes. Even when we spoke to him in German, he was constantly bored and even giving us wrong indications! <br>The food however was very good (I had a pizza Parma and my friends all got pastas). Especially the home made pastas are very good.<br>We decided to leave this place and try the deserts somewhere else, as the service was really bothering us. Too bad...<br><br>Even if I didn&#39;t plan to come back for the second time, I was in the area and it was around 10pm on a weekday. Both my boyfriend and I were hungry, so we tried La Scala again. This time, a lady waitress served us. She was extremely nice. Made us recommendations from the menu and was giving her best to find something which we really like. I got the pasta with gorgonzola sauce, which I found to be quite good. I think my boyfriend got the carbonara and he was super happy with it. The restaurant was intimate, few people and the atmosphere was complete opposite from the first time I went there.. We had a great time!<br><br>Moral of the story: even if you have the staff, but love the food.. give it another try! come back, maybe not all the waitress are rude! :)",

"reviewcomment":"The food here is really REALLY good. <br>The service here is really REALLY good.<br>The price here can get pretty darn HIGH. <br><br>So, now that you know that, I shall explain the wonderful culinary adventure I was taken on during my time here. <br><br>My boyfriends Aunt and Uncle took me here for an early dinner. We started with the TAO&#39;s Journey (32chf). It included 3 spoonfulls of sashimi (not sure what type of fish) glazed with some oil and peppers. I ate all three because they&#39;re not fans of raw fish- lucky me! It also included three servings of beef tar tar atop a toasted baguette, 3 sauteed chicken skewers, 3 tomato and mozzarella skewers, 3 spring rolls, and 3 meatballs. The bites were small, but absolutely delicious. <br><br>After 2 glasses of prosecco and sharing that, I didn&#39;t want too much for an entree, so I decided on the TAO&#39;s Chicken salad- small portion (25chf). It said the salad was topped with fried chicken, so I was expecting fried chicken slices. Instead the entire breast was fried first and then cut into pieces. I really loved this because it left a slight crunch on the chicken, but didn&#39;t overpower it with having every side breaded. The dressing was delicious, and the outside of the chicken was still crispy but inside was juicy. Underneath was a cooked egg.  It was an amazing salad. <br><br>Somtimes I&#39;m bothered when restaurants charge so much for a small amount of food, and you see this often in Zurich, but what I ate here was delicious, unique, and well worth the money. <br><br>I was also able to try the Vegetable tagliolini with beef stripes- (38 chf) on a red curry sauce. It was delicious as well, but sometimes it&#39;s hard to pay 38chf.",

Apparently &#34;All the mums will want to bring their push chairs in&#34; if the let us. Wouldn&#39;t make the effort to go back either as everything looked covered in icing and to fancy pants.",

"reviewcomment":"I&#39;ve been here two times both due to the good reviews and the central location. I&#39;m speaking about the central location because, as you know, I usually lack time so I try to meet people close to their destination, often the main station.<br><br>I&#39;ve tried two types of beverage so far here, some kind of coffee of which I don&#39;t remember the name due to the fact that I don&#39;t drink much coffee. But it was good and served with a glass of water (5,- CHF) always handy when you don&#39;t get much to drink the rest of the day. Was fine but once again I&#39;m not pro.<br>I&#39;ve also tested their Earl Grey tea (I&#39;m more into that kind of things). Was pretty cool for an acceptable price in Zurich (4,5 CHF).<br><br>The place is quite clean and got good chairs/ tables. If you go for the high one you can conveniently drop your coat/other stuff one the small wall close to the tables. Careful however, there is not much room between tables, so try to pick a seat quick on those. Alternatively there are se couches that seemed cool as well.<br><br>Staff is friendly and efficient. They won&#39;t bother you but might ask if you need something else from time to time which is absolutely fine.",

"reviewcomment":"One of my favourites in Niederdorf !<br><br>It is at the Zähringer place at the corner. It is very nice down to earth coffee place. It is actually one of the few places in Zurich where you don&#39;t feel that you have to belong to social group to go to. The place feels like a living room where everybody can come and read, play board games, just chat, or enjoy a nice beer. <br><br>The owner (an old Hippie) is a very nice guy. He likes to chat with people. You really have to talk to him. And he is very funny as well. The crowd is really mixed. You might find a lot of erasmus students or foreigners. <br><br>The desserts are good, but not especially good. <br><br>I have to admit that I am a bit torn. I had a burger the last time and it was 28 Sfr. What is not very cheap (and doesn&#39;t fit the social democratic ambiance of this place). And the burger was really not good. The bun (claimed to be homemade) was way to dry, the meat was overcooked and not juicy at all. And the potatoes were eatable, but still a dissapointement when you only get 7 sliced pieces on your plate. They added a asparagus on the plate, but again not well cooked...<br><br>Even with the very bad food I give it a 4 star because the place is really nice to hang out. I will go again and try again the food. Maybe later I will give a 5 star :)",

"reviewcomment":"Ok, so a Swiss guy took me here, or else I never would have even heard of this place.  It was autumn, so I ordered off the seasonal menu.  Well, he helped me order off the seasonal menu.  Whatever it was that I ate, it was delicious.  I think it may have been some game hen or something like that.  And the wine was delicious, too.  <br><br>I know this review isn&#39;t very helpful because I have no idea what I ate, but I was on a date, and I didn&#39;t want to look like a lame-o by asking what everything was and taking too many photos.  I did manage to take 2 photos of the desserts, citing how pretty they were.  ;)  One was some sort of frozen chocolate mousse, and the other was Oepfelchüechli gebacken mit lauwarmer Vanillesauce (Apple beignets with luke-warm vanilla sauce), which he told me was quite traditional.  <br><br>I LOVED the place with its rustic wood decor and homey artifacts adorning all the nooks and crannies.  According to their website (if Google Translate serves me right), this traditional hangout of the writer Gottfried Keller is the oldest preserved tavern in Zürich.  A big two thumbs up from me for great food and ambiance.",

"reviewcomment":"So, I stumbled upon El Maiz as I was walking through the neighborhood looking for something else. Luckily, I&#39;d previously read about the store here on Yelp. So, when I was done doing my other errand, I popped in and was pleasantly surprised. <br><br>I was immediately greeted warmly and asked if I needed any help. I told them that I&#39;d just like to look around. The shop is split into the grocery side and the gift/decor side. I happened to be much more interested in the grocery side. It&#39;s small but it has a lot... a lot more than I&#39;d found anywhere in Europe in the almost 9 years I&#39;ve been here. Tomatillos (almost impossible to find in my searches)... fresh and canned, some good quality tequilas, hand/homemade goodies of all sorts. I bought some chips and tamales and I&#39;m really looking forward to trying them. <br><br>My wife is jealous that I got to go but she didn&#39;t... therefore, I know that we&#39;ll be back soon.",

"reviewcomment":"One of two of Zurich&#39;s specialist chocolate boutiques. This boutique has a very large selection, ranging from brands like Zotter, Valrhona and Beschle as well as products from Claudio Corallo and Enrico Rovira. I love the Valrhona tasting set, a wonderful present. Zotter&#39;s drinking chocolate is wonderful (white chocolate and vanilla being my favourite). If you can&#39;t wait until you get home, then Mrs. Gössler will serve you what is perhaps Zurich&#39;s best hot chocolate (a giant portion with a shortbread biscuit for 8.10 Swiss francs).<br><br> The service is excellent, the owner being especially well informed.<br><br> The interior design (built from boat parts, would you believe!?) is as unusual as it is original.<br><br> For more photo reports, interviews and restaurant reviews, please visit:<br><a href='/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dessertblog.ch&amp;s=cdb100d5088844f81db4ab91c09e5c47ae310e9435ad1c58f1da925695d8900e' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>dessertblog.ch</a>",

"reviewcomment":"The food here is really REALLY good. <br>The service here is really REALLY good.<br>The price here can get pretty darn HIGH. <br><br>So, now that you know that, I shall explain the wonderful culinary adventure I was taken on during my time here. <br><br>My boyfriends Aunt and Uncle took me here for an early dinner. We started with the TAO&#39;s Journey (32chf). It included 3 spoonfulls of sashimi (not sure what type of fish) glazed with some oil and peppers. I ate all three because they&#39;re not fans of raw fish- lucky me! It also included three servings of beef tar tar atop a toasted baguette, 3 sauteed chicken skewers, 3 tomato and mozzarella skewers, 3 spring rolls, and 3 meatballs. The bites were small, but absolutely delicious. <br><br>After 2 glasses of prosecco and sharing that, I didn&#39;t want too much for an entree, so I decided on the TAO&#39;s Chicken salad- small portion (25chf). It said the salad was topped with fried chicken, so I was expecting fried chicken slices. Instead the entire breast was fried first and then cut into pieces. I really loved this because it left a slight crunch on the chicken, but didn&#39;t overpower it with having every side breaded. The dressing was delicious, and the outside of the chicken was still crispy but inside was juicy. Underneath was a cooked egg.  It was an amazing salad. <br><br>Somtimes I&#39;m bothered when restaurants charge so much for a small amount of food, and you see this often in Zurich, but what I ate here was delicious, unique, and well worth the money. <br><br>I was also able to try the Vegetable tagliolini with beef stripes- (38 chf) on a red curry sauce. It was delicious as well, but sometimes it&#39;s hard to pay 38chf.",

The restaurant &#39;s decor is a nice mix of modern and old industrial building. In the restaurant they offer a good range of various dishes and the wine card is also quite good. In the boutique section you can find a large selection of wine, schnapps and liquor. They even have some sweets as well, like fantastic salty caramel, special cookie etc... For take away people have the choice of a variety of salads, sandwiches and drinks. Basically they have what&#39;s needed for nice snack!",

So, when I was done doing my other errand, I popped in and was pleasantly surprised. <br><br>I was immediately greeted warmly and asked if I needed any help. I told them that I&#39;d just like to look around. The shop is split into the grocery side and the gift/decor side. I happened to be much more interested in the grocery side. It&#39;s small but it has a lot... a lot more than I&#39;d found anywhere in Europe in the almost 9 years I&#39;ve been here. Tomatillos (almost impossible to find in my searches)... fresh and canned, some good quality tequilas, hand/homemade goodies of all sorts. I bought some chips and tamales and I&#39;m really looking forward to trying them. <br><br>My wife is jealous that I got to go but she didn&#39;t... therefore, I know that we&#39;ll be back soon.",

I had a very business atmosphere with all the amenities you need. <br>I must say that the staff was amazing! They were on top of my every need, from restaurant recommendations, which were so on the money, to travel arrangements to shopping locations. From the moment I checked into this hotel I felt welcomed. <br>I took a massage during my stay that was excellent. <br>Let&#39;s talk views...from everywhere. while having a massage, I was able to enjoy a perfect vista from the table. <br>The meeting space was incredible. There are 2 floors of meeting space. One on the lower with larger ballroom type spaces, (which can be divided) and then there is the upstairs for the smaller group meetings. Again...la bella vista! from every room. All state of the art and very typical Swiss style. Great areas to dine. <br>The sales team was amazing as well. They knew their inventory and their product and were able to point me in the right direction for my needs. <br>The restaurant was good, breakfast was a fantastic buffet, with everything for carnivores and vegetarians alike. <br>The only downside is the security of the internet. My internet was hacked during my stay, which can happen, (and has happened as a road warrior), to anyone. No matter, that is not a good experience. <br>. <br>The beds were comfortable enough and inline with European standards. It was too late that I realized they had a pillow menu. Mine were way too soft for me...so be sure to enquire. <br>Overall, great experience",

But it was good and served with a glass of water (5,- CHF) always handy when you don&#39;t get much to drink the rest of the day. Was fine but once again I&#39;m not pro.<br>I&#39;ve also tested their Earl Grey tea (I&#39;m more into that kind of things). Was pretty cool for an acceptable price in Zurich (4,5 CHF).<br><br>The place is quite clean and got good chairs/ tables. If you go for the high one you can conveniently drop your coat/other stuff one the small wall close to the tables. Careful however, there is not much room between tables, so try to pick a seat quick on those. Alternatively there are se couches that seemed cool as well.<br><br>Staff is friendly and efficient. They won&#39;t bother you but might ask if you need something else from time to time which is absolutely fine.",

However, my host shares it with several others and it doesn&#39;t reside in my apartment. Bah!<br><br>Anyway, this place is close by and offers a wide variety of sustenance that I can order so I don&#39;t feel like a wifi moocher. I clearly am, but at least I can pay for the experience. And I must say their internet is worth the price of a drink. It&#39;s super fast, allowing me to quickly upload YouTube videos and pictures.

A little arrogant at times (can&#39;t see why), but popular amongst the locals. You must try the giant cordon bleu with pommes frites. They serve typical, heavy Swiss food with no frills attached.<br><br> Average desserts. The creme brulée is nice, though.

"reviewcomment":"Went here for dinner with the BF and had a nice meal :)<br>I ordered the penne bolognese but penne is prob my least favorite pasta shape so I asked them to sub the penne for spaghetti and they did. Before our meal we shared the nüsslisalat which was really really good. They also brought out a small bruchetta with tomatoes and mozzarella and a little shot sized fresh squeezed blood orange juice. It is little things like that they make me want to go back..<br>However, our service was just not good. :( He mumbled and spoke so quietly that it was hard to know what he said (and that is not just because I am a non native german speaker) and then when my pasta arrived they didn&#39;t offer any parmesan cheese, nor did it come with any, but I saw all the other tables get some :( and he didn&#39;t come back over so I didn&#39;t get the chance to ask. My BF was also not given any chili oil for his pizza which the other tables were also offered. So silly because my pasta was good without it, but could have been great with it. <br>Overall I was very happy with the food. Our bottle of mineral water cost us 14CHF though, so bring your own! Kidding.... but really... 14chf???!! for some san pellegrino..? :/",

"reviewcomment":"I stayed at this property for a business trip and meeting site inspection in mid October 2013. The property was immaculate and the rooms were well appointed. I had a very business atmosphere with all the amenities you need. <br>I must say that the staff was amazing! They were on top of my every need, from restaurant recommendations, which were so on the money, to travel arrangements to shopping locations. From the moment I checked into this hotel I felt welcomed. <br>I took a massage during my stay that was excellent. <br>Let&#39;s talk views...from everywhere. while having a massage, I was able to enjoy a perfect vista from the table. <br>The meeting space was incredible. There are 2 floors of meeting space. One on the lower with larger ballroom type spaces, (which can be divided) and then there is the upstairs for the smaller group meetings. Again...la bella vista! from every room. All state of the art and very typical Swiss style. Great areas to dine. <br>The sales team was amazing as well. They knew their inventory and their product and were able to point me in the right direction for my needs. <br>The restaurant was good, breakfast was a fantastic buffet, with everything for carnivores and vegetarians alike. <br>The only downside is the security of the internet. My internet was hacked during my stay, which can happen, (and has happened as a road warrior), to anyone. No matter, that is not a good experience. <br>. <br>The beds were comfortable enough and inline with European standards. It was too late that I realized they had a pillow menu. Mine were way too soft for me...so be sure to enquire. <br>Overall, great experience",

The others had the beef (Rendang) which had the most interesting combination of spices in the sauce, such a unique taste! <br><br>The chef came out to check on us and chat about the food and the place, and I have the same comment as the fish - it had been MONTHS since I received such outstanding service. To me, the excellence of the food and the highest standards of service more than justify the price in this case. I would say though, that CHF 60 (tip included) for two cokes, an appetizer, a very generous main dish, a side dish of rice, and a dessert it&#39;s an excellent value here in Zurich!<br><br>I went back for the 11-course meal called rijsttafel - inquire with the restaurant and book at least 24 hours in advance.<br><br>Thumbs up for Dapur Indonesia from me!!!",

Needless to say, we were treated like tourists who&#39;d probably never come back there(they&#39;re right about that).<br><br> We ordered two vegetable Samosas, the butter chicken, a Tandoori platter, and of course Naan. We also ordered a 70CHF bottle of white wine, which our waiter promptly spilled onto the table when filling the glasses. Our entire order arrived 5 minutes after we placed the order. And all at once! After placing all the food on the table, the waiter would not leave. Instead, he began serving us pieces from the Tandoori platter and by the time we were served our food was already cold. Maybe it was cold to start with.<br><br> The Tandoori platter was the most disappointing dish that I&#39;ve had in the past year in Switzerland. I highly recommend you avoid it. I am embarrassed to have recommended this place to our friend who picked up the check",

"reviewcomment":"Since we moved to Oerlikon, we started more and more to have brunches and dinners in Chayenne. The food is great and it always seemed very fresh. The atmosphere is very joyful and, unlike many Zurich places, it is almost always populated by young (and noisy) people, who want to have a good time. I find this very relaxing.<br><br>There are also available seats at the bar and often people are standing as well, since big groups of friends joining after work is a common view there.<br><br>The strongest point of the place is, in my opinion, it&#39;a brunch selection. On weekends, you can serve brunch until as late as 4 pm. Try their omelette, it is delicious! (I got the New York one). Also, they serve breakfast combos (i chose the American and the Swiss one), which are very expensive (up to even 30 CHF if I remember well), but they are worth it! The combos are enough for two people and they are very diverse. I would be happy if they offered more drinks as included in the combo though.<br><br>However, be prepared to pay Zurich prices. It&#39;s an expensive place, but I never regretted spending money there. Enjoy!",

I&#39;ll leave it to others to judge if what you are served here is actually traditional, but the couple of times I&#39;ve been here, the last time being a week ago, I ate well and I didn&#39;t pay an extraordinary amount of money, considering that we&#39;re still talking about a restaurant that is located right next to the Paradeplatz.<br><br>Service is a bit hit-or-miss and generally better when you reserve a table in advance.",

As it happened, the website of Café Boy was still open and since I hadn&#39;t finalized any dinner plans for that evening yet, I simply took my chance and went to Café Boy...<br><br>This was back in May and I have been to Café Boy now three times. In fact, on every of my Zurich trips I went back. So. what is it that I treasure about this establishment?<br><br>1) The staff is always exceptionally friendly and forthcoming. In fact, on none of my visits did I make a reservation and still they were able to accomodate me. Plus, on two of the three visits I was by myself and my experience is that oftentimes staff kind of neglects you when you&#39;re a sad-looking single guest...not so at Café Boy!<br><br>2) The menu is very inventive and the flavours are experimental, but not so much as to become alien. (On two occasions I had the aubergine-strudel on saffron-risotto, which was just delightful.)<br><br>3) The interior is chic &amp; clean, but not sterile. I can definitely recommend sitting outside underneath a canope of vine-leaves.<br><br>Attention: the immediate surroundings of the Café Boy are a little sketchy...at least for Zurich.",

"reviewcomment":"Yeeeeep, 5 stars. <br><br>I will tell you why. :)<br>The service was impeccable. Perfect timing, friendly, etc..<br>The food was so yummy. I ordered the daily menu which starts with soup or salad, I chose salad, natürlich, and a gnocchi as my main. The gnocchi was served al forno with béchamel and tomato sugo. The flavour combination was really good and the portion was the perfect size for me. For a grown man..? Eh....arguable. <br>Of course the indoor decor is unlike any other restaurant I have ever been...truly interesting to sit there and look around. <br>I am excited to go back, already... (and I am still full from lunch!)",

"reviewcomment":"We took an out-of-town friend to Khan&#39;s because I was expecting to get the quality food &amp; service experience I had when I had gone there with a Khan&#39;s regular customer. Needless to say, we were treated like tourists who&#39;d probably never come back there(they&#39;re right about that).<br><br> We ordered two vegetable Samosas, the butter chicken, a Tandoori platter, and of course Naan. We also ordered a 70CHF bottle of white wine, which our waiter promptly spilled onto the table when filling the glasses. Our entire order arrived 5 minutes after we placed the order. And all at once! After placing all the food on the table, the waiter would not leave. Instead, he began serving us pieces from the Tandoori platter and by the time we were served our food was already cold. Maybe it was cold to start with.<br><br> The Tandoori platter was the most disappointing dish that I&#39;ve had in the past year in Switzerland. I highly recommend you avoid it. I am embarrassed to have recommended this place to our friend who picked up the check",

"reviewcomment":"Outstanding Italian cuisine.  <br><br>The menu of the day was heavy on venison; we ended up with a venison ragout, which was tender and savory, but was still distinctively not beef.  Certainly mellow and not gamey --- perhaps farmed venison?<br><br>The smaller plates we ordered --- pasta fagioli (potted pasta with beans) and risotto --- were savory and made you feel like you were visiting someone&#39;s family.<br><br>Even the insalata mista and mortadella were nicely above average.<br><br>Desserts were each good, and balanced each other nicely.  The torta della casa was a fairly straight-ahead dense chocolate cake, and the tartufa di limoncello was bizarre --- crispy lemony outside, fluffy lemon fluff (somewhere between gelato and marshmallow), and a dense lemon-curd-jelly core.<br><br>Service was excellent, attentive, and managed a health emergency from another customer with a nice balance of efficiency and aplomb.  The reservation system involves a website, some text messages, and no waiting on hold --- I&#39;m a fan.<br><br>Their website even includes a Tetris game.  Who does that?",

The others had the beef (Rendang) which had the most interesting combination of spices in the sauce, such a unique taste! <br><br>The chef came out to check on us and chat about the food and the place, and I have the same comment as the fish - it had been MONTHS since I received such outstanding service. To me, the excellence of the food and the highest standards of service more than justify the price in this case. I would say though, that CHF 60 (tip included) for two cokes, an appetizer, a very generous main dish, a side dish of rice, and a dessert it&#39;s an excellent value here in Zurich!<br><br>I went back for the 11-course meal called rijsttafel - inquire with the restaurant and book at least 24 hours in advance.<br><br>Thumbs up for Dapur Indonesia from me!!!",

I visited this place last year during my visit to Zurich and again 2 weeks ago - from the quality of food to the price, everything was the same - the BEST ! <br><br>Food taste is very authentic and close to the real street food you get in India. Kotthu Parotta is the most popular item in their menu. For 14 swiss francs, you get a huge portion (2 people can easily share) of kottu parotta with a soda or a small can of beer. You can customize this dish with goat or beef or chicken and even egg-etarian. Also, their vada with chutney is very tasty. <br><br>In short, Inexpensive Tasty soul food. ;-)  Cash only transactions and all they have is one small table for 3 to 4 people to stand and eat - so be prepared to stand n eat your dinner or take away is another option.",

I had a generous portion of delicious foie gras, fantastic broiled bone marrow, a nüsslisalat with homemade dressings that are served in small bottles alongside the salad so that you can drown your greens if you so choose and a really nice cheese fondue!<br><br>It&#39;s very nicely decorated in a modern, yet traditional way. Service is super attentive, professional and friendly. There&#39;s a view if the forest out the large window and for nice weather, there&#39;s a beautiful outdoor terrace.<br><br>Definitely a place to bring guests or enjoy a good meal with your significant other...",

"reviewcomment":"Every Sunday there is a pretty comprehensive brunch filled with hot and cold foods and drinks.  I came here to meet a bunch of friends, and they sat us at a long table.  I was at the very end, and it was a bit difficult to talk to the people on the other end, so we had to switch places later on to talk to everyone.<br><br>I actually couldn&#39;t find this place at first, because I wasn&#39;t quite sure where it was located in Hauptbahnhof.  But eventually I found it next to the Burger King!<br><br>I stuffed myself silly on all the meats, bread, cake, different kinds of juices, eggs, etc.  I wouldn&#39;t say that the food was particularly spectacular, but there was definitely quite a bit of variety, so you could choose what you wanted to eat, and definitely no one left hungry.",

"reviewcomment":"I&#39;m a pretty discerning eater so when the guide book led us to the restaurant across the street with its menus translated into 6 languages I refused to go there. <br><br>I turned around to find a menu that was authentic Bavarian and Swiss which was what this visitor needed. <br><br>The prices were a little bit less than some of the other restaurants in the area. <br><br>Vaulted ceilings and painted walls really give the ambiance of the old style, and reading the other review proves that there is much history here. <br><br>The service was good. She didn&#39;t speak English but knew enough to give us Te English menu and had very good gesturing skills. <br><br>We got the Calves liver and Pork knuckle. I asked for Roesti instead of noodles because hey, I&#39;m in Switzerland and need to eat the famous potatoes in its rightful place. Calves liver was excellent but covered in the same sauce as my Pork knuckle which was a little dry. <br><br>The drink selection wasn&#39;t amazing. Just a light or a dark beer and a long wine list. The Cabernet I got was mediocre. <br><br>We decided to skip dessert and get chocolate down the street. <br><br>I really enjoyed the meal and happy we found the place !",

"reviewcomment":"Went on a summer evening for drinks at the bar, then dinner, both outdoors. The ambiance in the outside bar area is great - there are lounge chairs and bar stools. The whole area is very chic, romantic, comfortable. Great cocktails. <br><br>The outdoor dining area is over the water and you get great views of the sunset over the lake with dinner. Food was good - a bit on the pricier side but you expect that since its Zurich, and because of the restaurant&#39;s location. Fish was cooked perfectly - crispy skin and juicy everything else - and seasoned lightly but well. Servings were substantial. Service is good. <br><br>(In terms of value though I did witness a local woman losing it - crying - because she ordered a $70+ lobster dish and they only served her half the lobster. I ordered a $50 fish dish and got only a filet...is that comparable?) <br><br>(Also...we had a reservation but did not have a per person minimum enforced against us. They did however seat us about 20 minutes after our reserved time)",

"reviewcomment":"I&#39;ve been a few times to the Bellevue Le Cedre and overall think it&#39;s a solid option for a nice dinner with friends.  The times I&#39;ve gone there, we usually just get the selection of mezzes for however many are in our group, which I think is a great option if you are willing to share and don&#39;t have any picky friends :)  The last time we were there, we added on the grilled meat option, which ended up being too much food for us, so I would only recommend that combination if you have bigger eaters in your group.  The food is fresh and authentic.  <br><br>The restaurant itself is a little cramped - a few too many tables for the space - but it is very popular, so I suppose this helps them accommodate more guests.  There doesn&#39;t seem to be a place to hang coats.  Service is adequate - the last time we were there, there was a large birthday party dinner, which attracted most of the attention from the waitstaff for a while.",

A short walk down the hill from Hotel Dolder Grand along a nature reserve. <br><br>A really nice menu of Swiss classics and seasonal specialties. Currently they have and an attractive game menu for fall. I had a generous portion of delicious foie gras, fantastic broiled bone marrow, a nüsslisalat with homemade dressings that are served in small bottles alongside the salad so that you can drown your greens if you so choose and a really nice cheese fondue!<br><br>It&#39;s very nicely decorated in a modern, yet traditional way. Service is super attentive, professional and friendly. There&#39;s a view if the forest out the large window and for nice weather, there&#39;s a beautiful outdoor terrace.<br><br>Definitely a place to bring guests or enjoy a good meal with your significant other...",

"reviewcomment":"I&#39;m from NYC so naturally I took it for granted that good inexpensive sushi is almost around every corner like dry cleaners. When I moved to Zurich two and a half months ago, I came face to face with the cold harsh reality that good sushi is not only hard to come by, but also very pricey. <br><br>I read some reviews about Yooji&#39;s and decided to give it a try (after holding out for nearly two months of no sushi). Since people say that the inside conveyor belt sushi is less than desirable, my husband and I opted to sit outside on a nice evening. The wait was a bit long, which was expected on a Friday evening. There was only one waiter servicing all the tables outside and the table next to us has 10+ ppl. I was slightly irritated that we sat at our table for 15 mins before the waiter came by only to realize that we never got menus. So another 20 mins elapsed after we decided on our orders and filled out the order forms when the waiter came back to collect it. But like I said, he was the only one covering the outdoor seating section so we didn&#39;t mind so much. <br><br>Eventually our orders came all together, the appetizer and the entrees. Wish we got our edamame first but we were pretty hungry by then so the more the merrier. I ordered 3 pieces of spicy shrimp and three pieces of rainbow inside out roll, a salmon chirashi, and a piece of kingfish nigiri. The fish were fresh and up to par, the salmon chirashi was especially delish. The spicy shrimp roll was a bit on the drier side but I juiced it up with the yummy and super potent wasabi. I was satisfied with my entire order. Ok, I went in with not so high expectation so as not to be disappointed. My husband was also happy with his chicken teriyaki bento (he&#39;s Swiss, not too adventurous on the food front).<br><br>I don&#39;t usually give 4*s easily but the waiter recommended a nice sake for me after asking what my preference is, which brings up my rating from 3.5* to a 4* :) <br><br>The bill for the whole meal was well under a hundred CHF with apps and drinks which was quite acceptable (considering where we are). I&#39;ll definitely be hitting up Yooji&#39;s again next time I need to come up for some (sushi) air.",

The whole area is very chic, romantic, comfortable. Great cocktails. <br><br>The outdoor dining area is over the water and you get great views of the sunset over the lake with dinner. Food was good - a bit on the pricier side but you expect that since its Zurich, and because of the restaurant&#39;s location. Fish was cooked perfectly - crispy skin and juicy everything else - and seasoned lightly but well. Servings were substantial. Service is good. <br><br>(In terms of value though I did witness a local woman losing it - crying - because she ordered a $70+ lobster dish and they only served her half the lobster. I ordered a $50 fish dish and got only a filet...is that comparable?) <br><br>(Also...we had a reservation but did not have a per person minimum enforced against us. They did however seat us about 20 minutes after our reserved time)",

You feel awkward and right at home at the same time. A little like going to your estranged aunts place as an adult where you used to go to in the summer when you were a kid.<br><br>But let&#39;s get real. The food is ok, but nothing to write home about (note the irony of me writing home about it? Good. Let&#39;s move on.) As some of my fellow yelpers have noted, the staff is really friendly, if also a little on the slow side. The all-you-can-eat spareribs (only with a deindeal voucher) were tasty-ish, but nothing you would want to all-you-can-eat of. The star of the meal for me were the extremely yummy sweet potatoe fries, which have been unparalleled in CH for me thus far! I think they are the monthly special though, so get them while you can!",

And a large terrace with a outside bar. During the summer, you can hang out it the lounge area and watch people and enjoy the drinks.<br><br> The food is excellent: the food is fresh, Mediterranean, modern and yummy-ly prepared. The chef has officially 15 points in the Guide Michelin (according to the official website from Chez Fritz).<br><br> Wine comes mainly from Europe, with focus on France and Italy.",

Especially the tapas are nice and well selected. <br><br>Just pay attention with small and big portions. 2 took a small salad (17 Sfr.) and 2 a big salad (24 Sfr). We really couldn&#39;t tell the difference between both salads. We mentioned it and they gave a standard answer that the one was a small one and the other a big one.<br><br>The wine is good and they really give advice.  <br><br>Friendly staff but they could do an effort with people who don&#39;t understand CH-german. We were there with friends from abroad who were here to visit (could speak limited german). But the staff kept continuing speaking swiss german. Was getting a bit annoying at some point. <br><br>It is close to a big road. So it is a it loud. It is kinda normal when you are in the city.",

"reviewcomment":"The best North and South Indian restaurant in Zürich. The service was very friendly. When we came in, it was not very busy. All the tables were reserved. We had a tip from someone we know. The restaurant was easy to reach by tram and it was a bit outside Zürich. You can go with the tram or bus. We were with the tram 13 and the tram stops in front of the restaurant. The restaurant is above a store. When we came in we see a cosy interor with typical Indian stuffs. It was a bit too much, too full and old for me. But it was in one style. The chairs were not too comfortable. You have to sit too straight. You have a big choice from the menu. A lots of diffirent dishes from the north and south India. The proportions were good. A good thing was also that they put the dishes on a hotplate and candles. The service was a bit to fast. But above all it was a good diner (i ate to much) I will certainly come back.",

"reviewcomment":"By the way, if you&#39;re ever in Zurich on business, you might want to try staying at the Hotel Sonne in Kusnacht. It&#39;s about 10 km from downtown, and 11 minutes by trains that run every 15 minutes (and there&#39;s a direct train to the airport.) It&#39;s right on the lake, sunny in the afternoons, and the rooms are bigger than you&#39;ll get in downtown.<br><br>Don&#39;t get me wrong - it ain&#39;t cheap. But all the hotels in Zurich are really expensive, and the Sonne is charming AND...<br><br>If you walk up the main street, and follow the stream called the Tobler, you come to a ravine trail that is wonderfully Swiss. The waterfalls are sculpted, there are arched bridges over the stream, and this time of year there are teams of civic workers in the forest valley blowing away the leaves! (Even other Zurich residents think this is a bit much.)<br><br>Up and down is about 15 km with 220 m vertical, and just a great way of working off your Zurcher g&#39;schnetzlets mit Rosti!",

"reviewcomment":"Italian food in Switzerland?  Some may question it, but the food was great, and the venue was great.<br><br>The food... between my brother and I, we started with some beef carpaccio, had the lasagna and the spaghetti carbonara for entrees, and then finished with some iced cream.  The carpaccio was pretty good, not the most amazing I&#39;ve had, but very well cut, the cheese was superb (but that&#39;s Switzerland for you), and a bit of lime and greens made a great complement.  The entrees, I devoured by the lasagna, but I think the spaghetti carbonara may have been better based on my two bites.<br><br>The venue... located in central Zurich, it&#39;s on a fairly busy street in Niederdorfstrasse.  My only complaint would be the lack of outdoor music.<br><br>Overall... worth a visit if you&#39;re craving Italian food.",

So ideally located and with a magnificent view of the lake.<br><br> I think, the Chez Fritz has the same owner than the Seerose, but I think at the Chez Fritz it&#39;s more sophisticated place and not as show-offy as the Seerose.<br><br> It has a fine, but still cosy ambience inside. And a large terrace with a outside bar. During the summer, you can hang out it the lounge area and watch people and enjoy the drinks.<br><br> The food is excellent: the food is fresh, Mediterranean, modern and yummy-ly prepared. The chef has officially 15 points in the Guide Michelin (according to the official website from Chez Fritz).<br><br> Wine comes mainly from Europe, with focus on France and Italy.",

"reviewcomment":"Even though you have never been here, you know this restaurant already; it&#39;s the kind of place where you get lulled by cheesy Argentinian muzak and the dimly-lit lights together with the over-dominance of the color red giving you the impression of accidentally having entered a Twin-peaky dream sequence. You feel awkward and right at home at the same time. A little like going to your estranged aunts place as an adult where you used to go to in the summer when you were a kid.<br><br>But let&#39;s get real. The food is ok, but nothing to write home about (note the irony of me writing home about it? Good. Let&#39;s move on.) As some of my fellow yelpers have noted, the staff is really friendly, if also a little on the slow side. The all-you-can-eat spareribs (only with a deindeal voucher) were tasty-ish, but nothing you would want to all-you-can-eat of. The star of the meal for me were the extremely yummy sweet potatoe fries, which have been unparalleled in CH for me thus far! I think they are the monthly special though, so get them while you can!",

Especially the tapas are nice and well selected. <br><br>Just pay attention with small and big portions. 2 took a small salad (17 Sfr.) and 2 a big salad (24 Sfr). We really couldn&#39;t tell the difference between both salads. We mentioned it and they gave a standard answer that the one was a small one and the other a big one.<br><br>The wine is good and they really give advice.  <br><br>Friendly staff but they could do an effort with people who don&#39;t understand CH-german. We were there with friends from abroad who were here to visit (could speak limited german). But the staff kept continuing speaking swiss german. Was getting a bit annoying at some point. <br><br>It is close to a big road. So it is a it loud. It is kinda normal when you are in the city.",

"reviewcomment":"The best North and South Indian restaurant in Zürich. The service was very friendly. When we came in, it was not very busy. All the tables were reserved. We had a tip from someone we know. The restaurant was easy to reach by tram and it was a bit outside Zürich. You can go with the tram or bus. We were with the tram 13 and the tram stops in front of the restaurant. The restaurant is above a store. When we came in we see a cosy interor with typical Indian stuffs. It was a bit too much, too full and old for me. But it was in one style. The chairs were not too comfortable. You have to sit too straight. You have a big choice from the menu. A lots of diffirent dishes from the north and south India. The proportions were good. A good thing was also that they put the dishes on a hotplate and candles. The service was a bit to fast. But above all it was a good diner (i ate to much) I will certainly come back.",

"reviewcomment":"I lived in Ethiopia for a year, and occasionally (often) get a craving for traditional Ethiopian food. Marathon lives up. We shared the small dining room with mostly Swiss patrons, but the restaurant clearly caters to the Ethiopian community in Zurich as well. The food was authentic and well prepared, and served in the traditional Ethiopian style (shared plate of injera with your order poured on top). If you&#39;ve had Ethiopian food in Ethiopia, the only difference to point out is that the injera is less sour and not as course as you would often find there - probably a concession to palates not accustomed to the flavor.<br><br>If you want to try some food that ventures beyond the typical Zurich fare, I&#39;d highly recommend Marathon. The staff was friendly and helpful, and threw in free appetizers and coffee (but I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s standard or not).<br><br>Prices are typical for Zurich meals, if not slightly less than you might find elsewhere. Portions are 20-25 chf each.<br><br>Note to vegetarians: we only ordered meat dishes, but there were 4-5 vegetarian options on the menu.",

"reviewcomment":"Surprisingly good pan-Asian food, right next to Stadelhofen.<br><br>The menu is divided by country; we hit the China section, with ginger tofu and Cantonese duck.  The &#34;Ingwer Tofu&#34; was lightly spicy and loaded with veggies --- and not too oily, unlike some renditions.  It&#39;s also available as beef, and it&#39;s a much more straight-ahead ginger dish than, say, your average General Gao&#39;s chicken.<br><br>The duck was also excellent --- crispy on the outside, past tender into soft on the inside.  The sauce was a good pairing, but quite sugary.  No veggies whatsoever --- just duck and rice.<br><br>Both our items took a few minutes to cook in back; if you&#39;re in a hurry, there&#39;s ~6 woks of ready-to-go things at the counter.<br><br>They usually offer packaged sushi (prepared off-site), but were out when we visited.<br><br>Maybe not worth a dedicated trip to Stadelhofen --- but suddenly one of my favorite impulse stops in the area.",

Since the weather was sunny, the place was packed.<br><br>Atmosphere 4/5: Great place and conveniently located on the famous Bahnofstrasse, inside, the place has a nice and cozy environment. They have also a nice and huge terrasse if you want to eat outside during Summer time.<br>Food 4/5: Food was good. I had a roast beef with Fries. I payed a little bit less than 30 CHF for a entrée plate. The size was good and even had too much meat on the plate. It&#39;s also hard to judge a restaurant with a roast beef order but the kitchen seemed to be fast and clean. They also have excellent desserts.<br>Service 4/5: Service was excellent. The lady spoke english and they even have an english menu which helped a lot to understand what you were ordering.<br><br>Overall a good restaurant in Zurich, I would definitely stop by next time for a coffee or some food if I am hungry.",

It gets four stars for offering a variety for the patron who hasn&#39;t made up his/her mind about what to eat!<br><br>The store is sectioned in different areas, based on different types of food. Right in the front of the store is the made for take out foods, such as sandwiches (which there is a turkey sandwich with mango sauce that I like), salads, wraps and sushi/sashimi. I normally get the fast option of sashimi (available in salmon, tuna or both) with rice and a miso soup - the sushi/sashimi are priced well and are of ok quality (vs buying your sushi from Migros/Coop, eek). There is also a hot foods buffet (Asian) but it can be pricey so watch how much you pile on! Inside there is a Japanese noodle soup area, which I have tried once - it is okay, but nothing to die for.",

It was my last day and meal in Zurich before I leave for Singapore and I must say, the entire meal was delightful. The tapas were amazing. We had 6 tapas between a group of three of us. Must try are the lomito, mushrooms with chorizos, and the ceviche de cams tones casero. They were so good.<br><br>For desert, we had pop tarts: white chocolate with cononut and dark chocolate with hazelnut. Next is a dish which is their take of the cremè brûlée. It was mouth watering.<br><br>The service was absolutely commendable and the three of us were very well taken cared of. We had a good chat with the waitress and it was nice to get the chance to have a good talk with someone so warm and friendly.",

"reviewcomment":"Another great place in Oerlikon, very close to Chayenne and with quite similar food (Mexican profile) is Tres Amigos. I think the fact that these two very similar restaurants are so close to eachother and still manage to be full almost every nice in a suburb of Zurich is an indication that they do indeed serve good stuff :)<br>One advantage over Chayenne is that they serve food all day long, even between lunch time and dinner time (Chayenne only serves snacks then). <br><br>We visited the place twice. Once we ordered fajitas and it was just enough for two people and the other time I ordered a chicken burrito (it was huge), while my boyfriend had something like beef with lemon and tequila sauce. I liked the food every time and will definitely go back.<br><br>Prices are high, but that&#39;s Zurich...<br><br>P.S: great Apfel strudel as well :)",
