"reviewcomment":"I love this place. Last night I was craving a salad. I knew I could count on Teresa Carles for a great one. I wasn&#39;t wrong: brilliant circle of goat cheese, bib lettuce, walnuts, pears, beets, honey vinaigrette, ftw! <br><br>Clean, casual, friendly service, great food AND healthy - - it deserves six stars. <br><br>Please don&#39;t be afraid of the vegetarian label if you aren&#39;t one. There are plenty of flavorful dishes here for you to try. They don&#39;t sacrifice flavor in their veggie endeavors. The pasta (pappardellisimi esp) is terrific. You will likely swear they put some meat in there somewhere. The flatbread is a perfect starter to share. And the soup... Yum. Great to take a chill off. Then don&#39;t forget dessert - cheesecake highly recommended. <br><br>Enjoy all thus with nice wines or juices. <br><br>How perfectly well rounded does that sound. Do your heart some good and head in.",

"reviewcomment":"This restaurant was certainly the highlight of our trip. My husband is a big fan of the Adria brothers and so I made sure I made reservations 2 months before our trip- iy was certainly not easy! <br>Everything from the ambiance to the food was exceptional. The restaurant is divided into 4 sections that blend in together in a fun way. &#39;La Presumida&#39; (Bold) reflects Barcelona&#39;s blue waters, the sun, the people. In this section you&#39;ll find the traditional Spanish tapas. &#39;La Estrella&#39; (Star) focuses on drinks focusing in this case on the famous Spanish beer Estrella Damn. &#39;El Gallinero&#39; (Henhouse) for the lousy rascals (as per Tickets) and finally &#39;Nostromo 180286&#39; which is where we sat, that has a modern decor where they let their creativity drive them. The food is inspired by El Bulli and you can appreciate a lot of molecular gastronomy without losing on taste!<br>My favorite dishes were: Las Oliva -S, Toro Ham, Oysters with caviar olive oil, razor clams and the highlight was the golden painted fried egg with black truffle (Amazing!)<br>The desserts were outstanding as well and to add on the amazing night we met Albert Adria and spoke to him for 15 minutes - he was so friendly. I guess it helped that I was from Spain and my husband a major fan of his work!",

"reviewcomment":"The best meal of our lives.<br><br>Food: 5 stars<br>No menu, and everything they put in front of us was delicious.<br>We started with the jamon iberico (shaved ham) on tomato rubbed baguette.  The ubiquitous pedron peppers also made an appearance.  Then came several different types of prawns.  This was followed by ocean snails.  There was squid ink risotto, cubes of steak in garlic, and for the main entree we opted for lobster, which was just superb.<br>Desert was the Catalan style creme brulee.<br>I&#39;m sure I&#39;m missing several things.  It did get a little overwhelming at some point for me to remember it all.<br>A bottle of cava is provided on the house at the start of the meal and two bottles of grappa-like Catalan liquors were left on the table for us to pour at the end of it.<br><br>Service: 5 stars<br>I suppose it&#39;s not hard to provide exceptional service when there&#39;s no menu.  Still though the waiters were friendly, spoke good English, and put out the food at a good pace.  In a typical European fashion (?) the table was ours for the whole night (from 8.30pm to around 11.30pm).<br><br>Atmosphere: 5 stars<br>I was a little worried that this place would be too &#39;stuffy&#39;.  Relieved that it wasn&#39;t the case.  It&#39;s a fancy restaurant for sure and most people were dressed up.  However, the waiters were relaxed, joked around and there were people in shorts and casual shirts.  Definitely a good place for both a date night and a relaxed dinner with friends.<br><br>Price: 4 stars<br>This place isn&#39;t cheap.  We spent $320 on dinner for two, but that includes 10 or so course meal, a bottle of cava, a bottle of red wine, coffee, desert and after dinner drinks (the grappa-like liquor).  Considering what we were getting I consider this good value for money.<br><br>To conclude, this is one of those places where if you have the chance to go try, you should, period.",

"reviewcomment":"We booked this restaurant for our second night in Barcelona.  This has to be one of my favorite restaurant.  Similar to  many of other restaurants, they were small but this one actually had a second floor.  We had waited all day around the area and were getting tired.  We didn&#39;t want to go back to our hotel only to take the metro all the way back so we lingered in the area.  We even got seated early too.  Even though we were a bit tired from the long day, we loved our nearly 3 hours here.  I tend to eat everything fast but I savored every piece that came my way.<br><br>First Course: Iberian ham with tomato toast<br>Second Course: Oyster<br>Third Course: Melon soup with extra virgin olive oil ice cream<br>Fourth Course: Prawn Tartare with guacamole and lime&#39;s air<br>Fifth Course: Albacore on thin toasted bread with romesco and capers with edible flowers<br>6th Course: Lobster&#39;s Rice<br>7th Course: Ceviche (complementary dish)<br>8th Course: Duck and pears raviolis with foie poele and wild mushroom in Oporto&#39;s sauce<br>9th Course: Suckling pork with pumpkin puree (was not on the menu but we were lucky they had it for an upcoming party)<br>10th Course: Alcohol free beer (palate cleanser)<br>11th Course: Peaches, yogurt, and celery ice cream<br>12th Course: Figs, Baileys, Tonka Bean<br>13th Course: Complementary Truffles<br><br>We also got the wine pairing that came with this.  I highly recommend this as it made every dish seem more enjoyable and it complements it very well. As a result, I now think highly of Spanish wine.  A great way to experience Spanish wine.<br><br>Everything was great.  My favorites were the Prawn Tartare, Ceviche, and Suckling Pork.<br><br>I would definitely come back!  Loved it.<br><br>The service was amazing as well.  Both the host and waiters were knowledgeable and very nice!  They were all beautifully prepared.",

"reviewcomment":"When my cousin left home for the US, I thought I&#39;d save some € by eating in, instead of eating at a café/restaurant. Some days, I&#39;d buy 1 big sandwich to eat for the day. The Conesa Entrepans sandwiches were perfect for this, since they were big &amp; were good for about 2 meals (depends how much you eat), &amp; possibly around 800-1,000+ cals each (estimate). This saved me € &amp; calories, &amp; some days I think I only spent about €6-€12 on food. At CE, I bought 2 sandwiches, 1 cheese, 1 veggie. I tried other affordable Yelp-recommended sandwich places in Barcelona, but Conesa Entrepans was hands down the best. I had had the location of CE pinned in my City Maps 2GO iPad app (get it!!) for a while, but I never really looked for CE before, so I never found the place. It found me. Serendipity?<br><br>I was wandering aimlessly around Barri Gotic when I saw &#39;the queue&#39;. If you click on the webpage, you&#39;ll see it. It wasn&#39;t that long, but still extended past the entrance. The first thing I noticed was that the menu was in Catalan. I figured it would be in Catalan, since I was in Catalonia. With my broken French, Spanish &amp; Catalan, I figured which sandwich was which. There were a bunch to choose from, &amp; a ton of people inside. It was lunchtime, &amp; the place was packed &amp; kinda noisy (I didn&#39;t mind). There was a vending machine outside, so a bottle of water only cost me something like €1.10+. Yayz. <br><br>The next thing I noticed was that the guy making the sandwiches seemed truly happy - it&#39;s always great to see people enjoying whatever it is that they do. He was doing a kind of whistle-dance that would&#39;ve been great for YouTube. He could&#39;ve given 1 Pound Fish guy a run for his money. The cashier was also smiling. Looks like another happy day at Conesa Entrepans.<br><br>The sandwiches (about €4 each) were big (lots of bread), tasty, &amp; delicious. I ate half that night, &amp; reheated the rest in the toaster oven the following day. They were still delish. If you want to save € without having to starve, definitely pay Conesa Entrepans a visit.",

"reviewcomment":"I love this place! It&#39;s on a small, out-of-the-way street in Raval and it is full of romantic charm. First, the cocktails. I had a raspberry mojito that was full of fresh fruit and pomegranate seeds, not too sweet, perfection. Next, the starters: the first time I went I had a goat cheese salad, last time gambas that were a little too fried/oily but still delicious. For the main, I had a seared tuna with sesame and this cinnamon and pumpkin side that was amazing.<br><br>The place is small and usually crowded so definitely make a reservation. The staff is friendly and fun, telling jokes in English and Italian.<br><br>I will definitely be back soon.",

"reviewcomment":"The best meal of our lives.<br><br>Food: 5 stars<br>No menu, and everything they put in front of us was delicious.<br>We started with the jamon iberico (shaved ham) on tomato rubbed baguette.  The ubiquitous pedron peppers also made an appearance.  Then came several different types of prawns.  This was followed by ocean snails.  There was squid ink risotto, cubes of steak in garlic, and for the main entree we opted for lobster, which was just superb.<br>Desert was the Catalan style creme brulee.<br>I&#39;m sure I&#39;m missing several things.  It did get a little overwhelming at some point for me to remember it all.<br>A bottle of cava is provided on the house at the start of the meal and two bottles of grappa-like Catalan liquors were left on the table for us to pour at the end of it.<br><br>Service: 5 stars<br>I suppose it&#39;s not hard to provide exceptional service when there&#39;s no menu.  Still though the waiters were friendly, spoke good English, and put out the food at a good pace.  In a typical European fashion (?) the table was ours for the whole night (from 8.30pm to around 11.30pm).<br><br>Atmosphere: 5 stars<br>I was a little worried that this place would be too &#39;stuffy&#39;.  Relieved that it wasn&#39;t the case.  It&#39;s a fancy restaurant for sure and most people were dressed up.  However, the waiters were relaxed, joked around and there were people in shorts and casual shirts.  Definitely a good place for both a date night and a relaxed dinner with friends.<br><br>Price: 4 stars<br>This place isn&#39;t cheap.  We spent $320 on dinner for two, but that includes 10 or so course meal, a bottle of cava, a bottle of red wine, coffee, desert and after dinner drinks (the grappa-like liquor).  Considering what we were getting I consider this good value for money.<br><br>To conclude, this is one of those places where if you have the chance to go try, you should, period.",

"reviewcomment":"My friends and I were incredibly fortunate to be previously introduced to one of the waiters in this small, trendy tapas restaurant. This place gets PACKED, but we were lucky that we were seated quickly on a Saturday night around 9pm. The waiter served us a ton of drinks - me with the wine glass that was never left unfilled - and the food was outstanding. We didn&#39;t have to order anything, the waiter chose our whole meal for us and it was excellent.<br><br>The bikini sandwich IS as outstanding as all the other reviews say. We had croquetas, tacos, calimari, potatoes with runny egg cracked over them, and also some chocolate mousse with sea salt. <br><br>Their menus are awesome too - I really wanted to steal one, unfortunately our favorite waiter couldn&#39;t find one for us to steal :(<br><br>Upside: Extensive menu, delicious food, friendly servers<br>Downside: Closes at midnight, small space<br><br>I&#39;ll be back the next time I&#39;m in Barcelona!",

"reviewcomment":"What better way to celebrate my 100th Yelp review than reviewing my favorite restaurant in Barcelona!<br><br>I was introduced to Bubó by a friend who had went to Barcelona a few months before me. She did all this research on great places to go in Barca &amp; I just reaped the benefits.<br><br>Bubó was on her list as one of the top spots &amp; it just so happened to be directly across the courtyard from the gorgeous Santa Maria del Mar Cathedral (make sure you stop by, the stained glass windows are so beautiful).<br><br>There is limited seating inside which doesn&#39;t really matter because outside is where you want to be. The food is fantastic, the sangria is delicious &amp; the Bubó pasteleria next door doesn&#39;t hurt much either!<br><br>Some of my favorite dishes were the mozarella mille-feuille, the tuna ravioli (probably #1), brie &amp; coconut croquettes, iberian ham croquettes, grilled prawns, the mikini. You can&#39;t really go wrong with any of the choices though.<br><br>Also note that the dishes are essentially tapas so while it sounds like a lot of food, it&#39;s really not that much. <br>Prices are not cheap but you get what you pay for and that is quality my friends.<br><br>I love this place so much I went back 2x on my last trip and I can&#39;t wait to go back again. <br><br>Highly recommended stop in Barcelona.",

"reviewcomment":"Wow.<br><br>One of my best eating experiences in Barcelona and a meal I will remember for a long time. I was lucky to be able to walk on in without a reservation and proceeded to have a decadent feast, served by friendly staff eager to explain the elements of each dish.<br><br>The double egg souffle on a bed of potato &#34;ribbons&#34; was a textural delight, the flavours understated and perfectly balanced. The sardine and pork belly with a smear of peanut &#34;paste&#34; underneath was crazy good - all raw elements and served on a very hot plate, the fattiness of each started to melt and created an interesting experience in my mouth, everything sticking to my teeth as if I had eaten a spoon of peanut butter directly from the jar.<br><br>I ate, I think, around nine courses and all were beautifully made. Each playful, yet restrained at the same time, showcasing textures and flavour in a clever way and demonstrating the mad skills that are in the kitchen. <br><br>The wine list was incredible, if you were buying from the bottle. Unfortunately I was dining solo so I stuck to wine by the glass and was limited to just a few choices. I&#39;d love to come with a few friends and demolish some of the full bottles with another fabulous meal.<br><br>Why this place isn&#39;t packed I don&#39;t know! For the (very reasonable) price it is certainly a must do for any food lover who is visiting Barcelona.",

"reviewcomment":"In Barcelona, there are more than 500 tapas bars, most probably someone will convince me that in Barcelona there are more than 1.000 tapas bar restaurants. <br><br>after spending a week in Barcelona we were pleased to find a rather small tapas bar with a unique friendly service and delicious food and wine.<br><br>At the la pepita we came with a group of 8 collegues from our office. we never had to wait, our glaces were refilled frequently with excellent wine. <br><br>The room is cossy, with a warm and pleasant  decor.<br>The service was really outstanding. the service was very helpful and supportive and always with a big smile<br><br>all by all: outsanting and delicious tapas, outstanding atmosfeer and compared to some other restaurants in Barcelona a reasonable price/person. ( keep in mind that Wine is expensive in Barcelona)<br><br>I would defenitely go back, and always recommend that people reserve in advaance!",

"reviewcomment":"Great beer and the best tapas, what more could you want?<br>Well...how about an awesome staff in Captain uniforms who break into song every so often? Just another reason why Vaso de Oro is the best tapas bar in Barcelona.<br><br>Like most good tapas bars make sure to push your way in and get yourself a spot at the bar anyway possible. Its all part of the adventure and it seems to make the food a bit more satisfying after all the jockeying. This is a very long bar with multiple entrances. When walking by once I saw someone literally fall out the door since the space is so narrow between the bar and the door. They rolled past the sidewalk almost into the street. Make sure to get an anchored spot at the bar!<br><br>Once you make it in order their beer, only two options, light or dark, so this should be an easy selection.  Their wine is also good, although most drank beer and it seemed more appropriate with all the servers dressed in boat captain outfits. Next you must get a steak, sounds weird for a tapas bar but it is amazingly simple and so good.  It is quickly seared with quality olive oil, some onions, salt and little pepper. Yummmm...Perfection...Oh wait, and don&#39;t forget to top it off with some Foie Gras! Making it somehow better than perfect!<br><br>If still hungry try their fried chorizo.  Salty and big with flavor, they are perfect with the beer. The croquettes are also a solid choice. You really can&#39;t go wrong with much on the menu.<br><br>All you need to know is, with so little time on our vacation, with food being one of top priorities, we went there TWICE. Don&#39;t miss it!",

"reviewcomment":"When my cousin left home for the US, I thought I&#39;d save some € by eating in, instead of eating at a café/restaurant. Some days, I&#39;d buy 1 big sandwich to eat for the day. The Conesa Entrepans sandwiches were perfect for this, since they were big &amp; were good for about 2 meals (depends how much you eat), &amp; possibly around 800-1,000+ cals each (estimate). This saved me € &amp; calories, &amp; some days I think I only spent about €6-€12 on food. At CE, I bought 2 sandwiches, 1 cheese, 1 veggie. I tried other affordable Yelp-recommended sandwich places in Barcelona, but Conesa Entrepans was hands down the best. I had had the location of CE pinned in my City Maps 2GO iPad app (get it!!) for a while, but I never really looked for CE before, so I never found the place. It found me. Serendipity?<br><br>I was wandering aimlessly around Barri Gotic when I saw &#39;the queue&#39;. If you click on the webpage, you&#39;ll see it. It wasn&#39;t that long, but still extended past the entrance. The first thing I noticed was that the menu was in Catalan. I figured it would be in Catalan, since I was in Catalonia. With my broken French, Spanish &amp; Catalan, I figured which sandwich was which. There were a bunch to choose from, &amp; a ton of people inside. It was lunchtime, &amp; the place was packed &amp; kinda noisy (I didn&#39;t mind). There was a vending machine outside, so a bottle of water only cost me something like €1.10+. Yayz. <br><br>The next thing I noticed was that the guy making the sandwiches seemed truly happy - it&#39;s always great to see people enjoying whatever it is that they do. He was doing a kind of whistle-dance that would&#39;ve been great for YouTube. He could&#39;ve given 1 Pound Fish guy a run for his money. The cashier was also smiling. Looks like another happy day at Conesa Entrepans.<br><br>The sandwiches (about €4 each) were big (lots of bread), tasty, &amp; delicious. I ate half that night, &amp; reheated the rest in the toaster oven the following day. They were still delish. If you want to save € without having to starve, definitely pay Conesa Entrepans a visit.",

"reviewcomment":"This is hard, I don&#39;t know where to start. This was without a doubt one of our top 3 meals ever. That said, you need to be a certain kind of foodie to truly enjoy it. I can understand why there is a review that said things were too sweet. I was SHOCKED at how sweet things could be and still be savory. Cinc Sentis to me is a play on the senses, and it was delightful. Well, now that I&#39;ve started let me go on...<br><br>First the atmosphere and service were exceptional. This was team service and everyone we interacted with was lovely and equally as important really into the food and wine. What I loved was the pride they took in the pairings and the special finds they feature. They also go into the &#34;why&#34; the chef made a certain choice, which includes the heritage of the dish. Meaning... &#34;This dish is our take on [name] Catalan dish,&#34; which also included an explanation of that dish and their take.<br><br>Now, here, I have to mention that though I have had a large number of high quality modernist meals, they generally fall flat for me -- more form than function, and I dig function in my food and bev.<br><br>This was without a doubt, the best modernist meal I have had. Each dish was carefully constructed, and there was only one that didn&#39;t make me think differently about the ingredients or the original dish. (If I did know the original dish.) While it was hard to choose, I think my favorite was the main which was 3 version of squab... in 3 dishes, all creatively plated. Near to that was the langostinos and pork belly, which they paired with sea urchin foam and black garlic. Loved it and I don&#39;t like sea urchin typically. If I had to choose a third dish, it would likely be the 5 (or was it 6) tapas that we started with. Oh, forgot to mention this was the gastronomic tasting menu that is only offered for lunch. Yep, 3+ hours starting at 1:30p.<br><br>I have to agree with the surprise that this restaurant only has one Michelin star. Just a week ago in Nice we ate at a (also wonderful) 2-star restaurant and this was better... by just a schmidge. Really we loved both, but if I had to choose a winner, I&#39;d have to go with Cinc Sentis for originality that works.<br><br>So if you aren&#39;t really into food, or aren&#39;t in the mood to sit back and appreciate the artistry, this isn&#39;t for you. But if you are, wow, just wow. And then a few hours later, you will smile again and say, wow.",

I had a raspberry mojito that was full of fresh fruit and pomegranate seeds, not too sweet, perfection. Next, the starters: the first time I went I had a goat cheese salad, last time gambas that were a little too fried/oily but still delicious. For the main, I had a seared tuna with sesame and this cinnamon and pumpkin side that was amazing.<br><br>The place is small and usually crowded so definitely make a reservation.

"reviewcomment":"Great beer and the best tapas, what more could you want?<br>Well...how about an awesome staff in Captain uniforms who break into song every so often? Just another reason why Vaso de Oro is the best tapas bar in Barcelona.<br><br>Like most good tapas bars make sure to push your way in and get yourself a spot at the bar anyway possible. Its all part of the adventure and it seems to make the food a bit more satisfying after all the jockeying. This is a very long bar with multiple entrances. When walking by once I saw someone literally fall out the door since the space is so narrow between the bar and the door. They rolled past the sidewalk almost into the street. Make sure to get an anchored spot at the bar!<br><br>Once you make it in order their beer, only two options, light or dark, so this should be an easy selection.  Their wine is also good, although most drank beer and it seemed more appropriate with all the servers dressed in boat captain outfits. Next you must get a steak, sounds weird for a tapas bar but it is amazingly simple and so good.  It is quickly seared with quality olive oil, some onions, salt and little pepper. Yummmm...Perfection...Oh wait, and don&#39;t forget to top it off with some Foie Gras! Making it somehow better than perfect!<br><br>If still hungry try their fried chorizo.  Salty and big with flavor, they are perfect with the beer. The croquettes are also a solid choice. You really can&#39;t go wrong with much on the menu.<br><br>All you need to know is, with so little time on our vacation, with food being one of top priorities, we went there TWICE. Don&#39;t miss it!",

We came in a bit late and he served us up a wonderful fusion inspired meal smiling all the while.<br><br>I had the sashimi to start. Simply divine. Garnished with ginger and a delectable sauce I was in heaven. Followed it up with a version of bun bo hue (soup) with shrimp and beef. Delicious. To top it off we shared a rosemary and black pepper encrusted cheesecake. I seriously almost cried. <br><br>Amazing meal, great staff, fantastic dining experience.",

This dining experience is also &#34; an audio and visual experience&#34;. As you go through the various tapas the sounds and sights around you change to compliment the meal. The taste was even more amazing then the presentation. The kitchen and waiters are in sync as your eat your meal. The wine pairings are a must and they complement the meal exquisitely. <br><br>We left full, satisfied, and in awe.

"reviewcomment":"I cannot recommend this place enough. We wandered in on the advice of our hotel at 11pm on a Saturday night, and it was absolutely packed. We had made the mistake of not making a reservation, but we got very lucky and a waiter squeezed us in in the corner after 20 mins, but first making sure we got some wine while we waited. Despite the place being absolutely hectic, our waiter made sure we had all the time we needed with him, checking to see how we were getting on with each glass of wine, would we like the same again or to try a different one and explained the flavours in each bottle. <br><br>Everything sounded so good on the menu that we decided to let him choose some tapas for us, and were delighted we did so. The sardines with apple salsa was amazing, and I think our favourite was the salmon with a creamy italian cheese, I can&#39;t remember the exact. And order the cheesecake, you won&#39;t regret it! The bill came to 60 euro for 4 decent sized tapas, 5 glasses of wine, olives, bread and a slice of cheesecake for 2 people, which was very much worth it.",

If you tell the lovely woman serving up that it&#39;s your first time she&#39;ll give you recommendations on what tastes best with the meat you chose. I chose beef and MY was it good.

Sensi, is one of them.<br><br>I will start with the food. The tapas is excellent. A lot of creative tapas dishes. They have mixed the traditional spanish tapas with very tasty tapas from the far east and gourmet tapas from the catalan kitchen. <br><br>The atmosphere in the restaurant is very nice. It` s a small restaurant with few tables (10-15), and the music is chill. So it makes you relaxed and in the right mood to enjoy your food and have a nice time with your friends.<br><br>The staff here are very cool (and proffesional). They are helpfull and knows the menu in and out. You get the feeling that they enjoy their job, and they are there for you.<br><br>Since it is a pretty small and popular restaurant you have to book a table up front (even off season).<br><br>The prices are very cheap. Went out with my girl and a friend. We ate a lot, 12 tapas and drank at least 12 units of alcohol. The bill was just 85 euros. We had to ask if they had missed something, they had not.",

"reviewcomment":"we came here for sunday brunch, and it was great!  if you don&#39;t want the unlimited drinks, i believe brunch is €14-15.  make reservations in advance if you can, as this location only seats 10-12 people. <br><br>for €17 we got two tapas each, plus chocolate chip pancakes, and unlimited bacon tomato salad, pasta salad, raw veggies, bagels and bread with various spreads (p&amp;b, butter, humus, guac, tzaziki, egg salad, tuna salad, etc.), cookies and muffins, fruit juices, coffee, and all-you-can-drink mimosas!  the tapas we got were the hamburger slider (bun-less), bacon and cheese patatas bravas, bacon tomato quiche, and the eggs benedict.  <br><br>everything was delicious.  i don&#39;t even like pancakes, but these were legit--fluffy and just the right cakey consistency with a generous portion of chocolate. the owner and waitress both spoke perfect english and were super sweet and helpful.  <br><br>one of the owners, a pretty blonde woman originally from california, also owns Avenue Bar just down the street.  Avenue Bar is also great and a bit larger; so if you can&#39;t get a seat at Timeline for brunch or otherwise, just head over there.  in fact, we went there the previous night and the same owner was our server.  she gave us great recs for local festivals and hot spots in barcelona :) you can&#39;t beat a spot with such cute decor, good food, and excellent service.",

"reviewcomment":"I cannot recommend this place enough. We wandered in on the advice of our hotel at 11pm on a Saturday night, and it was absolutely packed. We had made the mistake of not making a reservation, but we got very lucky and a waiter squeezed us in in the corner after 20 mins, but first making sure we got some wine while we waited. Despite the place being absolutely hectic, our waiter made sure we had all the time we needed with him, checking to see how we were getting on with each glass of wine, would we like the same again or to try a different one and explained the flavours in each bottle. <br><br>Everything sounded so good on the menu that we decided to let him choose some tapas for us, and were delighted we did so. The sardines with apple salsa was amazing, and I think our favourite was the salmon with a creamy italian cheese, I can&#39;t remember the exact. And order the cheesecake, you won&#39;t regret it! The bill came to 60 euro for 4 decent sized tapas, 5 glasses of wine, olives, bread and a slice of cheesecake for 2 people, which was very much worth it.",

It&#39;s a neighborhood joint, complete with a large selection of tapas, beer wine and of course, vermut. <br><br>My favorite dish was an octopus salad, although everything was superb. Our waitress was really sweet and at the end of our meal, gave us a shot of their house made grappa, which was surprisingly smooth and a nice ending to a great meal. <br><br>The overall look/feel of the restaurant has and American jazz/blues/soul music theme, but didn&#39;t feel cheesy, but rather reflective of the owners&#39; love of obscure American music.",

We went here for both a pre-dinner and post-dinner drink. They sell Vermut in plastic jugs, which you can easily take home in your luggage. They sell bottles in glass as well. I originally came here with the purpose of buying Sweet Vermut, but to my surprise I discovered their homemade potato chips. These chips are amazing and are huge!

We turned to Yelp to see if anyone had any strong recommendations for a good burger which is when we came across Pim Pam. It was only a 10 minute walk from our hotel, so we decided we&#39;d try it.<br><br>It&#39;s sort of hidden away in the alleys of Barcelona, as most restaurants are, so be sure you know where you&#39;re going before you leave. When we walked in at 5:00 PM, the place was empty which was great for us, as we had read about long wait times. The guy behind the counter quickly offered us an English menu, which was nice too. <br><br>Talk about fresh! We watched a guy hand peel the potatoes to make the fries which is probably why they tasted so good. Everything we had was fresh and delicious. The burger was perfectly seasoned and the buns were soft and fresh. Pim Pam knows how to do burgers and fries right!",

"reviewcomment":"Out of all the meats and all the cheeses and all of the wine in all of Barcelona, none even come close to holding a candle to the marvelous smorgasbord offered at Recasens. Don&#39;t believe me? Then consider this: during our 10-day stay in Barcelona, Recasens is the only place we went to more than once, and still think about and crave to this day. <br><br>The place is gorgeous - rustic European charcuterie and cheese shop meets romantic bistro with low lighting, exceptional service and a drool-worthy menu boasting flat breads, hearty salads, house-cured meats, cheeses and fabulous local vinos. <br><br>Look no further than the tasting menu, friends. There is no need. You and your companion split a generous and ample salad full of fresh greens, amazing stewed mushrooms (and I&#39;m not a huge mushrooms fan), copious veggies and cheese. You then move onto The Board - piled high with various chouricos, cured sausages, jamon and even lomo (lamb) complimented by even more variaties of cheese (one even was even flecked pepperoni spices) that are all sinfully delicious and unique. With the food, you get a bottle of wine that they thoughtfully select to pair with the board you get. All of it is heavenly, and comes to a grand total of 46 euros. Seriously - a house-made, purley delicious and totally authentic Spanish meat and cheese fest for two for under 50 euros. Total. How can you not love that?<br><br>Since it&#39;s a pretty popular spot and it can be tricky to get a table, we immediately made a reservation to come back later in the week, and we looked forward to going back all week. Everyday. And no other meal in any other restaurant measured up to either of those we had a Recasens. Don&#39;t miss out, kids - it&#39;s sensational.",

"reviewcomment":"Wow - had a fantastic dinner here! <br><br>I have been to Barcelona several times previously but had never heard of Els Pescadors until a colleague of mine found it online and recommended we check it out. <br><br>A little hard to find (even the taxi driver had a hard time) but really nice locals feeling spot with fantastic service once you arrive. <br><br>We went on a Tuesday or Wednesday night at about 9 or 9:30, and were basically the only people in the restaurant even when we left 2 hours later.  I suppose it can get quite busy on the weekends but it was eerily quiet the night we were there. <br><br>Basic menu of fish and sea food but all prepared nicely.  Foie gras starter is PLENTY big for 2 people to share (unless you REALLLLY like Foie) and should not be missed, they do Foie 3-4 different ways so there should be a preparation for everyone.<br><br>Not inexpensive, but I will go back.",

I had the one with platano and some cheese from Venezuela and I loved it! They also have some great selection of fruit juices, including tropical varieties which I have seen only here, and beer from Venezuela as well. The atmosphere is really cool, and the bartenders are the best!) Price - as far as I have noticed the most expensive arepa will cost you... 5 €!!

This dining experience is also &#34; an audio and visual experience&#34;. As you go through the various tapas the sounds and sights around you change to compliment the meal. The taste was even more amazing then the presentation. The kitchen and waiters are in sync as your eat your meal.

The restaurant is on a quieter street, but not too far from the more popular touristy areas. My boyfriend and I sat outside on the patio enclosed by bushes-very cozy! We got the paella and mussels. Both were wonderful, and not too expensive. They also have 3€ bottles of house wine, which was actually pretty good.

The receptionist in our hotel told us that brunch isn&#39;t really a big thing but this is the place in the city that does it best, and she was completely right. I would definitely recommend reserving a table, two of us arrived for brunch on early Sunday afternoon and the wait even for a bar space was over half an hour. However once we were seated the service was very speedy. <br><br>We had the pink lemonade, the eggs benedict, a pulled pork sandwich and pancakes to split (I know, we were stuffed!). All the mains seem to come with a side salad and freshly fried potato cubes and everything was delicious. The eggs benedict seem to be the way to go, the kitchen was firing them out 5 a minute. The pancakes were also light and fluffy with fresh berries to top it off. 40 euro for brunch but we were still full 8 hours later!",

"reviewcomment":"On our third night in Barcelona, we couldn&#39;t help ourselves...a burger sounded so good! It almost seemed wrong that we were in Barcelona seeking out a burger-joint. We turned to Yelp to see if anyone had any strong recommendations for a good burger which is when we came across Pim Pam. It was only a 10 minute walk from our hotel, so we decided we&#39;d try it.<br><br>It&#39;s sort of hidden away in the alleys of Barcelona, as most restaurants are, so be sure you know where you&#39;re going before you leave. When we walked in at 5:00 PM, the place was empty which was great for us, as we had read about long wait times. The guy behind the counter quickly offered us an English menu, which was nice too. <br><br>Talk about fresh! We watched a guy hand peel the potatoes to make the fries which is probably why they tasted so good. Everything we had was fresh and delicious. The burger was perfectly seasoned and the buns were soft and fresh. Pim Pam knows how to do burgers and fries right!",

"reviewcomment":"We visited here after it popped up on my Yelp nearby page, and then our friends living in Barcelona also recommended it so I was keen to go straight away. We visited for breakfast two days in a row and got a table easily enough without having to wait both days (Friday &amp; Saturday). <br><br>They have menus in English which have a huge choice of breakfast options, available til 4pm. On the first day I had potato latkes with smoked salmon &amp; creme fraiche with dill. This was my favourite breakfast as it was a generous size, lots of salmon &amp; the latkes was crispy and tasty. On the second day I had poached eggs w/ toast + toast tomatoes, spinach &amp; halloumi. The eggs were excellent and in a cute shape but I thought the spinach was a little watery and the halloumi could have been grilled a little more. <br><br>Both days we spend around 20€ on breakfast for two with drinks. I&#39;m sure there are cheaper breakfasts available but this place is with visiting for the vibe alone - it&#39;s cool, laid back and great for people watching. It really did remind me of somewhere in Melbourne like Tresna said in her review. <br><br>Special mention to the staff who were friendly &amp; helpful on both out visits. It seemed like a really cool place to hang out if you needed somewhere to work and I loved the bench seating along the window!",

We were pleasantly full after that.  The Bravas are their number 1 tapas, the potatoes were soft and just melted in your mouth like butter with a special sauce.  The bread they gave at our table came with fresh garlic and tomato.  The waiter kindly demonstrated what to do and it was delicious!  Be careful not to overdo it w/ the garlic as it is fresh and very strong :-) We would go back every day if we could, this was a great restaurant, highly recommended!",

"reviewcomment":"Foie gras burger was hands down the BEST lunch near the Picasso Museum. Perfectly cooked resting on top of sea salted potato in a delicious olive oil. Heaven.  The olive oil they use is magical pixie dust. <br><br>Service was slow at first, but once they submit the order via wireless device, food comes out like the Jetson&#39;s cartoon. Our server brought out complimentary patatas bravas without the mayo aioli for the kids. Bravo for the bravas !! <br><br>Extensive wine list and menu &#34;del dia&#34; included, appetizer, entree, &amp; dessert for 9.95 Euro. Completely worth it. Outdoor seating is the usual + 15%, but if you sit inside you will enjoy the modern lighting and decorative varnished wooden repurposed wine crates.",

I thought it was a bad translation but they actually look like bags.]<br><br>Anyway, the desserts were also great (we tried four, they were all delicious) and the service was excellent.

"reviewcomment":"Love this place- even though it might be somewhat expensive, it&#39;s very much worth the price. <br><br>When I go to Thai restaurants, my go-to dish is generally some sort of green curry dish. What I can definitely say in the case of Thai Barcelona, is that their green curry with chicken did not at all disappoint (in fact, it was quite delicious!). What I especially liked was their attention to detail in the presentation of the food - even though it may seem inconsequential, it is very much in keeping with the overall aesthetic of the establishment. Although I don&#39;t remember exactly what the rest of my party ordered, I can remember that they were as satisfied with their meal as I was, if not even more. <br><br>In addition to the great food, the restaurant itself is lovely, very tastefully decorated in a classy sort of Oriental style. The place is clearly more of a fine-dining establishment than your usual tapas bar in the area, and the price of the meals does tend to reflect that, in addition to reflecting its very central location.",

"reviewcomment":"Cornelia and Co was the 2nd best meal, but also different from the best I had in Barcelona so it may be a tie. It&#39;s the most random place you don&#39;t expect to find. It looks like a market like Joan&#39;s on 3rd where it looks like casual, fast dining but it&#39;s elevated European fare.<br><br>So modern, you feel like you are in a cutting edge, foodie experiment.  The bunless veal burger with foie gras with a poached egg on the side. The grilled monkfish. Deep fried eggplant which is so thin and crispy, they are like the best potato chips you ever had.<br><br>We ate everything and even the entire bread basket when we&#39;d been avoiding carbs. AND asked for recommendations on dessert!  Our server recommended a simple almond cake vs the fancier desserts proving simple is best.<br><br>Dirty Martini presentation, the olive juice comes on the side like creamer so you can control the dirty. We loved it and were absolutely giddy.<br><br>It is pricier (sticker shock after alcohol and saying Yes, Yes to everything they recommended) than other restaurants you wander around, eating tapas and paella in Barca, but you will leave happy with good memories.<br><br>If you only eat 2 great meals in Spain or Europe, eat here and ATN in Barri Gotic.",

"reviewcomment":"I had the best meal of my entire trip to Barcelona at Kisoko Universal.  It was incredible!  <br><br>I wandered around and ended up choosing it for a late breakfast/early lunch after seeing open stools and, oddly enough, remembering it from a Rick Steves guidebook.  I was pulled in instantly by the gigantic plate of mushrooms on the counter in front of me.  I am a mushroom fanatic, so once I saw those, I easily knew that I would be ordering the mixed mushroom plate.<br><br>The staff is friendly and, despite how busy it can get there, it is easy to get their attention and quickly order.  I put in my order for the mixed mushrooms and a cappuccino and patiently waited!  Thankfully, the food came out extremely quickly.  I took my first bite and, sweet jesus...it was amazing.  The flavors were incredible.  I don&#39;t know what combination of oils and herbs they used (heck, I don&#39;t even know the names of all the mushrooms in the mix!), but whatever it was equaled magic.  My instant reaction was to start shoveling in bite after bite, but I held restraint and decided to instead savor each bite - a much smarter idea!  The mushrooms came with a side of bread, which was great as I was able to sop up the extra oil and herbs that were left behind on the plate.  The cappuccino was the perfect topper to the meal.  <br><br>For only about 12€, I had the meal of my entire trip.  I left very satisfied and happy.<br><br>I even returned on another occasion to have the mushrooms again.  This time I dragged my boyfriend along and we ordered some shrimp as well and split everything.  The mushrooms weren&#39;t quite as mind-blowing (there&#39;s nothing like the first time, I guess haha!), but they were amazing nonetheless.  <br><br>I heart this place.  You must go here while in Barcelona!",

But don&#39;t be frightened.  The seafood was fresh and excellent.  It&#39;s family run by a couple, and the son was very friendly and joked around with us in English.  We had mussels, clams, and razor clams cooked in butter.  Plus, grilled shrimp.  Not much to say other than it was excellent.  It&#39;s a noisy, small place, but it was packed at lunchtime with old, salty locals that were all giving the son a good hazing in fun, and then what seemed like arguing/joking with the mother.  Go, enjoy the food!",

"reviewcomment":"I relish diving deep into El Born and into the gothic areas of Barcelona. Although I live many thousands of miles away, it&#39;s one of my favorite cities in the world, in part for its amazing food, its hundreds of quaint and romantic grotto-like eating establishments, and its vibrant street life and street art. But I have to admit, the tapas, as delicious and varied as it can be, can get redundant and repetitive day after day. So this is why I was so pleasantly surprised when stepping into La Cua Curta on a recent visit to Barça. The ambiance and decor is wonderfully romantic and unique -- sophisticated and quaintly understated at the same time. The menu is loaded with interesting options and combinations. And the service -- provided by none other than the proprietor / menu designer -- is top notch. But most importantly, the dishes we ordered were out of this world. We had two of the fish carpaccios (tuna and cod) and a wild rice dish. The presentation was incredible, and the quality, freshness, and flavor combinations were world class. The tuna carpaccio at this place tops my list of amazing foods I&#39;ll remember and crave for years to come. So that was all well and good, and as we decided to wrap up and head out for some gelato, a small twinkle in the proprietor&#39;s eye told us to have a look at the dessert menu. The only bad thing I&#39;ll say about this place is that he didn&#39;t just force us to order the chocolate fudge cake. But by happenstance we did, and I have to say it was one of those mind-blowing experiences that come all too infrequently when eating dessert at a random restaurant. I have no idea what the cake part was made of -- nut flour of some sort perhaps. I&#39;m pretty sure the chocolate sauce was among the best I&#39;ve had, and I&#39;ve tried many dozens of chocolates worldwide. So, if you find yourself looking for an incredibly surprising, delightful, refreshing, and delicious experience in the heart of Barcelona, you must check out this gem. You will not be disappointed.",

"reviewcomment":"This place was just what we needed in Barcelona - get, delicious food &amp; booze, a 1 minute walk from our Airbnb flat with lovely staff and comfy seating. <br><br>We visited here when we realised things were looking tight in the Euros department. We popped in to find the long counter covered in pintxos - a huge range that were refreshed often and clearly marked with veggie options. Each pintxos was €1, just grab a plate and load it up. Too easy. Drinks were also really cheap - small wine and beer were also €1. <br><br>I enjoyed everything I ate here - and we are a lot. I think we returned 3 times in our visit and each visit was around €10 which is crazy good value for a meal for two with drinks. Every staff member we spoke to was lovely and helpful. It had a really nice relaxed vibe and awesome music - Elvis one day, Beatles the next. <br><br>This place is well worth a visit, I&#39;d go out of my way to return here if we go back to Barcelona.",

"reviewcomment":"We went there for our last meal in Barcelona. After reading the reviews we were expecting a restaurant that specialized in rice dishes. In reality this restaurant is a Catalan restaurant, that prides itself in the traditional foods of Catalonia, and has some rice dishes.<br><br>We were looking for something more upscale, and different from the usual tapas that we had been eating during our stay in Spain, and this place delivered. The restaurant is an old fashioned restaurant, with experienced waiters that take care of your needs, and provide you with very good guidance as to what to order. The staff was friendly and very informative, and really made our experience a very memorable one.<br><br>The food, was traditional, but really well done, and honestly a great change from the usual stuff we had during our stay. We had the young roasted goat and the asparagus with romesco sauce. The goat was incredibly tender and beautifully flavored, served with potatoes and roasted tomatoes, my friend, that was concerned about eating goat, ate the whole thing! The asparagus served with the romesco sauce were perfectly grilled and the sauce worked great with this dish.<br><br>The surprise was the dessert. We had a delicious chocolate cake served with mandarin ice cream (following the recommendation of our server) that was out of this world, and an Xixona style ice cream that tasted like almonds are supposed to taste, it really spoiled almonds for me! <br><br>The location of the restaurant is an old clock shop that was owned by Frederic Soler, an important literary figure in Barcelona, known as Serafi Pitarra. The place is covered with pictures from early Barcelona, and old clocks, it is worth a visit around the place, while you wait for your food to be ready.",

I am not exaggerating when I say this is the best restaurant in all of Spain!  Yes, we also found this spot thanks to a guide book.  What a wonderful surprise.  I was soo impressed i immediately wanted to e-mail the author and say &#34;Thank You&#34;!  This place embodies everything I imagined a Spanish restaurant would be!  I have been to many fine dining destinations and seriously this place rivals all of them.  <br><br>Location: Exterior -hidden and charming / Interior -rustic and chic (background music was super cool- jazz to classical pieces)<br><br>Food:    We ordered the &#34;Menu - Servit a la Barra which consisted of roasted chicken in  a harvest fruit sauce and potato puree, prefaced by an escarole bacon salad and finished with a lovely apple tartine.  We were also served this beautiful (seriously) and delicious medley of rustic breads and olives.  Their house wine was also solidly good.  Remember to have a carajillo to finish off your meal.<br><br>Service - Warm, welcoming, friendly.  We loved our waitress!  We initially sat at the bar because it was less expensive.  However, we would have paid full price anyway  to sit and chat with the servers.  <br><br>Do not pass up this place.  It epitomizes Spain in all of it&#39;s splendor.",

Now that&#39;s how you get your seafood fix!<br><br>Yes it was pricy at €96 for the two of us, but worth every penny.  We couldn&#39;t even finish it.<br><br>And when they brought the check, they also brought us complimentary grappa and cakes.  Simply wonderful!  This will always be a mandatory stop for us.",

No way.&#34; <br><br>Well, as it turned out they were both very impressed and swore they will come back soon. <br><br>As for my boyfriend and I, it was our first paella so I don&#39;t know if our opinion counts -- but my boyfriend doesn&#39;t normally eat fish yet he ate the whole plate. I think that&#39;s a good sign. <br><br>The owners are very personable and still baffled that so many people come to their restaurant. &#34;Somebody wrote something online then everybody started coming!&#34;  Ahh technology. <br><br>Out waiter was hilarious, in a very sarcastic way.

We made reservations but it was just after 8 so they just reopened and weren&#39;t too busy yet. Food was great my hubby got a pizza and I got mushroom chicken and it was delicious. It was a great price considering most of the places near by we&#39;re more pricey. Pizza was 9 euro chicken was 10 euro and big portions. House wine was 3.20 euro.

"reviewcomment":"4.5 stars<br><br>Super excited about my first OVERSEAS review. Would love to make yelp abroad a resource, allows for travelers even more options to really look for the great places to eat.<br><br>Went here 9/2011 for a trip of the northern part of Spain. Alkimia has been well talked about amongst the chowhound community and we&#39;re so glad we made it here.<br><br>Atmosphere: 1-michelin star, fine dining.  Modern and mostly subdued.  Go for the pre-fixe dinner, well worth the price.<br><br>Service: this is where they lost 0.5 stars. the service was hurried. the staff didn&#39;t spend too much time on explaining the food perhaps due to a language barrier.  so at first glance you would assume the food is just not as good due to its lackluster service, but WRONG. the food was just the opposite.<br><br>Food:  Very modern, flavors all spot on.  We ate at many fine dining establishments on this trip and I felt this place was one of the few that didn&#39;t have a few dishes that were overally salted.  All the classic catalan ingredients (all very fine) and done in a modern, clean way. <br>Favorites: Squid in it&#39;s own ink/ginger - very rich but oh so wonderful.  Oyster/beef cheek - similar texture but obviously different tasting profiles. Tomatoes/sea beans/fish - quite acidic, but all went well perfectly together. <br><br>Overall, very different than the cuisine we would encounter in the states.  Spanish fine dining concentrates so much on the freshness of the ingredient and are experts at preparing seafood.  Can&#39;t say enough how lovely this dining experience was for us (minus so-so service).<br><br>In the Cinc Sentis vs Alkimia debate - they are both sublety different so I would say must try both, but if I only had room for one, I would pick Alkimia.",

But come on, just wash your hands before dinner.<br><br> The food is not completely different from some Spanish dishes, but nonetheless delicious. They offer big plates for three or six persons to share.<br><br> Most of the tables and chairs in the restaurant are smaller than normally, but they have normal sized ones as well.",

"reviewcomment":"Foie gras burger was hands down the BEST lunch near the Picasso Museum. Perfectly cooked resting on top of sea salted potato in a delicious olive oil. Heaven.  The olive oil they use is magical pixie dust. <br><br>Service was slow at first, but once they submit the order via wireless device, food comes out like the Jetson&#39;s cartoon. Our server brought out complimentary patatas bravas without the mayo aioli for the kids. Bravo for the bravas !! <br><br>Extensive wine list and menu &#34;del dia&#34; included, appetizer, entree, &amp; dessert for 9.95 Euro. Completely worth it.

"reviewcomment":"Love this place- even though it might be somewhat expensive, it&#39;s very much worth the price. <br><br>When I go to Thai restaurants, my go-to dish is generally some sort of green curry dish. What I can definitely say in the case of Thai Barcelona, is that their green curry with chicken did not at all disappoint (in fact, it was quite delicious!). What I especially liked was their attention to detail in the presentation of the food - even though it may seem inconsequential, it is very much in keeping with the overall aesthetic of the establishment. Although I don&#39;t remember exactly what the rest of my party ordered, I can remember that they were as satisfied with their meal as I was, if not even more. <br><br>In addition to the great food, the restaurant itself is lovely, very tastefully decorated in a classy sort of Oriental style. The place is clearly more of a fine-dining establishment than your usual tapas bar in the area, and the price of the meals does tend to reflect that, in addition to reflecting its very central location.",

"reviewcomment":"OMG What a night we had at CDLC. First thing that gets you when entering this place at 11pm on a saturdayevening is the huge amount of beautiful women. (and off course all the buddha&#39;s and VIP beds, secretly hidden with white curtains). We got the best table of the house, the round one in the middle of the veranda with beachview. Even before taking orders the massage ladies come and start to treat your neck and shoulders ..... To keep things easy (we were party of 8) we ordered all the Chef&#39;s Menu (a surprising five-dish menu that blends the best of the Orient and Occident).  WOW WOW WOW the best choice you can make, tuna, hamashi, wagyu, ..... only the best for the best !  They have very good wines and nice big cocktails. At 01AM they take out some tables and the centre part becomes the club where we danced and drank till closing which is at 4AM. But no worries, the neighboring club Opium stays open till 6 .... ;o)",

"reviewcomment":"On our first night in Europe we wanted to go to a nice restaurant. After a ton of research we decided on Casa Calver; partly because the menu looked amazing and partly because it was in a Antoni Gaudí building.  Gaudí was a world famous architect who&#39;s buildings look like they came straight out of a Dr. Seuss book. The pictures aren&#39;t that great because I didn&#39;t want to use my flash in such a fancy restaurant. Sorry!<br><br>We started out with two starters meant to be shared.<br><br>After we ordered they brought out this cream soup with rabbit. They make a soup every night and it&#39;s included with your meal. The texture was great, very silky, and the added bonus of a little rabbit meat was great.<br><br>The &#34;Small plate of spider crab croquettes with guacamole and vegetable chips&#34; had a strong flavor (spider crabs can do that) but were good. The star of the dish was the guacamole though, you could taste every ingredient in it. Amazing.<br><br>The &#34;Small plate of crispy tomatoes, gorgonzola cheese and black olives&#34; was very good. It was wrapped in a thin crisp pastry and was like a little flavor bomb.<br><br>The &#34;Saddle of rabbit with tarragon and apple jelly and rice noodles with soya&#34; was the best thing I ate in Europe and the best rabbit I&#39;ve ever had, and I&#39;ve had a lot. The sweetness of the sauce was perfect with the savory meat and noodles.<br><br>The &#34;Pistachio-crusted lamb chops, tomato garlic mayonnaise and vegetable terrine&#34; simple but perfect. It was extremely flavorful.<br><br>The &#34;Apple tart tatin with cream ice cream&#34; is a simple dish but when done well it&#39;s unforgettable, this one was.  The ice cream had a beautiful silky texture and the apple had more flavor in it than any I had ever had.<br><br>Alisha ordered the &#34;Guanaja chocolate cake with avocado cream and lime and mint sorbet&#34;. The cake had the perfect texture and was not too sweet and the mint sorbet was a great pallet cleanser. I was interested to try the avocado cream, because I had never had it in a sweet dish, lets just say I will again! It was so good, not too sweet but just sweet enough.<br><br>Casa Calvet is one of the best restaurants we&#39;ve ever eaten at, hands down. The food was amazing, the service was extremely hospitable and prompt (something some high end restaurants lack) and the decor is beautiful.  If you visit Barcelona you must check this place out!",

"reviewcomment":"If you are up for highly refined Spanish cousin in town then you have come to the right place. My girlfriend and I have arrived this place totally under dressed not knowing this place was so seemingly up class restaurant. We went in anyway, just try to embarrass ourselves; what do you know? It turned out to be a culinary experience. They have eye dieseling menu but we ordered paella since we really are at beginners level of Spanish cuisine. It was brilliantly done. Rice cooked to perfection but fully infused with beautiful aroma of the prawns and saffron in the paella. A tad salty to accompany the wine the waiter could recommend if requested. Nothing else was in it but it is the beauty of such a simple version of this traditional Spanish dish. Be prepared to pay for the exquisite food as well as the exceptional service.<br><br>In our honest opinion it is well worth it.<br>It would defiantly help if you dress up for it especially if you can&#39;t deal with the embarrassment standing out from the rest of the dinners in a bad way which I barely survived from.",

The first time I was drew in by the live music, which only happens on wednesday evening, but then I come back several times &#39;cause I fell in love with the place. The food and the drinks (try the mojito) are prepared with attention and passion. The selection of wine is good and the beautiful music is carefully hand picked. The staff is very friendly and speaks fluently many languages (english, italian, french among others) so no traveller will feel out of place.<br><br>To sum it up: if you&#39;ll be in Barcelona, even only for one night, you have to try this place.",

"reviewcomment":"Xaloc was one of my favorite tapas restaurant during my last visit to Barcelona! Located in the Gothic Quarter, couple blocks away from the Cathedral and Mercat de la Boqueria.<br><br>We&#39;ve ordered array of tapas dishes to share. Following are some of the dishes that really stood out:<br><br>1. Pan de Coca(1.70 Euros)~ It&#39;s a traditional Catalan bread. A rustic bread with crispy crust and fluffy doughy center, which was lighted toasted, topped off with drills of olive oil and smeared with fresh tomato slices. So simple, yet satisfying.<br><br>2. IBERIAN HAM(6.90 Euros)~ Authentic Iberian pork, which was thinly sliced, cured. It&#39;s one of their signature dish, melts in your mouth with salty and nutty flavors.<br><br>3. Croquetas(2.9 Euros)~ Iberian Ham Croquettes, 3 pieces of deep fried potato croquettes stuffed with Iberian Ham, creamy and crunchy.<br><br>4. Ensaladilla Iberica(2.90 Euros)~ Iberian Salad. It&#39;s an egg salad with diced potatoes and sprinkles of cayan pepper.<br><br>5.Tortilla Con Choriz(4.90 Euros)~ SPANISH TORTILLA WITH CHORIZO<br><br>6. Nuevos Fritos(7.60 Duros)~ FRIED EGGS WITH POTATOES &amp; IBERIAN HAM<br><br>7. Tortilla Con Bacalao(4.90 Euros)~ SPANISH TORTILLA WITH CODFISH<br><br>8. Mejillones Vapor(6.40 Euros)~ STEAMED MUSSELS. Big enough to share, the mussels were fresh and succulent, simply prepared with white wine, parsley, lemon and garlic.<br><br>9. Torrijas(3.5 Euros)~ FRIED BREAD IN CINAMMON &amp; MILK, a sweet, airy crunchy donuts that&#39;s more delicious than candy.<br><br>The waiters had perfect English and great recommendations, an absolute must try restaurant!",

"reviewcomment":"You know what&#39;s an unusual sight? Entering a pub where everyone&#39;s staring intensely at the futbol game on television. I know I&#39;m in a major futbol country, but the Spanish are much louder. I look closer. Lighter complexions, yellow jerseys, aha! Dortmund versus Arsenal, a German runs this establishment, therefore German futbol. Mystery solved. <br><br>Not knowing whether to wade through the crowd and block a view, I waited near the back. Finally, someone came to take my order. It&#39;s a small menu featuring burgers and German sausages, fries, wings, and beer. For beer, you have cheap or good. I chose good and asked for something dark. I was forewarned it was the most expensive, but I accepted. For food, I ordered the well regarded Devil Burger and Fries. The waiter asked me where I was from. I say &#34;Colorado&#34;. In response, he asks confirming &#34;so, you don&#39;t want mayo, right?&#34; Correct. They serve you mayo for an extra €.30 and perhaps mild scorn if you&#39;re sporting anything but a Spanish accent. <br><br>I received the beer and discovered the server&#39;s sister lives in Boulder, Colorado. He&#39;s visited numerous times for skiing and loves our scenery. Go Colorado!<br><br>I received my burger, but screwed something up in the progress. They give you white waxy paper for eating and the chef reached with his metal spatula on which the hamburger lay. I inadvertently touched the spatula trying to help. My future advice- just move the wax paper so it&#39;s easier. The only available seat was tucked in the far back corner, a longer reach for him.<br><br>The burger was great. The meat was flavorful, the bun hearty, some juices ran. The fries were a welcome sight also, nearly covered completely in paprika. You should see all the sauces I had. When in a German restaurant, go with the Curry Sauce. Delicious, especially when applied on my burger too.<br><br>After the game, people cleared out relatively rapidly. I took my ticket up to the register and paid. They have a different system when the game is on. Assuming you want to watch every minute, they&#39;ll hand you your ticket and you&#39;ll pay afterwards. Good futbol loving system.",

It&#39;s a fun environment but you need to be assertive and loud enough to make your order. The food is all in a glass-encased window at the counter and you can select what you want, it gets piled on a plate, set at the kitchen window and comes back cooked/fried.  We tried the potatoes topped with a red spicy sauce, croquette&#39;s, sardines (or other small fish as I don&#39;t really know what they were), some sort of fried pig skin/fat, and calamari. When ordering such food, the best way to wash it down is with a beer. If you have  a weak stomach, this may not be a great place to eat as the food is, as mentioned, deep-fried (needless to say, I wasn&#39;t feeling the greatest the next day). Although, that could be contributed to lack of water, sleep and too much to drink mixed with fried/greasy food. Regardless, I still recommend going there and yes, I would go back.",

"reviewcomment":"On our first night in Europe we wanted to go to a nice restaurant. After a ton of research we decided on Casa Calver; partly because the menu looked amazing and partly because it was in a Antoni Gaudí building.  Gaudí was a world famous architect who&#39;s buildings look like they came straight out of a Dr. Seuss book. The pictures aren&#39;t that great because I didn&#39;t want to use my flash in such a fancy restaurant. Sorry!<br><br>We started out with two starters meant to be shared.<br><br>After we ordered they brought out this cream soup with rabbit. They make a soup every night and it&#39;s included with your meal. The texture was great, very silky, and the added bonus of a little rabbit meat was great.<br><br>The &#34;Small plate of spider crab croquettes with guacamole and vegetable chips&#34; had a strong flavor (spider crabs can do that) but were good. The star of the dish was the guacamole though, you could taste every ingredient in it. Amazing.<br><br>The &#34;Small plate of crispy tomatoes, gorgonzola cheese and black olives&#34; was very good. It was wrapped in a thin crisp pastry and was like a little flavor bomb.<br><br>The &#34;Saddle of rabbit with tarragon and apple jelly and rice noodles with soya&#34; was the best thing I ate in Europe and the best rabbit I&#39;ve ever had, and I&#39;ve had a lot. The sweetness of the sauce was perfect with the savory meat and noodles.<br><br>The &#34;Pistachio-crusted lamb chops, tomato garlic mayonnaise and vegetable terrine&#34; simple but perfect. It was extremely flavorful.<br><br>The &#34;Apple tart tatin with cream ice cream&#34; is a simple dish but when done well it&#39;s unforgettable, this one was.  The ice cream had a beautiful silky texture and the apple had more flavor in it than any I had ever had.<br><br>Alisha ordered the &#34;Guanaja chocolate cake with avocado cream and lime and mint sorbet&#34;. The cake had the perfect texture and was not too sweet and the mint sorbet was a great pallet cleanser. I was interested to try the avocado cream, because I had never had it in a sweet dish, lets just say I will again! It was so good, not too sweet but just sweet enough.<br><br>Casa Calvet is one of the best restaurants we&#39;ve ever eaten at, hands down. The food was amazing, the service was extremely hospitable and prompt (something some high end restaurants lack) and the decor is beautiful.  If you visit Barcelona you must check this place out!",

"reviewcomment":"If you are up for highly refined Spanish cousin in town then you have come to the right place. My girlfriend and I have arrived this place totally under dressed not knowing this place was so seemingly up class restaurant. We went in anyway, just try to embarrass ourselves; what do you know? It turned out to be a culinary experience. They have eye dieseling menu but we ordered paella since we really are at beginners level of Spanish cuisine. It was brilliantly done. Rice cooked to perfection but fully infused with beautiful aroma of the prawns and saffron in the paella. A tad salty to accompany the wine the waiter could recommend if requested. Nothing else was in it but it is the beauty of such a simple version of this traditional Spanish dish. Be prepared to pay for the exquisite food as well as the exceptional service.<br><br>In our honest opinion it is well worth it.<br>It would defiantly help if you dress up for it especially if you can&#39;t deal with the embarrassment standing out from the rest of the dinners in a bad way which I barely survived from.",

"reviewcomment":"Ziryab has quickly become my favorite place in Barcelona. The first time I was drew in by the live music, which only happens on wednesday evening, but then I come back several times &#39;cause I fell in love with the place. The food and the drinks (try the mojito) are prepared with attention and passion. The selection of wine is good and the beautiful music is carefully hand picked. The staff is very friendly and speaks fluently many languages (english, italian, french among others) so no traveller will feel out of place.<br><br>To sum it up: if you&#39;ll be in Barcelona, even only for one night, you have to try this place.",

"reviewcomment":"Xaloc was one of my favorite tapas restaurant during my last visit to Barcelona! Located in the Gothic Quarter, couple blocks away from the Cathedral and Mercat de la Boqueria.<br><br>We&#39;ve ordered array of tapas dishes to share. Following are some of the dishes that really stood out:<br><br>1. Pan de Coca(1.70 Euros)~ It&#39;s a traditional Catalan bread. A rustic bread with crispy crust and fluffy doughy center, which was lighted toasted, topped off with drills of olive oil and smeared with fresh tomato slices. So simple, yet satisfying.<br><br>2. IBERIAN HAM(6.90 Euros)~ Authentic Iberian pork, which was thinly sliced, cured. It&#39;s one of their signature dish, melts in your mouth with salty and nutty flavors.<br><br>3. Croquetas(2.9 Euros)~ Iberian Ham Croquettes, 3 pieces of deep fried potato croquettes stuffed with Iberian Ham, creamy and crunchy.<br><br>4. Ensaladilla Iberica(2.90 Euros)~ Iberian Salad. It&#39;s an egg salad with diced potatoes and sprinkles of cayan pepper.<br><br>5.Tortilla Con Choriz(4.90 Euros)~ SPANISH TORTILLA WITH CHORIZO<br><br>6. Nuevos Fritos(7.60 Duros)~ FRIED EGGS WITH POTATOES &amp; IBERIAN HAM<br><br>7. Tortilla Con Bacalao(4.90 Euros)~ SPANISH TORTILLA WITH CODFISH<br><br>8. Mejillones Vapor(6.40 Euros)~ STEAMED MUSSELS. Big enough to share, the mussels were fresh and succulent, simply prepared with white wine, parsley, lemon and garlic.<br><br>9. Torrijas(3.5 Euros)~ FRIED BREAD IN CINAMMON &amp; MILK, a sweet, airy crunchy donuts that&#39;s more delicious than candy.<br><br>The waiters had perfect English and great recommendations, an absolute must try restaurant!",

"reviewcomment":"You know what&#39;s an unusual sight? Entering a pub where everyone&#39;s staring intensely at the futbol game on television. I know I&#39;m in a major futbol country, but the Spanish are much louder. I look closer. Lighter complexions, yellow jerseys, aha! Dortmund versus Arsenal, a German runs this establishment, therefore German futbol. Mystery solved. <br><br>Not knowing whether to wade through the crowd and block a view, I waited near the back. Finally, someone came to take my order. It&#39;s a small menu featuring burgers and German sausages, fries, wings, and beer. For beer, you have cheap or good. I chose good and asked for something dark. I was forewarned it was the most expensive, but I accepted. For food, I ordered the well regarded Devil Burger and Fries. The waiter asked me where I was from. I say &#34;Colorado&#34;. In response, he asks confirming &#34;so, you don&#39;t want mayo, right?&#34; Correct. They serve you mayo for an extra €.30 and perhaps mild scorn if you&#39;re sporting anything but a Spanish accent. <br><br>I received the beer and discovered the server&#39;s sister lives in Boulder, Colorado. He&#39;s visited numerous times for skiing and loves our scenery. Go Colorado!<br><br>I received my burger, but screwed something up in the progress. They give you white waxy paper for eating and the chef reached with his metal spatula on which the hamburger lay. I inadvertently touched the spatula trying to help. My future advice- just move the wax paper so it&#39;s easier. The only available seat was tucked in the far back corner, a longer reach for him.<br><br>The burger was great. The meat was flavorful, the bun hearty, some juices ran. The fries were a welcome sight also, nearly covered completely in paprika. You should see all the sauces I had. When in a German restaurant, go with the Curry Sauce. Delicious, especially when applied on my burger too.<br><br>After the game, people cleared out relatively rapidly. I took my ticket up to the register and paid. They have a different system when the game is on. Assuming you want to watch every minute, they&#39;ll hand you your ticket and you&#39;ll pay afterwards. Good futbol loving system.",

"reviewcomment":"While my husband and I were in Barcelona, we wanted to enjoy some traditional Catalan cuisine. We were told this was the spot. <br><br>We arrived just before the doors opened for lunch and there was a line of people waiting to get in. A good sign, I suppose. It&#39;s a large restaurant, so we were seated almost immediately once the doors opened. The couple next to us quickly figured out we were tourists and engaged us in conversation. He was excited to see us in here because apparently this is where the locals go. Excellent. I wish we could have talked more, but my Spanish is not up to par.<br><br>It was menu del dia time! Fish soup for me, canelones for my husband, and we went crazy and got veal stew and the pig trotter stew as the entree. Lots of wine to drink (of course). The first course was excellent. We should talk sometime about how much I love canelones. I&#39;m thinking we went a little too experimental for the second course. The stews were both good but kind of similar to each other and pigs trotters are fattier than I thought. So the second course was good but not great. Dessert was chocolate cake for my husband and a whiskey tart for me. Both were quality, but I preferred the whiskey tart.<br><br>Prices were very good, but the service was slow at times (particularly at the end, as our server disappeared for half an hour before we got our check). Definitely worth checking out. If I was to come back, I&#39;d eat that fried calamari the couple next to us got. It looked awesome.",

"reviewcomment":"Cuines Santa Caterina was one of the restaurants that were recommended to us by a local as a restaurant that he takes his American friends to dine when they visit. Located in the Mercat de Santa Caterina, the decor of this restaurant is gorgeous. What I very much appreciated was the menu that an engineer can appreciate. It was a grid to break down their dishes by the type of cuisine in which the dish belonged, and the main ingredients it uses.<br><br>We waited about 15 minutes for a table, and it did take a little while for a server to come ask us what we wanted, but they were also very busy, which I had a feeling was typical of the restaurant on most nights. We ordered three dishes, a mixed vegetable dish, a chorizo with foie gras dish, and a chicken paella. All three dishes were delicious, but I would have to say that the chorizo with foie gras dish was our favourite. I loved the chorizo, and my wife loved the foie gras.<br><br>I would definitely recommend this restaurant if you visit Barcelona.",

I sat downstairs at the bar and enjoyed listening to the other diners converse in Catalan and English. If San Francisco, had a hip Catalan restaurant it would be just like this place. <br><br>The food was also fantastic. I had the salad of the day with red leaf lettuce, carrots,  tomatoes, tofu and bean sprouts. It was awesome.  All the produce was fresh and the tofu was not soggy, but firm and super flavorful. I know it wasn&#39;t the most traditional choice,  but after traveling through Italy and not seeing very much in the realm of veggies I was craving some greens. <br><br>I had the chicken in yogurt sauce for my second course. It was super tender and just fell right of the bone. It was in a creamy, super fragrant yellow yogurt sauce. It was served along side some equally well cooked potatoes. <br><br>I had chocolate cake with a small glass of sweet wine as my last course, which was good. Nothing spectacular, probably should have gone the way of the locals and asked about the cheesecake or flan.",

We came hungry and decided to order a few too many things, though we were unaware how large the portions would be. We still managed to clean our plates and fill our bellies far past capacity because of how delicious everything was. We settled on duck pate, Russian and crab salads, potatoes brava, Jamon and chorizo with tomato bread, and some &#39;tasty goat cheese&#39;. Everything came out to be more than enough for the three of us, presented beautifully and paired nicely with the red wine we ordered. Everything was of high quality, and at a reasonable price.

Anyway, this definitely checks the box for awesome food at a good price. I&#39;ve been there twice now to get burritos, and each one I&#39;ve had (the Supercarnes and the Cubano I think) has been very good.<br>For the Americans out there, if you want a Chipotle comparison, I would say that the burritos here are unquestionably better, and taste more natural and have more flavor. <br>As another reviewer commented, the hot sauce selection is really good as well. In Spain, it&#39;s very difficult to find *actual* hot sauce so it was nice that this place had an assortment of them. <br>Anyway, if you are here long term or even just swinging by Gracia for the day and hungry, I&#39;d say it warrants a visit.",

"reviewcomment":"Determined to work our way through the Michelin-starred Catalan restaurants in Barcelona, this was a most wonderful stop on our list.  Right next door to our hotel, it was so convenient to stumble back (quietly) afterwards after so much excellent wine.  The meal was first-rate, service was as tremendous as could be given that most of the restaurant was taken up with an enormous private party, which they made up for with complementary wine (always welcome) and seating us above in our own semi-private alcove, complete with a little library of old books to entertain ourselves.<br><br>We left feeling like we experienced a real bit of Barcelona, and some of the best and thoughtful food we&#39;d eaten to date.  Love, love, love.",

"reviewcomment":"Knowing it would be our last meal in Spain, we picked this place after finding excellent reviews. We came hungry and decided to order a few too many things, though we were unaware how large the portions would be. We still managed to clean our plates and fill our bellies far past capacity because of how delicious everything was. We settled on duck pate, Russian and crab salads, potatoes brava, Jamon and chorizo with tomato bread, and some &#39;tasty goat cheese&#39;. Everything came out to be more than enough for the three of us, presented beautifully and paired nicely with the red wine we ordered. Everything was of high quality, and at a reasonable price. You can&#39;t go wrong with that combination.",

"reviewcomment":"This place was just what we needed in Barcelona - get, delicious food &amp; booze, a 1 minute walk from our Airbnb flat with lovely staff and comfy seating. <br><br>We visited here when we realised things were looking tight in the Euros department. We popped in to find the long counter covered in pintxos - a huge range that were refreshed often and clearly marked with veggie options. Each pintxos was €1, just grab a plate and load it up. Too easy. Drinks were also really cheap - small wine and beer were also €1. <br><br>I enjoyed everything I ate here - and we are a lot. I think we returned 3 times in our visit and each visit was around €10 which is crazy good value for a meal for two with drinks. Every staff member we spoke to was lovely and helpful. It had a really nice relaxed vibe and awesome music - Elvis one day, Beatles the next. <br><br>This place is well worth a visit, I&#39;d go out of my way to return here if we go back to Barcelona.",

"reviewcomment":"While my husband and I were in Barcelona, we wanted to enjoy some traditional Catalan cuisine. We were told this was the spot. <br><br>We arrived just before the doors opened for lunch and there was a line of people waiting to get in. A good sign, I suppose. It&#39;s a large restaurant, so we were seated almost immediately once the doors opened. The couple next to us quickly figured out we were tourists and engaged us in conversation. He was excited to see us in here because apparently this is where the locals go. Excellent. I wish we could have talked more, but my Spanish is not up to par.<br><br>It was menu del dia time! Fish soup for me, canelones for my husband, and we went crazy and got veal stew and the pig trotter stew as the entree. Lots of wine to drink (of course). The first course was excellent. We should talk sometime about how much I love canelones. I&#39;m thinking we went a little too experimental for the second course. The stews were both good but kind of similar to each other and pigs trotters are fattier than I thought. So the second course was good but not great. Dessert was chocolate cake for my husband and a whiskey tart for me. Both were quality, but I preferred the whiskey tart.<br><br>Prices were very good, but the service was slow at times (particularly at the end, as our server disappeared for half an hour before we got our check). Definitely worth checking out. If I was to come back, I&#39;d eat that fried calamari the couple next to us got. It looked awesome.",

Also for those who prefer milder seasoning, you may want to ask for less salt. <br><br>Gazpacho and the calamares were also delicious.<br><br> I&#39;m not sure if it was the language barrier but when we ordered two paellas for the four of us the waiter looked surprised and told us it was not enough, that the plate was small, so we ordered 3. But each one was definitely a full size paella so we could only finish two by the time we were full! I suggest one paella for two people is plenty for a large lunch if you don&#39;t already know. <br><br>- gazpacho<br>- calamares <br>- mixed paella<br>- fiduea <br><br>Also the dining environment is quite beautiful as it is open to the air.",

They are French people, from an area of France were the crepes were invented, so all is said. <br>They only serve crepes, salty and sweet. And they have this awesome slightly-sparkly French white wine (called &#39;cidre&#39;) that French people usually drink when eating crepes.<br>Crepes from here are really amazing. I always do the classic Nutella chocolate. If you try it once, you&#39;ll be addicted forever.",

"reviewcomment":"When I first walked into this place, I thought that it was dingy and was ready to leave for another tapas place after one drink. There were only two tables of customers, one large table and one small table. A few minutes in however, I started to change my mind. We ordered a few tapas which looked extremely ordinary and sat down at a table. The other larger table (apparently a table of Australians) just left, and the owner came to chat with his limited English. He was extremely friendly and I think he was particularly pleased with the fact that there were international visitors at his restaurant. Our waiter, a very pleasant white-haired old man who also didn&#39;t speak any English, gestured numerous wine and tapa recommendations to us. He was the sweetest old man and constantly came back to make sure we were taken care of. Although the fork and knife that we were given were slightly stained, we enjoyed the food and the overall experience. They didn&#39;t have a menu and served some dishes of the day, including sautéed snails, olives and sardines, roasted partridge, and tomato paste bread. The whole restaurant/bar was eventually full of locals who just seemed to enjoy their time with a coffee and/or wine. Another old customer behind us deliberately came over to show us how to eat the snails properly, and made recommendations on a mint-liquor expresso at the end of the meal. The visit made us feel the warmth of Barcelona locals and truly experience what it means to live as a Catalonian. Wonderful!",

And the view from the highway leading up to the bar is one of the best in the city. This is the place the locals go to.<br><br>I recommend the following:<br><br>Patatas bravas: great sauce and great spuds. <br><br>Mejellones: Simply the best I have had in Spain. They are HUGE and the garlic limon sauce is excellent. This plate alone is worth coming for.<br><br>jamon serrano: this is a platter that comes with cheese, great plate.<br><br>Calimare: not too greasy, large portions, solid choice<br><br>The food is for sharing and it is great for large groups. The seating outside is nice but on weekends and evenings you&#39;ll have to wait.<br><br>The best way to get here is via taxi, the hill going up is steep, it is not so bad going down hill though.",

Make sure to take reservation before going there, it&#39;s usually crowded! <br><br>The other place is called Kshunka (I might be sleeping it wrong) Its much more expensive than Shunka but it worth every penny you pay!! And if you go for the tasting menu get the 110 Euro one, its more expensive but then its only 30 Euros more! It is a great experience!

"reviewcomment":"There were a few days left in BCN, &amp; there was serious shopping to be done. I thought I&#39;d try saving some € by spending less on food. I&#39;d been wanting to try Maoz Falafel since reading the reviews here, so I made my way there in the morning, before doing my shopping. I found myself standing in front of the food joint at around 9:50AM, waiting for Maoz to open. This woman came &amp; unlocked the door, &amp; told me they wouldn&#39;t be open until 11 AM. Oh.<br><br>I really, really wanted to try the food here, so I went back at around 11:30AM after doing some shopping. I saw these girls standing outside, having a cig. I went in &amp; they followed suit, sat themselves at 1 of the 2 tables. There was also a family there (2 boys, &amp; dad), so both tables were taken. Luckily, as it turned out, the family was on their way to the airport to catch their flight (I know this because the dad kept saying &#34;our chips!&#34; &amp; had an argument with the Maoz guy, &amp; while all this was going on, the dad with the unibrow kept getting olives directly from the tray &amp; leaving the seeds on the counter.....srsly dude..), &amp; so 1 of the 2 tables was free for me to grab. I placed my collapsible shopping bag there to &#34;reserve&#34; my seat. Hehe.<br><br>If you&#39;re going to eat at Maoz &amp; want their salad buffet, you&#39;re gonna need to eat in. I ordered the falafel with salad buffet + a soda &amp; paid I think €5+ for everything. I refilled my bowl with sides &amp; sauces a couple of times. I was stuffed, &amp; didn&#39;t feel hungry until the following day. Thanks to Maoz, there was 1 day that I spent only around €5 for food in BCN. Phenomenal. Only at Maoz. More € for shopping. Hehe.<br><br>Note: the falafel with salad comes with greens, &amp; a single (small) falafel. I&#39;m reading reviews from another reviews site, &amp; someone said she got 3 falafels. So I dunno. The sides are the ones you can get as much as you want of, &amp; they are so delicious that you wouldn&#39;t know which one to get. I got a bit of everything, &amp; thought the fried broccoli was super (never had that before, I think).",

"reviewcomment":"Stumbled upon Mandarosso Pastis on Good Friday when virtually the entire city was shut down.  This little cafe, however, was open and looked incredibly inviting. It was cool, rainy and we were hungry.  The three places we attempted to go for brunch were closed for the holiday and, as fate would have it, we were led to this place. <br><br>It was fantastic in every way -- from the quaint hipstery vibe with an old record player playing classic Elton John, to the glass counter filled with decadent pastries. <br><br>Both the chalkboard hanging above the record player and the individual, hand-scripted cardboard menus are written in Catalan so, as we entered and tried to figure out what to do -- how to order, what to order.  We must have looked like two confused, lost souls because the the singular employee who was behind the counter washing up the dishes taking orders and making food, stopped what she was doing and came over to help us out.  She was so incredibly friendly and helpful, and between her broken English and my even more broken Spanish we sorted everything out.  <br><br>We ordered two sandwiches on bagels, which she of course made to perfection. The juice was delicious and the hot tea warmed me up from the inside.   It was a wonderful, cozy, and delightfully warm way to spend a few hours on a rainy Good Friday morning.  <br><br>If I was a Barcelona local (if only!!) this is exactly the type of place I&#39;d like to frequent.  Great food, Great service, Great atmosphere.",

Make sure to take reservation before going there, it&#39;s usually crowded! <br><br>The other place is called Kshunka (I might be sleeping it wrong) Its much more expensive than Shunka but it worth every penny you pay!! And if you go for the tasting menu get the 110 Euro one, its more expensive but then its only 30 Euros more! It is a great experience!

There was also some live music on that day and everybody was in a great mood.<br>They have a broad selection of sushi, japanese beer and some other drinks. The sushi was really delicious and not that expensive. Too bad that I was not hungrier, or maybe it was good for my wallet ;) <br>The only downside is the location of the restaurant, since most nightlife does not really happen around the Arc de Triompf. It&#39;s definitely worth the metro ride though.",

"reviewcomment":"Questo posto meriterebbe 6 stelle. Una serata abbastanza vuota, solo pochi tavoli occupati e non saprei dire se è necessaria una prenotazione. <br>Locale carino ed atmosfera soft ottima per  una cena romantica ma anche per serata tra amici. <br><br>Tapas da pauraaaaa.  <br>Veramente degli abbinamenti fantastici. <br>Cominciamo con i fichi con foie gras, sicuramente da provare una porzione e&#39; ok per un assaggio per una persona sola. Da non dividere altrimenti non si apprezza. <br><br>Camembert con marmellata di mirtilli da paura. Se amate la buona cucina penso che questo abbinamento sia uno dei migliori mai provati. <br>In questo caso la porzione e&#39; di 4 pezzi per cui si può dividere in due tranquillamente se volete assaggiare un po&#39; tutto. <br><br>Gamberi con aglio e olio buoni ed abbastanza magari da ordinare alla fine per non alterare il gusto degli altri piatti. Attenzione a non ordinari assieme al resto altrimenti si raffredderanno. Porzione che si può dividere in due. <br><br>Melanzane fritte con miele anche questo abbinamento e&#39; molto buono. Un piatto si può tranquillamente dividere in due o tre.<br><br>Il consiglio e&#39; appunto di ordinare un po&#39; di tutto e dividere le singole porzioni. Ad eccezione dei fichi tutto il resto che ho qui elencato si può dividere.",

This is definitely a place for locals--at least some degree of Spanish is probably necessary, and I didn&#39;t hear a word of English from the other tables or from the servers while we were their.",

I chose the Ravioli with Mushroom Sauce and although there are only a few pieces of ravioli, it really fills you up. The mushroom sauce was extremely rich and other than mushrooms, there were also some sort of nuts or grains in the sauce. I couldn&#39;t figure it out. The filling was a cheese filling and went very well with the mushrooms. U had the Chicken with Peppers and Truffle. It was nicely presented on a wooden board with a skillet on top. She said the chicken was tender and the flavours worked well with each other. Extremely delicious she said! Last but not least, U and I shared a slice of Tiramisu. It was filled with chocolate and coffee goodness. A slight hint of alcohol and filled with cream and mascarpone cheese. So good!",

You go around the marketplace, select and pay for each dish separately, and then go to a table with your friends and dine; or you make new friends who may be other patrons sitting next to you. <br><br>Even the wine has its own stand, and this of course means it is sold at market price (not restaurant menu price).

The sushi was really delicious and not that expensive.

"reviewcomment":"It was my birthday so my friend suggested we go here for dinner to celebrate. It&#39;s kind of confusing when you walk I&#39;m whether you are supposed to wait to be seated or if you should just seat yourself so we just grabbed a seat at the bar. They have €3.50 mojitos. Make sure you stir it up or else you&#39;ll get a big sip filled with sugar which was an unexpected surprise. I was obsessed with the ice. I really couldn&#39;t get over how cool the ice cubes were. It&#39;s the simple things right? <br><br>Anyways we started with the chips and guacamole which, be forewarned I&#39;m pretty sure is not made with California avocados (!) but is still pretty tasty. For dinner I had the pulled pork quesadilla which was delicious. The meat was very flavorful. I don&#39;t usually order pork dishes but I may have to start. <br><br>The service was pretty terrible. The girl all but snatched the payment out of my hand. Made me want my pretty epic 12% tip back... I can&#39;t get used to this whole not tipping thing.",

"reviewcomment":"Authentic paella! I can be quite sure about that because I&#39;ve had paella my Spanish friends make that tastes like the ones here. The seafood in the seafood paella is good but not the freshest. Also for those who prefer milder seasoning, you may want to ask for less salt. <br><br>Gazpacho and the calamares were also delicious.<br><br> I&#39;m not sure if it was the language barrier but when we ordered two paellas for the four of us the waiter looked surprised and told us it was not enough, that the plate was small, so we ordered 3. But each one was definitely a full size paella so we could only finish two by the time we were full! I suggest one paella for two people is plenty for a large lunch if you don&#39;t already know. <br><br>- gazpacho<br>- calamares <br>- mixed paella<br>- fiduea <br><br>Also the dining environment is quite beautiful as it is open to the air.",

The owner Josep was the most friendly and welcoming person. The meals were always made fresh. The portions were plentiful. Each meal consisted of at least 2 large course and several smaller courses. The house wine was included with the meal and our glasses were never empty. Best of all, this wonderful home cooked meal was not expensive at all. Then again, at the time the dollar against the Euro.<br><br>Good times!!!",

The food, the cozy decor, the service. <br><br>The restaurant was almost empty when we came in on a Wednesday evening, but it made no difference. The service was friendly and the restaurant was welcoming. <br><br>The food was also well prepared. I started with the pumpkin soup while colleagues tried the zucchini carpaccio. Both were delicious. I tried the cod for my main dish (which had the most delicious tomato relish I&#39;ve ever had), but the steak and lamb dishes were very tasty as well. Dessert was something that resembled creme brulee and it was amazing. Overall, the food was well executed, with great flavors and it was all perfectly cooked. It was nice to get away from traditional tapas for a change.<br><br>Great inexpensive wine selection, and Norah Jones playing in the background. Felt like the perfect atmosphere for a date, or in my case, a date with co-workers. Would definitely come back!",

"reviewcomment":"A trendy bar-cafe with cosmopolitan business-chic. <br><br>We had been walking for twenty minutes late at night, on the prowl for late-night decaf, possibly beer (eventually we decided we would settle for mere potato chips, but no late night Macs in that section of Barcelona apparently). After walking past a dozen banks and a few small Mom and Pops bars with obvious regulars, we came upon Casa Martelo. It appeared like a strange oasis in a desert of closed shops and darkened windows. Businessmen and nicely dressed women sat in the small outdoor patio and ordered fancy dishes from the smartly dressed staff. Quite a surprise! <br><br>Atmosphere-<br>The decor is business-chic cafe. Not as pretentious as a lounge but still impeccably arranged and clean.  With silent sliding glass doors and gleaming golden wood floors and a 20 foot ceiling, it was hard not to be a little impressed at first glance. The bar glimmered with a wall of backlit liquor. Warm wood tables for two were completed with matching chairs. The outdoor seating was half-enclosed on the side facing the street, creating a cozy spot for people watching and enjoying your cafe con leche or a brew.  The classy cosmopolitan vibe means you can take your family but not feel out of place with your friends. Five or six wee tables outside underneath umbrellas and about the same inside, with a few larger tables buried near the back. The bar had stationary stools for approximately ten. <br><br>Food-<br>We opted for coffee and some lighter fare, considering it was near midnight and we were jet lagged. First off, the menu was in 5 languages and nicely designed. Much appreciated as a tourista. Secondly, the waiter was extremely helpful and took us by the hand, explaining the food at the bar, which was displayed behind glass. We were still getting used to the idea of having the food in a classy cafeteria style, in trays behind glass where we could see it.  We wanted something traditional and he helped us out by pointing out common dishes. The potato omelette was fat and delicious, not too salty or greasy. The potato was rich and thick, the egg not too chewy or soft. The tomato-rubbed bread came with the oil on the side, which was much appreciated. <br><br>The cuttlefish came chopped into bite sized peices, which was again much appreciated, as we were too darn tired and stupid to cut it up effectively ourselves. It was warm and simple, olive oil, garlic and minimal salt, laced with the good toasted taste of the grill. The whole thing was simple and delicious. <br><br>The coffee was gorgeously decorated with a chocolate drizzle in the foam. The coffee was nice and strong. By the time I got to the bottom of it, it was a tad too milky for my taste, but it was decent while it lasted. <br><br>Service-<br>Our server was fantastic. He was very helpful and friendly. He spoke impeccable English and put up with our terrible Spanish. He shared some travelling stories from New York and guessed correctly that wed come in just two nights ago. The first night, he said, you come in an take it easy and sleep. The next day you go 100 per cent and drive yourself into the bloody ground, which is why we looked like wed been hit by a truck. He was very informative and his chatty, down to earth attitude helped make my evening.<br><br>Convenience-<br>Located a bit out of the city core proper, away from La Rambla, but a great spot if youre in the neighborhood. Our hostel was near Badal station, and the resto was a 15 or 20 minute walk away. <br><br>Overall, we had a great experience and wed be happy to recommend it to others. A classy joint for the classy night owl out on the prowl for some good food late at night. The big windows would make it a great sunny breakfast spot as well. It isnt cramped or tiny and isnt a big tourist trap. To my uneduated Canadian sensibilities, the food seemed good quality and could be a great breather from the bustle of the city.",

"reviewcomment":"By far, the best sushi I&#39;ve had in Barcelona! SO good!! I wish I had found it sooner in my 3 month stay.<br><br>  One of my favorite things with sushi restaurants is a selection of creative rolls. I went to 3 sushi restaurants in the Barri Gottic and only this one had creative rolls. Maybe not a ton, but definitely some cool ones. There was a delicious duck roll and the tempura battered salmon roll was perfect! <br><br>  Also, if you happen to be from a big city &amp; you&#39;re used to being able to get whatever you want delivered, look no further! They deliver!! And they speak English, so it&#39;s perfect for ordering after a long day of strolling the city and you&#39;re in your hotel room and just want something that&#39;s not room service.

We speak fluent English and Spanish and ate there on a Monday for lunch.  Food seemed prepared days in advance with some items on a dish &#34;refrigerator cold&#34;, rather than hot, warm or room temperature (vegetables)  dishes extremely salted to the point of not being able to eat main courses and appetizers.  There were only 4 tables filled at a 2pm lunch reservation with each table whispering.  Dress was casual for patrons and the waiters tried to serve very formally--was not carried off well-- ie cups rattling as they were set on the table, amuse bouche branch with spoons shaken and set on top of existing silverware.  Our waiter made eye contact and talked only to my husband and to no one else at the table when each dish was set down.  The explanation was given in a whisper and deadpan, flat voice with no enthusiasm for the technique, ingredients or different presentation.  This is in sharp contrast to any other restaurant we ate in the last month--waiters are friendly, tell you what is best and what has just come in from the market, joke and want you to have a good time.  The service was poor, the food was mediocre and over salted.   This was not a one star restaurant experience and we felt angry at having wasted a meal here instead of the many wonderful Barcelona restaurants.",

That said, it&#39;s always really busy here, so I&#39;m not in a minority.<br><br> Origens is actually a small chain of shops and restaurants, that concentrate on Catalan food. You can order some of the dishes to take away. This isn&#39;t a linen cloth establishment, but the service is efficient and friendly. There can be a problem getting in though. You might have to go for a walk and come back in an hour.<br><br> The menu is a little magazine, (in Spanish and English) that includes some of the recipes, and stories behind your meal and the ingredients, most of which are locally sourced. There&#39;s a really wide selection of food, the idea is you order lots of bits. So, the more of you there are, the more you get to taste.<br><br> I especially recommend the simple toasted bread slice with tomato (we eat it like this at home now, you basically rub the tomato and garlic on the bread and eat it like that), then try the the stuffed aubergine and the haricot beans with sausage all followed with their delicious creme Catalan.<br><br> Basically I can&#39;t wait to get back to Barca, just so I can carry on exploring the menu.",

"reviewcomment":"Myself and 2 other friends were starving after walking around barcelona for quite sometime and ended up here. It&#39;s quite small, but they make up for it with their deliscious sandwiches. I thinks my sandwich and beer was 8euro. so it was extremely affordable and the food came out quick...it was none of that 3 hour long dining that many folks are used to around barcelona. It felt like we were in someone&#39;s personal kitchen. They even spoke a little english to explain the menu and make small talk. They loved that we came all the way from Texas. You won&#39;t be dissappointed by grabbing a quick bite here.",

"reviewcomment":"My husband and I were staying at the Regencia Colon, practically next door, so we stumbled upon Babia in our explorations. It&#39;s a great little, divey bar. Lots of wonderful art all over the place. Our first night we sat down at the bar and the bartender was extremely nice. He served us up a couple of cervezas and completely excused our poor Spanglish. Our second night going there, the bartender remembered us and chatted us up. His name is Rollo and he&#39;s very nice. He gave us some complimentary beers, cheese and a cd of his band. <br><br>  The atmosphere is great here, especially if you&#39;re looking for something nice in Barcelona near all the tourist stuff, but isn&#39;t an over-priced tourist trap.",

"reviewcomment":"OK, so we arrive at 9pm. There are three of us, and the waitress, somewhat rudely, explains that they have sittings at 8 and at 10:30 and if we want to eat, she needs the table at 10:30. We say fine, no problem. The tables are very tightly packed. When we arrived, there was one other table occupied, a three-top. We ordered for starters 2 servings of gyoza and some sushi - a couple of eel, a couple ebi and some california rolls. For main courses, we ordered katsudon, teriyaki chicken and a tuna-rice dish.<br>One serving of gyoza came out relatively quickly. They were a little on the small side, but tasted good. Then came the sushi - eel and ebi were fine, although the rice fell apart when you ate it. The california roll came with canned tuna. Strange. <br>A few more tables had arrived by this point, and every time one of the waitresses walked by, she would smack her belly into my back. No excuse me or anything, just...thump....thump...thump.<br>Then one of the waitresses unceremoniously dumped a board on the table with some chicken and lettuce on it. OK, that&#39;s the teriyaki, we guess. No rice. No explanation. <br>A long time later, another bowl is dumped on the table. It&#39;s rice covered in some glutinous looking stuff. I can&#39;t tell what it&#39;s supposed to be. I ask the waitress, who tells me it&#39;s the katsudon. OK. No gravy, the breading is mushy and kind of wet. <br>We wait some more, and I ask the waitress if it&#39;s normal that we still haven&#39;t received one of the appetizers (the other order of gyoza), or me my main course. She replies that that is normal japanese style of serving dinner. Nonsense.<br>A good while later (It&#39;s now past 10pm), she drops 2 orders of gyzoa on the table. I explain that we have already received one order. She looks flustered and then says that the second plate is a gift. <br>We eat the gyozas. I&#39;m still waiting for my main course and we joke that they will kick us out before we get it. Finally we tire of waiting, and I tell the waitress that we still haven&#39;t received one of our main courses, and that we would like the check.<br>I go to the bar on the way out to pay. She says that she can&#39;t deduct my main course from the computer, so she will have to do it manually. First calculator doesn&#39;t work. She rummages around and finds another one. Deducts my main course that never arrived from the bill. I look at the bill to make sure her math is correct. There is a charge on there for natto - which we didn&#39;t order and isn&#39;t even on the menu. There is a charge for daikatsu - don&#39;t know what it is and we didn&#39;t order it. There is a charge for dessert - we didn&#39;t order or receive it and wouldn&#39;t have had time to eat it even if we had. I protest these charges and she removes them from the bill. I ask if there is any kind of discount for the atrocious evening we&#39;ve had. She indignantly refuses. <br>Everything about this was a disaster. Terrible food, awful service, cramped seating. Avoid this place at all costs.",

"reviewcomment":"Oh hello, delicious tacos! We visited here for taco Sunday - three tacos for the crazy price of €8.50. The place is well decorated and I was captured by the cool print on the wall of the snowman and the mountain (I really want it!) as well as the lovely tiles. We were greeted by a lovely waitress who spoke impeccable Spanish, only to be revealed as an English lass when we  reverted to English to find out how the ordering worked. <br><br>They have a board up with the taco options - 5 different choices including pork, fish, prawn, mushroom and lamb. We ended up sampling all of them as well as the side of grilled corn. The food arrived pretty quickly and even though they forgot one of the tacos it was quickly rectified. I really loved the fish one - on the menu it was described as bacalao which is apparently like salt cod. It was lightly battered and super crunchy which was perfect in a soft shell taco. The prawn was also lovely and had generous sized prawns. <br><br>With a pretty relaxing environment yet super busy on a Sunday, this was a great place to grab a bite to eat. After three tacos I was really full and content with my meal - and especially at what good value it was.",

This was close and highly rated on Trip Advisor, so we gave it a shot. It&#39;s in interesting place. Sort of goofy looking from the front, but seems somewhat historic from the inside, with a nice, long wooden bar. If you&#39;ve ever been to Los Angles, it reminded me of Canter&#39;s on Fairfax: old, proud and with a style all its own. <br><br>We had a couple of large Estrella drafts and some bravas. We also had the best pan amb tomate we had anywhere in Catalunya...nice rustic bread, slightly charred, with just the right amount of olive oil and of course, the crushed tomatoes.<br><br>They seem to actively promote their live music, but we were there too early for that.",

"reviewcomment":"Cuines Santa Caterina was one of the restaurants that were recommended to us by a local as a restaurant that he takes his American friends to dine when they visit. Located in the Mercat de Santa Caterina, the decor of this restaurant is gorgeous. What I very much appreciated was the menu that an engineer can appreciate. It was a grid to break down their dishes by the type of cuisine in which the dish belonged, and the main ingredients it uses.<br><br>We waited about 15 minutes for a table, and it did take a little while for a server to come ask us what we wanted, but they were also very busy, which I had a feeling was typical of the restaurant on most nights. We ordered three dishes, a mixed vegetable dish, a chorizo with foie gras dish, and a chicken paella. All three dishes were delicious, but I would have to say that the chorizo with foie gras dish was our favourite. I loved the chorizo, and my wife loved the foie gras.<br><br>I would definitely recommend this restaurant if you visit Barcelona.",

The tuna sushi was the best of the meal and it was one of the best sushi I&#39;ve ever had. That&#39;s a high compliment since I eat a lot of Japanese food and it&#39;s one of my favorite cuisines. The rest of the meal - wonton, yakitori and others were not very memorable. They taste similar to what you&#39;d get in an authentic Asian restaurant. The portions were small since the dishes are tapas, so it is a bit pricey for the amount of food you get. Overall, the experience was still great so I&#39;m happy I tried it; but it&#39;s not special enough for me to return to when I go visit Barcelona again.<br><br><a href='/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fmonkeyseemonkeyfeast.blogspot.ca%2F2012%2F08%2Fdos-palilos.html&amp;s=c7c250d27557875a5ed074ccc89c84e2877beb957b112456cfb187c89d267ebb' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>monkeyseemonkeyfeast.blo…</a>",
