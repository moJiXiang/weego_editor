Fried Banana, Sweet Potato, and even a Tequila based ice cream were all on the menu and all were sure darn tasty. My favorite was the Fried Bananas (I need this in my life soon ASAP), followed by the Tequila and Sweet Potatoes. I never even know they made Tequila ice cream but def was feeling the taste and light hints on my palate. <br><br>Next time I host a party I think I&#39;ll reach out to this business. My friend said they cater to most flavors/ideas so I think this will be a nice treat for my guests, you know, something uniquely delicious. <br><br>I even heard I can scoop some flavors up at Whole Foods so I&#39;ll be looking for that if I get an itch prior..<br><br>All around very very tasty.",

The food is excellent, and the service is great.<br><br>The Burl Kogi Sammy offers a very unique taste that satisfies a particular (indescribable) craving. You will know what I mean the second you try it. <br>This place is very small, but there&#39;s no chance I will dock it a star for that. After all, it&#39;s in SF. If you have to eat close by and there is no room in the cafe, I recommend the short walk to Huntington or Union Sq. Park to eat in the sun. The service is great, the staff is beyond pleasant!<br><br>Check it out!",

"reviewcomment":"I had been entering the lottery for a party of 2 for months and months and months, so when I received word there would be a dinner the weekend our friends were coming to visit, I said, &#34;What the hey!&#34; and entered us for 4.  <br><br>The attention to detail that Lazy Bear expounds is unbelievable. Every plate, every bite is flawless. I have quite the laundry list of allergies and, while back in the kitchen -- which by the way they totally encourage you to go to and give you gelato if you do! -- I heard Chef David start to recite them by heart and make sure those ingredients were kept off my plate. <br><br>While the food (and the price) is nothing short of upscale, the experience is as relaxing and carefree as can be. BYOB (or wine in our case) and they&#39;ll even chill it for you if you&#39;d like. There is no pressure to dress up, the wonderful people running this joint are very gregarious and approachable, and everyone around you is making yummy sounds and having a good time, so you can too!<br><br>Our friends were at a loss for words afterwards, except to record every morsel they ate and muse over the incredible bread and butter. And all my fiancé had to say was, &#34;Enter us into the lottery from now until forever.&#34;",

"reviewcomment":"Prior to visiting Cowgirl Creamery, I knew jack about cheese. My first intro to &#34;cooking&#34; was to toast two slices of Kraft processed cheddar on white bread, and tried not to burn the hell out of it. This was when I was about 8 and had to make my own after school snack. Gourmet enough for an 8 year old, but heavily scoffed by the Mission Hipster (wait, aren&#39;t Mission Hipsters mostly Asian American TechHead dork types these days now wearing collar shirts and taking notes with a clip pen and paper pad at the sooshy bar? Doh...)<br><br>But as an adult, the world is thy oyster, or wheels and wheels and wheels of fine high end gourmet cheese! Such is the case at Cowgirl Creamery cheese store at the Ferry Building, a deli and a smorgasboard of variety.<br><br>We are blessed to live in an area that makes great use of natural quality resources, as well as having knowledgeable folks who turn this stuff into various types of magic. Cowgirl Creamery makes some unbelieveable cheese, but they also put in the effort of being a distributor of cheese made by other independent Californian cheese farmers/makers, so you can buy some very interesting selections in addition to their own products.<br><br>I dropped by CC with the intention of buying some cheese....but it wasn&#39;t for your average frou frou picnic of spreading Mt Tam with Acme bread, while downing a Blue Bottle or Sightglass with some Hog Island oysters and stone grilled Frog Hollow Farm peaches, followed by some porchetta sandwich, with a side of some Miette Cupcakes smothered with Boccalone lardo slices all around, some bao&#39;s from that funky Chinese place, and ending with a hot milk tea from Out The Door followed by a fun time on the throne... <br><br>The object of the game was to find several cheese varieties from hopefully a one stop shop (I actually made two separate stops in the end) to pair with three different flavor profiles of pinot noir wine, and a burgundy from France! I love a good challenge.<br><br>I settled on the following<br><br>Cowgirl Creamery&#39;s Red Hawk<br><br>Basseri from Baringa Ranch in Marshall, CA <br><br>Mt Tam (for a separate consumption)<br><br>Cypress Grove goat milk with dill<br><br>First of all, the Mt Tam is goregeous like everyone says. A really smooth triple cream with a hint of....mushroom. Great for any application, and you can even melt it with other cheese for whatever reason. It spreads great as well.<br><br>But...for wine pairing, particularly strong pinot noir and burgundy, the Red Hawk is a show stealer. It is as they say, a Mt Tam with a rind, but it is actually a bit firmer and pungent/stronger with a nice umami component. Much so that if you melt the Red Hawk a bit (e.g. for grilled cheese) it can be incredible, ditto for Mac Cheese. <br>But, you want to unwrap the cheese after purchasing and let it air out. The center then becomes a bit softer, and the more you eat and drink (wine), the more flavor intense it becomes. Burgundy (and pinot) pairs well with a stinky French cheese called Epoisse (which is the famous cheese from Burgundy region)....but with a Red Hawk, you can get something fairly close apparently. So if you have a pinot and a burgundy, drink the pinot first, and try some Red Hawk with it. Then let the Red Hawk sit, and then move on to the Burgundy....both will taste even more intense.<br><br>The Basseri (meaning &#34;farm house&#34;) is actually a Basque style sheep milk cheese. It is a firmer variety and also pairs incredibly well with a slightly lighter yet fruitier type of pinot noir (we were blessed to have Anthill pinot noir that evening). My first choice from CC was to try Fat Bottom Girl&#39;s sheep milk cheese, but they did not have that, so the salesperson recommended Basseri. Do try a sample of this!<br><br>OK I&#39;m done with cheese nerding out.<br><br>CC may not have all the varieties you have, but certainly worth a stop if you want to taste and get a very good selection of local artisanal cheese. Even if you are visiting from out of town, drop by and see this place for yourself. Remember to take a # from the right side wall, if you need help, have questions, or want to taste.",

"reviewcomment":"Submarine Center is most definitely one of my favorite places in the city.  I stumbled upon it by complete accident when I moved to the area last year, and I&#39;ve been frequenting this place, and introducing friends to it, ever since.  <br><br>Before I even get into the food, big shoutout to the guys who work at this place.  The employees here are awesome!  Although sometimes I wonder if they ever go home or take days off, because it&#39;s the same amazing guys in there making sandwiches every time I go in.  But it&#39;s great to always be welcomed by friendly faces, and they&#39;ve even started to memorize my order (which is impressive, because this place is BUSY.)<br><br>The sandwiches are amazing.  Pretty basic, but there&#39;s just something about them that puts them above all the rest.  I do love how they stick all of the sandwiches in the oven for a few minutes to get the cheese nice and melted and they bread perfectly toasted.  <br><br>I could seriously go on for days about how much I love this place, but I&#39;ll refrain from writing an essay about sandwiches.  The place is very small and unsuspecting, but do NOT underestimate it! It&#39;s incredible.  It does get busy around lunch and dinner, but it&#39;s worth the wait.  It&#39;s also worth the drive out to West Portal if you don&#39;t already live out in that area of the city.  GO!  This is the easiest 5-stars I&#39;ve given on Yelp.",

"reviewcomment":"This is a thoroughly delightful little spot to grab a really yummy sandwich - no fanfare, no mentions of grass-fed-well-massaged-happy-go-lucky-meats, just super tasty, well-executed sandwiches.<br><br>As promised in other reviews, the lady running the show is so friendly and sweet, you kind of want to cancel your day and stay to eat more sandwiches. This wouldn&#39;t be a bad thing, either, because the turkey melt with avocado, mayo, mustard (x 2) and cranberry sauce on Dutch bread was simply delicious. The kind of delicious where your lover calls you while you&#39;re eating it, and you don&#39;t pick up the phone.<br><br>I will be going back regularly to try the other options, as everything looked so authentic and yummy.<br><br>Pro tip - take the time to sit down and eat outside the shop or somewhere nearby, so you can do this sandwich justice by eating it fresh. I grabbed one to go while on a walk and by the time I got home, a bit of sogginess had occurred. 100% my fault for not jumping on the sandwich straight away. I&#39;m sorry, turkey melt; next time I&#39;ll do right by you.",

You do have a cheese pot but there are other pots with olive oil for steak and poultry and seafood.. and then for dessert to... <br><br>The service here is immaculate. It was really beautiful to I think its at a hotel this place. Its funny because when I got out of my car I was walking around a little confused which direction the front door was located at, and suddenly I realized it was really quiet and the building was beautiful and made out of brick and there were flowers, and a limo..and I go deja vue that I was in a past life on an episode of the bachelor.. my boo ( I dont know what to call him ,we arent official yet because I am weird but thats another story haha)  walked up and saw the confusion on my face and I told him &#34; I feel like I am on the Bachelor, where is my Rose &#34; hahah but yah we went inside and it is almost cave like in there, each table has a hot pot.. the food is really good, we had a pre fix menu for Valentines day. I also tried one of their Mojitos . <br><br>I would def return here. I know it was a little pricey ( I didnt look at the bill! ) but I would def come back here , our server was incredible, I cant remember her name but she was sweet and attentive.

"reviewcomment":"To the point: This place is a must visit. The food is excellent, and the service is great.<br><br>The Burl Kogi Sammy offers a very unique taste that satisfies a particular (indescribable) craving. You will know what I mean the second you try it. <br>This place is very small, but there&#39;s no chance I will dock it a star for that. After all, it&#39;s in SF. If you have to eat close by and there is no room in the cafe, I recommend the short walk to Huntington or Union Sq. Park to eat in the sun. The service is great, the staff is beyond pleasant!<br><br>Check it out!",

"reviewcomment":"The food is not expensive,  but amazing. I have never been disappointed in any of their sandwiches.  My favorite at the moment is pork. And my girlfriends favorite is chicken. But we always cut them in half so we both get half of each. <br><br>I also love having no idea what any of the plastic wrapped goodies on the counter are. Sometimes when we are feeling ballsy we but one and eat it. Those are a lottery, cause even after eating them I couldn&#39;t tell you what they are. Sometimes they are sweet and some times, not so much.<br><br>They have puddings? In the fridge with jelly or nuts or something in them. They are in the bottom of the fridge, those are good too. But I also couldn&#39;t tell you what they are. <br><br>I guess I could ask what all of them are. But if you are there at lunch it&#39;s very fast, and if I&#39;m not, I feel like if I knew it would take some of the fun out of it! <br><br>Over all they are super fast at making the sandwiches and they are on top of remembering who ordered what with out a computer. I love it. I come here any time I am close.",

"reviewcomment":"City Smoke House catered my boyfriend&#39;s surprise party earlier this year. My guests were very pleased with their meal (I had chefs at the party and they gave it the thumbs up). It was great to also have no delivery charge for being in SF. <br><br>Communication: We communicated primarily through email. I contacted them just about 2.5 weeks before the event. They were timely in all communications and incredibly responsive/helpful. When the gentleman came in to set up the food, he was on time and very polite. <br><br>Food: I opted for the 3 meat/3 side combo. I ordered for 23 people, but I probably could&#39;ve gotten away with ordering for 18-19 or a smaller combo. I ended up with more than 23 people and we had plenty of leftovers (if not almost too much).  I ordered the pulled pork, beef brisket and rotisserie chicken for the meat. The pulled pork and brisket were the stars of the meal. For the sides, mac &amp; cheese, baked beans and collard greens.",

My childhood friends mom does fondue every xmas eve so thats always something that I have to look forward to once a year. I love fondue ! Popular to the misconceived notion , its not just cheese. You do have a cheese pot but there are other pots with olive oil for steak and poultry and seafood.. and then for dessert to... <br><br>The service here is immaculate. It was really beautiful to I think its at a hotel this place. Its funny because when I got out of my car I was walking around a little confused which direction the front door was located at, and suddenly I realized it was really quiet and the building was beautiful and made out of brick and there were flowers, and a limo..and I go deja vue that I was in a past life on an episode of the bachelor.. my boo ( I dont know what to call him ,we arent official yet because I am weird but thats another story haha)  walked up and saw the confusion on my face and I told him &#34; I feel like I am on the Bachelor, where is my Rose &#34; hahah but yah we went inside and it is almost cave like in there, each table has a hot pot.. the food is really good, we had a pre fix menu for Valentines day. I also tried one of their Mojitos . <br><br>I would def return here. I know it was a little pricey ( I didnt look at the bill! ) but I would def come back here , our server was incredible, I cant remember her name but she was sweet and attentive. I will def come back here !! :) great place for a date. .",

All the quiches have a lot of the filling (bacon, veggies, cheese, etc), instead of being mostly egg), which I appreciate. <br><br>Every bread is good.<br><br>This is a place where you can grab a meal or individual baked goods to take home, both sweet and savory. <br><br>But it IS a bakery, if you come in at the very end of the day you might get something that&#39;s a little more dry or has absorbed flavors from something else it sat next to all day in the case -- that&#39;s just how bakeries work.",

"reviewcomment":"The wait for this small, cute, and delicious seafood bar was two hours! I think a lot of people waited over two hours for this place and that two hour wait was so worth it!<br><br>The BF and I came here on our day trip to SF.  We arrived there was a bunch of people waiting outside since the restaurant is so small and there&#39;s no wait room inside. I put my name on the board (the board is located by the door) along with the time we arrived. The worker told us it would be about an hour and a half wait for a party of two so we walked around and checked out bars/shops around the vicinity.<br><br>Two hours later we were finally seated! We sat at the bar and the seating was very tight. To my right (literally we were touching elbows) was another customer and behind me was another customer sitting at a table.  I had to make sure I didn&#39;t move otherwise I would hit all those around me, including my BF! We ordered a dozen of oysters and the cioppino bowl to share. The oysters were super fresh and melted in my mouth. Get these if you like oysters! The cioppino was so flavorful and loaded with fresh and yummy seafood. The broth and garlic bread was legit. Man, I wanted to eat more of that garlic bread. SUPER LEGIT! The bowl was larger than my head! Thank goodness we shared. Even then, we took a lot home because we were unable to finish the meal. <br><br>The service was excellent! The workers were friendly and chatted with us freely. The restaurant is super small and crammed but that&#39;s what makes this place special. It was clean, the staff was amazing, and the food was even more amazing. I walked out and told everyone who was outside waiting outside it&#39;s worth the two hour wait. The hungry people outside looked relieved :)",

"reviewcomment":"I took my two boys (13 and 16) for a long weekend in San Francisco.  We stayed at the Courtyard Marriott, which has 3 pizza places within a half block of the hotel.  I looked all of them up on Yelp and this one had the best reviews, so we decided to try it.  After a LONG day walking around the city, we were exhausted and hungry.  The place is small, but wasn&#39;t too busy for a Saturday night.  All outdoor seating, but they have heat lamps so it wasn&#39;t cold at all.  We ordered 2 pizzas between the 3 of us.  We had a cheese pizza and a pepperoni pizza.  Our friends that were with us had the pizza panini.  Everything we ordered was delicious. They use very fresh ingredients in everything, and the pizza is thin crust, but the crust is amazingly delicious.  They say the pizzas are supposed to be sort of individual sized, but we had 2 pizzas between 3 of us and there were a couple of extra pieces, so our friends ate them.  We could not waste that delicious pizza!<br><br>They serve beer and wine, although a limited selection, and sodas, which are in a case and you help yourself.  Very informal, but definitely worth a visit.  We liked it so much that we decided to go back again a couple of nights later.  <br><br>The second time i ordered a ceasar salad, which was $9 so i though it would be fairly large.  it was really just an individual portion.  I think the pizza&#39;s and other items on the menu are reasonably priced, but $9 for a ceasar salad...really?",

"reviewcomment":"Wanted to take a friend somewhere special and yummy for his birthday and this has been one of the spots I wanted to try. You would think that French cuisine is super pricey, but this wasn&#39;t as pricey as most. I was definitely not disappointed in this place at all. <br><br>First, the staff here is super friendly and helpful in helping you choose dishes.<br>Second, the food didn&#39;t take that long to arrive at your table.<br>Third, the food is exquisite and had a good portion of each<br>Fourth, the price is totally worth it and doesn&#39;t hurt your wallet as much as I would think. <br><br>My table we ordered the trio salmon, which melted in my mouth and the duck which wasn&#39;t dry at all. Next,we ordered the bouillabaisse which was the perfect portion of each seafood. The bread definitely added to the finishing touch for the soup. My friend ordered the duck, which was moist and delicious. For desserts, we ordered the French toast which was different than the breakfast French toast and super creamy with that yummy hazelnut cream. I ordered the chocolate rum cake which was perfect with the rum raisin ice cream. <br><br>Everything was just perfect for the price. The place gets crowded and can get a little tight with tables close by, but honestly it did not bug me. Just be sure to make a reservation in advance. I got even lucky booking it 3 weeks I&#39;m advance with few slots!",

"reviewcomment":"Two words...pure wow! Such a little gem tucked in a residential neighborhood. Food and service was amazing!! The waiter really made our night...what a funny guy! <br>My friend was flying out of SFO and we tried to spend his last day here in SF doing touristy things. He has never tried French food in the US so of course I turned to yelp to find the perfect dining place.<br> We started off with 3 appetizers: a plate of cold cut/cured meat (procuitto, duck, chicken pâté, rabbit pâté, beef, pork butt rolled in bacon - forgive me but I don&#39;t remember all the fancy names for the meats but it was amazing!!), garlic butter escargot, beef tartare. Although I&#39;m not a beef eater myself, I heard the tartare is to die for. If my bf could, he would&#39;ve licked the plate clean. We ordered entrees to share: mussels in curry-garlic white wine w/side order of fries , medium rare duck over a bead of greens and potatoes with liqueur soaked cherries, and scallop risotto. Everything was just perfectly cooked and executed. The plating of every dish was beautiful. By the time we finished our meal, every plate was scraped clean. Who says you have to leave a tiny bit of food on your plate to be polite?!? Not us!  We were showing the chef we REALLY enjoyed every last bit of food. <br>    We ended the night with creme brûlée. It was silky and creamy- so rich and delicious! I will go back to try their strawberry in peppered balsamic vinegar. It was highly recommended but we didn&#39;t have space for 2 desserts.<br><br>I will be back soon!!! Loved everything about this place. :)",

My childhood friends mom does fondue every xmas eve so thats always something that I have to look forward to once a year. I love fondue ! Popular to the misconceived notion , its not just cheese. You do have a cheese pot but there are other pots with olive oil for steak and poultry and seafood.. and then for dessert to... <br><br>The service here is immaculate. It was really beautiful to I think its at a hotel this place. Its funny because when I got out of my car I was walking around a little confused which direction the front door was located at, and suddenly I realized it was really quiet and the building was beautiful and made out of brick and there were flowers, and a limo..and I go deja vue that I was in a past life on an episode of the bachelor.. my boo ( I dont know what to call him ,we arent official yet because I am weird but thats another story haha)  walked up and saw the confusion on my face and I told him &#34; I feel like I am on the Bachelor, where is my Rose &#34; hahah but yah we went inside and it is almost cave like in there, each table has a hot pot.. the food is really good, we had a pre fix menu for Valentines day. I also tried one of their Mojitos . <br><br>I would def return here. I know it was a little pricey ( I didnt look at the bill! ) but I would def come back here , our server was incredible, I cant remember her name but she was sweet and attentive.

"reviewcomment":"I took my two boys (13 and 16) for a long weekend in San Francisco.  We stayed at the Courtyard Marriott, which has 3 pizza places within a half block of the hotel.  I looked all of them up on Yelp and this one had the best reviews, so we decided to try it.  After a LONG day walking around the city, we were exhausted and hungry.  The place is small, but wasn&#39;t too busy for a Saturday night.  All outdoor seating, but they have heat lamps so it wasn&#39;t cold at all.  We ordered 2 pizzas between the 3 of us.  We had a cheese pizza and a pepperoni pizza.  Our friends that were with us had the pizza panini.  Everything we ordered was delicious. They use very fresh ingredients in everything, and the pizza is thin crust, but the crust is amazingly delicious.  They say the pizzas are supposed to be sort of individual sized, but we had 2 pizzas between 3 of us and there were a couple of extra pieces, so our friends ate them.  We could not waste that delicious pizza!<br><br>They serve beer and wine, although a limited selection, and sodas, which are in a case and you help yourself.  Very informal, but definitely worth a visit.  We liked it so much that we decided to go back again a couple of nights later.  <br><br>The second time i ordered a ceasar salad, which was $9 so i though it would be fairly large.  it was really just an individual portion.  I think the pizza&#39;s and other items on the menu are reasonably priced, but $9 for a ceasar salad...really?",

"reviewcomment":"Dear yelpers,<br><br>As I was having my tires fixed, I had 2 hours to spare with the goal to have some food with hopefully some kind of WIFI to entertain myself.   Well right around the corner of the car place I saw a little cafe whose identity was more confused than hybrid.  <br><br>After stumpling in this icecream, sandwich, gyro, sit around establishment, I regonized one of the sandwich makers who used to make me be the best sandwiches in Noe Valley.  I said hi and he regonized me right away and remembered what I used to order, he then recommended a new sandwich the Try Trick Me for only $7.75.   I was not tricked, the meat was succalent, and marinated with some spice just right.  The bread was fresh and toasty.  The pickle was just a skinny pickle one step away from being a shy cucumber dipped in pickle juice.   However the 3rd bite I just realized that I can not do my work I was meant to do as I had to have the second half before I even started anything incorporating keyboards and finger licking juicy dressing exploding out of the sandwich.   <br><br>As all true sandwich shops they had a wide variety of soft beverages with the must of the true sugar cane colas hecho en Mexico.  That combination was a suberbe. <br><br>The sandwich did not leave me any room for Ice Cream but did leave me some extra money I could spend wisely.  <br><br>The only downfall is that you can see that it is just opened a year ago, and wires are very in sight.  This could be easily modified and the owner was mentioning that he did all the work himself and he was planning to get some cool art work on the walls and apply for a wine license.  That could beat my Mexiican Cola and would even be better.<br><br>The WIFI was amazingly fast and for Free!  Please don&#39;t tell too many people as that could change with the beanies and beardies of SF downloading the latest mythbusters episodes :)",

My childhood friends mom does fondue every xmas eve so thats always something that I have to look forward to once a year. I love fondue ! Popular to the misconceived notion , its not just cheese. You do have a cheese pot but there are other pots with olive oil for steak and poultry and seafood.. and then for dessert to... <br><br>The service here is immaculate. It was really beautiful to I think its at a hotel this place. Its funny because when I got out of my car I was walking around a little confused which direction the front door was located at, and suddenly I realized it was really quiet and the building was beautiful and made out of brick and there were flowers, and a limo..and I go deja vue that I was in a past life on an episode of the bachelor.. my boo ( I dont know what to call him ,we arent official yet because I am weird but thats another story haha)  walked up and saw the confusion on my face and I told him &#34; I feel like I am on the Bachelor, where is my Rose &#34; hahah but yah we went inside and it is almost cave like in there, each table has a hot pot.. the food is really good, we had a pre fix menu for Valentines day. I also tried one of their Mojitos . <br><br>I would def return here. I know it was a little pricey ( I didnt look at the bill! ) but I would def come back here , our server was incredible, I cant remember her name but she was sweet and attentive.

A score of 90/100 in cleanliness makes me feel confident about how my food is being handled. And to add, they serve fresh squeezed orange juice!!! Oh yeah, they&#39;re also located right off the 29 and 14 bus stops and there&#39;s free parking behind the restaurant!!!

This place is the smallest I&#39;ve ever seen. I couldn&#39;t even go inside because it was packed with people sitting at the bar, people ordering to-go, and others waiting in line.<br><br>We ordered a small clam chowder, the salmon plate, and the seafood cocktail. All this came out to be $60-ish. Trust me, it was worth it! Cash only.<br><br>The salmon plate had fresh salmon slices topped with capers on top of thin, fresh, crunchy bread with a side of baby shrimps. We squeezed a little bit of lemon on top and it was amazing. I could eat 20 of these. The seafood cocktail was a bunch of seafood in this spicy (we asked for it to be spicy) and very flavorful cocktail sauce. The shrimp, oysters, crab, etc was so dang good and so fresh. I savored each and every bite. The clam chowder was just ok. I like my chowders thick and I thought this one was a little runny.<br>Service was quick and the guys were very nice and helpful. The wait looked to be very brutal but it judging by what I ate there, it&#39;s worth the wait if you&#39;re craving seafood. Check this yummy place out!",

"reviewcomment":"Another bookmark checked off! <br><br>Chez maman - you were not a disappointment. <br><br>Small place - we came for dinner on a Saturday night &amp; waited for maybe 25 minutes. They have 2 little tables outside and inside there is a large counter that people sit &amp; eat at. Kind of a fancy diner feel. I&#39;d say the whole place seats about 20 people at most. <br><br>I of course opted for the basic burger with the Brie cheese add on ($12.50). And no other way to have a burger than with fries on the side, the other option being salad. The fries were awesome! Very similar to how French fries are in France - very thin &amp; crisp. I loved them! They also gave us aioli dipping sauce. OMG. Love. <br><br>Now to the burger. Medium rare perfection! It was cooked perfectly to my request. Juicy goodness &amp; oh my did the Brie pair nicely with it! It was such a good meal. I felt no guilt afterwards. <br><br>Service was friendly and nice. He complimented me on my choice of meal and also on my appetite after he saw a clean plate after I ate. <br><br>Gourmet burger at it&#39;s finest!",

"reviewcomment":"Restaurants with self-proclaimed &#34;best _____&#34; are usually overrated, but Sotto Mare&#39;s &#34;best damn crab cioppino&#34; simply stays true to its word. How much do I love this dish? The most recent time I came here with just one other person, I forgot that my friend was allergic to shellfish, so I ended up ordering the whole thing to myself! I had leftovers for lunch and dinner the next day, but totally worth it. At $41, this hearty cioppino is packed with pre-cracked crab, shrimp, scallops, mussels, clams, squid and penne noodles. Just a tip - save the bread they serve you at the beginning until the cioppino comes out, so you can dip it in the stew...amazing. <br><br>The restaurant itself is small, long and narrow, and is always busy. They only take reservations for parties of 3 or more, but luckily, both of the times I&#39;ve been with just one other person, we didn&#39;t have to wait. The service is always friendly and attentive, despite how busy it is! <br><br>Another thing to note - they offer a limited menu (no dessert), but the cioppino is seriously the only thing you need to order here.",

"reviewcomment":"So I&#39;m not from Eastern Europe but all of my relatives / grandparents are - and this is the food I&#39;ve grown up with. Short and Sweet - it&#39;s very good and such a great new experience vs. going to the German Restaurants around town that don&#39;t take reservations and have gotten Americanized. This food is not spicy and it&#39;s not supposed to be. It&#39;s an excellent representation of what I grew up with - Pierogies and all. <br><br>I&#39;ve been bragging about this place to all of my friends and finally remembered to review it. ######HashTag LOVE IT. just jaggin bout the hash tags. <br><br>Stopped in here on a Sunday evening - all quiet on the western front - just a few tables seated. The owner and his waitress were working. My pally - my friend - Bob J on here highly touted this place - I looked at yelp and saw both good and bad - but you know - some people have really 5 Star expectations at a dive bar so you can&#39;t trust everyone. <br><br>The owner recommended a Czech beer that was delicious and I haven&#39;t seen it before at the other German/European jaunts that I go to on a regular so that was a nice surprise. <br><br>I ordered the Hungarian Goulash - a great word to say anytime of the day and it was very good. I will have it again definitely. My friend ordered the Homemade Pork Sausage and they were OUTSTANDING. <br><br>We finished with the Apple strudel and OMG it was soooooooo good. A perfect ending to any meal. I highly recommend and it&#39;s okay to wait a bit for your reservation - making a reservation on a Friday/Saturday night does not guarantee that you&#39;ll be sat at that very moment. It blows me away when people complain about having to wait on a weekend - take a seat at the bar, have a beer or a glass of wine and anticipate a hearty delicious meal. <br><br>Entrees are mostly 15 to 20. Extremely reasonably priced.",

My childhood friends mom does fondue every xmas eve so thats always something that I have to look forward to once a year. I love fondue ! Popular to the misconceived notion , its not just cheese. You do have a cheese pot but there are other pots with olive oil for steak and poultry and seafood.. and then for dessert to... <br><br>The service here is immaculate. It was really beautiful to I think its at a hotel this place. Its funny because when I got out of my car I was walking around a little confused which direction the front door was located at, and suddenly I realized it was really quiet and the building was beautiful and made out of brick and there were flowers, and a limo..and I go deja vue that I was in a past life on an episode of the bachelor.. my boo ( I dont know what to call him ,we arent official yet because I am weird but thats another story haha)  walked up and saw the confusion on my face and I told him &#34; I feel like I am on the Bachelor, where is my Rose &#34; hahah but yah we went inside and it is almost cave like in there, each table has a hot pot.. the food is really good, we had a pre fix menu for Valentines day. I also tried one of their Mojitos . <br><br>I would def return here. I know it was a little pricey ( I didnt look at the bill! ) but I would def come back here , our server was incredible, I cant remember her name but she was sweet and attentive.

"reviewcomment":"Absolutely spectacular. Special occasion? Romantic outing? Glutton at heart? You should treat yourself to an amazing dinner.<br><br>The dining room is not that big. From the outside it looks like it&#39;s part of an housing complex, yet once you get into the main room it&#39;s reminiscent of a retrofitted wine cellar (look at the beams on the ceiling). It felt like there were maybe a dozen or so tables.<br><br>The menu is prix fixe only and you can choose between three course and five course. In our party the men opted for the five while the women did the four. If I were to do it again I&#39;d definitely do the four course. Five courses is just way too indulgent.<br><br>Food is great. Presentation and flavor are excellent. The Italian cuisine felt very Californian-inspired, with the seasonal produce and common favorites. Many dishes had nice spins on them. There wasn&#39;t one dish that I had a problem with. A standout to me was the sunchoke soup with seared brussels sprouts and sous vide egg.<br><br>Once you&#39;re done with your luxurious meal, you&#39;re not really done. You actually get to choose as many treats as you want from a dessert cart. This does not disappoint. It all looks so good. At this point I was just forcing myself to eat. So on top of the five course meal you also get an amuse bouche, bread, and dessert cart. Time to run a marathon.<br><br>Service is spot on. My only problem with service, and it&#39;s not really with service, is that the floors are really sensitive to movement. Whenever someone walks by you, you can hear it and feel it. It&#39;s a glaring oddity especially when everything else is done right. You might not notice it as much if you sit on the sides, but we had center stage.<br><br>____<br><br>Prepare your stomach for a flavor onslaught.",

"reviewcomment":"Honesty, if I could keep this place a secret I would but I can&#39;t help posting a review about it. <br><br>I happened upon this place by accident. We were wandering around the city for the day exploring the ferry building and china town, we&#39;d walked all the way to the end of the wharf and decided to walk up to North Beach. <br><br>Naturally we got hungry and had a quite a selection of restaurants to go to but nothing stood out to us. At one point we looked up and noticed a line of people standing outside this tiny unassuming building. Coupled with the amazing smell wafting from the door we joined them immediately without knowing what was in store or what we were waiting for. Needless to say, I&#39;m glad we did. <br><br>Be advised it&#39;s cash only but there&#39;s an ATM in the back if you forget. The pizza comes out in sheets, hot out of the oven it&#39;s cut into generous squares, and each one is heated for you before being tossed on a wicker plate along with a fork and knife (the only way to eat this pizza). It is my strong belief that the fork and knife method is to keep you from attempting to fit the whole slice in your mouth at once. <br><br>They have plain cheese, pepperoni or sausage, combo, pesto veggie, and clam and garlic. Not a single topping falls flat in my book. The crust is PERFECTION and I am VERY particular about my pizza crust. This is what pizza is supposed to be like!They also serve great beer on tap. <br><br>I have tried every slice more than once now and none of them fall short of amazing. By far this is my favorite pizza place possibly of all times. Every chance we come to the city we make a point to get a few slices. Its worth standing in line for!",

The earliest I could be sat on a Saturday was at 9:45 which tells you that this place must be pretty good.<br><br>Very quiet and romantic setting for me and my date. They greeted me promptly and everyone was warm and friendly.<br><br>We started with the tiger prawn ravioli which was cooked in a light sauce and melted in your mouth. It was fantastic as it was unique.<br><br>She had the duck confit and I had the lamb. I expected a small dish being European but there was a good amount on my plate.<br>Her duck was good and tasty although my lamb was probably the best I have ever had. I&#39;m still thinking of this it!!!<br><br>It included a small bed of greens which were very flavorful as with the pommes landaise which were tasty but a tad but greasy.<br><br>All in all food was great, service was great and made for a great Saturday night. We didn&#39;t drink but the check wasn&#39;t even too bad either. Perfect place for a date in the city, hope to go back and tear up their filet!",

"reviewcomment":"The wait for this small, cute, and delicious seafood bar was two hours! I think a lot of people waited over two hours for this place and that two hour wait was so worth it!<br><br>The BF and I came here on our day trip to SF.  We arrived there was a bunch of people waiting outside since the restaurant is so small and there&#39;s no wait room inside. I put my name on the board (the board is located by the door) along with the time we arrived. The worker told us it would be about an hour and a half wait for a party of two so we walked around and checked out bars/shops around the vicinity.<br><br>Two hours later we were finally seated! We sat at the bar and the seating was very tight. To my right (literally we were touching elbows) was another customer and behind me was another customer sitting at a table.  I had to make sure I didn&#39;t move otherwise I would hit all those around me, including my BF! We ordered a dozen of oysters and the cioppino bowl to share. The oysters were super fresh and melted in my mouth. Get these if you like oysters! The cioppino was so flavorful and loaded with fresh and yummy seafood. The broth and garlic bread was legit. Man, I wanted to eat more of that garlic bread. SUPER LEGIT! The bowl was larger than my head! Thank goodness we shared. Even then, we took a lot home because we were unable to finish the meal. <br><br>The service was excellent! The workers were friendly and chatted with us freely. The restaurant is super small and crammed but that&#39;s what makes this place special. It was clean, the staff was amazing, and the food was even more amazing. I walked out and told everyone who was outside waiting outside it&#39;s worth the two hour wait. The hungry people outside looked relieved :)",

My childhood friends mom does fondue every xmas eve so thats always something that I have to look forward to once a year. I love fondue ! Popular to the misconceived notion , its not just cheese. You do have a cheese pot but there are other pots with olive oil for steak and poultry and seafood.. and then for dessert to... <br><br>The service here is immaculate. It was really beautiful to I think its at a hotel this place. Its funny because when I got out of my car I was walking around a little confused which direction the front door was located at, and suddenly I realized it was really quiet and the building was beautiful and made out of brick and there were flowers, and a limo..and I go deja vue that I was in a past life on an episode of the bachelor.. my boo ( I dont know what to call him ,we arent official yet because I am weird but thats another story haha)  walked up and saw the confusion on my face and I told him &#34; I feel like I am on the Bachelor, where is my Rose &#34; hahah but yah we went inside and it is almost cave like in there, each table has a hot pot.. the food is really good, we had a pre fix menu for Valentines day. I also tried one of their Mojitos . <br><br>I would def return here. I know it was a little pricey ( I didnt look at the bill! ) but I would def come back here , our server was incredible, I cant remember her name but she was sweet and attentive. I will def come back here !! :) great place for a date. .",

"reviewcomment":"Gayle and I each took last Friday afternoon off and came into the City to see the Georgia O&#39;Keeffe Exhibit at the De Young. After that, we walked over to Park Chow for Lunch, and on a hunch I asked Gayle to see if there was an Arizmendi nearby. This small chain evolved from Berkeley&#39;s Cheese Board, and I&#39;ve been a regular patron of their shops in Emeryville, Oakland, and San Rafael.  And what do you know, this Inner Sunset Outpost was only a block or 2 away!<br><br>Gayle works for the City of Walnut Creek, and I&#39;m fond of pointing out that this Contra Costa County economic powerhouse will (in my eyes) remain a bakery backwater until an Arizmendi sets up shop there. In the meantime, I will continue to be &#34;forced&#34; to travel many miles for a chance to buy corn cherry scones, socialist pizza, and other gluten goodness. <br><br>We found that and more at this Arizmendi. This version seems smaller than the other ones, but with similar selections and consistently delicious versions. I picked out a half a dozen assorted scones for the week and left knowing that my upcoming mornings would start off on the right foot. Our extra bonus was the chocolate chip cookie that was wonderfully warm, melty, and tasty.",

So this is my annual lunch tradition Iol!!! <br><br>The menu changes weekly, just google Vista Room Menu.  We had....<br>Butternut squash with sweet potato soup - delicious n full of natural flavor<br>Red peppermint &amp; feta cheese salad - my son finished it, that says a lot!<br>Baked Veal cordon Bleu - colorful dish, yummy veggies, veal lacked flavor<br>Chocolate Expresso Meringue - had it to go.  The bread n butter filled me up.  However, it was perfect for afternoon tea.<br>Tea + herb and/or cheese rolls and they have boxes to go in case, like me could not finish my meal yay! And they come around topping your glass with lemon water..<br><br>Previous times I went there, there was a tip box in the corner. Opps felt bad that I forgot to look for that tip box today, of cousre its at your discretion.  I always have good experiences here so they do deserve a tip. Not sure it goes to the students or back to the training.  Anyway, they get 5 stars everytime.  I sense students can be nervous and yet very helpful and attentive.  Afterall, they are in training and therefore provide excellent service.  Alot of faculty staff were there today, including the chancellor of SF. Did not notice any students, I guess $15 can be a lot to a student but for special occasions, it&#39;s well worth it.<br><br>Looking forward to next year&#39;s Columbus Day lunch, can&#39;t wait, btw you have to pay in advance on the 3rd floor.  The restaurant does not handle any money...if you go, enjoy!!!",

"reviewcomment":"I love good sandwich and Deli Board definitely delivers!<br><br>Where Ike&#39;s is all about the sauce, deli board is all about the meat, and man do they give you a lot of meat!<br><br>I&#39;ve tried a few different sandwiches here recently. The Ron is pretty good, it&#39;s essentially a good cheese steak with TONs of meat plus some avocado. <br><br>The real winner here though (of the ones I&#39;ve tried so far) is the &#34;$$$&#34; - pronounced &#34;money&#34; by the lady who handed me the sandwich. Really delicious warm and gooey with TONS of flavor and meaty goodness! It contains brisket, corned beef, kosher salami, muenster cheese, cheddar cheese, cherry peppers, cole slaw, Board sauce all on a warm french roll. A delicious combination!<br><br>Be warned that you may have to wait, especially on a weekday lunch, but Deli Board is definitely worth the wait.",

My childhood friends mom does fondue every xmas eve so thats always something that I have to look forward to once a year. I love fondue ! Popular to the misconceived notion , its not just cheese. You do have a cheese pot but there are other pots with olive oil for steak and poultry and seafood.. and then for dessert to... <br><br>The service here is immaculate. It was really beautiful to I think its at a hotel this place. Its funny because when I got out of my car I was walking around a little confused which direction the front door was located at, and suddenly I realized it was really quiet and the building was beautiful and made out of brick and there were flowers, and a limo..and I go deja vue that I was in a past life on an episode of the bachelor.. my boo ( I dont know what to call him ,we arent official yet because I am weird but thats another story haha)  walked up and saw the confusion on my face and I told him &#34; I feel like I am on the Bachelor, where is my Rose &#34; hahah but yah we went inside and it is almost cave like in there, each table has a hot pot.. the food is really good, we had a pre fix menu for Valentines day. I also tried one of their Mojitos . <br><br>I would def return here. I know it was a little pricey ( I didnt look at the bill! ) but I would def come back here , our server was incredible, I cant remember her name but she was sweet and attentive. I will def come back here !! :) great place for a date. .",

But if you are there at lunch it&#39;s very fast, and if I&#39;m not, I feel like if I knew it would take some of the fun out of it! <br><br>Over all they are super fast at making the sandwiches and they are on top of remembering who ordered what with out a computer.

They also have competitive prices on typical corner store items ($2 coconut water!) . I just wish Cindy&#39;s was the corner store across the street from my apartment instead of Deli Plus ($3 coconut water) a few blocks down . <br><br>They also have a good selection of produce that you may need in a pinch (not necessarily the most fresh but not bad), good bread, and even vegetarian bacon. So glad to have this place in the neighborhood.",

If you&#39;re watching your figure as I do on and off.... Lol you can hit up the salad bar or get a half sized sandwich. It&#39;s affordable, and the ladies are super friendly. At 12, hell yea there will be a line.... for good reason! I love this place!<br><br>To Justin: Who left a 1 star rating.<br><br>You clearly needed a hug that day. Give them another chance, first of all the shop is run by a woman and with 3 female assistants. And if the place was so bad you would not have been waiting in line with  other people for 20 minutes.....  :)<br><br>Don&#39;t waste your time with this sorry excuse for a sandwich shop I sat in line for 20 minutes watching the owner watches employees do all his work for him . there was a thick film of grime over the splash guard in the sandwiches didn&#39;t even look all that great. I don&#39;t know whyanyone would give this place great reviews because he was rather disgusting if you ask me.  save your money and don&#39;t support rude business",

Salty but it keeps you wanting a crapload more. They always ask if you want tomatoes or pineapples with your order and I opt for pineapples, because I have this thing for pairing up salty foods with sweet foods.<br><br>Parking is horrible in Excelsior.

Local greens and potato and garlic all roasted..  Tasty! <br><br>Potato dumpling kumla. Onion ragout. Lingonberry. Lardon . Brown butter. Individually, the components were OK, but when you took a bite and it had a bit of everything including the lardon, it s amazing! All for the lardon on the side  so that it stays crispy! <br><br>Skrieg, wild Arctic cod. Sunchoke cream. Salmon roe sorrel chanterelle mushroom. Just like the potato dumpling, take a bite with a little bit of everything, amazing  the fish alone was buttery and delish!! <br><br>Squab breast. Potato florette. Cabbage forest mushroom. Lemon tarragon jus. The squab was made two ways, roasted and also confit, juicy tasty meat. The bone in leg was a bit hard to eat off the bone since it&#39;s cooked to a medium rare. But still yummy. A bit sad for me since the bone is always my favorite part. <br><br>Pretty decor. I love this place. Will have to come back as we both have a lot of other dishes we want to try!",

"reviewcomment":"I&#39;ve finally found a good sandwich shop in my hometown! Daly City doesn&#39;t have much to offer in the restaurant business, so finding a gem like Sam&#39;s really makes me happy. My sister and I had some time to kill while waiting for our car to get washed at Touchless Car Wash. Immediately, we were greeted by a really friendly male (I&#39;m assuming it was Sam?) and he explained to us that the sandwiches were made to order and directed us to the check off cards. We ended up getting a toasted Turkey sandwich on Dutch Crunch with mayo, lettuce, tomatoes, provolone cheese and their delicious pesto sauce. Our total was about $7-$8 which wasn&#39;t bad. The sandwiches at Sam&#39;s are delicious and filling! <br><br>I was really impressed with the service and products that I ended up visiting the next day. The same male employee remembered me and thanked me for coming back! You&#39;ll be seeing me on the regular check in list, Sam! Great products, even better prices, and friendly service.. what more could you ask for?!",

"reviewcomment":"Lovely place! Went here with some wonderful people for a packed wine tasting and learned a lot. We also stayed and shared some of the food there. We ordered the gnocchi, wild boar with polenta and grilled veggies, and arugula salad. Everything tasted amazing and was fresh. My favorite was the wild boar... OMG. I seriously think about the flavors that satiates my mouth with each bite. I, honestly cut the pieces of the boar into smaller pieces (when I was running low) so that my evening can continue to be heightened with such wonderful, bursting flavors and each little bite was heavenly. Mmm!!! Such a warm and inviting place with delectable dishes. I&#39;d definitely would love to come here again... and I will! :)<br><br>Also, I didn&#39;t know this but when you order the food, don&#39;t expect huge portions or a big meal because they&#39;re supposed to be small plates. Oh, and I think it&#39;s wonderful that they have a night where parents (it is Bernal Heights where lots of parents with babies live) can bring their babies in, without having to pay a babysitter for the evening and enjoy themselves with a glass or two of wine. (applause) What a great idea!",

You do have a cheese pot but there are other pots with olive oil for steak and poultry and seafood.. and then for dessert to... <br><br>The service here is immaculate. It was really beautiful to I think its at a hotel this place. Its funny because when I got out of my car I was walking around a little confused which direction the front door was located at, and suddenly I realized it was really quiet and the building was beautiful and made out of brick and there were flowers, and a limo..and I go deja vue that I was in a past life on an episode of the bachelor.. my boo ( I dont know what to call him ,we arent official yet because I am weird but thats another story haha)  walked up and saw the confusion on my face and I told him &#34; I feel like I am on the Bachelor, where is my Rose &#34; hahah but yah we went inside and it is almost cave like in there, each table has a hot pot.. the food is really good, we had a pre fix menu for Valentines day. I also tried one of their Mojitos . <br><br>I would def return here. I know it was a little pricey ( I didnt look at the bill! ) but I would def come back here , our server was incredible, I cant remember her name but she was sweet and attentive.

All of the staff was extremely attentive, friendly and nice. They ensured that our water glasses were also full and brought us everything we needed. <br><br>We chose the prix fixe menu, which included an appetizer, main dish and dessert for $38. We chose to get three different kids of appetizers (see pictures) and shared them. The portions were just right. My favorite were the truffle, Parmesan Brussels sprouts. The flavor was extraordinary and I love how each bite had just enough crisp. For my main dish I had their Hawaiian Ono Fish - well done. I&#39;m usually really scared with the fish I order at restaurants, but I had trust in my waitress that said it was delicious and similar to halibut. Instead of dessert, my friend and I ordered a side of kale in olive oil and lemon juice - perfectly cooked! One of my friends ordered dessert for us three to share - chocolate cake with a later of marshmallow... Amaze! We licked every last bit of it. <br><br>If you&#39;re visiting SF or are in the area, you must come here. Parking wasn&#39;t hard at all!",

We don&#39;t have to look for a tag, or wonder or worry we can just eat it. It&#39;s like a Weird Al song.<br><br>I absolutely love the way Sophie is with my 10 and 11 year old children. <br><br>Before you write a 1 star review, consider that they are the only store of this kind (that I know of) and if you&#39;re just bitching at their prices, you&#39;re basically attempting to say &#34;If I can&#39;t have it no one should.&#34; If you can&#39;t afford it or don&#39;t want to spend the money, walk out the door, that&#39;s your prerogative. Some of these reviews are lame and abuse the one star option.",

"reviewcomment":"Knowing I was making a trip out to San Francisco, I felt compelled to have some kind of food agenda. My source for Nopa suggested to do brunch and book a reservation whatever time of day I actually decided to come. <br><br>My source was right: this place is constantly busy and with good reason. The food is out of this world and the service is impeccable. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever encountered a well-informed staff since my restaurant trip in Las Vegas to Twist. I ended up coming here for dinner and I believe I had the sea bass (I honestly forgot which fish it was) and it was absolutely delicious. I never knew you could cut orange peels into a meal and eat them, let alone enjoy eating them! Mind blown for sure. <br><br>For dessert, I tried the dark chocolate tart with goat cheese ice cream. At first me and my friend were like, &#34;um, why goat cheese ice cream?!?&#34; As soon as we got our order, our tone changed to &#34;holy crap, GOAT CHEESE ICE CREAM!!&#34; Needless to say, our adventure to Nopa was ACA-MAZING!!! <br><br>I&#39;m now on the hunt for more wonderous goat cheese ice cream. Thanks Nopa.",

The salsa that come with the chips is amazing, too -- mild but so well balanced and flavorful.<br><br>The waiter was nice enough to split the entree for us even though we didn&#39;t ask for it. Very sweet of him. The chicken is fall off the bone tender and the sauce is just perfect. The rice has nice texture and flavor and the black bean sauce on top marries all the flavors together.<br><br>We got a free dessert (the flan) for checking in on yelp. It was pretty good flan, as far as flans go.<br><br>I forgot to take my credit card before I left and the waiter was nice enough to run more than a block to hail me down and return the card to me.

Senor Sisig certainly found the secret to making the best burrito there is, just like Facebook found the secret of what people like, ATTENTION!

You do have a cheese pot but there are other pots with olive oil for steak and poultry and seafood.. and then for dessert to... <br><br>The service here is immaculate. It was really beautiful to I think its at a hotel this place. Its funny because when I got out of my car I was walking around a little confused which direction the front door was located at, and suddenly I realized it was really quiet and the building was beautiful and made out of brick and there were flowers, and a limo..and I go deja vue that I was in a past life on an episode of the bachelor.. my boo ( I dont know what to call him ,we arent official yet because I am weird but thats another story haha)  walked up and saw the confusion on my face and I told him &#34; I feel like I am on the Bachelor, where is my Rose &#34; hahah but yah we went inside and it is almost cave like in there, each table has a hot pot.. the food is really good, we had a pre fix menu for Valentines day. I also tried one of their Mojitos . <br><br>I would def return here. I know it was a little pricey ( I didnt look at the bill! ) but I would def come back here , our server was incredible, I cant remember her name but she was sweet and attentive.

They have 2 little tables outside and inside there is a large counter that people sit &amp; eat at. Kind of a fancy diner feel. I&#39;d say the whole place seats about 20 people at most. <br><br>I of course opted for the basic burger with the Brie cheese add on ($12.50). And no other way to have a burger than with fries on the side, the other option being salad. The fries were awesome! Very similar to how French fries are in France - very thin &amp; crisp. I loved them! They also gave us aioli dipping sauce. OMG. Love. <br><br>Now to the burger. Medium rare perfection! It was cooked perfectly to my request. Juicy goodness &amp; oh my did the Brie pair nicely with it! It was such a good meal. I felt no guilt afterwards. <br><br>Service was friendly and nice. He complimented me on my choice of meal and also on my appetite after he saw a clean plate after I ate. <br><br>Gourmet burger at it&#39;s finest!",

Find them cozily placed on Irving and 15th Ave, with window in front to let in some nice natural light (yes there is sunshine in Sunset..). They have an awesome and creative menu with good customer service. Bring your computer, or a very chatty friend, and enjoy a good coffee with an affordable lunch from a hearty menu too. <br><br>Big thumbs up from me...And I&#39;ve tried most places in this neighborhood...Give it a shot!",

"reviewcomment":"Two words...pure wow! Such a little gem tucked in a residential neighborhood. Food and service was amazing!! The waiter really made our night...what a funny guy! <br>My friend was flying out of SFO and we tried to spend his last day here in SF doing touristy things. He has never tried French food in the US so of course I turned to yelp to find the perfect dining place.<br> We started off with 3 appetizers: a plate of cold cut/cured meat (procuitto, duck, chicken pâté, rabbit pâté, beef, pork butt rolled in bacon - forgive me but I don&#39;t remember all the fancy names for the meats but it was amazing!!), garlic butter escargot, beef tartare. Although I&#39;m not a beef eater myself, I heard the tartare is to die for. If my bf could, he would&#39;ve licked the plate clean. We ordered entrees to share: mussels in curry-garlic white wine w/side order of fries , medium rare duck over a bead of greens and potatoes with liqueur soaked cherries, and scallop risotto. Everything was just perfectly cooked and executed. The plating of every dish was beautiful. By the time we finished our meal, every plate was scraped clean. Who says you have to leave a tiny bit of food on your plate to be polite?!? Not us!  We were showing the chef we REALLY enjoyed every last bit of food. <br>    We ended the night with creme brûlée. It was silky and creamy- so rich and delicious! I will go back to try their strawberry in peppered balsamic vinegar. It was highly recommended but we didn&#39;t have space for 2 desserts.<br><br>I will be back soon!!! Loved everything about this place. :)",

You do have a cheese pot but there are other pots with olive oil for steak and poultry and seafood.. and then for dessert to... <br><br>The service here is immaculate. It was really beautiful to I think its at a hotel this place. Its funny because when I got out of my car I was walking around a little confused which direction the front door was located at, and suddenly I realized it was really quiet and the building was beautiful and made out of brick and there were flowers, and a limo..and I go deja vue that I was in a past life on an episode of the bachelor.. my boo ( I dont know what to call him ,we arent official yet because I am weird but thats another story haha)  walked up and saw the confusion on my face and I told him &#34; I feel like I am on the Bachelor, where is my Rose &#34; hahah but yah we went inside and it is almost cave like in there, each table has a hot pot.. the food is really good, we had a pre fix menu for Valentines day. I also tried one of their Mojitos . <br><br>I would def return here. I know it was a little pricey ( I didnt look at the bill! ) but I would def come back here , our server was incredible, I cant remember her name but she was sweet and attentive.

My childhood friends mom does fondue every xmas eve so thats always something that I have to look forward to once a year. I love fondue ! Popular to the misconceived notion , its not just cheese. You do have a cheese pot but there are other pots with olive oil for steak and poultry and seafood.. and then for dessert to... <br><br>The service here is immaculate. It was really beautiful to I think its at a hotel this place. Its funny because when I got out of my car I was walking around a little confused which direction the front door was located at, and suddenly I realized it was really quiet and the building was beautiful and made out of brick and there were flowers, and a limo..and I go deja vue that I was in a past life on an episode of the bachelor.. my boo ( I dont know what to call him ,we arent official yet because I am weird but thats another story haha)  walked up and saw the confusion on my face and I told him &#34; I feel like I am on the Bachelor, where is my Rose &#34; hahah but yah we went inside and it is almost cave like in there, each table has a hot pot.. the food is really good, we had a pre fix menu for Valentines day. I also tried one of their Mojitos . <br><br>I would def return here. I know it was a little pricey ( I didnt look at the bill! ) but I would def come back here , our server was incredible, I cant remember her name but she was sweet and attentive.

"reviewcomment":"Lolinda is a fantastic steak &amp; tapas place in the Mission. I first tried it when they opened and again just recently. Both times were equally amazing. Great food and service all around.<br><br>The place gets busy pretty quickly, so I definitely recommend arriving early or making reservations. Luckily our party of 3 was able to snatch a last minute reservation on OpenTable.<br><br>Every dish we ordered was absolutely AMAZING. The plates are meant to be shared, so 4-5 dishes were more than enough for a group of 3. I&#39;d also def recommend splitting a steak too.<br><br>FOOD:<br>* Ceviche MIxto - surprisingly fresh and delicately balanced. Usually I&#39;m not a fan of ceviche because I find the lemon/lime juice too overpowering, but this was really good. The fried corn was also a great complement to the seafood.<br>* Crispy Pork Belly - I could&#39;ve eaten this whole plate by myself. Crispy on the outside, and tender and juicy in the middle. YUMM.<br>* Bone Marrow - Melt in your mouth good. <br>* Rib Eye Steak - Seasoned and cooked perfectly. Not the most flavorful dish of the night, which is saying something since I still thought it was amazing steak in general.<br>* Braised Beef Ribs - At this point, I think we were already full. But the beef ribs were so tender and the tomato sauce was so good, we just kept stuffing our faces. The carrots and potatoes in this dish were also very flavorful.<br>* Milk &amp; Cookies - The perfect bite of dessert, especially after such a filling meal. <br><br>Everything was reasonably priced, especially since the dishes are meant to be shared. I really enjoyed everything we tried and thought service/ambiance was great overall. Definitely need to come back more often!",

The bus ride and walk to the restaurant were a little sketchy (not in the best neighborhood), but it&#39;s well worth the meal. We had to wait a few minutes but were seated and taken care of by a wonderful waiter. He was very attentive to us (and my wife&#39;s vegan and gluten-free diet) and helped us choose the best dishes. We definitely splurged and ordered more than we needed: a few small plates and a few large plates. The hummus and pita (even the gluten-free pita) is out of this world! The roasted cauliflower and falafel were so good, and our main dishes were very tasty. I would&#39;ve loved to have had some dessert but we just didn&#39;t have enough room.<br><br>Though we had all vegetarian dishes, there were plenty of meat options as well, which is why we will definitely be coming back here when we have visitors in town!",

"reviewcomment":"What a relief to have Another Cafe in this city! The first time I heard of this spot I was eavesdropping in another conversation in another cafe. (No pun intended. And yes, I&#39;m aware that last comment sounded super creepster-y. I mean, they were talking loudly anyway...)  Someone asked the barista of a coffeehouse open beyond 8 and they suggested Another Cafe. I Yelp bookmarked it, visited it, and have remained a happy customer since. <br><br>Located at the corner of Pine and Leavenworth, Another Cafe is two stories. It doesn&#39;t look very big from the outside, but it is. The bottom floor has long community tables with stools and numerous 2-people tables. Upstairs there is limited seating; they are definitely appropriate for studying. Another Cafe serves Bicycle Coffee and like others have noted, their beverage and food prices are reasonable. But what distinguishes Another Cafe from other places is the service and ambiance. The baristas are incredibly friendly and probably the nicest ones I can think of in this city. They also bump good music. One minute it&#39;s R&amp;B, next it&#39;s rock, and then it&#39;s folk. Along with that, the environment is unpretentious and relaxed.",

It was really beautiful to I think its at a hotel this place. Its funny because when I got out of my car I was walking around a little confused which direction the front door was located at, and suddenly I realized it was really quiet and the building was beautiful and made out of brick and there were flowers, and a limo..and I go deja vue that I was in a past life on an episode of the bachelor.. my boo ( I dont know what to call him ,we arent official yet because I am weird but thats another story haha)  walked up and saw the confusion on my face and I told him &#34; I feel like I am on the Bachelor, where is my Rose &#34; hahah but yah we went inside and it is almost cave like in there, each table has a hot pot.. the food is really good, we had a pre fix menu for Valentines day. I also tried one of their Mojitos . <br><br>I would def return here. I know it was a little pricey ( I didnt look at the bill! ) but I would def come back here , our server was incredible, I cant remember her name but she was sweet and attentive.

I was torn between the Reuben and the Lamb and feta meatball sandwich.... just kidding, easiest decision EVER!!!<br><br>3-4 large light meatballs sit within a freshly baked brioche bun (almost a croissant in texture and buttery flavour - FML), a little sauce, A LOT of cheese and some basil leaves - HOT DAMN!!!<br><br>For the girth and density of this sandwich it was actually quite light. The meatballs were delicous... nay, scrumptious.... nay... I&#39;m going to make up a word right now to describe the flavour.... right off the top of my head, SCRUM-TRU-LESCENT!<br><br>Yes.

My childhood friends mom does fondue every xmas eve so thats always something that I have to look forward to once a year. I love fondue ! Popular to the misconceived notion , its not just cheese. You do have a cheese pot but there are other pots with olive oil for steak and poultry and seafood.. and then for dessert to... <br><br>The service here is immaculate. It was really beautiful to I think its at a hotel this place. Its funny because when I got out of my car I was walking around a little confused which direction the front door was located at, and suddenly I realized it was really quiet and the building was beautiful and made out of brick and there were flowers, and a limo..and I go deja vue that I was in a past life on an episode of the bachelor.. my boo ( I dont know what to call him ,we arent official yet because I am weird but thats another story haha)  walked up and saw the confusion on my face and I told him &#34; I feel like I am on the Bachelor, where is my Rose &#34; hahah but yah we went inside and it is almost cave like in there, each table has a hot pot.. the food is really good, we had a pre fix menu for Valentines day. I also tried one of their Mojitos . <br><br>I would def return here. I know it was a little pricey ( I didnt look at the bill! ) but I would def come back here , our server was incredible, I cant remember her name but she was sweet and attentive.

"reviewcomment":"Came here for Brunch on a Sunday morning. My bf and I made a last minute decision, and he found reservations on Opentable that morning. Score! We got here around 10:30am, when it seemed like SF was still sleeping. The restaurant was very quiet, but it was pleasant. The interior of the restaurant screams fine dining, but the food prices are fair for the quality of food. I think this is a great place for brunch if you&#39;re tired of waiting in line (i.e. Plow, Mission Beach Cafe), and just want to relax on your day off!<br><br>We started off with the beignets -- I was expecting something crispy, kind of like the ones in NOLA. But, we actually got beignets that looked like donut holes! Except rolled in cinnamon sugar...man they were delicious. I also liked the dipping sauces included: the huckleberry preserves and creme anglais. This was a great starter!<br><br>I really wanted the burger my bf kept telling me about. We are always in search of the best burger in SF, and he claimed this was one of them. The burger was fantastic. It&#39;s composed of different types of meat, which made it softer than usual. The fries were very good too - the perfect medium thickness (not too skinny like McDonalds, not too thick). They were nice and soft. <br><br>My bf got the pastrami and grits, which he really loved. No regrets here!<br><br>The service is extremely personable. The Burmese waiter we had was always making jokes with us, as if we had dined there all the time (it was my first time). Everyone was just so friendly. I guess this is what you expect for a 1-Michelin star restaurant!<br><br>I can&#39;t wait to come here for dinner sometime. The hostess on our way out told us about &#34;Burgers and Burgundy&#34; on Sunday nights, where you eat the burger and a glass of Burgundy wine. The regular menu looks great too, although on the pricier side. I&#39;d like to come back whenever I have the chance (or credit).",

I&#39;m a picky eater, don&#39;t judge me.<br><br>i was a bit disappointed they didn&#39;t have the option for a sourdough roll, but sliced sourdough was just fine. i got turkey with bacon on sourdough, with lettuce, red onions, and mayo. the turkey was amazing! and they put a good amount of bacon which is usually not the case most places. the lettuce and onions were super fresh and there was just enough mayo.<br><br>needless to say it was the best sandwich any of us had had in a long time, and we have already ordered twice more since the first time! and there will be plenty more to come in the future.",

"reviewcomment":"Dottie&#39;s is a San Francisco institution. It&#39;s one of the breakfast spots in the city, and as soon as you sit down with your food in front of you, it&#39;s easy to see why.<br><br>Seriously, those 2,000+ reviews do not lie. This is the legit spot for eats.<br><br>I went with a friend on a Friday morning at about 9am. It was packed when we got there, but the line moved quickly (don&#39;t expect the same during the rush hour or during the weekend, then you will wait.) It&#39;s a spot that&#39;s larger than it looks, with tables extending to the back. The menu is simple but amazing, and everything is upped on quality and size. Not just pancaked but blueberry cornmeal pancakes. Not just an omelette but a delux hand crafted omelette with ingredients minced and spread throughout rather than just stuffed into the centre. You get the deal.<br><br>Plus, they have probably the best breakfast deal in the entire city. The Open Road: two eggs, bacon, eggs or sausage, homefries, and two giant pancakes, all for $13. Yes, yes, and more yes, every time. <br><br>Eat here, pass out, enjoy life. This is a true blue spot for sure.",

My childhood friends mom does fondue every xmas eve so thats always something that I have to look forward to once a year. I love fondue ! Popular to the misconceived notion , its not just cheese. You do have a cheese pot but there are other pots with olive oil for steak and poultry and seafood.. and then for dessert to... <br><br>The service here is immaculate. It was really beautiful to I think its at a hotel this place. Its funny because when I got out of my car I was walking around a little confused which direction the front door was located at, and suddenly I realized it was really quiet and the building was beautiful and made out of brick and there were flowers, and a limo..and I go deja vue that I was in a past life on an episode of the bachelor.. my boo ( I dont know what to call him ,we arent official yet because I am weird but thats another story haha)  walked up and saw the confusion on my face and I told him &#34; I feel like I am on the Bachelor, where is my Rose &#34; hahah but yah we went inside and it is almost cave like in there, each table has a hot pot.. the food is really good, we had a pre fix menu for Valentines day. I also tried one of their Mojitos . <br><br>I would def return here. I know it was a little pricey ( I didnt look at the bill! ) but I would def come back here , our server was incredible, I cant remember her name but she was sweet and attentive. I will def come back here !! :) great place for a date. .",

"reviewcomment":"Naked Lunch makes tasty, slightly unusual sandwiches. They present a small, but varied menu that seems to always consist of a chicken sandwich, a burger, a veggie sandwich, a salad, a soup, fries, and some random sides. Sandwiches (fries not included at $5) usually cost around $10, soups $8. The atmosphere is warm and spacious, with a great, breezy outdoor area in the front. Staff are pleasant, the wait time is decently fast, and they have some nice beers on tap.<br><br>Here are some things I have tried:<br><br>Chicken coleslaw sandwich (signature item): The chicken was moist, juicy and fried to perfection. I don&#39;t like the taste of coleslaw very much, so I&#39;ve only had this once, but it does go well with the chicken.  <br><br>The burger: Also great -- I really dig the cheese crisp thing they put on it (manchego?)<br><br>The vegetarian sandwich: Favorite one! Seems to always be goat cheese, arugula, some caramelized vegetable, and maybe fruit. I think this is the tastiest of all the options, although I have to psych myself up before ordering something vegetarian. Would maybe be healthy if it weren&#39;t for all the cheese and greasy goodness.<br><br>Fries: Fine. Served with a garlic aoli/ketchup mix and tastes like it&#39;s seasoned with Lawry&#39;s spice and sugar. For $5 the order size is a bit small. The sandwiches themselves are all very filling, so you probably wouldn&#39;t need to order fries anyway.<br><br>They&#39;ve also been known to randomly change up a menu for a day or invite in guest chefs to serve up something different, but I&#39;ve never eaten there when that happens so I can&#39;t say what that&#39;s like either way.",

But it&#39;s limited in a good way. The list of classics are combinations of quality ingredients that are well prepared. I love the sausage or the calimari to start. My wife is a big fan of the onion soup and she lived in Paris so... For the main course the Moules dishes are great and the deserts are brilliant.<br><br>More than anything though the owner goes out of his way to make people feel at home.

Someone once stopped me on the street to ask me where my sandwich was from because yes it looks that good. It tastes that good to.<br><br>This is also a good spot to pick up odds and ends when you don&#39;t want to go to a full grocery store.

You do have a cheese pot but there are other pots with olive oil for steak and poultry and seafood.. and then for dessert to... <br><br>The service here is immaculate. It was really beautiful to I think its at a hotel this place. Its funny because when I got out of my car I was walking around a little confused which direction the front door was located at, and suddenly I realized it was really quiet and the building was beautiful and made out of brick and there were flowers, and a limo..and I go deja vue that I was in a past life on an episode of the bachelor.. my boo ( I dont know what to call him ,we arent official yet because I am weird but thats another story haha)  walked up and saw the confusion on my face and I told him &#34; I feel like I am on the Bachelor, where is my Rose &#34; hahah but yah we went inside and it is almost cave like in there, each table has a hot pot.. the food is really good, we had a pre fix menu for Valentines day. I also tried one of their Mojitos . <br><br>I would def return here. I know it was a little pricey ( I didnt look at the bill! ) but I would def come back here , our server was incredible, I cant remember her name but she was sweet and attentive.

"reviewcomment":"Wow, a 5-star experience!!!  My bf made reservations for a Sat night @ 7pm 4 people the day before. It was that easy to get a reservation, probably because this restaurant is only a few months old. Upon arriving, they were pretty swamped. We got there on time, but weren&#39;t seated until maybe 7:15pm. However, once entering, we recognized Thommas, our favorite waiter (once captain) from Michael Mina. It turns out many of the people from the Michael Mina group (Ryan, owner of Stones Throw, the ex Chef de Cuisine of Michael Mina, and our host Thommas) had jumped ships to this new American restaurant in Russian Hill. Thommas immediately gave us champagne while we were waiting for our table.<br><br>Highlights:<br><br>1) Duck Pate &amp; Mousse with Pretzel - closest thing to foie gras you can get in this state! So good...pretzel was to die for too...it was super fresh and soft. Not your typical Auntie Anne&#39;s! <br><br>2) Squid Ink Conchiglie Pasta with clams. PERFECT FOR ALL YOU SQUID INK PASTA LOVERS! The pasta was cooked perfectly, al dente, with yummy seafood touch from the clams. Can&#39;t come here without ordering. My only complaint is that I wish it were an entree, rather than a pasta. Too small for someone&#39;s meal unless you really eat like a bird.<br><br>3) Fish...which I believe was Halibut. They Sous-vide&#39;d it, so it was cooked perfectly, very soft and pretty much a poached fish. They took this one off the menu though unfortunately, I couldn&#39;t find it! =(<br><br>4) Lamb was ordered twice at our table. It was very good - I typically don&#39;t like lamb, but this was cooked in a way where it did not taste like lamb (the best). If you are a lamb lover, order this dish!<br><br>Ambiance was young, loud, dark, fun, similar to Pesce. Food was phenomenal. However, parking was awful. My bf and I ended up hiking up the hill from Van Ness in the rain, not the best way to end your Saturday night! Do yourself a favor and allow 45 mins to find parking. If you get there early, treat yourself to a cocktail!<br><br>Can&#39;t wait to return for a family member&#39;s birthday!",

Especially tonight&#39;s. We had the lemon pappardelle with their bolognese sauce and it was plate-licking fantastic. The bolognese sauce was probably one the most rich and flavorful I&#39;ve ever had. My husband knew he was in for a great meal when he smelled the delicious sauce bubbling in the kitchen. <br><br>The total was only $16 for dinner for two. You get good, quality meal you can whip up in no time at home for half the cost you&#39;d spend at a restaurant. <br><br>My mother in law and sister in law are coming over this weekend for the holidays.

"reviewcomment":"How much do I love Source? I was here three times in the past week on my visit to SF. As I type this, I&#39;m going through the w/ds, since my last bite of incredible veg/non GMO food was a mere 18 hours ago.<br><br>Besides the food, I also want to mention that the past three times service was above and beyond! Last Sunday night, when I asked about hot sauce (it&#39;s my thing), I was given several options, including a  beyond blazin&#39; habanero sauce (I was told they used to ask people to sign a waiver before indulging) and then a less teary green sauce that was the waiter&#39;s favorite. How nice that he cared! Hot sauce addicts unite, right?<br><br>On Monday, I brought my team here for lunch, but called ahead to order, not realizing that you only do this when taking out. I felt bad about wasting all those takeout containers, but the waitstaff and manager were anything but snarky about all of this and helped us get situated at a table, making sure that our order was all correct. I realized that because I had already used my CC when ordering, that a gratuity had not been added, yet we were still very much attended to, again, above and beyond! I made sure to go up and take care of all of that (just mentioning so you know I always do right by waitstaff, friends :)<br><br>And last night, my final meal here *sob*-- again, I noticed how nice the cashier was, offering options because they had run out of things, knowing that one of us was GF. On that note, expect to be told if there is even the slightest hint of gluten in an item. They are so informed about their menu. <br><br>In my previous review, you&#39;ll see that I recommended the Buffalo Bites and Living Platter. And now I recommend the vegan artichoke/spinach dip that you&#39;d *swear* contained a rich parmesan cheese rather than cashew butter, truffle oil and what might actually be nutritional yeast. My favorite sandwich is the Cluck Avocado Club that is overloaded with all of the items described (those &#34;oink&#34; bits are joys in texture and taste!!) Note to self: next time leave off the cheese (vegan or otherwise). You totally don&#39;t need it. I also had them leave out the caramelized onions because I&#39;m not a fan. The spinach/artichoke dip is perfect to mix in with the sandwich (not to mention dipping your fries into) and there is just too much food for me to even consider eating the fresh roll (though I tasted it and wanted to expand my stomach so that I *could* eat it!)<br><br>Although I typically avoid fake meats like the plague, Source&#39;s are well made and GMO-free, so they aren&#39;t the rubbery &#34;soy protein&#34; bits you&#39;re used to having to suffer through (though admittedly most of my vegan friends that miss meat actually enjoy those horrors). I think that the fake meats here will please both those who eschew and those who enjoy such things. <br><br>Also, it bears repeating: their fries may very well have brought tears of joy to mine eyes.",

"reviewcomment":"4.5* rounded up<br><br>Range is my go-to restaurant in San Francisco - solid food and nice ambiance (modern and minimal, yet cozy; fancy but not pretentious) though with tightly packed tables. It has become much easier to get a reservation since they lost their Michelin star but the quality has remained the same. Overall, the food is fairly simple and consistent - if you prefer complexly prepared dishes with a swirly melange of flavors, foam, etc you may find Range disappointing; I have a foodie friend who thinks it&#39;s over-rated for this exact reason. Desserts tend to be on the less to moderately sweet side. Good, friendly bartenders and a nice bar that is generally always full.",

My childhood friends mom does fondue every xmas eve so thats always something that I have to look forward to once a year. I love fondue ! Popular to the misconceived notion , its not just cheese. You do have a cheese pot but there are other pots with olive oil for steak and poultry and seafood.. and then for dessert to... <br><br>The service here is immaculate. It was really beautiful to I think its at a hotel this place. Its funny because when I got out of my car I was walking around a little confused which direction the front door was located at, and suddenly I realized it was really quiet and the building was beautiful and made out of brick and there were flowers, and a limo..and I go deja vue that I was in a past life on an episode of the bachelor.. my boo ( I dont know what to call him ,we arent official yet because I am weird but thats another story haha)  walked up and saw the confusion on my face and I told him &#34; I feel like I am on the Bachelor, where is my Rose &#34; hahah but yah we went inside and it is almost cave like in there, each table has a hot pot.. the food is really good, we had a pre fix menu for Valentines day. I also tried one of their Mojitos . <br><br>I would def return here. I know it was a little pricey ( I didnt look at the bill! ) but I would def come back here , our server was incredible, I cant remember her name but she was sweet and attentive.

"reviewcomment":"Probably THE BEST burger I have ever had.<br><br>The Box Kitchen takes Hole in the Wall very literally. There is no where to sit and eat except for the bar that other reviewers talked about. Tried taking my food in there but who wants to eat inside a bar that reeks of BO and has sticky residue on the tables that you are not quite sure what it is? Definitely take it to go but you better get back quick to wherever you are going to enjoy this meal because it is something that you do not want to let sit for long.<br><br>Tip: Do not get the chicken IN Waffles. I know everyone talks about it but it definitely is not their best. Get the burger!!! <br><br>Learned this the hard way... but remember that the neighborhood is very sketchy... My gf was not happy and even the amazing burger did not make up for her disappointment that I led her to a long and dark alley with homeless people asking for change.",

My childhood friends mom does fondue every xmas eve so thats always something that I have to look forward to once a year. I love fondue ! Popular to the misconceived notion , its not just cheese. You do have a cheese pot but there are other pots with olive oil for steak and poultry and seafood.. and then for dessert to... <br><br>The service here is immaculate. It was really beautiful to I think its at a hotel this place. Its funny because when I got out of my car I was walking around a little confused which direction the front door was located at, and suddenly I realized it was really quiet and the building was beautiful and made out of brick and there were flowers, and a limo..and I go deja vue that I was in a past life on an episode of the bachelor.. my boo ( I dont know what to call him ,we arent official yet because I am weird but thats another story haha)  walked up and saw the confusion on my face and I told him &#34; I feel like I am on the Bachelor, where is my Rose &#34; hahah but yah we went inside and it is almost cave like in there, each table has a hot pot.. the food is really good, we had a pre fix menu for Valentines day. I also tried one of their Mojitos . <br><br>I would def return here. I know it was a little pricey ( I didnt look at the bill! ) but I would def come back here , our server was incredible, I cant remember her name but she was sweet and attentive. I will def come back here !! :) great place for a date. .",

"reviewcomment":"I want to write a review of this because I haven&#39;t been to a fancy-pants restaurant for a while, and this one was great. <br><br>The ambiance is very old-school, and even though I am now a grown woman of 30, I still felt conspicuously young and too flamboyantly dressed. But, whatever. It was a special occasion. The service was still great and warm and friendly. Bonus points for getting me an extra brioche bun when I asked.<br><br>The food was Japanese-French fusion, which sounds suspect, but was very well executed. I gather they have recently changed the menu to be more set and have fewer add-on options, which I think is a good call. Tempting but expensive add-ons always kind of harsh my mellow at super-fancy restaurants. Part of the pleasure of it is just sitting down and not having to make any decisions.<br><br>Our menu for the evening was:<br><br>-Some kind of forgettable amuse-bouche. Maybe involving some kind of gelatin texture? <br><br>-Black truffle tart with black truffle sauce. Excellent. Very mushroom-y, in a good way. Fabulous texture on the pastry crust. Not too heavy or overwhelmed by all of the truffle-ness.<br><br>-Cauliflower mousse with uni, Osetra caviar, scallop tartare, &#39;dashi&#39; geleé and cherry blossom smoke. This was probably my favorite thing. I am often skeptical of overly fussy molecular-gastronomy dishes like this that involve (literal) smoke and mirrors, but this was a winner. Excellent blend of novel textures and flavors that all came together beautifully.<br><br>-Lobster ravioli and mushroom with parsley puree. This was very good, and the lobster was better than most lobster I&#39;ve had on the west coast. And more great mushroom texture and flavor. It didn&#39;t wow me quite as much as the other dishes, but that&#39;s only in comparison to the other outstanding things we got.<br><br>-Then came the brioche and butter, which I liked so much I had them bring me another helping. Even though I knew there was so much more food coming. NO REGRETS.<br><br>-Wagyu beef two ways--braised with mashed potatoes and greens, and seared with a wasabi foam. OH MY GOD THIS WAS SO GOOD. <br><br>Another type of dish of which I am generally skeptical. I feel like there is so much highly-touted fancy beef at fancy restaurants that I have not been overly impressed by. A lot of the supposed wagyu and &#34;kobe&#34; beef I&#39;ve had has been pretty good, but didn&#39;t seem to justify the exorbitant prices. I also tend to think that any kind of steak at a super high-end restaurant is sort of a boring choice compared to the other kinds of concoctions that get put together. <br><br>This was a different story all together. This is definitely the best beef I have ever had. Yeah, I said it. I am sure of it. It was absurdly tender without being mushy, and the flavor was out of control good. Both presentations were excellent and really complemented each other, and the wasabi foam was great and not gimmicky like I feared. BEST. BEEF. EVER. For reals.<br><br>-Dessert--chocolate and white chocolate ganache in cocoa powder with chocolate ice cream, and then another course of tiny cookies on our way out the door. Dessert was honestly kind of disappointing. Like, of course it was good, but the other courses had me expecting something exceptional. That&#39;s okay, though. I feel like lots of bakeries and fancy restaurants do compelling sweets without delivering on all the savory dishes, so I will still take this place over most comparable restaurants any day.<br><br>Oh, slight ding for not really having any non-alcoholic beverages. I think they had coke and sprite. Come on, this is a fancy place! Have some nice juice or ginger beer or something. I guess they&#39;re focused on wine, not cocktails, and there isn&#39;t really a great substitute for wine. <br><br>Great spot, excited I got to eat here. Nice to be able to do once in a while for a very special occasion.",

"reviewcomment":"Jane is my new favorite coffee house / bakery in the city.<br><br>I did a google search for the best hot chocolate in the city (my friend needed some cheering up and she doesn&#39;t drink coffee) and Jane popped up because they make their own marshmallows. BINGO.<br><br>I had never been there before so I sort of wandered in, cruising, being THAT customer that we all know and love ;) The cashier was so nice and helpful, not a smug hipster b that most San Franciscans are familiar with. She explained the pastries to me and offered her opinions very thoughtfully. She didn&#39;t rush me at all, great customer service. <br><br>They also have gluten free and vegan pastries, the gluten free banana bread was one of the best I&#39;ve ever had! And I got my friend the hot chocolate and brioche bun and she LOVED them!<br><br>Overall a wonderful experience and I will definitely return.",

"reviewcomment":"It&#39;s time to profess my LOVE of the Hot Spud. I&#39;ve been a loyal customer from the day they first opened their doors. I&#39;ve probably consumed about 200 spuds since then. I&#39;m an addict. They are my spud dealer. I&#39;ve managed to cut my spud consumption down to about one a week, but the temptation is always there. I never thought I could love potatoes as much as I do. These are NOT your ordinary baked potatoes though.... <br><br>My favorite spud is the shrimp spud. It has Cheese, butter olives, corn, and onions. I add warm sautéed Mushrooms. It is topped with perfectly grilled shrimp. The key ingredient is the Chipotle sauce. I&#39;ve tried to make this sauce at home and I just can&#39;t. It&#39;s the most creamy blend of deliciousness. There is a mixture of spicy, little sweet and a dash of lemon. I&#39;ve reached the point where I request an extra cup on the side. I scrape that spud clean and basically drink the remaining sauce. Like I&#39;ve said, I am an addict.  <br><br>I also like the ambiance. It&#39;s perfect for eating alone or eating with a group. The music playing is always a good beat and the colors are cheerful. The staff is awesome. I just feel good going there and it&#39;s an overall great experience. <br><br>So if you&#39;re wondering whether or not you should check out Hot Spud, I urge you to do so. Just not between 11:30 and 12:00 on the weekdays because that&#39;s when I get my fix and I don&#39;t want to wait on a long line. ;) ENJOY!<br><br>P.S. You get a discount as a local.",

My childhood friends mom does fondue every xmas eve so thats always something that I have to look forward to once a year. I love fondue ! Popular to the misconceived notion , its not just cheese. You do have a cheese pot but there are other pots with olive oil for steak and poultry and seafood.. and then for dessert to... <br><br>The service here is immaculate. It was really beautiful to I think its at a hotel this place. Its funny because when I got out of my car I was walking around a little confused which direction the front door was located at, and suddenly I realized it was really quiet and the building was beautiful and made out of brick and there were flowers, and a limo..and I go deja vue that I was in a past life on an episode of the bachelor.. my boo ( I dont know what to call him ,we arent official yet because I am weird but thats another story haha)  walked up and saw the confusion on my face and I told him &#34; I feel like I am on the Bachelor, where is my Rose &#34; hahah but yah we went inside and it is almost cave like in there, each table has a hot pot.. the food is really good, we had a pre fix menu for Valentines day. I also tried one of their Mojitos . <br><br>I would def return here. I know it was a little pricey ( I didnt look at the bill! ) but I would def come back here , our server was incredible, I cant remember her name but she was sweet and attentive. I will def come back here !! :) great place for a date. .",

"reviewcomment":"Why oh why have I waited until now to try this place?! I&#39;ve walked by this place so many times and boy have I been missing out.<br><br>Ok, so it&#39;s Lent ... 40 days and 40 nights of NO MEAT (beef, pork, chicken) basically only fish/seafood is okay. At least for me--- I opted to abstain from meat for the duration of lent instead of just Ash Wednesday and Fridays. A challenge for sure, trying things like veggie burgers and other vegan options.<br><br>It&#39;s Sunday evening and I&#39;m starving after mass, where oh where should I eat? I happened to be walking by Super Duper and they have veggie burgers and GARLIC Fries! Yes, garlic fries. No meat in the garlic fries so you better believe I didn&#39;t miss out an opportunity to try them.<br><br>The cashier was very nice and their service is quick. They handed me a buzzer and I only waited about 5 minutes to get my order. I only had enough time to pick a place to sit and take a peak at what others ordered. A burger joint is so hard to come to when you can&#39;t eat meat, I definitely can&#39;t wait to come back and try a REAL burger. <br><br>Anywho! The veggie burger was great! Perfectly cooked fresh veggie pattie with all the toppings as well as avocado and jack cheese between what a bun should be -- an equal number of soft and firm. This was so filling, but not too much that I felt overstuffed.<br><br>This was a great pair with the highly talked about garlic fries. If only there were a way to capture scent... Man! I wish you guys could smell these things and I mean that in a good way. The fries come with FRESH not powdered garlic like some places and topped with cheese.  And again, THE SMELL!!!! mmmmmmm ... So good... It&#39;s definitely too much for me, if your out with someone it would be good enough to share between two people. But maybe that&#39;s just my opinion. <br><br>Oh and I also gave up soda for lent-- they have a delicious lemonade with brown sugar. <br><br>Price wise... Yeah, they are a little pricey I ended up paying a little over $14 for my veggie burger, garlic fries and drink, but I don&#39;t mind paying for good food.<br><br>To sum it up: <br><br>Veggie Burger: Super<br>Garlic Fries: Duper<br>Lemonade: Delightful<br><br>Thank you for a great Sunday night dinner (:",

Find them cozily placed on Irving and 15th Ave, with window in front to let in some nice natural light (yes there is sunshine in Sunset..).

Bring your computer, or a very chatty friend, and enjoy a good coffee with an affordable lunch from a hearty menu too. <br><br>Big thumbs up from me...And I&#39;ve tried most places in this neighborhood...Give it a shot!",

"reviewcomment":"So I have been waiting and needing a new experience to bring me back to writing awesome reviews and Whalah! I stumbled across the Millennium!!!!  The first thing that comes to mind is the essence of the inner layout and the precarious placement of its urban location.  The inner parts of this restaurant reminded me of a 1950&#39;s high scale restaurant perhaps in lower Manhattan or Harlem and for some reason I was waiting for Duke Ellington or John Coltrane to appear with quartet and play some unconventional Jazz standards.  In addition, located in the lobby of the Hotel California and smack in the middle of the cities lower Tenderloin District placement could have not been more advantageous or suitable .<br><br> I love the hustle and bustle of SF especially on a Friday or Saturday night, its actually a very nostalgic type of feeling traveling to the location and arriving in front of such a befitting landmark.  When it comes to Vegan food I&#39;m severely biased and well reserved in my opinions of great experiences however, when required too I succumb.  The Millennium in my opinion is a mix between extremely fine dining and shot of morphine intravenously, simply because it really provides the ultimate experience as it pertains to dining and enjoying food.  The atmosphere was filled with positive energy and before I had a bite I almost was certain my experience would be quite overwhelming and worthy of a complete experience and not just conventional dining.  I arrived and was greeted at the front door but the house was extremely packed so while waiting I proceeded to the bar for some libations.  The bar is awesome and worth your undivided attention for many locals drop by just to briefly pregame and continue...  I would definitely come here just to sit at the bar in fact perhaps I will!<br><br>In summation, I ordered the Coconut crusted tofu with curry and a side of lightly steamed kale greens and a chocolate almond midnight for dessert.  The food was ecstatically jubilant and left me in an intense state of euphoria.  They far exceeded beyond my expectations in every regard.  I can still taste the intense but appropriately placed spices and herbs drifting across my palate.   Mind you the prices are not cheap I spent $50 bucks for my fare not including tips or drinks but I must say it was worth $100...   This experience was &#34;Rapturous&#34; subsequently leaving me as if I accomplished my most important task of the day by merely walking through the door.  Its almost unfair to have such a pleasant experience simply because it makes for a disappointing series of events to occur as I explore new options  (note to self)  don&#39;t set such high expectations for upcoming destinations. <br><br>This place is busy especially on weekends so if you plan on coming be prepared to wait if not make a reservation.  I highly recommend making a reservation!!!  I wholeheartedly recommend this establishment and can assure you with certainty you will not be disappointed....  This place is one of the reasons SF is perhaps one of the best cities on the planet...   You MUST Go HERE!  Immediately..........",

My childhood friends mom does fondue every xmas eve so thats always something that I have to look forward to once a year. I love fondue ! Popular to the misconceived notion , its not just cheese. You do have a cheese pot but there are other pots with olive oil for steak and poultry and seafood.. and then for dessert to... <br><br>The service here is immaculate. It was really beautiful to I think its at a hotel this place. Its funny because when I got out of my car I was walking around a little confused which direction the front door was located at, and suddenly I realized it was really quiet and the building was beautiful and made out of brick and there were flowers, and a limo..and I go deja vue that I was in a past life on an episode of the bachelor.. my boo ( I dont know what to call him ,we arent official yet because I am weird but thats another story haha)  walked up and saw the confusion on my face and I told him &#34; I feel like I am on the Bachelor, where is my Rose &#34; hahah but yah we went inside and it is almost cave like in there, each table has a hot pot.. the food is really good, we had a pre fix menu for Valentines day. I also tried one of their Mojitos . <br><br>I would def return here. I know it was a little pricey ( I didnt look at the bill! ) but I would def come back here , our server was incredible, I cant remember her name but she was sweet and attentive. I will def come back here !! :) great place for a date. .",

If you can get over there before the menu gets changed I would highly suggest ordering the Ricotta Cavatelli. Great news as you can order half orders of the pasta!! So you can try a couple if you&#39;d like. The Cavatelli was delicious. Probably my favorite of the night even though the Sea Bass was amazing. But pasta just always hits for me. The Sea Bass I finished so quickly my date was astonished as was I. I meant to offer him a bite but next thing I knew it was gone. Ooops. He ordered half orders of the spaghetti, cavatelli, and steak &amp; fries. Plates were cleaned.<br><br>For dessert I got the Young Ginger Pavlova which was bonkers. If you are a fan of meringues and coconut I highly recommend it.<br><br>I&#39;ll certainly come back.",

It was a cozy romantic atmosphere, great service and food! I got a creamy shrimp pasta any my husband got a a meat and pork pasta special both were amazing! It may be because I&#39;m expecting and eating for two (my excuse) that I ended up finishing my entire entree, which was a good size portion. Bruschetta is a must, so fresh and flavorful! <br><br>We passed on the dessert menu, we were so full, but the server gave us a complimentary Panna cotta dessert topped with fresh fruits.. he said it was for the &#34;baby&#34; haha!!

"reviewcomment":"So I just started this thing called Coffee Meets Bagel and saw this place serves bagels for breakfast so I thought it be a fun place to meet my &#34;bagel&#34; here. <br><br>I waited for 40 minutes. No show. No text saying she&#39;d be late...no response. So while I was waiting I looked over the entire menu, observed the folks casually enjoying their morning brews in the parklet seating area, and checked out some of the small details of the shop. <br><br>This place is like the perfect combination of things: bike shop, coffee shop, good food, and even beer with a happy hour! Can this place be more hipster than that?! <br><br>Anyway, I chalked up the date as a loss and ordered myself a breakfast bagel to go and went home. The bagel hit the spot and I&#39;m glad that I at least got to enjoy some kind of bagel! <br><br>I shall return! Hopefully I&#39;ll have a more successful bagel and check out the little garden in the back. Oh! And don&#39;t forget that the cafe is cash only.",

"reviewcomment":"Wow. So good that I feel the need to write a review in the middle of my meal here!<br>I completely understand why Quince got upgraded to a Michelin 2 star last year.  Definitely everything I have come to expect from restaurants at this level. Incredible service, intricate, imaginative dishes and elegant ambience. I am dining here by myself and the staff has made me feel very comfortable and welcome. <br>Many 2 and 3 star restaurants where I have eaten are usually excellent but seem to imitate the Ferran Adria\ Thomas Keller style. While I am not denigrating this in any way (to the contrary) it is a delight to experience haute cuisine that borrows from this school but also creates something very unique. The menu seems to very much express the current season (spring) without being too light. Quite expensive but if you are a true foodie it&#39;s worth every penny. Epic.<br>Well, time to get back to the food!",

My childhood friends mom does fondue every xmas eve so thats always something that I have to look forward to once a year. I love fondue ! Popular to the misconceived notion , its not just cheese. You do have a cheese pot but there are other pots with olive oil for steak and poultry and seafood.. and then for dessert to... <br><br>The service here is immaculate. It was really beautiful to I think its at a hotel this place. Its funny because when I got out of my car I was walking around a little confused which direction the front door was located at, and suddenly I realized it was really quiet and the building was beautiful and made out of brick and there were flowers, and a limo..and I go deja vue that I was in a past life on an episode of the bachelor.. my boo ( I dont know what to call him ,we arent official yet because I am weird but thats another story haha)  walked up and saw the confusion on my face and I told him &#34; I feel like I am on the Bachelor, where is my Rose &#34; hahah but yah we went inside and it is almost cave like in there, each table has a hot pot.. the food is really good, we had a pre fix menu for Valentines day. I also tried one of their Mojitos . <br><br>I would def return here. I know it was a little pricey ( I didnt look at the bill! ) but I would def come back here , our server was incredible, I cant remember her name but she was sweet and attentive. I will def come back here !! :) great place for a date. .",

The choice of what kind of meat I want in my burger, how I want my burger, the old fashion milkshakes made with their homemade ice cream, different type of fries with different type of toppings. Everything about this place was awesome and made me wish I would find myself on Union Street in San Francisco more often.<br><br>And let me tell you, they don&#39;t skimp on anything. The style burgers were huge and with plenty of ingredients. But not overwhelming with ingredients that you couldn&#39;t find the meat. It was well proportion. I&#39;m glad my friend and went with a style rather than trying to build my own burger. With so much to choose from, I don&#39;t think I would have ever made a final decision.",

"reviewcomment":"I was very impressed by the service and food of Mission Public. Albeit the name is a little confusing, and doesn&#39;t really indicate that it is a coffee shop, cafe, and bar. After telling the server that it was my birthday, he immediately went and filled up a glass of their finest beer, and insisted that this one was on them. Anthony was as pleasant as can be and made me feel right at home.<br><br>Still, the food was just as great as the friendliness. I had a delicious upper deck sandwich, which was accompanied by a tasty side salad. I was very impressed by how fast the service is, and how they created a sandwich this good and this beautiful so quickly.<br><br>Finally, the ambience of the cafe is the perfect harmony of its three functions; as a cafe, coffee shop, and bar. Light music, wifi, well lit interior, and awesome seating. I highly recommend this place. I came here as my only meal in San Francisco, and I am pleasantly surprised.<br><br>This place has a ton of character, and is executed very well. You&#39;d do well to stop by, if even just for a drink. Mission Public is fantastic.",

"reviewcomment":"This is by far my favorite steakhouse. My uncle celebrated his birthday here and it went perfectly. My aunt worked with the sweetest lady-I forgot her name, who literally did everything she could to accommodate our needs and made sure our dinner party ran smoothly.<br><br>They made us custom menus too! (check my photos)<br><br>As soon as I walked into our private room downstairs, waiters were literally feeding me crab cakes and shrimp like I was a queen. The appetizers are delicious. I&#39;ve eaten a lot of crab cakes in my time and these were the BEST. I was shoving shrimp and crab cakes into my mouth nonstop for a good 15 minutes.<br><br>I felt like a spoiled kid. The second my glass was empty, a waiter was already over my shoulder refilling it. <br><br>I ordered:<br><br>Salad w/ Little Gem &amp; Romaine, Parmesan Vinaigrette, Crispy Capers, Olive Crostini, Nisoshi, Poached Egg: Absolutely delicious. This took salad to a completely new level. The poached egg was the perfect addition to the salad.<br><br>Prime Rib: This is what made me fall in love with Alexanders. Words cannot describe how much I enjoyed this slab of meat. There was a point where I was so full I wanted to cry but I pushed myself to finish because it was so good. Any kind of food isn&#39;t appetizing when you&#39;re full but this WAS. I knew I would regret it the next day if I didn&#39;t finish it- THAT&#39;s how good it was. <br><br>Banana Creme Tart: This isn&#39;t an item on the menu. The chef made it specially for our party because banana cream pie is my uncle&#39;s favorite dessert. The restaurant literally created a new dessert because they HAD to make my uncle&#39;s birthday perfect. Amazing. This place is just amazing. This also became my new favorite dessert. It was SO delicious. Despite eating so much that my stomach was about to explode, after a bite of this I HAD to finish the entire thing. I got a second plate because I couldn&#39;t get enough. It pains me to know that this is not a permanent item, I would order five plates of this every time I come.<br><br>They also gave us this delicious cotton candy after dessert. It was also amazing.<br><br>They also provided us with our own private bathrooms which were basically zen gardens. I wish I took pictures and could show you! Our dining room was beautiful, classy, and comfortable. I felt extremely underdressed.<br><br>This was the best dining experience I&#39;ve ever had. The waiters were super friendly and socialized with us. We all became friends with them by the time our party was over. I knew all about their families and life-changing experiences. How crazy is that? Alexanders will forever and always be my favorite restaurant. Who ever runs this place does a hell of a job and all the employees are angels.",

Not even sure how to describe it but it was delicious. <br><br>And the fried chicken...was heavenly. The flavor was everything! Sweet, salty, and with a bit of a kick. I can&#39;t express how amazing this eating experience was. <br><br>Lastly, for dessert we got an apple tart? Or something like that. The pastry part was very crispy but good. It worked really well with the fruit, sauce, and ice cream. <br><br>The decor was beautiful and trendy. Service a tad slow but allowed us to digest a bit in between courses.",

My childhood friends mom does fondue every xmas eve so thats always something that I have to look forward to once a year. I love fondue ! Popular to the misconceived notion , its not just cheese. You do have a cheese pot but there are other pots with olive oil for steak and poultry and seafood.. and then for dessert to... <br><br>The service here is immaculate. It was really beautiful to I think its at a hotel this place. Its funny because when I got out of my car I was walking around a little confused which direction the front door was located at, and suddenly I realized it was really quiet and the building was beautiful and made out of brick and there were flowers, and a limo..and I go deja vue that I was in a past life on an episode of the bachelor.. my boo ( I dont know what to call him ,we arent official yet because I am weird but thats another story haha)  walked up and saw the confusion on my face and I told him &#34; I feel like I am on the Bachelor, where is my Rose &#34; hahah but yah we went inside and it is almost cave like in there, each table has a hot pot.. the food is really good, we had a pre fix menu for Valentines day. I also tried one of their Mojitos . <br><br>I would def return here. I know it was a little pricey ( I didnt look at the bill! ) but I would def come back here , our server was incredible, I cant remember her name but she was sweet and attentive.

"reviewcomment":"As many of you know, construction vehicles in front of a sandwich joint are the 5-star Yelp review of yesteryear.  So on my way to work, where I am frequently inconvenienced by double-parked work trucks clogging up the street, rather than banging my steering wheel and yelling terrible things, I smile and think, &#34;Thanks for the tip, fellas!&#34;<br><br>That&#39;s the low-tech story of how I found Freddie&#39;s, a beautifully simple-- but far from run-of-the-mill-- Italian sandwich shop:  double-parked trucks.<br><br>Warning to pretentious food snobs:  the wonderfully drab interior of this sandwich shop will not translate well over Instagram and there is no Sonoma squab liver pate or tea leaves pooped out by monkeys on the menu.  <br><br>Head&#39;s up to my veggie brethren: the vegetarian sandwich is deliciously fresh, with a touch of herbaceous crunch.  It goes far beyond some boring-ass deli sandwich, hold the meat.  There&#39;s also a falafel option.<br><br>A tip for my girls who is always on diets:  the small (6&#34;) sandwich is just the right size for keister control.<br><br>To thems who would never really call themselves foodies but like to put interesting things in their mouths:  there&#39;s herbs in the mustard that add a delicious brightness to your sammy.  There&#39;s also a freshly-baked sweet onion roll bread option, and you can add hot or mild pepper spreads, garlic spread or even cranberry sauce to any sandwich. And of course, there&#39;s a wide variety of Italian cured meats.<br><br>Word up to children of the 70&#39;s and 80&#39;s:  they serve carrot and raisin salad.  No, I don&#39;t want to eat it!  But it&#39;s cool, right?<br><br>Freddie&#39;s has been around since 1926.  1926, beeches!  That&#39;s a lot of cumulative construction crew cred. (And also pretty much guarantees that Joe DiMaggio enjoyed a sandwich here, too, btw.)  Tucked away in that mildly unfashionable North Beach-slash-Fisherman&#39;s Wharf zone, it has somehow quietly survived douchefication and hippies and earthquakes and the middle school kids across the street, so you and I and every dude in a hard hat within two miles can enjoy a tasty sangwich.",

"reviewcomment":"I LOVE this place!!! My bf and I discovered this place when we were on a healthy kick last summer and decided to give it a try. We&#39;ve never once regretted it. All the items are delicious AND healthy for you! Best part is that the calories are already calculated and laid out for you to see to have a better idea of what to choose and how much. We both keep coming back to our two faves: the meatloaf and the bulgar with wild mushrooms. Yum yum! <br><br>We&#39;ve met and spoken with the owner several times. Everyone that works there is super nice, friendly, and helpful. It&#39;s just such a shame that this is the only location as it&#39;s a bit of a drive for us, but we willingly make the trek every month or so.<br><br>Parking is fine during the day time, but as evening approaches it becomes increasingly difficult. <br><br>I think the prices are fair given how much you would spend at another fast food joint for much less healthy food. But no kidding - the clean living can cost you a couple of pretty pennies. <br><br>I&#39;m so in love with this place, I swear even their WATER is phenomenal! :P Please try this place out if you&#39;re considering. Also, you can take extras to go to heat up another night - one less drive to go though!",

Everything about this place is fantastic. <br>We did the tasting menu because it&#39;s probably the best deal in SF. $20 for four courses with large portions. Tip: add the Arepa for $8. It&#39;s a MUST! <br>My friend and I got sat at the chefs counter and it was such a treat! Johnny, the chef was so nice and friendly. He chit chatted with us all night and we had the pleasure of watching him cook our delicious food-he&#39;s pretty easy on the eyes too! ;) <br>This place is really special and completely unpretentious.

My childhood friends mom does fondue every xmas eve so thats always something that I have to look forward to once a year. I love fondue ! Popular to the misconceived notion , its not just cheese. You do have a cheese pot but there are other pots with olive oil for steak and poultry and seafood.. and then for dessert to... <br><br>The service here is immaculate. It was really beautiful to I think its at a hotel this place. Its funny because when I got out of my car I was walking around a little confused which direction the front door was located at, and suddenly I realized it was really quiet and the building was beautiful and made out of brick and there were flowers, and a limo..and I go deja vue that I was in a past life on an episode of the bachelor.. my boo ( I dont know what to call him ,we arent official yet because I am weird but thats another story haha)  walked up and saw the confusion on my face and I told him &#34; I feel like I am on the Bachelor, where is my Rose &#34; hahah but yah we went inside and it is almost cave like in there, each table has a hot pot.. the food is really good, we had a pre fix menu for Valentines day. I also tried one of their Mojitos . <br><br>I would def return here. I know it was a little pricey ( I didnt look at the bill! ) but I would def come back here , our server was incredible, I cant remember her name but she was sweet and attentive. I will def come back here !! :) great place for a date. .",

She was craving their Oyster Po&#39; Boy sandwich which she described to me as a delicious sandwich with &#34;raw and fried oysters&#34;. I was already salivating when she told me! <br><br>It was such a nice, sunny day at the Ferry Building so we just sat near the pier and ate. I wish they had togo boxes, though. The bread was perfectly toasted and it was easy to eat, despite all the good stuff inside. <br><br>I ate it all, needless to say.

Golden waffles are seriously one of the only things that&#39;ll make me jump out of bed. This means waking up, getting ready, and driving to Stonestown on Sunday mornings in order to catch this food truck before they leave at 1pm. No regrets. At all.<br><br>Even when I&#39;m not having a sweet tooth, just the sweet smell of mouthwatering liege waffles makes me change my mind. The waffles are always served fresh and warm, caramelized at its crust, and soft and chewy in the center. Absolute heaven. I also love how the sweetness from the sugar pearls aren&#39;t overwhelming and is a perfect compliment for a good-sized waffle. I usually like mine plain but extra plus for having condiments in case you&#39;re feeling a little bit of a heavier snack. <br><br>Seriously, no regrets.",

Initially we wanted to have the truck park outside the office and we would get the food from the truck. Logistically this ended up being a mess with our office building so we asked if they could bring the food upstairs and we would just have the entire event in our office. No Problem!<br><br>The team was on time, friendly, and efficient. Set up was a breeze - they brought a flat top up to heat tortillas, had all the meat choices, rice beans, salsa, chips and guac and it was all DELISH!<br><br>The entire company raved about how good the food was- everyone got more than enough and quickly too. Them being able to change gears and serve in the office saved the day. <br><br>I would highly recommend Red Rooster for any event. <br><br>Good food, good service, great price point.",

"reviewcomment":"This is my second review for sea biscuit.  First review was tepid--good spot, but the coffee was a bit underwhelming for the price.  <br><br>However, the sandwiches here are hands down all-time.  Recently went with the Sea Biscut on the recommendation of staff.  Hot pastrami, gouda and avocado, mustard, mayo, romain onion, banana pepper, really lean boars head, and a semmifreddy dutch crunch roll.  <br><br>Staff says this young spot (4 months) serves mostly a neighborhood clientele here in the outer sunset.  But if you are looking for a destination sandwich spot, and think you know the best in San Francisco, then you must come here to test your palate.  Sandwich is a hands down 5.<br><br>Solid crew woking the sandwich line and coffee bar.  <br><br>Out of hood beach goers need to know this spot.<br><br>Sandwiches are 7-8 bucks, really fair considering how big they are.  Split one with a drink and it&#39;s a proper, filling but not stuffing lunch.<br><br>Their reputation is growing.  I&#39;ve heard several people in the past weeks speak similarly about their sandwiches.",

"reviewcomment":"Lolinda is a fantastic steak &amp; tapas place in the Mission. I first tried it when they opened and again just recently. Both times were equally amazing. Great food and service all around.<br><br>The place gets busy pretty quickly, so I definitely recommend arriving early or making reservations. Luckily our party of 3 was able to snatch a last minute reservation on OpenTable.<br><br>Every dish we ordered was absolutely AMAZING. The plates are meant to be shared, so 4-5 dishes were more than enough for a group of 3. I&#39;d also def recommend splitting a steak too.<br><br>FOOD:<br>* Ceviche MIxto - surprisingly fresh and delicately balanced. Usually I&#39;m not a fan of ceviche because I find the lemon/lime juice too overpowering, but this was really good. The fried corn was also a great complement to the seafood.<br>* Crispy Pork Belly - I could&#39;ve eaten this whole plate by myself. Crispy on the outside, and tender and juicy in the middle. YUMM.<br>* Bone Marrow - Melt in your mouth good. <br>* Rib Eye Steak - Seasoned and cooked perfectly. Not the most flavorful dish of the night, which is saying something since I still thought it was amazing steak in general.<br>* Braised Beef Ribs - At this point, I think we were already full. But the beef ribs were so tender and the tomato sauce was so good, we just kept stuffing our faces. The carrots and potatoes in this dish were also very flavorful.<br>* Milk &amp; Cookies - The perfect bite of dessert, especially after such a filling meal. <br><br>Everything was reasonably priced, especially since the dishes are meant to be shared. I really enjoyed everything we tried and thought service/ambiance was great overall. Definitely need to come back more often!",

My childhood friends mom does fondue every xmas eve so thats always something that I have to look forward to once a year. I love fondue ! Popular to the misconceived notion , its not just cheese. You do have a cheese pot but there are other pots with olive oil for steak and poultry and seafood.. and then for dessert to... <br><br>The service here is immaculate. It was really beautiful to I think its at a hotel this place. Its funny because when I got out of my car I was walking around a little confused which direction the front door was located at, and suddenly I realized it was really quiet and the building was beautiful and made out of brick and there were flowers, and a limo..and I go deja vue that I was in a past life on an episode of the bachelor.. my boo ( I dont know what to call him ,we arent official yet because I am weird but thats another story haha)  walked up and saw the confusion on my face and I told him &#34; I feel like I am on the Bachelor, where is my Rose &#34; hahah but yah we went inside and it is almost cave like in there, each table has a hot pot.. the food is really good, we had a pre fix menu for Valentines day. I also tried one of their Mojitos . <br><br>I would def return here. I know it was a little pricey ( I didnt look at the bill! ) but I would def come back here , our server was incredible, I cant remember her name but she was sweet and attentive. I will def come back here !! :) great place for a date. .",

"reviewcomment":"As I promised myself, my very first EVER review is going to Tekka. <br><br>For about 2-3 months before I actually ate here, I would fall asleep staring at the pictures of their sashimi combos on my phone (not joking). My boyfriend brought me here for my birthday and we ran into some traffic and didn&#39;t there until about 6pm. From all the other reviews, 6pm is considered &#34;late&#34; if you wanna make the 7:15pm seating, so I started getting nervous that we wouldn&#39;t make it. When we got there, there was no one there, and there was still no line even at 6:45pm, so I started to think it was closed for the day since I also read that they like to close randomly without notification. People walked up and mumbled that it was closed, and the two girls that showed up in line were also convinced they wouldn&#39;t open. We waited until 7:20pm, and right when we were about to leave, a car pulled up, and it was Nobu &amp; his cute little wife! We got in at about 7:45pm and were seated in front of his work station. There were about 8 of us total. Soon after we got seated, we were served green tea, and his wife took our orders.<br><br>We ordered:<br>Sashimi combo<br>Agedashi tofu<br>Hamachi kama<br>2 unagi nigiri (1 piece per order)<br>2 uni<br>2 scallop nigiri<br><br>Their nigiri is HUGE--about half the size of my chopsticks. The sashimi combo came with easily 48 pieces of extremely fresh sashimi that Nobu cuts in front of you. I liked how the agedashi tofu came with a mountain of bonito flakes, but the sauce was kindof thick, like a teriyaki sauce. The hamachi kama--GET IT. IT IS AMAZING. The meat is so moist and the crust is crispy, salty, and lemony. GET IT.<br><br>Overall, we over-ordered. A group of 2 people next to us left spending about $75, and we left spending ~$115 after tip and tax (oh yeah, CASH ONLY). Tekka is definitely on the low spectrum of $$$ because you&#39;re getting a LOT more than what you would at any other restaurant for the same price. And--Nobu and his wife are so cute! When we left, they stopped what they were doing, smiled, and yelled &#34;arigato!&#34; The wait is worth it, especially with their extremely reasonable prices and high quality of food. Next time I&#39;ll order the spicy tuna roll--it looked huge and packed with strips of tuna! Eat here! I&#39;ll definitely be back.",

"reviewcomment":"As mentioned in my previous review, 15 Romolo is a great bar with totally underrated food. And if food is underrated, then brunch at 15 Romolo is the most underrated meal here but that needs to change. This is brunch done right. <br><br>Let&#39;s start with waffle shots. It&#39;s 15 Romolo&#39;s amuse bouche for boozy brunch and boozy it is. Bite sized waffle sprinkled with powdered sugar dunked into a bourbon/rum and coffee liquer shot. Now I&#39;m ready for brunch. But wait let&#39;s order a Bloody Mary first. By far one of the spiciest Bloodys in the city but it&#39;s mighty tasty. If spicy is not your thing, then the Beetlejuice is a nice gin and beet alternative. or just get a glass of punch because as it says on the menu, &#34;without a drink in hand, brunch is just breakfast.&#34;<br><br>Menu changes somewhat often which is great for variety but sad to see old favorites like the fried chicken biscuit go away. It&#39;s almost like the dinner version but throw in some egg, bacon, and hashbrowns. Yum! But my new favorite brunch item on the current brunch menu is the country fried steak. Tenderized beef breaded, fried, then smothered in gravy accompanied by some over easy eggs and hashbrowns plus some salad for balance. So satisfying for brunch. <br><br>I love boozy brunch at 15 Romolo. If you like happy hour here, you need to stop by for brunch. I think the bar best explains why themselves: &#34;If 15 Romolo is a well-kept secret, then our weekend pnchdrnkbrnch is f-ing Narnia!&#34;",

"reviewcomment":"Great place for fancy schmancy dim sum!!<br><br>I thought the bill was going to be horrendous from previous reviews, but it really wasn&#39;t that bad.  Comparable in price to Yank Sing, but a much swankier, high end, hip and exclusive feel to it.  I think two of us ate for about $120, and that&#39;s a no holds barred meal, smorgasbord of food, also including seafood and drinks.  All the dishes were about $6-12 each, except the main lobster with spinach noodle, which ran about $28 but was weeellllllll worth it. YUM.<br><br>Each dish comes out artistically presented on a plate or in a bamboo steamer.  Each dish more delicious and beautiful than the last!!  The only unimpressive dish was the fried rice.  We ordered the chocolate orange dessert and were blown away not only by the taste, but the pop rocks added an outside-the-box texture and the presentation includes an interactive display of melting the outer shell of the chocolate ball right before your eyes and revealing the light and fluffy truffle innards.  Oh and it had edible gold flakes all over it too.  You basically feel like you are literally eating royalty.  <br><br>Great place to take a guest or a group if you really want to impress.  We came for lunch and it wasn&#39;t too busy, but I could totally see this place hopping on a Friday/Saturday night.  The bar is huge and looks like it could be a lot of fun for a group of people or for those looking for a good time ;) ;)",

"reviewcomment":"Walzwerk might be my favorite German restaurant in the US (yes, even beat Leopold&#39;s)<br><br>On a crisp evening on Van Ness, my travel companion to Frankfurt once upon a time and I decided to transport ourselves back in time through a dining experience not soon to be forgotten. <br><br>The two ladies working that evening were more than cordial, and we ended up dining at the small bar seating next to the kitchen. We were brought out an array of recommendations from the ladies, and each dish came with a story or a memory to match the delicious food presented to us. <br><br>For some reason, German dining is always warm and inviting, but at Walzwerk, the bar is set high.",

"reviewcomment":"In my estimations thus far Okina is the best &#34;authentic&#34; style sushi place in San Francisco. If you crave California style fusion rolls laden with avocado, spicy mayonnaise, chicken, etc. do not waste your time coming here, this is purist sushi. <br><br>The spartan menu consists simply of nigiri, sashimi, and beer. Sashimi is priced the same as nigiri, which is fairly unheard of. Once you go you will realize this is because he uses the same sized sashimi cuts for both the sashimi and the nigiri. What fish is available will vary each time you come, as allegedly he only opens the restaurant with the freshest fish of the day. <br><br>Important to note, if you cannot make and keep a reservation do not come here. Walk-in dining is virtually unheard of and somewhat frowned upon at this tiny 12 person seating restaurant. They take reservations same day if you call the hour they open and it is possible to book a day or two in advance which is HIGHLY advisable as they book up for the entire weekend fast! <br><br>The bottom line: best raw authentic sushi, hours and reservations take some attention to detail to successfully execute, overall completely worthwhile, real hole in the wall, bring a date or a friend not a group.",

My childhood friends mom does fondue every xmas eve so thats always something that I have to look forward to once a year. I love fondue ! Popular to the misconceived notion , its not just cheese. You do have a cheese pot but there are other pots with olive oil for steak and poultry and seafood.. and then for dessert to... <br><br>The service here is immaculate. It was really beautiful to I think its at a hotel this place. Its funny because when I got out of my car I was walking around a little confused which direction the front door was located at, and suddenly I realized it was really quiet and the building was beautiful and made out of brick and there were flowers, and a limo..and I go deja vue that I was in a past life on an episode of the bachelor.. my boo ( I dont know what to call him ,we arent official yet because I am weird but thats another story haha)  walked up and saw the confusion on my face and I told him &#34; I feel like I am on the Bachelor, where is my Rose &#34; hahah but yah we went inside and it is almost cave like in there, each table has a hot pot.. the food is really good, we had a pre fix menu for Valentines day. I also tried one of their Mojitos . <br><br>I would def return here. I know it was a little pricey ( I didnt look at the bill! ) but I would def come back here , our server was incredible, I cant remember her name but she was sweet and attentive. I will def come back here !! :) great place for a date. .",

I am a newbie but I knew I wanted a concert size, have a soprano at home. Beyond that, I was up for anything. Edgar showed me a range of concert ukes (they have a surprisingly wide selection) and once I chose one, he spent easily ten minutes stretching the strings and tuning it for me. If that&#39;s not excellent customer service, I don&#39;t know what is!! My purchase was modest but Edgar was extremely generous with his time. Trust me when I say he has some beautiful instruments there  and NO JUNK. It is worth a trip to Aloha Warehouse to check it out!",

"reviewcomment":"We had Firetrail Pizza cater our wedding at Wellington&#39;s Wine Bar, and they did a terrific job!  They worked with us to pick pizzas we all liked, and even made a custom pizza based just on a description of a pizza we liked at a bar in SF, which we found very accommodating and helpful.  Firetrail even coordinated the place setting rental for the wedding reception, and helped cut and serve ice cream and the cake we brought in!  Jed, Krissy and the Firetrail staff worked very hard to make sure everyone was well fed, and brought everything out at exactly the times we&#39;d asked for.<br><br>Of course, most importantly, the pizza and appetizers were DELICIOUS!  No picture can capture how good this thin crust pizza right out of the oven is.  And I highly suggest the bacon wrapped shrimp, which had our guests literally sending emails the next week to say how much they enjoyed it.<br><br>Definitely try their food truck at SOMA Streat Park, and use them for great pizza at your next event!",

My childhood friends mom does fondue every xmas eve so thats always something that I have to look forward to once a year. I love fondue ! Popular to the misconceived notion , its not just cheese. You do have a cheese pot but there are other pots with olive oil for steak and poultry and seafood.. and then for dessert to... <br><br>The service here is immaculate. It was really beautiful to I think its at a hotel this place. Its funny because when I got out of my car I was walking around a little confused which direction the front door was located at, and suddenly I realized it was really quiet and the building was beautiful and made out of brick and there were flowers, and a limo..and I go deja vue that I was in a past life on an episode of the bachelor.. my boo ( I dont know what to call him ,we arent official yet because I am weird but thats another story haha)  walked up and saw the confusion on my face and I told him &#34; I feel like I am on the Bachelor, where is my Rose &#34; hahah but yah we went inside and it is almost cave like in there, each table has a hot pot.. the food is really good, we had a pre fix menu for Valentines day. I also tried one of their Mojitos . <br><br>I would def return here. I know it was a little pricey ( I didnt look at the bill! ) but I would def come back here , our server was incredible, I cant remember her name but she was sweet and attentive. I will def come back here !! :) great place for a date. .",

We were seated right away, had some deliciously fluffy bread, and had a decent view of the water. Our waiter, Salvatore, was really nice and professional (old school waitstaff).<br><br>We ordered a Hot Sampler Trio for Two ($26); it was a mix of Calamari Fritti, Rock Shrimp Scampi, and Crabcakes. BF had a Bloody Mary ($10). <br><br>The sampler was really tasty. The calamari fritti was perfectly crispy, the Crabcakes held together but were deliciously moist, and the shrimp scampi was perfectly cooked (and the sauce was great for bread dipping!) BF really liked his Bloody Mary as well!  Overall, great pricey little spot tucked away from the hustle and bustle of the wharf. We&#39;d definitely be back.",
