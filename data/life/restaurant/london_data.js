"reviewcomment":"Best hog dog in London? You bet!<br><br>I have sampled a Big Apple hot dog on a couple of occasions and if different locations, but the most memorable was at Grillstock in Bristol.<br><br>I was there for the weekend, so on the Saturday I treated myself to a &#39;Huge Pole&#39; a succulent 8 inch beef &amp; pork dog sausage seasoned with sage, mace and cayenne peppe, a real mouth fall, really delicious!<br><br>Then on the Sunday we were back, my mate Dave was chatting away to the owner Abiye and the topic food challenges came up, then Abiye laid down the challenge, some guy had done a double &#39;Huge Pole&#39; but someone needed to take it up a notch, yep, that guy was me.<br><br>The Triple Pole: The deal was I had to fit a everything in my gob and have a bite, then I had to finish the beast and If I completed the challenge, the &#39;Triple Pole&#39; would be on Abiye.<br><br>Guess what? I demolished it with ease, and the main reason was the standard of those sausages, so tasty I manged three of the buggers and that&#39;s why Big Apple Hot Dogs is the best hot dog in London.",

"reviewcomment":"An English meal so good on American Thanksgiving that I didn&#39;t even miss home.<br><br>Food: Started with a nice (yet awkwardly sweet) amuse bouche of foie gras foam (very mild) and squid ink on a biscuit. Next we had scallop ceviche with seaweed oil and frozen horseradish. Surprisingly, the cold was a good touch. Cornish turbot was cooked perfectly and plated beautifully. The roast quail with fennel was delectable. For dessert, the sommelier recommended a nice red with the cheese plate we specially assembled. To top it all off, the jelly doughnuts were exquisite.<br><br>Service: The first whiff of the devotion this place had to fine dining is that they didn&#39;t give us coat check tickets - just remembered whose coat belonged to whom. Class. The servers were friendly, talkative, and not uppity at all. <br><br>Ambience: Elegant yet welcoming decor. Dressy and upscale.<br><br>Bottom Line: When searching for an unbeatable meal in central London, look no further than the Ledbury.",

"reviewcomment":"Wow. Imaginative menu and an uber cool buzz - this place got my attention and held it!<br><br>6 of us got a table on a Wednesday evening to celebrate my housemate&#39;s birthday, sitting right next to the floor-to-ceiling windows for a view I&#39;ll call &#39;monsoon on cobblestones&#39;. Luckily my seat faced inwards, so I could enjoy the open plan kitchen and classy décor - minimalist without being cold, all clean lines and soft edges. It&#39;s one of those places where every party seems to be having a great time and you kinda want to pull up a chair and join in the conversation.<br><br>If the atmosphere hums then it&#39;s the food that sings, right from the olive oil and bread board (in 3 types yay) through a range of reasonably-priced antipasti which the waitress kept recommending and we kept saying yes. The sea bass carpaccio and the blackened octopus dish stood out here, and I think I finished one of the burrata dishes all by myself. <br><br>Eventually someone had the willpower to call a halt to move to mains; cue yummy homemade pappardelle that melted in your mouth stuffed with a flavourful pheasant ragu. I think the menu changes regularly but others had the squid, the pork belly and a seafood-based spaghetti dish which they all seemed pretty pleased with. Have to say I&#39;m not sure how well veggies would fare but for less restricted eaters and happy sharers this is a really interesting menu.<br><br>The taste adventure was nicely topped off with the fact the wine was excellent - the waitress gave us some recs and even let us try a couple first which was a really nice touch! Service was generally attentive and flexible - they were happy for us to sneak up to the counter individually to pay without the birthday girl noticing she was being treated :)<br><br>It&#39;s not an everyday/drop-in place so prices are in the semi-expensive camp, particularly if you try the wine (and you should). Perhaps the first Italian I&#39;ve been happy paying up for. You&#39;ll know what you&#39;re getting into though because you&#39;ll have booked in advance. It&#39;s a Bermondsey gem I&#39;ll be revisiting - your biggest issue with it may well be getting a table!",

"reviewcomment":"I had never experienced Erritrean cuisine before, but I love to try new food and this definatley intrigued me! <br><br>We opted for the middle set menu for two, which consisted of a mix starter, followed by chicken, lamb,Okra and Falafel ALL on one plate, but not just that ..it was also accompanied by vegetable and salad!!  No forks or knives,..you get a sour crepe to pick up with and eat it from there..I Struggled to start with , but after a few minutes a really got the hang of it ! Sooo good to try something different and I loved it ! <br><br>For drinks we had a number of Sexy Mosob&#39;s and Also Margaritas ( although not served in a margarita glass and was a little on the small side ) it was kind of like Really refreshing and worth it !!<br>Service was superb! Although I do think 1 more waitress would have been helpful. <br><br>Would Defintaley recommend !",

"reviewcomment":"Had the opportunity to come here for Valentine&#39;s Day. It is by far one of the best restaurants in the world. Things to take note of is that this restaurant and it&#39;s staff/chefs are extremely well trained. The design of the restaurant is simple and elegant, allowing for the service and food to shine.<br><br>- The service staff is phenomenal. They are attentive, courteous, and very knowledgeable. They seem to make it a priority to anticipate your needs. It is almost as if they can read your mind. Their timing and delivery of service is impeccable.<br><br>- The cooks/chefs have food put together and delivered in appropriate time. Every dish was always spot-on, well plated, eye catching, and of course delicious beyond words. Every item we received from the menu had obviously been very well thought out. Flavors worked/melded in a way that accented the ingredients used to develop a symphony of deliciousness. Though I enjoyed every dish, the one item that would consistently bring me back to the UK and this restaurant would definitely be their ravioli of lobster, langoustine and salmon in a light bisque with lemongrass and chervil velouté. That is bar none, one of the most wonderful things I have ever had. I was literally licking that plate clean. <br><br>In my experience with all the restaurants that I have visited in the world, this is by far one of the front runners and very deserving of it&#39;s Michelin stars. The service is a dream and the food is so wonderful that I doubt even the magic of a unicorn and skilled fingers of Santa&#39;s elves could possibly make any better. Bravo Mr. Ramsay, bravo.",

The kebab operation in front is pretty popular on a street which otherwise feels like it has seen better days. Walk through that and you arrive back in time in the 1950s, in a cavernous room with wood paneling and art, nice and attentive wait staff, and incredibly good Cypriot food. I have heard from a good friend (who told me about this place...I never would have gone there otherwise) that the fish is amazing but I&#39;ve not yet tried it...I can report that the kleftiko (slow roasted lamb) is COMPLETELY AMAZING as are the copious mezze and the chicken kebab.<br><br>Cant wait to go back.",

"reviewcomment":"My dinner at the Austrian restaurant Tiroler Hut between Paddington and Notting Hill Gate was one of the most enjoyable meals in recent months. It is a busy place, and I wanted to eat there before and could not get a table. But finally I managed to get in and it was a pleasure. <br><br>I do not know why,  but everybody, guests and staff alike, seemed to be smiling and happy. For all I can tell, the nice little restaurant Tiroler Hut simply sports a great vibe. Most servers also speak German, so if you would like to buy your schnitzel in German, you can even do that. <br><br>Starting with some bread and butter, my meal began rather average. Unfortunately, I was not in a wine mood that evening, but the wine list read quite promising. I will definitely get an Austrian white the next time I go there. For the main, I went off menu. I asked for a Wiener Schnitzel with spaetzle - you could probably describe it as a special kind of pasta - and gravy. When I ordered, I was a bit disappointed that they only serve pork an no veal. Anyway, it was worth going off menu. My main was really delicious. A good escalope, a delicate gravy and tasty spaetzle. You could argue that the spaetzle were a bit small, but I won&#39;t. They were good. That&#39;s it.<br><br>Of course I could not skip the dessert. Continuing with the Austrian theme, I went for the Apfelstrudel. And what should I say, it was heavenly. <br><br>Altogether, I had very good food and just a great time at Tiroler Hut. No doubt, I will come back. So far, this is probably the best German or Austrian restaurant I know in London.",

Our experience at Petrus can be summed up in one word...Perfection!<br><br>The 100% French staff really looks after you. We definitely felt special. Expect to commit a lot of time to dinning. We were at Petrus for at least 3 hours.<br><br>The portion sizes are ideal. Initially, we thought we would go home hungry....6 courses later....we could barely move. My boyfriend ordered the pheasant. I would suggest you do the same, as he is still talking about it. The chocolate sphere is an absolute must. The dessert presentation can only be described as &#34;magic&#34;. Once you have dessert at Petrus, you will understand. Save room for the fantastic tea and chocolates.<br><br>The décor was a bit modern for my taste, but the food and the dining experience more than makes up for it.<br><br>I would consider Gordon Ramsay&#39;s Petrus a London must!",

"reviewcomment":"I consider myself a traveler, not a tourist and I hate tourist trap restaurants. I really wanted good fish and chips on a recent trip to London so I checked Yelp rather than the tourist guide books. I read the reviews for Toff&#39;s and decided to go there. I didn&#39;t realize Toff&#39;s was such a journey away from Kensington where I was staying so my mother and I set off in search of great fish and chips. <br><br>We took the train to North London and got off and started walking. She hates walking and it was 15+ minute walk uphill for the most part. She complained the entire way. She didn&#39;t even appreciate the wonderful park views or lack of tourists. The only thing that stopped her complaining was when the fish and chips were set down in front of us. In short, it was worth the walk and the complaining. The fish was huge and  crispy and delicious and it was fresh. The chips were the best I had in London or pretty much anywhere. A testament to how good it was is that my mother, who picks at food and eats very little usually, ate everything on her plate and finished before me!<br><br>The best part of the meal though: the sticky toffee pudding in custard. I&#39;m drooling now thinking about it. I had also wanted authentic sticky toffee pudding while in London, so I killed 2 birds with one stone at Toff&#39;s. My mother had the creme caramel and loved it. In addition to the mouthwatering food, the service was friendly, fast, and totally efficient. The owner joked around with us and Alex, our waiter, was a delight. When my  mother complained to him about the walk from the train he told us to take a bus from right outside so she wouldn&#39;t have to walk back. It was one of best dining experiences we had in London. They should consider opening more branches, specifically one in NYC,",

"reviewcomment":"Before I went to Home House, I was totally against the idea of paying membership fee to join a private club. After going there for a couple of times for events, I understand why people would pay the fee. However, I am still not ready to shell out any cash yet. <br><br>The property is gorgeous with 3 different houses and a nice garden, which is lovely to hang out at in the summer time. The house bar is very contemporary with sweeping lines and metallic finishes, a bit space-age. I love all the lounges in the house. It seems there are endless rooms with comfortable couches that you can just chill out. The house also comes with a gym and members can use the lounges to hold meetings or just as an out-of-home office. Actually, if you have the flexibility to work anywhere you want and the time to work out a lot, the membership fee is well worth the benefit. And it is a good place to socialize and meet fellow members.",

And of course, fashion designer-inspired desserts were so cute :)<br><br>What made it amazing was that they kept bringing food and tea until we said &#34;no more.&#34;  They also packed the leftover dessert in a colorful box to take home (which we enjoyed the next day).<br><br>They even brought a special plate with fruits and chocolate to celebrate our anniversary.  We felt spoiled!<br><br>I&#39;d recommend afternoon tea at The Berkeley to anyone visiting London.",

On our way to the Ottolenghi restaurant, they had called us to confirm that we were still on to meet the reservation because we were running late. <br><br>The service was superior; the food came out quickly, everything looked, felt, smelled and tasted impeccable.<br><br>We started with the best tasting croissant in London. English breakfast liquor tea by the side.<br><br>The bagel with Hansen &amp; Lydersen smoked salmon on a bed of wasabi cream was adequately loaded with fish, fresh and bursting with flavour. My sister ordered the black rice porridge cooked with coconut milk topped with banana and mango (comes with extra coconut milk for added richness and palm sugar for sweetness), which was good too, but in my mind the extra coconut milk will need to be used to do it proper justice. I have a bit of a sweet tooth too, so some of that palm sugar won&#39;t hurt either. A little bit of extra fruit might have enhanced the taste of this fibrous porridge. My favourite, which is what I ordered, was the mushroom on sourdough, iced with a dollop of poached egg. <br><br>The place looks of course, like an archetypal Ottolenghi establishment, bathed in white hue descended on the even whiter marble floors. I didn&#39;t feel the gold enough though (come on Yotam, give me some more of that aurous glitter!). The bathroom tiles bring out the white even more, and if it not were for the slight dullness outside, I would have had a little bit of a headache at the end of it all. I suppose that synthetically created solar emotion in a restaurant is not so bad for us, Vit D starved Britons.<br><br>The bill, £50 for 3, sounded about right. I&#39;ll be back for dinner!",

"reviewcomment":"Goodman is a legit steak house!<br><br>I&#39;d been wanting to go for ages, and when my parents came to town and offered to take us to dinner, I booked Goodman. The ambiance is upscale, and while I&#39;m sure they would prefer people to be dressed more smarty, it seems like it&#39;s a bit casual there as well. The servers were all incredibly friendly and always coming by to see if we were okay with drinks.<br><br>I needed a bit of a drink to calm down when I arrived so ordered the bartender&#39;s special, The Derby. Delicious (but strong) drink to start the meal. They&#39;re more than willing to bring the cuts of meat over to the table to show you what you&#39;ll be ordering. They have some regular cuts of steak on the menu, but they also have a few special cuts for the evening which are located on various chalkboards around the restaurant. They do both American corn-fed beef and European grass-fed beef. We opted for the grass-fed bone-in rib-eyes and a few sides.<br><br>I also had the seared foie gras starter. It was fantastic. The foie gras was really well seared and it was served with figs and truffle honey (I love truffle honey). The beef was really well cooked. Perfectly medium rare (as a rib eye needs to be to cook the fat) and they served with a variety of sauces. My favorite was the Bearnaise. Super duper delicious. The pepper sauce was really peppery. The only letdown was the Stilton wine sauce. Wasn&#39;t Stilton-y enough for me. We got steamed spinach (perfectly reasonable), beef dripping chips (awesome) and truffle mac and cheese (amazing) as sides. My parents got the chocolate tart dessert and it was oozing chocolate. We ordered the cheese and there were some pretty tasty cheeses there.<br><br>All in all, it&#39;s probably the best steak I&#39;ve had in London. Next time I have the hankering for an expensive steak dinner, Goodman will be at the top of my list!",

"reviewcomment":"Before I went to Home House, I was totally against the idea of paying membership fee to join a private club. After going there for a couple of times for events, I understand why people would pay the fee. However, I am still not ready to shell out any cash yet. <br><br>The property is gorgeous with 3 different houses and a nice garden, which is lovely to hang out at in the summer time. The house bar is very contemporary with sweeping lines and metallic finishes, a bit space-age. I love all the lounges in the house. It seems there are endless rooms with comfortable couches that you can just chill out. The house also comes with a gym and members can use the lounges to hold meetings or just as an out-of-home office. Actually, if you have the flexibility to work anywhere you want and the time to work out a lot, the membership fee is well worth the benefit. And it is a good place to socialize and meet fellow members.",

"reviewcomment":"What a great dining experience! The food and services are both top notch. My friend and I went for the 7 course tasting menu. We started with chestnut and juniper gnocchi with chestnut and truffle veloute. It was very tasty and I can just take a whole bowl of the veloute sauce as a soup course. Next we have a pan-friend fillet of cod. For main, we had two types of lamb, slow cooked neck of lamb and nice piece of loin. I have to say the portion was quite generous. Another thing that is worth mentioning is the bread. The whole time when we were enjoying the differences courses, we were given several choices of tasty warm bread. My friend and I liked the bread so much, we totally ODed on it. So by the time we finished the main, we were ready to call it quit. However, we still have some more exciting surprises coming our way. <br><br>I love the cheese course. The two types of cheese were great, but the killer was how the crackers were presented to us. The restaurant cracker holders custom made from olive tree. So this course was like a cool piece of art work presented on our table. Then for dessert, we had white chocolate tart what was more like a slice of creme brulee. Then there was petits fours, basically 4 little bites of chocolates and sweets. We thought we were done and our lovely waiter brought on several cute donut balls and some best tasting caneles. <br><br>Be prepared to spend a solid 3 hours there to enjoy your meal. And expect great food and exceptional services. Highly recommend it.",

"reviewcomment":"I  found this place after meeting friends in Angel, who decided not to get a bite to eat in that area, so we went for a walk on the regents canal. I told them I saw a review of this really cool cafe place on the canal on yelp. They didn&#39;t believe at first! as it was quite a long walk from Angel. It is actually better to walk from the Dalston  to Angel route, than the other way round! <br><br>We finally found it just off Dalston, its a  very small cafe with a few communal tables and chairs dotted on the canal.  Sandwhich  dishes are about £6. I got the ham and my friend brought the salmon terrine, which was very tasty with cucumber salad. I think they only have a number of set dishes because after we left about 4pm, the salmon sold out. I also brought the homemade ginger beer which  was rather fiery, just how i like my ginger beer! <br><br>I agree with Ben M. who said it reminded him of  those  teepee tent/cafes  at Glastonbury. <br>I cannot fault the place so I have decided to give 5 stars. A ideal place to  have  a drink, brunch or cake on a sunny day. Is dog friendly as well.<br><br>Keep  it a secret though!",

"reviewcomment":"Kappacasein is an amazing food stand right at the end of a row of great lunch choices at Borough Market. You&#39;ll be tempted by all the other offerings, but I implore you to pass them up at least once for that toasted cheese sandwich. After one taste, you&#39;ll probably pass them all up again, and again, and again.<br><br>The queue starts up after 11/12, but since I&#39;ve become very lucky in living close to Borough Market I&#39;ve taken to coming around 10:30 and making a brunch out of it. Believe me when I say you won&#39;t need much more until dinner time! And that way I only ever wait about 5 minutes for my gooey goodness.<br><br>The bread is toasted to PERFECTION, and the cheese is perfectly melted, even some of the cheese on the outside becomes nice and crunchy and beautiful without being burnt whilst everything on the inside is gooey and irresistible. The addition of onions and leeks makes it really special without taking the focus away from the cheese. I sometimes find myself feeling like I&#39;m intoxicated by cheesey goodness, just comfort food at it&#39;s best. For a fiver, you really cannot go wrong.",

"reviewcomment":"What a great dining experience! The food and services are both top notch. My friend and I went for the 7 course tasting menu. We started with chestnut and juniper gnocchi with chestnut and truffle veloute. It was very tasty and I can just take a whole bowl of the veloute sauce as a soup course. Next we have a pan-friend fillet of cod. For main, we had two types of lamb, slow cooked neck of lamb and nice piece of loin. I have to say the portion was quite generous. Another thing that is worth mentioning is the bread. The whole time when we were enjoying the differences courses, we were given several choices of tasty warm bread. My friend and I liked the bread so much, we totally ODed on it. So by the time we finished the main, we were ready to call it quit. However, we still have some more exciting surprises coming our way. <br><br>I love the cheese course. The two types of cheese were great, but the killer was how the crackers were presented to us. The restaurant cracker holders custom made from olive tree. So this course was like a cool piece of art work presented on our table. Then for dessert, we had white chocolate tart what was more like a slice of creme brulee. Then there was petits fours, basically 4 little bites of chocolates and sweets. We thought we were done and our lovely waiter brought on several cute donut balls and some best tasting caneles. <br><br>Be prepared to spend a solid 3 hours there to enjoy your meal. And expect great food and exceptional services. Highly recommend it.",

The products quality is great, it&#39;s japanese after all, <br>The shop is divided in two parts, the store which sells great japanese imported products, and the little restaurant. It&#39;s very small, and there are not much seatings, but the food is good. You can just by some fresh sushis or sashimis on the stands and eat in.<br><br>What&#39;s not to be missed : If you want to eat in and order some noodles at the restaurant, ask for the udon there are just amazing! *slurp* <br><br>Money, money, money : The sushis/sashimis are around £3-£5 for 3 to 6 pieces. <br>The prices of the products in the store are not cheap, as it&#39;s all imported.  <br><br>That little thing : First of all, i have to say that the cashiers are really efficient. Sometimes the line may seems very long, but the wait is not. <br>A big thanks to the cashiers for they efficiency and courtesy <br>A little plus for the fresh daily sushi and bakery<br><br>What needs to be work on : Let me think about it... that&#39;s it! what&#39;s really missing is japanese ice cream! you can find some sweet desserts in the bakery and frozen stands, but nothing beat some real authentic japanese ice cream! taro, red bean flavour !",

"reviewcomment":"Bocca di Lupo had been on my &#39;must try&#39; list for a while.  Oddly, we ended up here after unsuccessfully trying to get into a few other Soho restaurants and were told we could get a seat at the bar.  I never turn away the opportunity to eat at the bar.  It&#39;s one thing that London restaurants don&#39;t do enough of!<br><br>Overall, the food was good.  There were a few blips but let&#39;s start with what worked:<br><br>* Octopus, roast tomato, celery &amp; basil salad - this was the best thing we had and it was the roast tomato that really shined.  Deep tomato-y taste which paired well with the basil and perfectly cooked octopus (not chewy, hurray!)<br><br>* Fried squid &amp; blood orange slices - yes, this was &#39;just&#39; fried calamari but they were fried with just a light dusting of flour (or something like that) and perfectly tender (again, not chewy, hurray!)  The star to this dish was really the blood orange slices which were also battered and deep fried.  Luscious!<br><br>* Sage leaves filled with anchovy - tempura battered sage leaves with salty anchovies.  YUM.  These were excellent.<br><br>* Olive stuffed with minced pork &amp; veal - they were like olive dumplings!<br><br>* Orecchiette with &#39;nduja, red onion &amp; tomato - delicious, saucy orecchiette pasta with chunks of red onion and tomato.  A really lusty dish!<br><br>What worked less well were the following:<br><br>* Rosamarina - it&#39;s toast with a spread of spicy fermented neonati (fish fry)  and chiles.  You could barely taste any fish but just got a mouthful of heat.  Don&#39;t get me wrong.  I like spicy.  This was just spice on toast which isn&#39;t really that nice.  <br><br>* Baccala - yes, baccala is really just fancy fish and chips (w/o the chips!) but it can be really lovely.  This wasn&#39;t bad but the salt cod had not been soaked long enough and was very salty.  In retrospect, I&#39;d get something else.<br><br>For dessert, we had the Bacio gelato which was essentially their homemade version of a big frozen baci candy.  This was awesome!<br><br>Overall, a great meal.  I&#39;d definitely come back!",

Spinach was very tasty and the fries were too good...i finished them. Swooooosh went my no-carb-diet... Also the baby potatoes, i&#39;m sure they have their own potato-pusher-man, that walks in every day and deals them in alley in the back. So good, sweet, full, buttery and they almost popped in my mouth like pees! So good, must be illegal. The side with beans was gone before i had a chance...looked good! Thanks baby,..gggrr... My Bearnaise sauce was waiting, i didn&#39;t go for it, afraid i would see the bottom of that dish too, too soon.<br><br>The Sole was very close to the best i had, better than Bentleys...sorry! And i loved that Sole! The cod was on My Love&#39;s plate, and he was happy, but also very happy he could eat of my plate too.<br><br>I&#39;m back! BAM!<br><br>OH!!! I forgot about the cheeeeese!!... the cheese...

"reviewcomment":"Ah- MA-ZING!  This was the best South Indian food I have ever eaten.  From the first bite (to the completely stuffed) last, I found myself humming and closing my eyes and saying &#34;mmm,&#34; through the whole meal.<br><br>The menu is a little daunting for me because there is so much text.  I would have like to have taken it to the hotel to read a day before to understand all the great stories being told about the food, how the smells remind the author of one thing or the next from his childhood, etc.  But I didn&#39;t have that luxury.  It was 10pm on a Sat, I was starved and YELP said they closed at 10:30p. (Luckily, on Sat- they don&#39;t stop seating till 11pm).<br><br>I am traveling alone and unlike many prix fixe menus I have seen around town, this one was not a min of 2 ppl.  So I ordered the &#34;Non Veg&#34; FEAST.  Here&#39;s what came with it:<br><br>- Part 1: Pre-Meal- a basket of cruchies of all sizes, including savory banana chips.  All perfectly seasoned and delicious enough that I almost got full just snacking on those!  Also included was a small sampling of spicy pickles and a garlicy yogurt<br><br>- Part 2: Appetizers - served with a small cucumber, carrot and lettuce bed, the apps were a lamb puff, chicken samosa (this was THE BEST SEASONED SAMOSA I HAVE EVER HAD) and a fried prawn.  The prawn was just at the right temp, not rubbery or overcooked.  The lamb was mixed with potato and a little bit dry- but compared to everything else- a small textural note.<br><br>- Part 3: Mains- there were three curries- Chicken, lamb and fish- a large helping of lemon rice and a large pancake roti.  The fish seemed hard at first, but did not taste dry at all.  It tasted almost like it was compressed.  Not sure what fish it was, but it was wonderful.  The lamb was a solid curry in a dark sauce.  It was cooked perfectly.  The best of the three was the chicken curry.  This wasn&#39;t your average tikki masala, the seasoning was just spicy enough and went perfectly with the roti they included to mop up all the juices.  Before I could finish this part I was bordering on stuffed.  I couldn&#39;t resist noshing on more of it, so I barely left any behind.  Then I was truly stuffed.  and along came...<br><br>Part 4: Dessert- this was a delicate tapioca rice porridge with hints of coconut, cardamon and little slices of cashews.  Unlike other tapioca that I have gotten to finish and Indian meal, this one really knew how to hint at spices without overpowering it.  Cardamon is a difficult spice to work with if its not toasted properly and (preferably for me) strained out rather than included whole.  They handled it perfectly.<br><br>The service was spot on, I was visited several times, but not enough to feel intrusive.  There was an entertaining party sitting nearby, so I heard some fun conversations.  The only downside was the lack of wi-fi and spotty phone reception, or this review would have been posted while i ate.<br><br>PS: I heard from the waiter that the cousin of the chef/ owner has a restaurant in Culver City on Venice Blvd.  He wrote down the info for me.  Now I have a place to check out when I get back to LA!",

Awesome!!<br><br>They have a nice selection of wraps, sandwiches, soups and take-away meals. Do not think you can eat there, as there&#39;s no place at all! come, take and go!

"reviewcomment":"Bocca di Lupo had been on my &#39;must try&#39; list for a while.  Oddly, we ended up here after unsuccessfully trying to get into a few other Soho restaurants and were told we could get a seat at the bar.  I never turn away the opportunity to eat at the bar.  It&#39;s one thing that London restaurants don&#39;t do enough of!<br><br>Overall, the food was good.  There were a few blips but let&#39;s start with what worked:<br><br>* Octopus, roast tomato, celery &amp; basil salad - this was the best thing we had and it was the roast tomato that really shined.  Deep tomato-y taste which paired well with the basil and perfectly cooked octopus (not chewy, hurray!)<br><br>* Fried squid &amp; blood orange slices - yes, this was &#39;just&#39; fried calamari but they were fried with just a light dusting of flour (or something like that) and perfectly tender (again, not chewy, hurray!)  The star to this dish was really the blood orange slices which were also battered and deep fried.  Luscious!<br><br>* Sage leaves filled with anchovy - tempura battered sage leaves with salty anchovies.  YUM.  These were excellent.<br><br>* Olive stuffed with minced pork &amp; veal - they were like olive dumplings!<br><br>* Orecchiette with &#39;nduja, red onion &amp; tomato - delicious, saucy orecchiette pasta with chunks of red onion and tomato.  A really lusty dish!<br><br>What worked less well were the following:<br><br>* Rosamarina - it&#39;s toast with a spread of spicy fermented neonati (fish fry)  and chiles.  You could barely taste any fish but just got a mouthful of heat.  Don&#39;t get me wrong.  I like spicy.  This was just spice on toast which isn&#39;t really that nice.  <br><br>* Baccala - yes, baccala is really just fancy fish and chips (w/o the chips!) but it can be really lovely.  This wasn&#39;t bad but the salt cod had not been soaked long enough and was very salty.  In retrospect, I&#39;d get something else.<br><br>For dessert, we had the Bacio gelato which was essentially their homemade version of a big frozen baci candy.  This was awesome!<br><br>Overall, a great meal.  I&#39;d definitely come back!",

I can just say that the service, the food and the atmosphere and decorations here are excellent. <br>I&#39;ve been here few times already and its a great experience to pay a visit to The Chancery. My last one was about a week ago and it was great, I was there with few friends of mine and we were starving. <br>I my self had a starter and main, followed by a desert. Food was just fantastic, products were so fresh that it felt that the vegies were just harvested from the garden. Meet was high quality and I love how it was cooked with all the toppings, also had a nice bottle of red wine with the dishes. Prices were surprisingly low. Staff are nice, polite and welcoming.

"reviewcomment":"I was slightly skeptical arriving at The Curious Yellow Cafe as it didn&#39;t look so great from the outside and also very small. What have I learnt? Don&#39;t judge a book by its cover! <br><br>Firstly the staff were very warm and welcoming taking our order quickly without being intrusive. We both ordered the vegetarian breakfasts and banana shakes. Both were outstanding. I almost felt guilty as I watched one of the staff leave and return 5 minutes lately with fresh bananas especially for us. There was no &#39;sorry that&#39;s not available.&#39; The breakfast was by far the best vegetarian breakfast I&#39;ve had since being in London. All prepared and cooked right in front of our eyes in the small kitchen behind the counter so we could see what was going into our food. I must make a special mention to the scrambled eggs. I&#39;m not quite sure what she did but they were delicious! Soft but not runny and sweet and savoury at the same time.<br><br>Lastly even though it was only 10.30am we opted for a slice of chocolate beetroot cake as we had heard great things. Who could have ever guessed this could be such a great combo! The beetroot made the cake soft and moist but without overpowering the chocolate and the icing completed the masterpiece.<br><br>This will definitely be on my most recommended cafes list!",

Regardless, if you go for a meal at Cah-Chi, you are going to have an incredibly pleasant time.<br><br>The decor has a subtle eloquence to it. They have a heated conservatory at the back of the restaurant, which was the perfect place to chill out! You are allowed to bring your own wine to the restaurant, which is served up to you and stored and there is no corking fee, which keeps the price down. Not that you should worry about price. The food there is very fair, for its quality. <br><br>Starters were brilliant - deep fried Oysters, Kim shin beef in a lovely sauce and Octopus eggs. The main was a choice of a noodle dish, rish dish or stew. As a table we went for one of each - all delicious. If you do go there, order the Green Tea tiramisu for dessert - absolutely lovely<br><br>The Staff were incredibly friendly, welcoming, did a great job and food was quick to the table.<br><br>I had never had Korean food before and my expectation lay somewhere between Chinese and Thai. The food wasnt greasy, heavy and the spices were spot on.<br><br>I am looking forward to going again",

"reviewcomment":"Not really a fan of Spanish restaurants but having read the reviews we just had to go for a birthday celebration.<br>It was at least as good as the other reviews and even the non meat eaters gave grudging respect although I think that the meat was outstanding -really very very good  cooked just right and bursting with flavour from the grill.<br>Wine was well matched to the food (but by no means cheap) and we ate as much as we could fit in and were not disappointed by any of the dishes that came to the table- it was tapas style so lots of little dishes. I could have stayed there all night but might well have exploded so I will have to go back soon and try the rest of the menu!<br>Service was good, attentive and friendly as well as really helpful. A great location as well  a pity we had to eat inside but we were experiencing an August ice age and the weather was not at all Spanish!<br>I can thoroughly recommend Caminos  if you are in the area you should really try it and see what you think.",

"reviewcomment":"Addie&#39;s Thai is an Urban Legend; and for good reason too. They&#39;ve been here since 1987, and are still going strong; not surprising, as they&#39;ve perfected the art of serving Oriental fast food that places the sole priority of satisfying the eater&#39;s tastebuds first, way before everything else. It&#39;s all about the flavour; there are no corners cut here when it comes to tending to the tongue. The flavours are over-the-top, massively indulgent, satiating, animated in appearance, glutinous, and gluttonous; a real treat, leaving the mouth awash with pure satisfaction, with lips curled up at the side in sheer delight. When it boils down to it, &#39;Oriental delivery/takeaways&#39; are a treat really, aren&#39;t they? You don&#39;t eat this type of food to get healthy, do you? You eat it because it tastes good; it tastes different; it&#39;s the opposite of boring isn&#39;t it? &#39;Boring&#39; is boiling a pot of pasta and adding some ground beef to it to turn it into a Spaghetti Bolognese; &#39;fun&#39; is picking up the phone after a few drinks and having a bit of a bubbly chinwag with the restauranteur, then setting the stop-watch before frantically scurrying around the house like the Tasmanian devil, trying to find some cash (with a fictitious elongated 30-min Countdown theme-tune building up in your head), or for the more sadistic of you, gleefully laying in wait until the order has been relayed, then reveling in the tremendous joy of hearing that ever-so-slight woefully sounding sigh as you connivingly state to the person on the other end of the line I&#39;d like to pay by card please.; the cheap thrill you get and the goosebumps that cover your forearms when the front doorbell goes, it&#39;s here!!!; the ceremonial &#39;2001 A Space Odyssey&#39;-styled &#39;opening of the front door&#39; to greet the spaceman who smells of traffic (who&#39;s already reaching out to hand you a big plastic bag filled with your steaming goodyness); the expectation of it all; the pulling of the dishes out one by one from of the bag and trying to figure out what is what and who&#39;s is who&#39;s; the lid-popping; the sniffing; the obligatory I didn&#39;t order this!? comment regardless of the whether or not it was what you ordered; the tucking-in, the munching-with-no-manners, the burping, the small-talk, the guzzling of the fizzy drink right at the end; the playing of &#39;kitchen-basketbal&#39; with the kitchen bin and the empty containers; and then finally, the last act, the waddling over to the sofa and slumping down in it like a Walrus auditioning for a part in the &#39;Royle Family&#39;.<br> There&#39;s a whole culture involved isn&#39;t there? It&#39;s an operatic act starting right from the second you pick up the phone. And with Addie&#39;s Thai, you are not just &#39;ordering a takeaway&#39;, you are buying a ticket or two for this Oriental opera, that will provide you with the classic takeaway/delivery experience, from start to finish. <br> As soon as the call is answered, you are greeted by the ever-chirpy, effusively attentive, heart-warmingly friendly host, a lady who&#39;s name I have forgotten, who, regardless of the weather, will cheer you up no-end, and by the second call, will know your first name and your favourite dishes off by heart. Slightly lascivious in nature, if you are male, do not be put off by what may seem like flirtatious behaviour; it all adds to the Addie&#39;s experience. This is the time to practice some sexual innuendo jokes, or any joke for that matter. The phone-calling here reminds me of communicating with male Air Stewards on British Airways flights; it&#39;s got that similar sort of tongue-in-cheek Carry-on style of tone to it. And when the food arrives, you will have no trouble whatsoever with their extremely efficient, polite, methodical delivery staff; have no fear, there won&#39;t be any Hey, how&#39;s it going geezer?! Did ya watch tha footy?! small-talk here, nor any off-putting &#39;huffs and puffs&#39; from peeved-off drivers, as the Addie&#39;s delivery crew are like commandos, straight in, straight out, hi and bye is all you get (if that), and that&#39;s it. For the more frugal of you out there, rest assured, you will not encounter any &#39;Oxfam eyes&#39; from the driver, as the passing-over of the food is complete, but I always tip anyway, so personal preference is key here. The food is gorgeous. I quickly became an Addie&#39;s addict circa 2006/2007, when I was living in an apartment block in South Kensington, and had the good fortune of coming across one of their menus they had left on the counter of the reception down in the lobby. The rest is history. I was ordering at least three times a week from them, and quickly became a regular Alas, I am no longer an addict now, as I went into re-hab (moved &#39;north of the park&#39;), and as they don&#39;t deliver too far from their base-camp, their food is something I will not have the pleasure of experiencing any time soon. <br> FOOD:<br> Phad Thai: &#39;Alice in Wonderland&#39;-styled appearance of this staple Thai dish, with whopping chunks of all the ingredients crammed into the container, with the lid literally bursting",

"reviewcomment":"Ever since meeting my BFF (Best French Friend) Sev during my exchange year I&#39;m a big fan of cheese. When I say cheese I don&#39;t mean the cheddar variety, which I personally find incredible (imagine that word in a french accent) boring. I think about all the lovely varieties of cheese ... from blue cheese, do truffle cheese and soft camembert and brie and ... it goes on forever.<br><br>Anyway this shop/restaurant is giving you the option to just buy it or first eat it and then buy it.<br><br>First time I went there, I just got a block of interesting looking cheese and it was good. Second time we went full out with cheese fondue and the really nice raclette: it was  downright delicious. As its located inside Spitalfield Market you can sit &#34;outside&#34; the restaurant without being actually outside. It&#39;s still rather chilly on a normal english spring evening, but they have heaters and blankets, which made it really cosy. I had an amazing time messing around with the cheeses and drinking a lovely wine with it. as close as it gets to the french experience. I really loved the restaurant, as the waiters were nice and unobtrusive. They give you time to sit and enjoy the meal.",

When we arrived, we were the only table in the resaturant. Usually I hate that, but this time was different.<br><br>We sat down, the head chef came over and greeted us, and asked us if we would like to do the &#34;carte blanche&#34; chef&#39;s choice tasting menu. We opted for this, and he asked us several questions about our likes and dislikes. He then personally made wine recommendations based on what he was going to bring out. When we ordered more wine halfway through the meal, he came out again and guided us on wine selections based on the remaining dishes. It was awesome!<br><br>As each subsequent dish came out, I thought it was the best one yet, only to be further amazed. We had oysters, scallops, venison, pasta, canapes, crab, and a host of others I&#39;m now forgetting. Every bite was perfection.<br><br>This chef and restaurant have a big future.

Chris F. and I are always bookmarking places for special date nights&#39; and he planned this one, but coincidentally, I also had this gem bookmarked. <br><br>We started with the soup of the day - Creamy Chickpea Potato. This has to be one of the most lovely soups I&#39;ve ever had. It came with lovely pieces of bread on top. Perfectly seasoned. Yum!<br><br>My husband ordered the Vegetarian pizza and I ordered the folded pizza, which was like an Italian quesadilla. Delicious. Though Chris&#39; pizza was nice, mine was divine, and I had so much left-over that we were able to eat it the next day for the majority of our lunchtime meal.<br><br>Santore adds a 12.5% service charge, but as an American, I&#39;m good with tipping, and usually leave more than 12.5% anyway.<br><br>The wait staff was very nice. We had a lovely meal and lovely time at Santore. I can&#39;t wait to go back. The only thing I would have done differently would have been to order extra soups to go for the next day.

It also attracts a great crowd, so you&#39;re unlikely to be distracted by the smell of popcorn and the sound of vigorous chewing (or maybe I&#39;ve been lucky so far?). The prices are also very friendly - £12 for two tickets on a Monday and £9.50 on Weekends, if I&#39;m not mistaken.",

Of course, I felt the need to add my two cents. <br><br>You win, Yelp; you&#39;re right. This place is solid. For £5, you get pork belly with a sheet of cracklings, a smear of apple sauce, and just a little closer to heaven. I don&#39;t even like cracklings but I this was delicious and I didn&#39;t mind fighting the texture to get it past my teeth.

"reviewcomment":"I came upon this restaurant by sheer luck and fortune, and boy am I glad I can add this place to my box of memories!<br><br>As a hobbyist being a Thai food critic, it must have been fate that my gang and I stepped into the Arms. Outside, the building is anything but unassuming. It is layered with natural greenery, and sticks out from the other buildings like nothing you have ever seen in the heart of London. But, it is hardly what one would expect to see as a Thai restaurant, since the facade is entirely modeled like a pub. And upon entering, the pub scene is only intensified. The lighting is so low, that it makes following the hostess to the table a chore in itself, but that only adds to the charm. As you walk through the seating areas, you will be visually bombarded with so many decorations that hang both from the walls and ceilings; do not be surprised if a plant vine, or old fishing net gets tangled in your hair as you proceed. <br><br>Once seated, I remember our waiter being very patient and attentive, despite the tightly packed and busy evening he was encumbered with. When our dishes arrived, we all gladly devoured our plates within a few minutes. Stopping only to sip and talk over our drinks. After a 12+ hour day exploring London with my backpacker pals, this was just the place we needed to stop. The piping hot, delicious food and added environment made this restaurant a perfect end to a perfect day. <br><br>The only issue I had (which is entirely subjective), is that I ordered my dish Hot, and it ended up being quite mild, so I asked for extra chilli and hot sauce, which the waiter promptly brought out. <br><br>I would highly recommend this place to any of my acquaintances.",

"reviewcomment":"London does high end dining incredibly well an Pollen Street Social met all of my expectations. <br><br>I visited on a cold and wet Monday lunch the week before Xmas and the dining room was absolutely buzzing.  Must have been all that Xmas cheer in the air. <br><br>This is a big restaurant. The spacious dining room upstairs is large but feels spacious with a small pre-dining bar area and a sneaky view into the kitchen and a large team of busy busy chefs.  Downstairs is a lux private room which would be perfect for a special occasion or corporate event, a very versatile space. <br><br>We choose the excellent value 3 cars Xmas set lunch which at £35 was a bargain.  <br><br>The menu was gorgeously seasonal and quite complex.  All choices sounded gorgeous but I went for the clever entree eggy full English breakfast, a gorgeous lamb shoulder main course and Thai flavours dessert which was fresh, pretty and light.  <br><br>The wine list is huge but the friendly sommeliers are on hand to guide you should you need any assistance with the many many options.  There are wine to suit most budgets as well which is great.  I would have liked to see a few more beers available - just the meantime lager, pale ale and IPA were on offer which is a shame for a British restaurant living large on its local produce when there are so many incredible ales produced right here in Britain. <br><br>We we pleasantly surprised with between course treats - 3 canapés to start, a zingy pre-dessert cleanser and maroons with coffee.  I love surprises and these are the very best kind! <br><br>Rather than being stuffy this was an exciting and engaging dining experience.  Many elements of the food were interactive and the busy, festive dining room made it clear that everyone there was having a great time.  <br><br>All in all this was an entirely pleasant way to pass a rainy afternoon.  It&#39;s not cheap but it is a great example of the Brits doing a fabulous job at world class restaurants.  Jason Atherton and his team should be justifiably proud.",

In short: it&#39;s an Italian coffee bar that&#39;s open 24 hours. <br><br>It&#39;s not necessarily cozy in there with plush sofas and plenty of seating à la Starbucks. No, there&#39;s a counter with a giant espresso machine, a shelf displaying all kinds of snacks (think Portuguese custards, pannini sandwiches etc) and behind the counter there&#39;s a small army of Italian baristas (the non-hipster and genuine kind) who will serve you up your espresso drink in mere seconds. (This is also not a place where you should ask for complicated coffee concoctions à la Starbucks - keep it simple and real.)<br><br>Given that this is not a place to linger, I typically come here for a quick espresso before heading on to a next destination - whether it be the National Gallery, a musical or a bar nearby. In the summer though, you might be lucky and snatch one of the prime seats outside. That&#39;s actually quite fun, as you can watch and comment on the diverse Soho crowd parading by...",

I told them I saw a review of this really cool cafe place on the canal on yelp. They didn&#39;t believe at first! as it was quite a long walk from Angel. It is actually better to walk from the Dalston  to Angel route, than the other way round! <br><br>We finally found it just off Dalston, its a  very small cafe with a few communal tables and chairs dotted on the canal.  Sandwhich  dishes are about £6. I got the ham and my friend brought the salmon terrine, which was very tasty with cucumber salad. I think they only have a number of set dishes because after we left about 4pm, the salmon sold out. I also brought the homemade ginger beer which  was rather fiery, just how i like my ginger beer! <br><br>I agree with Ben M. who said it reminded him of  those  teepee tent/cafes  at Glastonbury. <br>I cannot fault the place so I have decided to give 5 stars. A ideal place to  have  a drink, brunch or cake on a sunny day. Is dog friendly as well.<br><br>Keep  it a secret though!",

Tayyab is BYOB (there are numerous Off-License stores along the walk from the Whitechapel station) and unless you call and make reservations the day before or early the day of, you will likely have to cue for a table (reservations are highly recommended). Poppadums with the three classic mango, mint, and chutney sauces begin the meal. The chicken tikka for an appetizer is wonderful and served on the hot plate with peppers and onions. The main dishes are all great (thought not diet friendly given the amount of oil used to prepare them), though I would recommend anything with lamb in it. Make sure to get a homemade naan to accompany the sauces of the main dishes. While I typically do not get dessert, there is a counter on the way out that has the classic desserts of the region.<br><br>The prices are one of the key sellers of this place. Appetizers like chicken tikka are around £3.50, mains are around £7-12, and sides like rice and naan around £2.50-3. Even at my most hungry times, an appetizer, main, and one order of naan are overfilling. A full meal can easily be under £15 each. Just remember to pick up wine and beer on the way to the restaurant. <br><br>The atmosphere has changed considerably from when I first came to Tayyab years ago. In the past, small rooms to the left and right of the entrance on the ground floor were the only spaces available for dinner. Now, a full upstairs is also available. The decor has also become significantly nicer. Unfortunately, this means a large number of diners are eating simultaneously, meaning that service is slower and sometimes inaccurate. While the staff always try to correct the errors, it is challenging to gain their attention most of the time (we had to get up a few times to grab a bottle opener or waiter for more water). The atmosphere of years ago had better service, but the quality of the food still outweighs the poorer service to keep me coming back.<br><br>The dining atmosphere is quite packed and it can become difficult to hear your companions if not sitting close to one another (this is a side-effect of the upstairs expansion as well). If you are looking for a quiet or romantic location, this is probably not the place to meet. However, if you are looking for an informal, reasonable, and authentic Pakistani/Indian restaurant, Tayyab is a perfect choice.",

The white bread of the barbecue pork bun was soft and light. <br>Even though the prices are exorbitant because you can pay 1/4 of the price for the same quality in China, in London this will the best it gets for quality dim-sum along with a great atmosphere.",

"reviewcomment":"My boyfriend and I ate here purely because of the Yelp rating and proximity to our hotel. The restaurant was under construction in the front so it was hard to see the name at night, but once we entered I really loved the atmosphere / decor and quickly forgot about the exterior.<br><br>We ordered the lemon rice, prawn masala, mango curry, malabar paratha, and pachadi. We also received some complimentary appetizers. Everything was absolutely delicious. My least favorite would probably be the prawn masala (I heard they were well-known for their seafood but this is probably for a different dish), but everything else was very flavorful and filling. I typically eat bread with my yogurt and the malabar paratha/pachadi mix was great - the pineapple and pomegranate mix balanced out the yogurt, which paired very well with our spicy dishes. I was skeptical about lemon rice (I was considering ordering the Tomato rice) but I&#39;m glad I went with it; the lemon rice and mango curry went very well together.<br><br>Throughout our meal, we had several different waiters serving us and asking about our experience, which was a bit confusing but I suppose better this than having no service at all :)<br><br>While ordering, I indicated that we only wanted the small prawn masala dish but we got charged for the large. I noted this to (one of) our server who immediately apologized and adjusted our bill. The manager (?) also apologized on our way out while holding the door open for us. I really appreciated this act of customer service.<br><br>Overall, I had a lovely time and would recommend this restaurant.",

"reviewcomment":"Ah- MA-ZING!  This was the best South Indian food I have ever eaten.  From the first bite (to the completely stuffed) last, I found myself humming and closing my eyes and saying &#34;mmm,&#34; through the whole meal.<br><br>The menu is a little daunting for me because there is so much text.  I would have like to have taken it to the hotel to read a day before to understand all the great stories being told about the food, how the smells remind the author of one thing or the next from his childhood, etc.  But I didn&#39;t have that luxury.  It was 10pm on a Sat, I was starved and YELP said they closed at 10:30p. (Luckily, on Sat- they don&#39;t stop seating till 11pm).<br><br>I am traveling alone and unlike many prix fixe menus I have seen around town, this one was not a min of 2 ppl.  So I ordered the &#34;Non Veg&#34; FEAST.  Here&#39;s what came with it:<br><br>- Part 1: Pre-Meal- a basket of cruchies of all sizes, including savory banana chips.  All perfectly seasoned and delicious enough that I almost got full just snacking on those!  Also included was a small sampling of spicy pickles and a garlicy yogurt<br><br>- Part 2: Appetizers - served with a small cucumber, carrot and lettuce bed, the apps were a lamb puff, chicken samosa (this was THE BEST SEASONED SAMOSA I HAVE EVER HAD) and a fried prawn.  The prawn was just at the right temp, not rubbery or overcooked.  The lamb was mixed with potato and a little bit dry- but compared to everything else- a small textural note.<br><br>- Part 3: Mains- there were three curries- Chicken, lamb and fish- a large helping of lemon rice and a large pancake roti.  The fish seemed hard at first, but did not taste dry at all.  It tasted almost like it was compressed.  Not sure what fish it was, but it was wonderful.  The lamb was a solid curry in a dark sauce.  It was cooked perfectly.  The best of the three was the chicken curry.  This wasn&#39;t your average tikki masala, the seasoning was just spicy enough and went perfectly with the roti they included to mop up all the juices.  Before I could finish this part I was bordering on stuffed.  I couldn&#39;t resist noshing on more of it, so I barely left any behind.  Then I was truly stuffed.  and along came...<br><br>Part 4: Dessert- this was a delicate tapioca rice porridge with hints of coconut, cardamon and little slices of cashews.  Unlike other tapioca that I have gotten to finish and Indian meal, this one really knew how to hint at spices without overpowering it.  Cardamon is a difficult spice to work with if its not toasted properly and (preferably for me) strained out rather than included whole.  They handled it perfectly.<br><br>The service was spot on, I was visited several times, but not enough to feel intrusive.  There was an entertaining party sitting nearby, so I heard some fun conversations.  The only downside was the lack of wi-fi and spotty phone reception, or this review would have been posted while i ate.<br><br>PS: I heard from the waiter that the cousin of the chef/ owner has a restaurant in Culver City on Venice Blvd.  He wrote down the info for me.  Now I have a place to check out when I get back to LA!",

"reviewcomment":"Wow.  First time at the restaurant and it made sense to do the tasting menu.  I don&#39;t regret that one bit.  The service was impeccable, and the tasting menu had items from various Indian culinary backgrounds, with paired wines.  Overall...unbelievable!<br><br>Of the tasting menu, the two standouts were the pineapple curry -- chunks of pineapple in warm yogurt gravy with bits of chili, fried mustard seed, and fried curry leaves.  OMG -- amazing.  Single best moment of my meal.  In fact, I told the people serving me that I was upset that I left that dish for the last!  The second dish -- the coconut creme brulee.  Again, OMG.  Creme brulee crust was perfect, and the custard itself had a good balance of sweet goodness with the savory coconut.<br><br>Every aspect of the operation, from the person greeting you at the door, to the person taking you to your seat, to the servers taking care of you, all the way to the food prepared and presented is unified under a banner of high standards and quality.  That&#39;s why Veeraswamy gets five stars in my book.  Thank you for setting the bar high for standards and quality, and meeting them Veeraswamy!  <br><br>Will I be back?  But of course.  Next time, I&#39;m getting a larger order of that pineapple curry.  Thank you for the experience, Veeraswamy!",

"reviewcomment":"Goodman is a legit steak house!<br><br>I&#39;d been wanting to go for ages, and when my parents came to town and offered to take us to dinner, I booked Goodman. The ambiance is upscale, and while I&#39;m sure they would prefer people to be dressed more smarty, it seems like it&#39;s a bit casual there as well. The servers were all incredibly friendly and always coming by to see if we were okay with drinks.<br><br>I needed a bit of a drink to calm down when I arrived so ordered the bartender&#39;s special, The Derby. Delicious (but strong) drink to start the meal. They&#39;re more than willing to bring the cuts of meat over to the table to show you what you&#39;ll be ordering. They have some regular cuts of steak on the menu, but they also have a few special cuts for the evening which are located on various chalkboards around the restaurant. They do both American corn-fed beef and European grass-fed beef. We opted for the grass-fed bone-in rib-eyes and a few sides.<br><br>I also had the seared foie gras starter. It was fantastic. The foie gras was really well seared and it was served with figs and truffle honey (I love truffle honey). The beef was really well cooked. Perfectly medium rare (as a rib eye needs to be to cook the fat) and they served with a variety of sauces. My favorite was the Bearnaise. Super duper delicious. The pepper sauce was really peppery. The only letdown was the Stilton wine sauce. Wasn&#39;t Stilton-y enough for me. We got steamed spinach (perfectly reasonable), beef dripping chips (awesome) and truffle mac and cheese (amazing) as sides. My parents got the chocolate tart dessert and it was oozing chocolate. We ordered the cheese and there were some pretty tasty cheeses there.<br><br>All in all, it&#39;s probably the best steak I&#39;ve had in London. Next time I have the hankering for an expensive steak dinner, Goodman will be at the top of my list!",

Granted I didn&#39;t pay for this meal, it was a top notch experience. Some dishes were better than others, but overall it was very solid food and excellent service. So overall I&#39;d say 4-star food and 5-star service. Plus, it is a cute bright blue space that has its own old-time charm.<br><br>Considering how large the lobster was, it was extremely tender and flavourful. The preparation and with lots of ginger was perfect, although the noodles that lay underneath were forgettable. <br><br>The spare ribs appetizer with pickles (japanese-style daikon pickles) was also really yummy. I&#39;d definitely get this again. I also really liked the Szechuan peppercorn jumbo prawns. Super nom. <br><br>Hot and Sour soup was solid, but nothing special, but I&#39;d order it again. Fried tofu northern-style was light in flavour, but really brought out the fresh taste of the tofu. We also had some mushroom dish, but I forget what it was called. <br><br>The maitre&#39;d, William, is a really nice man and obviously a career professional. He makes this place special.

"reviewcomment":"STOP.<br><br>Do you know how good cornmeal crust pizza is? <br><br>I&#39;m lactose intolerant, so pizza might seem out of the question. But it turns out I still love pizza, without the cheese! This place earned a star before I even walked in the door by promptly and politely replying in the affirmative when I emailed to ask if their crust is lactose-free and if they have lactose-free topping combination options. So all was set for a delicious visit!<br><br>When myself and two friends arrived, we were greeted politely and seated immediately. My friends shared a whole pizza with two topping combinations and cheese, while I tried three slices (pizza here is served by the slice because there are so many topping combinations to try so it&#39;s best to mix and match.) I had:<br>-artichoke and spinach<br>-pepperoni, mushroom, and jalapeño<br>-pulled pork and slaw<br><br>All were awesome without the cheese. We also ordered a salad to share as a table. All the salads on offer had cheese in them, so the kitchen created a salad for us that wasn&#39;t on the menu:<br>-mixed greens salad with roasted apple, pear, and onion<br><br>It was delicious, and a perfect accompaniment to the pizza. Otto&#39;s willingness to create this salad for us really showed me they&#39;re able to go the extra mile in terms of service and accommodation of food allergies. They also have gluten free pizza crust, and a vegan cheese made from cashews (though I&#39;m allergic to those too, so I didn&#39;t try it!) <br><br>To top it all off, I had a fantastic floral IPA, which paired perfectly with the meal. There&#39;s a small but good beer selection here, which rotates regularly.<br><br>For the three of us, dinner came to just over £45. <br><br>Altogether, a delicious dinner, and very friendly service too!",

"reviewcomment":"It was a relatively long but sexy walk from Neal&#39;s Dairy Yard, and we almost got lost a couple times. But it was all worth the wait. The very sexy wait.<br><br>As I&#39;m not one for hyperbole (unless it&#39;s sexy), I&#39;d rather let the star ranking speak for itself and keep my words a bit limited. Needless to say, we were immediately impressed and took a couple of sexy seats up top. It was a bit on the talky side so we asked the server if there were sexier seats elsewhere, and she took us down to the lower level where it was all verrrrrrrry sexy.<br><br>I had the duck rillettes and they were perfect. Perfect like the hair on a werewolf of London - and you know that&#39;s right. The Tuscan Bean soup was the cat&#39;s meow baby and my dinner guest gorged herself on a cheese plate that any dairy lover would sing carols to. I don&#39;t like cheese, but I still tipped my cap to its sexiness. Back that thang up with some clams with garlic, lemon and coriander and you&#39;re talking about one mean spread right there.<br><br>One day I&#39;ll be back to try the Bull&#39;s Blood lettuce or deep fried pig&#39;s head because I&#39;m open-minded like that and will brag about this sexy fact on a Yelp review. Digital Underground said it best with: Help yourself to a cracker, with a spread of cheddar cheese/Have a neck bone, you don&#39;t have to say please/Eat whatcha like/yo, smell how ya like/Everybody doowutchyalike!",

From outside, you wouldn&#39;t think it&#39;s a Michelin Star restaurant. The facade was simple. <br>Inside, the decor was modern and the restaurant looked clean and crisp.<br><br>We all tried their prix fixe lunch which includes an amuse bouche. Here was their menu:<br><br>Appetizer (a choice of)<br>Salad of Radishes with Black Quinoa with crime fraiche, fennel and dill OR<br>Baked beet roots with blackberries, goats curd and herbs.<br><br>Both appetizers were delicious. I just found the salad of radishes similar to their amuse bouche for that day.<br><br>Entree (a choice of)<br>Poached Hake with Parmesan Crust, confit tomato and squid ink OR<br>Roe Deer cooked in cocoa and juniper<br><br>The Hake was good but the deer was the best. It was very flavorful and tender. <br><br>Dessert<br>Cheese Platter OR<br>White chocolate and cardamom Panna Cotta with orange and olive oil purée and cherry sorbet<br><br>None of us tried the cheese platter. The panna cotta though was delicious. It was the best way to end a lovely meal.<br><br>If you want to try a Michelin Star restaurant, this is a must try especially if you are traveling on a budget.

Terrific miso soup to start--perhaps the best of said soups I&#39;ve had. I ordered the okonomiyaki Tokyo style (with porks, shrimps, and squids). Our server came out with a bowl of ingredients, whisked them all together, and poured it onto the stove-table in front of us. Took about 10 minutes to cook and then added a number of mysterious sauces and flakes (two of which seemed to be a Japanese mayonnaise and seaweed flakes. In the end, it was yummy and so I ate it.

It was a magical 7 course tasting menu, I still dream of the yuzu truffle oil dressing they used to drench the super high quality sashimi. The meal only got better with Wagyu beef cooked to medium rare perfection. The atmosphere was super cool with an exposed center kitchen/grill. Definitely highly recommended. <br><br>ALSO!

I could have stayed there all night but might well have exploded so I will have to go back soon and try the rest of the menu!<br>Service was good, attentive and friendly as well as really helpful. A great location as well  a pity we had to eat inside but we were experiencing an August ice age and the weather was not at all Spanish!<br>I can thoroughly recommend Caminos  if you are in the area you should really try it and see what you think.",

The menu has very little selection which i think is a good thing - it means the chef can concentrate on perfecting the few things they have on the menu rather than trying to juggle a load of mediocre dishes throughout an evening.<br><br>Instead of a basket of bread to start they serve popcorn cooked in beef juices which is wonderful. The house flat iron steak is tender and full of flavour and you can get a selection of sauces - I got peppercorn and my girlfriend got bernaise - both really tasty.<br><br>I had a small carafe of house red wine which was delicious and went with the steak perfectly.<br><br>Highly recommend!",

"reviewcomment":"Went here with friends for lunch since we all wanted to try a Michelin Star restaurant.<br><br>We initially wanted to go to a Gordon Ramsey restaurant but all of his restaurants were completely booked the week we were in London. <br><br>This place is a 10-minute walk from the tube station. From outside, you wouldn&#39;t think it&#39;s a Michelin Star restaurant. The facade was simple. <br>Inside, the decor was modern and the restaurant looked clean and crisp.<br><br>We all tried their prix fixe lunch which includes an amuse bouche. Here was their menu:<br><br>Appetizer (a choice of)<br>Salad of Radishes with Black Quinoa with crime fraiche, fennel and dill OR<br>Baked beet roots with blackberries, goats curd and herbs.<br><br>Both appetizers were delicious. I just found the salad of radishes similar to their amuse bouche for that day.<br><br>Entree (a choice of)<br>Poached Hake with Parmesan Crust, confit tomato and squid ink OR<br>Roe Deer cooked in cocoa and juniper<br><br>The Hake was good but the deer was the best. It was very flavorful and tender. <br><br>Dessert<br>Cheese Platter OR<br>White chocolate and cardamom Panna Cotta with orange and olive oil purée and cherry sorbet<br><br>None of us tried the cheese platter. The panna cotta though was delicious. It was the best way to end a lovely meal.<br><br>If you want to try a Michelin Star restaurant, this is a must try especially if you are traveling on a budget. For a three course meal, we spent £28 per person.",

"reviewcomment":"I was on a lone late Sunday wander in Soho headed for my usual haunt of Wong Kei only to find it mysteriously closed for &#39;refurbishment&#39;. Being still hungry and, having originally been dead set on a giant, juicy plate of Singapore noodles, I found myself lost in a sea of unfamiliar Chinatown eateries, casinos and unorthodox revellers. It took me a few moments to collect my thoughts, but then I remembered: what about that tiny Japanese place that I had read about somewhere on the social media train? Always a queue, I had heard. But maybe at 9pm on a Sunday, there might just be a free spot for one.<br><br>Walking down towards Leicester Square, I kept looking out for Misato as I thought I&#39;d missed it, but stopped in time. Menus printed on A4 paper and placed inside plastic wallets in the window. A spot visible through said window! I went in and after a quick look at the menu, instantly ordered a can of Sapporo beer, some miso soup and a katsu curry.<br><br>The soup was warm and comforting, and the curry just giant. The portion size was reminiscent of dishes I&#39;d cook up during my student days. Two breaded cutlets of pork slathered in Japanese curry sauce, with a dressed salad and an extremely generous heap of sticky rice. All were pleasing to this ravenous kid recharging his batteries after a hectic weekend.<br><br>The bill? £11.50 including tip. Some may baulk at the &#39;optional service charge&#39; suggested at the foot of the bill. I&#39;ve read many a review shrieking about waiters asking for tips and customers refusing through their rigorous, dogmatic obligation to take offence wherever humanly possible, but let&#39;s be honest, these are people earning tuppence trying their luck. So what? I paid it anyway and left.<br><br>Five stars. Will be back with a friend next time.",

"reviewcomment":"I only discovered the Carpenter&#39;s a few weeks ago but it&#39;s become my new favourite and here&#39;s why.<br><br>It&#39;s a proper pub where everything is just right. Well chosen beer selection (not too many, I don&#39;t need hundreds of choices). The staff are friendly and you get the feeling they take pride in their pub.<br><br>The pub itself is just what I want in a pub. Not too big, not to small and with cosy tables to sit at in a dark wood interior. There are several rooms extending to the back and and even a tiny beer garden hidden away behind that. It&#39;s a pleasant contrast to those wannabe &#39;gastro&#39; places with huge huge dining room tables with deafening volume that require to you shout across to be heard. None of that here. It&#39;s all on a more human scale.<br><br>It&#39;s another example of my personal rule that says that the best pubs in London are just far enough off the beaten track...not outside a tube station or directly on a crowded thoroughfare but slightly hidden away. In this case it&#39;s about a 5 minute walk down a quiet street from the seething crowds in the Brick Lane area. This is where they always are...<br><br>That also means that the punters are pleasant and not full of irritating types and you don&#39;t need to push through crowds to get served.<br><br>Haven&#39;t tried the food but it fits with the rest of the pub, the menu at least is proper pub food, refreshingly absent of silly named dishes desperately trying to be on trend.<br><br>Just perfect.",

"reviewcomment":"This is a review of their afternoon tea. I&#39;ve never stayed in the hotel because I live here, but the pictures sure look nice! I&#39;ve had afternoon tea here, twice. If it&#39;s warm out, you&#39;ll want to see if you can sit on the terrace overlooking their garden, because, well, that is awesome. You sit there the whole time thinking, &#34;Wow, it&#39;s warm in London.&#34; If not, they have a lovely indoor dining room. Be sure to call in advance, especially if you&#39;re going there during the weekend, because it often fills up.<br><br>With the afternoon team, do come hungry. (Is that not a classy thing to say?) And be sure to wear something nice -- jeans and a t-shirt will probably make you feel out of place. Then you&#39;ll enjoy the usual assortment of sandwiches (crust cut off!), scones (clotted cream piled on), and mini desserts. Most people end up ordering their house tea, which is very good, and you can also opt to add champagne.<br><br>Gluten-free notes: Yes, they do gluten-free afternoon tea. It&#39;s best to call them in advance and let them know, and confirm that they&#39;ll have scones and sandwiches for you. Then you can eat just like everybody else. Amazing! Clotted cream is naturally gluten-free, by the way. London is great for gluten-free eaters.",

A closer look reveals a high-end Indian restaurant serving exciting and ambitious food in a white napkin style with art-adorned brick walls and sculptures. It&#39;s a surprising and rewarding find, but given the rave reviews already here and in press, the real surprise is why everyone in London doesn&#39;t know about Barbur. <br><br>I highly recommend a trip. The OG to HOP is the way to go (overground to Honor Oak Park) and from there it is only a short walk East. You&#39;ll need to have a reservation for your table and to have no reservations for your menu choice; there are wild mixes of flavours throughout which excel when combined with the high quality of ingredients on offer.",

"reviewcomment":"Brilliant! (when in London...)<br><br>Dined here with a client and the service, food, atmosphere are all wonderful. Northern Italian fare, very fresh and authentic. Started with appetizer of mussels (fabulous), crab salad (just good, not phenomenal), and bruschetta (simple yet delicious). I opted for linguine with clams. It was the perfect portion size, pasta cooked al dente, not overly garlicky, really perfect. Co diners went with a chicken dish in a creamy mushroom sauce which smelled amazing and a grilled swordfish - which came out rare - which was not the norm for us but it tasted good. We had a fabulous French Pinot Noir and finished up with some ginger tea and a creme brulee.<br><br>An excellent meal, not rushed at all. Piano music playing upstairs. Highly recommend when in this part of town (West Hamstead) - it&#39;s on a small side street BTW and right around the corner from a crepe stand which had a line down the block....",

"reviewcomment":"This is the best fish and chips I&#39;ve ever had. I chose the jumbo fried haddock cuz I&#39;m a hungry hungry hippo and had a cider to wash it down with. The fish is perfectly cooked; flaky and delicate. The fried breading was light and ultra crispy without being too crunchy. The chips are your standard steak fries and definitely need salt, vinegar and/or ketchup for extra flavor. But the star of the show is certainly the fish.<br><br>The staff is very helpful and friendly despite having to deal with our rowdy touristy group. The dining space is very homey and comfortable. All future fish and chip meals will be compared to North Sea as the benchmark.",

"reviewcomment":"Ever looked for a great lobster restaurant in London? Just stop by here, but it was SUPER good..!<br><br>They have such a great deal. For just 20 pounds you will have a WHOLE lobster with fries and salad. The lobster was pretty big and it was worth waiting for it I must say. When we arrived, they said to us that we have to wait about 1 hours due to it was so incredible busy. We waited at the bar and luckily we can already sit at our table after waiting 15 minutes!<br><br>They also have a great lobster menu or you can even order bigger lobsters as well! I haven&#39;t tried the burger, but it looked sooo good as well!<br><br>I recommend you to go after peak hours to prevent you to wait so long, but definitely try the lobster!<br><br>Next time when I am in London I definitely will come back!",

"reviewcomment":"I heard mixed things about this place but wanted to check it out... I mean, having a duck on a waffle with maple syrup, it&#39;s too intriguing not to! I was very lucky to have gotten a booking a few days before the date of choice, because I heard you have to wait at least a month for a good table. <br>Unfortunately one of the lifts was broken, which was the only downside to the experience because being in that lift is pretty amazing. It&#39;s completely clear so the view takes your breath away. But this time it was really crowded so didn&#39;t get to appreciate the view as much as I could have otherwise. <br>You go to the 40th floor and the staff immediately takes care of you. There&#39;s a small bar before the restaurant space but we had a late dinner booking so we went straight to the table to order drinks, which were fabulous. The tables closest to the windows are obviously the best, but unfortunately we were seated close to the kitchen which was farthest away from the view. I didn&#39;t mind it though, I enjoyed staring at all the dishes come out.<br>The appetizers are stunning. The garlic bread is a must-have... I&#39;ve never had garlic bread so deliciously original. Hands-down the best bread I had in my life actually. Soft cloves of garlic nested in the soft bread but wasn&#39;t overpowering. The octopus was also really nice with the roasted potatoes, and the doughnut was really interesting! I didn&#39;t enjoy the raw scallops though... each piece was way too small and was the most disappointing dish of the evening. <br>Of course, then comes the duck &amp; waffle, and I absolutely loved it! The whole combination worked perfectly together. I poured all the maple syrup over the duck and egg and inhaled the dish. The portion could be bigger. <br>Overall, I can&#39;t wait to bring my siblings here, it will really impress them :)",

"reviewcomment":"I was slightly skeptical arriving at The Curious Yellow Cafe as it didn&#39;t look so great from the outside and also very small. What have I learnt? Don&#39;t judge a book by its cover! <br><br>Firstly the staff were very warm and welcoming taking our order quickly without being intrusive. We both ordered the vegetarian breakfasts and banana shakes. Both were outstanding. I almost felt guilty as I watched one of the staff leave and return 5 minutes lately with fresh bananas especially for us. There was no &#39;sorry that&#39;s not available.&#39; The breakfast was by far the best vegetarian breakfast I&#39;ve had since being in London. All prepared and cooked right in front of our eyes in the small kitchen behind the counter so we could see what was going into our food. I must make a special mention to the scrambled eggs. I&#39;m not quite sure what she did but they were delicious! Soft but not runny and sweet and savoury at the same time.<br><br>Lastly even though it was only 10.30am we opted for a slice of chocolate beetroot cake as we had heard great things. Who could have ever guessed this could be such a great combo! The beetroot made the cake soft and moist but without overpowering the chocolate and the icing completed the masterpiece.<br><br>This will definitely be on my most recommended cafes list!",

"reviewcomment":"After reading reviews for several Indian restaurants in Kensington, we decided on Zaika for dinner one night while traveling in London.  We were not disappointed!  Zaika&#39;s unique menu options had us trying new dishes for the first time, and everything was superb. I had the Lamb Shank and Masala Ratatouille, and my husband had the Prawn Platter. Both were absolutely delicious and filling.  The Naan bread basket and ochre appetizer were fantastic, too. <br><br>The waiters were very attentive and the chef kept sending out small tastings of various treats (a tiny cup of cauliflower soup, a mango ice, a miniature dessert tasting platter, etc.)  The wine was great too.  We went away very happy and extremely full.<br><br>Some of the historic interior walls of the building were preserved while others featured vibrant colors and plush upholstery. It was a wonderful place for a romantic evening and fabulous Indian food. I would highly recommend this restaurant.",

"reviewcomment":"Apart from HKK, this is, I think, in terms of food quality the best Chinese restaurant in London. When you consider that it costs slightly under half what you&#39;d pay at HKK it is absolutely fantastic value. <br><br>Chef Peng has now relinquished control of the dining room to his son but remains in the kitchen churning out delicious dishes I&#39;ve never seen on a menu, and owing to the fact that Hunan doesn&#39;t have a menu, I probably never will. It&#39;s best with about 8 people so they can bring out lots of small dishes. Dishes come out of the kitchen at a relaxed pace, once you say you are full to bursting they bring out some fritters and you are done.<br><br>The food is at a flat rate. I think it was around £45 last time I went so it&#39;s not your local takeaway but it is 100% worth the money. Their wine list is excellent too, go for an Alsatian varietal and you can&#39;t go too far wrong. Have a little lychee wine as a digestif and you will be good to go.",

Trinity does not do that. It remains modern and interesting without losing sight of the customer&#39;s empty bellies and salivating taste buds. <br>6) Clear winners for me were the &#34;Coriander Seared Tuna, Avocado, Soy and Lime&#34; and the &#34;Blackberry and Apple Parfait, Caramelised White Chocolate and Hazelnut&#34;. They were simply out of this world! <br><br>Cons:<br>1) One negative is the fact that some people could find the dishes too rich and heavy...there were A LOT of powerfully flavored and heavy dishes.

For so much to eat, it&#39;s a great price that can&#39;t compare to other Turkish restaurants. <br>Not only is the food great, but the atmosphere is amazing.

"reviewcomment":"Not sure why it says that the restaurant is closed, since it patently isn&#39;t. That must have been a very old review. My strict veggie friend recommended this place for after-theatre dinner and I have to say I was blown away by the food even though I am usually strictly NOT vegetarian. I liked the room too, friendly and smart without being too formal, looks more like a bistro really. Have the starter meze for two; it&#39;s a great way to try lots of the starters, though for some reason they wouldn&#39;t let us have a bigger one for 3 of us. For the mains we had a Thai curry, mushroom risotto cake (much more interesting and tasty than it sounds) and a root vegetable bake, all excellent. They have a very good wine list too. Very highly recommended.",

"reviewcomment":"Andrew Edmunds is a quaint European restaurant in SoHo in London. I had heard of Andrew Edmunds from friends before and it is quite highly rated on Zagat so decided to book dinner for a friend that had just moved to London that evening. When we arrived at Andrew Edmunds, we were surprised to see that the restaurant is around 8 tables or so that are closely packed (reminded me quite a lot of a small restaurant in Southern France). The decor is quite romantic with used wine bottles corked with candles burning on the table, a chalk board with up to date wine specials, and a handwritten menu. The wine list is phenomenal - they source their wine list from high-end retailers in London and buy the last few bottles of a bin at a significant discount. They truly pass along the discount to the costumer - bottles begin around £18 for their house red Corbieres and upward to hundreds of pounds for known vintages of French, Italian, Spanish, Australian, and Napa/Sonoma wines. The menu is filled with classically French and British dishes that are simple but well crafted. We decided on the winter stew, lemon sole, and lentil and aubergine for the three mains, along with the charcuterie for an appetizer, and the cheese plate for dessert. The Corbieres was splendid (and reasonably priced) and the mains were surprising great (plus, the price point was from £12.50 for the lentils to £22 for the sole, so quite reasonable for SoHo). The cheese dish was sourced from local farms outside of London and was one of the nicest cheese plates I have had in a long time. As an aside, Andrew Edmunds does not do online reservations and does not accept them more than a week in advance. Calling for reservations 3 or more days in advance is quite recommended in order to get a spot (especially for the weekends). The staff were attentive and helpful in selecting a dish, but were also not too hovering, so we felt we could sit for as long after our meal as we wished. The dishes were also well-timed, so courses did not overlap. Overall, Andrew Edmunds was a splendid restaurant. If you are looking for a higher end French/European restaurant to take a date or to catch up with good friends, Andrew Edmunds is a great choice.",

My last one was about a week ago and it was great, I was there with few friends of mine and we were starving. <br>I my self had a starter and main, followed by a desert. Food was just fantastic, products were so fresh that it felt that the vegies were just harvested from the garden.

It would be ever so greatly appreciated. <br><br>For real though- this place does an incredible breakfast/brunch, and somehow, although I hear horror stories galore about having to wait ages for a table (at The Table, ha! aren&#39;t they so witty!), every time I&#39;ve come, the wait has been either non-existent or minimal. Which thank god, because I don&#39;t know how long I could wait to get my hands on their insane poached eggs and waffles! <br><br>Although I&#39;ve never tried their meat-based breakfast options, many brunching companions have, and all can testify to their goodness (honestly, seeing their Full Borough breakfast, I have, on occasion doubted my choice of vegetarian-ness). In addition, they do great lunch burgers and their fixed lunch is fabulous (although, with the fixed menu, it can be a little hit-and-miss if they happen to be serving something you don&#39;t particularly like). <br><br>A particularly positive point of The Table&#39;s, is that when you order tea, instead of just bringing you a cup of tea, as most places tend to do, they bring you an entire pot of it (it helps that their pot is nice as well... what doesn&#39;t this place get right?)!

Regardless, if you go for a meal at Cah-Chi, you are going to have an incredibly pleasant time.<br><br>The decor has a subtle eloquence to it. They have a heated conservatory at the back of the restaurant, which was the perfect place to chill out! You are allowed to bring your own wine to the restaurant, which is served up to you and stored and there is no corking fee, which keeps the price down. Not that you should worry about price. The food there is very fair, for its quality. <br><br>Starters were brilliant - deep fried Oysters, Kim shin beef in a lovely sauce and Octopus eggs. The main was a choice of a noodle dish, rish dish or stew. As a table we went for one of each - all delicious. If you do go there, order the Green Tea tiramisu for dessert - absolutely lovely<br><br>The Staff were incredibly friendly, welcoming, did a great job and food was quick to the table.<br><br>I had never had Korean food before and my expectation lay somewhere between Chinese and Thai. The food wasnt greasy, heavy and the spices were spot on.<br><br>I am looking forward to going again",

"reviewcomment":"Dear Orangery, your tea service is spectacular. I will be back. Sincerely, Natalie.<br><br>Ok, I do want to write more than that, but seriously if you&#39;re looking for a place to have a nice tea, LOOK NO FURTHER! I&#39;ve had the tea service at Harrod&#39;s and while that was a great experience, I have to say I liked tea at the Orangery even better. I went with a group of colleagues while on a business trip to London. We made a reservation, which I would highly recommend. They may be able to fit you in as a walk-in with a small party, but reservations help. <br><br>I was impressed by the selection of tea and tisane on their menu. I generally cannot do caffeine, and usually resign myself to a decaf earl grey that most places have. The orangery had several herbal choices (completely caffeine free). Each person receives their own pot of tea, which catered to my selfish American ways ;)<br><br>We had the traditional afternoon service, and for each pair at the table we received a platter of goodies. Raisin scones with jam and clotted cream were probably my favorite. This was my first experience with clotted cream, and and must say the English have a winner on their hands! It&#39;s a delicious spread that is basically thick, slightly sweetened cream. I could feel it going straight to my thighs...and I loved it. Several little cakes and pastries I couldn&#39;t quite identify, but all were delicious. The cucumber sandwiches were a refreshing choice on a warm afternoon, and though I loved the sweets, provided a nice contrast.<br><br>The place settings were lovely. Bright aqua and pink colors. There is a story about the orangery&#39;s history on the back of the menu, which is informative and interesting. Something neat to read while waiting for the rest of your party to arrive. The location is very idyllic. You must walk through Hyde Park to get there, and have the opportunity to pass Kensington Palace as well. There is a pond nearby, and as you walk up to the Orangery take note of the elegantly pruned trees and lush greenery. A few minutes here, and you begin to feel like royalty yourself!",

"reviewcomment":"Superb coffee. Deliciously creamy and brilliant. As a fussy ex-patriate Melbournian coffee drinker, I was pleasantly suprised. The Kiwi&#39;s that run this place are doing London a great service. London is so stuffed with chain coffee joints and an astonishing number of putrid &#39;Americano&#39; drinkers. This place, though a tad out of the way for some, is most certainly worth the drive for latte and education alone! Delightful aftertaste, of caramelized nuts, delicious! <br><br>Eggs Benedict - eggs cooked nicely, perched on two muffins that didn&#39;t seem to be toasted terribly well. Hollandaise ok but lacked a bit of flavour. Nitpickery really for what was a fine breakfast. I hope to return soon and try something else. Delightful setting, across canal from the transforming Olympic remnants. Beatnikish crowd stabbing away at their laptops but overall a calming place to be...",

"reviewcomment":"Addie&#39;s Thai is an Urban Legend; and for good reason too. They&#39;ve been here since 1987, and are still going strong; not surprising, as they&#39;ve perfected the art of serving Oriental fast food that places the sole priority of satisfying the eater&#39;s tastebuds first, way before everything else. It&#39;s all about the flavour; there are no corners cut here when it comes to tending to the tongue. The flavours are over-the-top, massively indulgent, satiating, animated in appearance, glutinous, and gluttonous; a real treat, leaving the mouth awash with pure satisfaction, with lips curled up at the side in sheer delight. When it boils down to it, &#39;Oriental delivery/takeaways&#39; are a treat really, aren&#39;t they? You don&#39;t eat this type of food to get healthy, do you? You eat it because it tastes good; it tastes different; it&#39;s the opposite of boring isn&#39;t it? &#39;Boring&#39; is boiling a pot of pasta and adding some ground beef to it to turn it into a Spaghetti Bolognese; &#39;fun&#39; is picking up the phone after a few drinks and having a bit of a bubbly chinwag with the restauranteur, then setting the stop-watch before frantically scurrying around the house like the Tasmanian devil, trying to find some cash (with a fictitious elongated 30-min Countdown theme-tune building up in your head), or for the more sadistic of you, gleefully laying in wait until the order has been relayed, then reveling in the tremendous joy of hearing that ever-so-slight woefully sounding sigh as you connivingly state to the person on the other end of the line I&#39;d like to pay by card please.; the cheap thrill you get and the goosebumps that cover your forearms when the front doorbell goes, it&#39;s here!!!; the ceremonial &#39;2001 A Space Odyssey&#39;-styled &#39;opening of the front door&#39; to greet the spaceman who smells of traffic (who&#39;s already reaching out to hand you a big plastic bag filled with your steaming goodyness); the expectation of it all; the pulling of the dishes out one by one from of the bag and trying to figure out what is what and who&#39;s is who&#39;s; the lid-popping; the sniffing; the obligatory I didn&#39;t order this!? comment regardless of the whether or not it was what you ordered; the tucking-in, the munching-with-no-manners, the burping, the small-talk, the guzzling of the fizzy drink right at the end; the playing of &#39;kitchen-basketbal&#39; with the kitchen bin and the empty containers; and then finally, the last act, the waddling over to the sofa and slumping down in it like a Walrus auditioning for a part in the &#39;Royle Family&#39;.<br> There&#39;s a whole culture involved isn&#39;t there? It&#39;s an operatic act starting right from the second you pick up the phone. And with Addie&#39;s Thai, you are not just &#39;ordering a takeaway&#39;, you are buying a ticket or two for this Oriental opera, that will provide you with the classic takeaway/delivery experience, from start to finish. <br> As soon as the call is answered, you are greeted by the ever-chirpy, effusively attentive, heart-warmingly friendly host, a lady who&#39;s name I have forgotten, who, regardless of the weather, will cheer you up no-end, and by the second call, will know your first name and your favourite dishes off by heart. Slightly lascivious in nature, if you are male, do not be put off by what may seem like flirtatious behaviour; it all adds to the Addie&#39;s experience. This is the time to practice some sexual innuendo jokes, or any joke for that matter. The phone-calling here reminds me of communicating with male Air Stewards on British Airways flights; it&#39;s got that similar sort of tongue-in-cheek Carry-on style of tone to it. And when the food arrives, you will have no trouble whatsoever with their extremely efficient, polite, methodical delivery staff; have no fear, there won&#39;t be any Hey, how&#39;s it going geezer?! Did ya watch tha footy?! small-talk here, nor any off-putting &#39;huffs and puffs&#39; from peeved-off drivers, as the Addie&#39;s delivery crew are like commandos, straight in, straight out, hi and bye is all you get (if that), and that&#39;s it. For the more frugal of you out there, rest assured, you will not encounter any &#39;Oxfam eyes&#39; from the driver, as the passing-over of the food is complete, but I always tip anyway, so personal preference is key here. The food is gorgeous. I quickly became an Addie&#39;s addict circa 2006/2007, when I was living in an apartment block in South Kensington, and had the good fortune of coming across one of their menus they had left on the counter of the reception down in the lobby. The rest is history. I was ordering at least three times a week from them, and quickly became a regular Alas, I am no longer an addict now, as I went into re-hab (moved &#39;north of the park&#39;), and as they don&#39;t deliver too far from their base-camp, their food is something I will not have the pleasure of experiencing any time soon. <br> FOOD:<br> Phad Thai: &#39;Alice in Wonderland&#39;-styled appearance of this staple Thai dish, with whopping chunks of all the ingredients crammed into the container, with the lid literally bursting",

"reviewcomment":"I can eat muffins and frozen yogurt all week long if it weren&#39;t for the inadequate placement of the shop. It&#39;s far away from my office and actually quite hidden from the street. If you don&#39;t know that it&#39;s there you might miss out on the opportunity to taste some out of this world muffins and other sweet pastries. <br><br>The guys also offer some low-fat options for the ones that look after their figure. I also tend to do so but I would really prefer to taste a muffin&#39;s original taste than to try to lie to my stomach with these low-fat wanna-bes. You can also go with the healthy option of frozen yogurt plus some fruit on top of it or blended in with the yogurt. I prefer it on top as that way the taste is more definitive.<br><br>The space inside is neat and tidy and the staff was generally sweet and friendly.",

"reviewcomment":"We came on a weekday for an early dinner so mostly enjoyed the pre-theatre deal of two courses for £15 (done between 5:30pm and 7:30pm).   The pre-theatre is good value considering it included most of the mains which cost about that on their own.  The service was great and the food was delicious.  They also obliged us with the free glass of bubbly with the yelp check-in deal.  <br><br>I originally found this place while googling around for a good English Gastropub to take some out of town visitors but I wouldn&#39;t really say this is a pub.  It&#39;s more of a chic rustic English restaurant with amazing locally sourced fare.  <br><br>Starters:<br>squash soup  - ehh.. it was ok.  I had to add salt pepper which is a bad sign..<br>rare beef, rocket &amp; horseradish  -  pretty good<br>Yorkshire wild rabbit, foie gras &amp; raisin bread terrine - loved it<br><br>Mains<br>Mount Grace farm British Lop port chip, English mustard cream - loved it<br>Wild black bream fillet, cauliflower puree - loved it<br>white park bavette steak with chips - loved it (and finally some good chips!  the right combo of crispy on the outside, delish on the inside)<br><br>The menu changes frequently (maybe even weekly) so take the above as indication of style you&#39;re likely to see.<br><br>A few miscellaneous items:<br>They advertised a brunch but it doesn&#39;t seem to be american style -- i&#39;ll have to give it a go and update this review later.   The server said they served a mean bloody mary.   We shall see..<br>I also noticed a side room which would be perfect for a party!  They had it set up with a large feasting table at the window facing the street and to the back a nice leather couch and seating for a cocktail area.  I can imagine a small engagement party, rehearsal dinner or our sad so say leaving London party I&#39;ve yet to plan..<br><br>Enjoy!",

"reviewcomment":"First things first, I was here last year and had the rabbit, which is now ruined for me. Because after you&#39;ve eaten at The Square, whatever type of meat/seafood you ate there will forever make you a snob. That&#39;s right, I can not eat rabbit anywhere else now, because they rocked my world.<br><br>The restaurant atmosphere is sophisticated and very formal. There&#39;s a dress code in place, and eating was a little stiff. This isn&#39;t the type of place that would welcome walk-ins. <br><br>The starter bread was delicious, as they come around with a selection for you to chose. The appetizers were delightful and beautifully arranged, and light enough that you wouldn&#39;t worry about filling up fast.<br><br>Then you have your main course. This place is michelin rated for a reason. The balance of flavors was wonderful, they give you just enough to satisfy, but not enough to gorge yourself on.<br><br>And then the dessert was a light touching after. Perfectly balanced. <br><br>Go, dress up, eat, and enjoy. You don&#39;t eat a meal like this every day, it&#39;s something to be savored and really a pleasure to have dined here.<br><br>Also, even though I&#39;m not big on wine. The list was superb.",

The menu has very little selection which i think is a good thing - it means the chef can concentrate on perfecting the few things they have on the menu rather than trying to juggle a load of mediocre dishes throughout an evening.<br><br>Instead of a basket of bread to start they serve popcorn cooked in beef juices which is wonderful. The house flat iron steak is tender and full of flavour and you can get a selection of sauces - I got peppercorn and my girlfriend got bernaise - both really tasty.<br><br>I had a small carafe of house red wine which was delicious and went with the steak perfectly.<br><br>Highly recommend!",

"reviewcomment":"I ate at St Moritz three or four times now and so far it never disappointed me.<br>I&#39;m a cheesaholic and I have to admit I had fondue every single time so I didn&#39;t try anything else on the menu apart from the starters.<br>St Moritz is more a winter restaurant, it&#39;s cosy, it&#39;s warm, it&#39;s woody and it reminds of a chalet in the Alps where you snuggle up in front of a fireplace sipping red wine. Good thing they are based in London where even in August on some days it feels like January.<br>Back to the food, for starters me and my fiancée tried escargots with garlic and herbs and the terrine maison which basically is the house pate. They both tasted amazing the amount of garlic in the escargots (perfect for this dish) is going to affect your social life for the rest of the night and the day after so if you are on a first date with someone you really like, better to pick something else! The pate is like a cream and it melts in your mouth. The star of the restaurant is definitely the fondue (to share). They are specialized in this great dish in fact they have different versions on the menu. To me the best one is the classic FONDUE NEUCHATELOISE with gruyere cheese and bread. I can stay for an hour just rolling the bread in the melted cheese, it feels therapeutic but that&#39;s just me I guess. We always have a white wine with the fondue as the staff suggested, a very good wine from one of the Swiss canton. The service is great, all the waiters are very polite and caring and they make you feel very welcomed. I really recommend this restaurant in the heart of Soho.",

"reviewcomment":"Adobo is probably my favourite burrito in London, besides Daddy Donkey (but always open to suggestions, and still need to try Chilango!), and yet I&#39;ve only been here twice! Service was quick even during lunch time which makes for a happy Nicole. They have the option of small or regular sized burritos, which is great, and the smaller ones are only a fiver so it won&#39;t break the bank.<br><br>I&#39;ve had the chicken tinga with chorizo and guacamole and was in burrito heaven. It&#39;s rare to find a burrito place where you can add chorizo to your burrito but it should be done more often - sure it might cost 80p extra but that 80p equates to some beautiful burrito flavours; it&#39;s not to be missed. <br><br>I really like that on their boards behind the staff are suggestions for healthier burritos, for example one concoction which is really low in calories and another one which is filled with protein. I probably wouldn&#39;t go for them since I like to make my own but it&#39;s a nice addition!<br><br>And now that Yelpers have helpfully tipped me off to the 10% discount for students, guess who&#39;s going here ALL THE TIME from now on? :D",

"reviewcomment":"I was craving spicy hot noodle soup with meat, came here and got exactly that. La mian noodle soup with char-siu and added pork-veggie wontons (for an additional cost). <br><br>The food came out within 10 mins and was burn-your-mouth hot...just the way I like it! There&#39;s a jar of chili flake paste on the table you can also add to make it spicy. So duh, I had to. <br><br>The tables are like picnic style with benches and you sit with other parties, but I didn&#39;t mind. They don&#39;t cram you in or anything...you&#39;ll still have elbow room. If it gets more people in faster, then it works. The place is really small though, there are only 3 picnic tables I believe, so it&#39;s good that they get people in and out fast.",

But for Jin Kichi, which is one hell of an izakaya tucked away in Hampstead.<br><br>Having eaten at Dinings the weekend before, Jin Kichi at first glance looks similar: small Japanese restaurant. But the styles are so diffferent. Dinings goes down the creative route, and charges an arm and a leg for it. Jin Kichi has a menu that probably came from a izakaya menu template, as the dishes are all the standard things you&#39;d find across Japan.<br><br>Yet the quality was good, the pricing reasonable, and the service fast and efficient.<br><br>Do try the yakitori while there - second only to the ones you&#39;ll find at Bincho, the yakitori specialists. And then venture through their extensive menu - outside-in rolls were well made and full of fresh fish. Fatty tuna was melt in the mouth.<br><br>Do make reservations though if you want to go - this place was packed on a Friday evening!",

Delicious Italian food with Germany engineered experience and efficiency.<br><br>Upon entering you&#39;re given a card then you head to the counter you&#39;d like to purchase from. These are split by food type, Pizza, Pasta and....I forget....ANYWAY...You choose what you want then your card is scanned and you&#39;re given a buzzer that will tell you when your food is ready. You choose a seat and bam, wait for your food to be cooked.<br><br>I must admit I&#39;ve only had the pizza here, but literally everything looks good. The pizzas have a nice thin crust with light toppings. You won&#39;t feel heavy or greasy after leaving. A nice touch is that there are fresh basil plants all over the place ready to pick and put on your food. Water is free from jugs at the drinks counter (but again you need to get it yourself, as there is no service here, however nor is there a service charge...great right?)<br><br>Anyways, remember that card they scanned? Well that has a record of what you ate, and you pay with this at the till on leaving. Note the delicious german gummi sweets on leaving and take as many as possible without receiving a raised eyebrow :)<br><br>A fantastic experience.",

"reviewcomment":"I have been DYING to find a decent burrito place in London. Together with a friend of mine, we have developed a little tradition - whenever we go to the theatre together, we grab a burrito beforehand. Gotta love a tradition, right?! <br>Well we did it twice and got annoyed. There were NO decent burrito places in London, none anyway that you could get decent food at a low price and quick enough to also make the theatre without inhaling your food. So, we plumped for one last try with Chipotle - it&#39;s a chain so surely something about it has to be good?? right?<br><br>RIGHT! We wandered in on Friday at 6.30 with no queue and loads of free tables. Uh oh, we thought. Well we were wrong! Not a huge selection (if you don&#39;t want burritos) but a great variety of salad and sauces to put on it. Bit expensive (you&#39;re looking at £10 for a large burrito and a Corona) but Dear Lord it is SO GOOD to taste a burrito where you can actually taste of all the individual flavours. Normally they taste like salt (especially with pulled pork) and refried beans, so mush. Yum, that is not.<br><br>I had medium spicing, perfect for those who like a touch of chilli heat without it overpowering anything. Even my friend (who doesn&#39;t like coriander) enjoyed her meal, bulked out with fragrant coriander rice.<br>All in all, we were happy. And perfectly filled to enjoy a cultural night out - well we can try and be cultural anyway!",

First of all, THE WINE!  The wine list is very extensive and offers small pours (75ml) so you can actually try a bunch of different kinds of wine.<br>We started with a bottle of champagne to celebrate a colleague&#39;s move back to the US, which I will definitely say was way too yummy and each sip wasnt enough!  We then moved onto a bottle of Mencia, a light but full bodied wine that went well with everything we ordered.<br><br>OK on to the food:<br>We ordered three different types of cheese and mini chorizo, which were TRULY mini, I was expecting larger sizes but then again, I really did have enough space to eat a dish.<br><br>Meals:<br>Roasted Cod with fennel and lemon infused couscous: OMG. fluffy deliciuos couscous with lovely melt in your mouth cod.  I mean wowser!<br>Other orders: Rib eye, some other beef dish, and side dishes of kale and seasoned vegetables.  Everything was fresh, delicious and just the right amount of food.<br><br>Ambience:  <br>Felt very comfortable yet being modern and trendy. <br><br>Service:<br>Superb, I felt like I was being treated five star the entire time and our needs were well cared for.  As much food and drink that we ordered, we ended up spending about £55 a person, which I find to be quite reasonable for a special event.  I am absolutely coming back and cant wait for the next event to hang out there casually!",

"reviewcomment":"So let me preface this by saying, as a child... I had a really bad experience with a curry.  A very spicy, strong, neon yellow curry.  Was forced to wash it down with a tall glass of milk... my babysitter didn&#39;t know I was lactose intolerant.  Since that experience, the smell of a curry (still unsure what kind of curry exactly) can cause me some anxiety.<br><br>Fast forward, Mr. Snarky suggested Gurkhas Diner and I became a bit anxious.  However, I decided to look at the menu to see what might be of interest to me.  As luck would have it, there were a number of dishes that I sounded very delicious to me.  So I was game!  The place was not very busy, but we were warmly welcomed.  Instantly I noticed that the place did not overwhelm you with the smell of strong curries.  The decor was minimal, but very classic with white table cloths and simple table settings.<br><br>The menu has lots of lovely things on it, but I was really taken by the Mayur Lamb... particularly the lemon and tamarind parts of the dish.  I like sour things.  We had a lamb feast.  Both of our starters... lamb.  Both of our mains... lamb.  So we started with the Lamb Dumplings (Momo) and the Barbequed Lamb (Choyala).  When it came out, the smell was lovely and the dishes looked amazing.  Honestly the presentation made me feel like this place was gourmet.  The Lamb Dumplings looked like Chinese Soup Dumplings and had this beautiful orange sauce on either side of the five dumplings.  They were delicious!  The Choyala was very good too, although Mr. Snarky did find it a bit on the spicy side, so just be warned.<br><br>For mains we had the Mayur Lamb and the Sherpa Lamb.  The waiter suggested to Mr. Snarky that he should consider a side with some kind of sauce as the Sherpa Lamb does not have a sauce.  He told us about the sides that had sauces and said that if we were having rice, the lentils would be the best.  So we ordered the lentils and rice... and a side of Garlic Nepali Bread.  We may have gone overboard.  The food came out... Mr. Snarky&#39;s was sizzling and smoking.  The whole spread just looked amazing and I regret not taking a picture.  The Garlic Nepali Bread had real pieces of garlic and had some Fennel Seeds inside the dough, giving it a very unique flavour.  The Mayur Lamb was delicious!  Although it wasn&#39;t as sour as I was hoping and honestly I got a bit nervous when the waiter said, &#34;And your Lamb Curry.&#34;  However, if that is a curry, then I am all about it.  The Lentils were amazing as well, however we had to order more rice to finish off the sauces from my main and from the lentils.  if you order saucy dishes, you should really consider two orders of rice.<br><br>While we were very full after our dinner, I will say that I didn&#39;t think the portions were huge... I think they were just right.  The portions allow you to order a few different dishes to try and I like that.  The staff were very attentive and helpful.  They brought us a dessert menu and even the desserts looked delicious, but we were just too full.  I think it was the Garlic Bread that put us over the top!  Anyway, I have been converted... at least to this restaurant and wish that I had one here in the states!  And it was good value too... I think our entire feast was about 40 or 45 quid.  Not bad when you consider how much we ordered and ate.  Lots of people were ordering for takeaway and they do deliver, but just in the Balham area.",

"reviewcomment":"STOP.<br><br>Do you know how good cornmeal crust pizza is? <br><br>I&#39;m lactose intolerant, so pizza might seem out of the question. But it turns out I still love pizza, without the cheese! This place earned a star before I even walked in the door by promptly and politely replying in the affirmative when I emailed to ask if their crust is lactose-free and if they have lactose-free topping combination options. So all was set for a delicious visit!<br><br>When myself and two friends arrived, we were greeted politely and seated immediately. My friends shared a whole pizza with two topping combinations and cheese, while I tried three slices (pizza here is served by the slice because there are so many topping combinations to try so it&#39;s best to mix and match.) I had:<br>-artichoke and spinach<br>-pepperoni, mushroom, and jalapeño<br>-pulled pork and slaw<br><br>All were awesome without the cheese. We also ordered a salad to share as a table. All the salads on offer had cheese in them, so the kitchen created a salad for us that wasn&#39;t on the menu:<br>-mixed greens salad with roasted apple, pear, and onion<br><br>It was delicious, and a perfect accompaniment to the pizza. Otto&#39;s willingness to create this salad for us really showed me they&#39;re able to go the extra mile in terms of service and accommodation of food allergies. They also have gluten free pizza crust, and a vegan cheese made from cashews (though I&#39;m allergic to those too, so I didn&#39;t try it!) <br><br>To top it all off, I had a fantastic floral IPA, which paired perfectly with the meal. There&#39;s a small but good beer selection here, which rotates regularly.<br><br>For the three of us, dinner came to just over £45. <br><br>Altogether, a delicious dinner, and very friendly service too!",

"reviewcomment":"Oh my, oh my, oh my. Three bites into my pulled pork and bone marrow mash, I said, &#34;This is one of the best meals I&#39;ve had in London.&#34; Which says loads because I&#39;ve had many, many, many bad meals and few good meals while living in London for the past 2.5 years.<br><br>Though the ambiance at Bodean&#39;s is more to my liking, the food at Pitt Cue Co is far superior to Bodean&#39;s. In fact, the food really doesn&#39;t compare aside from the fact they are in the same genre, BBQ. <br><br>My plate of pulled pork was super juicy and had no chunks of fat which is always a plus (not while cooking but definitely while eating). The bone marrow mash was delectable in its little bowl settled on my plate. The pickle relish was a bit strange but that didn&#39;t stop me from chowing down and the tiny bit of coleslaw was gone pretty much after my plate arrived in front of my googly eyes.<br><br>Yum.<br><br>As a side note, we arrived at 2:59pm on Sunday afternoon and were told that we needed to place our order straight away because they were closing in 1 minute which meant they closed at 3pm on Sundays which is contradictory to the opening hours on their door and website. A couple arrived at 3:00pm and though the door was still open, they were turned away.

Though I am never surprised to find out something is a chain, this doesn&#39;t appear to be one.<br><br>This pub doesn&#39;t have the greatest prices in this century, but is a good place to grab one pint. Food prices hover around the 10+ pound range so again, this isn&#39;t a cheap place, but is is quite nice! Coming in here for a pint or two is all I&#39;d recommend if you are on a budget.<br><br>The seating is extremely comfortable and the pub is very spacious, including a second level. It has a wholesome feel and is very very clean. Staff is semi-eager to usher you out after you&#39;ve finished your pint, but they won&#39;t do anything about it if you sit around talking.<br><br>The selection of beers on tap is another plus; there are several microbrews and the standard mainstream beers. It&#39;s worth trying something new at this place, the local taps are tasty as hell!! (is hell tasty?)<br><br>Overall, this place is a grand slam (baseball reference). A true touchdown (american football reference) of the sphere of pubs in London. Honestly, it&#39;s a slam dunk (basketball reference). <br><br>Hole in one (golf).",

When we arrived, we were the only table in the resaturant. Usually I hate that, but this time was different.<br><br>We sat down, the head chef came over and greeted us, and asked us if we would like to do the &#34;carte blanche&#34; chef&#39;s choice tasting menu. We opted for this, and he asked us several questions about our likes and dislikes. He then personally made wine recommendations based on what he was going to bring out. When we ordered more wine halfway through the meal, he came out again and guided us on wine selections based on the remaining dishes. It was awesome!<br><br>As each subsequent dish came out, I thought it was the best one yet, only to be further amazed. We had oysters, scallops, venison, pasta, canapes, crab, and a host of others I&#39;m now forgetting. Every bite was perfection.<br><br>This chef and restaurant have a big future.

"reviewcomment":"So... It happened I was walking around, looking for another place to have my late coffee on a Sunday afternoon and suddenly, a group of people stepped out of a door that led to an alley that led me to J+A Café.<br><br>There are two buildings, one on each side of the alley. One of them is a coffee shop where you can have brunch/lunch and the other, apparently, is a bar. I just went to the &#39;restaurant&#39; part because all I wanted was some coffee and cake.<br><br>The place is really nice, airy and bright, with simple decoration. The staff was lovely, always with a smile on their faces even though it was almost closing time. Always appreciated.<br><br>Brunch was over when I arrived, so I didn&#39;t have a chance to try the food. But I did try the cakes and they were wonderful. I had the Chocolate Guinness Cake with Baileys and clotted cream on the side and I just have one word to describe it: MARVELLOUS!<br><br>The coffee was also really good. Much better than the one you will get for the same price in any high street chains.",

"reviewcomment":"LOL, upon entering this bistro/bakery and seeing the amazing display of cakes, pies, desserts and platters of fantastically prepared Mediterranean appetisers (roast pumpkin, beetroot puree, grilled vegetables, hummus etc)  I knew I was gonna spend a few hours there.<br><br>Right before ordering I told the waitress not to be shocked because we were hungry. She didn&#39;t blink when we ordered everything :-D Guess we weren&#39;t the first Ottolenghi enthusiasts. <br><br>The first impression was good, it was all delicious and I will definitely go back for much more. I was actually thinking to bring a tent and permanently camp in front of this bakery LOL<br><br>PS: the place is very very small, so it&#39;s perfect for takeaway, not so great for a party of more than two people, as they only have one large table downstairs, which customers share. If you can, avoid lunch break and weekends as it can get pretty busy.",

Maybe it becomes so popular I can&#39;t even get a reservation someday?<br><br>The flavors of the four dishes I tried were all subtle.

It was all a rare, lovely treat. <br><br>Not only will I return, but I want to bring everyone I care about to this place. <br><br>The service was quite good, and the prices were very reasonable for this area.  <br><br>Note that gratuity is included in the bill, but frankly if you double tip it&#39;s no loss since the service was really above par.<br><br>Oh, and the decor was great.  Lots of colorful, Spanish tile.

"reviewcomment":"This is one of my favourite places in the World. You will always get a hello on entry and has comfy bar seats in the front bar and a lovely quiet restuarant at the back. The food is unreal, no seriously it is very, very good. I havent had anything to eat here I did not like here and I intend to have a Sunday Roast here each week as it is better than one I could make myself or made by my own mother.<br><br> They have Sports channels in the front bar and the one shop size unit make it very tiny and atmospheric for sport watching and whilst that might be a downside for some, it is not busy and the friendly and excellent bar staff will take your card and let you run a tab which means the relaxed vibe is kept and you can read your book/newspaper or go online with their internet access as a wi-fi hot spot.<br><br> You will not be disspointed by the choice of drinks here too...coffee and tea better than any pub and to cafe standard, whilst the foreign beer range is huge. Belgien, Scottish, French, Russian, American to name but a few you will find all in bottles with Irish Harp Lager, Czech Staropramen, Scottish McEwans, Gunniess and more on draught. Whilst I can reccmonded everything on the cocktail list, after drinking all 12 one night, although I can&#39;t reccomend copying my actions as I was quite ill the following day, but at two for one, it was a great Friday night!<br><br> I have taken a few few friends her and they all loved it. I held a surprise Wedding Annivarsary party for my parents here and my family and their friends loved it, so why don&#39;t you come down to Wimbledon one night or on a weekend day and take the 163, 164 bus or the tram from the station to nearby Merton Park for a hearty meal and a drink or two, I am sure you will love it too.",

"reviewcomment":"So... I had my first experience of a Supper Club last night. I&#39;ll do my best to give you a blow by blow account.. <br><br>Firstly (not really applicable), but it was a PIA to get there! The tube was being it&#39;s usual unreliable self and the taxi got really lost. Not surprising, as the venue was a flat in Whitechapel. That being said (even though we were 30 minutes late), it was worth the journey!<br><br>We arrived at an unassuming tower block and was greeted by MJ (one of our hosts of the evening). We were ushered into a lovely flat, decorated with pop icons on the walls and living room furniture cleared out to make space for 2 tables and chairs. We were given a fruity welcome cocktail (or 4) with a boozy sorbet floating in it and our lovely hosts had provided olives, cheese, garlic sausage, crackers and dips for pre-meal snacking. <br><br>After we were seated began a 5 course feast! We had prawn toast, summer rolls, duck soup and another starter of trout served on a betel leaf. The dessert was pannacotta with fresh fruit. All of it exceptionally fresh, tasty and interesting. After the meal was over, more cocktails were consumed with a side order of good conversation and great company. <br><br>I would not hestitate to try another supper club after my first experience. Give it a go while you can (but note that Table for 10 are taking a break until 2014).",

"reviewcomment":"Finally getting out to explore our new neighborhood beyond our local, we dined at the New Moon last weekend.  We loved it.  <br><br>It was the kind of Italian restaurant I always enjoy; authentic with house made pasta, friendly service and fresh menu that is very reasonably priced.  As we were some of the early dinners, they let us choose our table.  Once seated we were presented with olives and freshly made foccacia to snack on while we checked out the menu.  It didn&#39;t take us long as we were both in the mood for pasta and I jump at the chance to get grilled squid whenever I see it.  Shockingly, we both passed on the crab ravioli special that our server was raving about.  While that sounded very good, we had no regrets with how we played it.  <br><br>-Fresh wild rocket with shaved parmesan and cherry tomatoes<br>-Marinated grilled baby squid<br>-Pappardelle con Salsiccia e Funghi-Homemade pasta with sausage, mushrooms and red onions<br>-Tagliolini con Gamberi e Zucchine-Homemade pasta with prawns, courgettes, chilli and tomato sauce.<br>-Tiramisu<br><br>I had the pasta with sausage and it was excellent, as was my wife&#39;s prawn pasta.  The tiramisu was a very good one.  After settling up our inexpensive bill, we were offered comp limoncellos, grappa or sambuca.  We passed, though that is a nice touch.  <br><br>I also got to work on my improving grasp of the Italian language with the staff and left feeling fairly confident that I could have done it all in Italian, if necessary.  <br><br>Pleasant service, cozy setting and a delectable menu that&#39;s well priced.  We&#39;ll be back and often.",

"reviewcomment":"Absolutely faultless.<br><br>We were having the pre-theatre menu which at just £15 is a bargain.  Despite drinking only tap water and ordering the cheapest food on the menu, we still felt like we were treated like royalty.  The waiting staff could not have been any slicker, more polite or better turned out if they&#39;d tried.  It was an absolutely polished affair of which the manager should be very, very proud.<br><br>The food too was great; some of the freshest, most fantastic food I&#39;ve eaten anywhere, ever.  This restaurant blows the socks off some of the finest restaurants in London I&#39;ve been lucky enough to eat in.<br><br>Finally the restaurant itself is beautiful; lots of quirky design features mixed with cool, minimalist Turkish features.<br><br>To me this place is about as good as a restaurant can get - I will 100% be returning.",

"reviewcomment":"To step in to this place is to walk into a wonderful, olde worlde little cavern of bronze coloured walls ,wooden benches, oil filled lanterns amidst several beautiful paintings depicting 17th century ishafan landscapes. <br>You can imagine 17th century ottoman knights visiting such a place at the end of a hard days battle and resting their trusty shields and swords on the heavy duty wooden tables before sinking their teeth into the meats on offer here.<br>I have been visiting this hidden gem for 5 years now and nothing ever changes.<br>Reading some of the reviews of Patogh on here it is to the credit of us as discerning consumers that at a time of national calamity  our economy in ruins, half the population in negative equity and the other half on Facebook,our youth rioting and lying drunk in the gutters, and our elderly lookig for a salubrious gutter in which to reside, it is to the credit of our spirit as a nation of restaraunt goers that at such a time so many on here can find the energy to complain the food was great but the waiters didnt tallk to me!<br>Such people miss the essence of this place. There is only 1 waiter , there are 2 elderly cooks, making food iwith meticulous care and pride in a open plan kitchen/counter area the size of the average suburban semi detached living room with seating for ten downstairs and the same upstairs. Yet despite this the food and premises are unscropously hygienic and fresh and the food amongst the best value in the West End.<br>The menu has not changed in the time i have been going there, service is always very fast, it can be difficult to get tables at peak times, and when u do u will be served your food fresh off the grill within 6-7 minutes and will probably have eaten it and left within 25 minutes. But you will be rewarded with the biggest nan bread in london quaintly listed on the menu as big bread, glazed with olive oil and encrusted with sesame seeds , or alternatively saffron rice and a choice of either chicken or lamb minced meat skewers, or baby chicken., the adventurous u can buy a side of grilled chillies or okra.and that is basically the food menu! For drinks there is pepsi/fanta/water and a drink called Dog which is a refreshing yoghurt and coriander beverage.<br>Prices for either rice or one of these huge breads with your meat of choice is an incredible £6! Your salad will be freshly cut and consist of baked tomato, onions,cabbage,mint,green chillie,lemon,and radishes. Dont be misled by others descriptions, to sit in this place for even 5 minutes is to be taken to another world, perhaps a small downtown iranian cafe off the beaten track with its wooden bench tables and quite ambience. And for the record, the 2 cooks always say hello and goodbye! Just understand the culture.. this is a persian joint run by 2 older gentleman who are cooking non stop yet go about it so quietly and calmly! It isnt suitable for tuxedoed partygoers looking for a long raucous night out, and isnt suitable for screaming kids and pushchair toting bingo winged soccer moms.<br>For perhaps a couple or a party of 3-4 connosseurs seeking a quick teleportation into a far away land and its delicious street cuisine try Patogh! If you want a more extensive selection of Iranian food and the full night out dining experience try one of the iranians on edgeware road.",

"reviewcomment":"I asked my hotel manager for a casual place to eat that was not a chain thinking he was going to tell me to go to Mc Donalds.  Well...he told me to go to Pret a Manger ...while is a chain...he said there food is very good and they give anything they don&#39;t sell at the end of the day to the homeless...sounds cool.<br><br>You go in and there are open refrigerators that have all different kinds of sandwiches mostly baguette. At lunch, they have hot wraps too.  You bring your selection to the counter where you can also purchase soup, coffee, or tea.  They have a take away and eat in price.  The price to take it away is about 50 pence less per item than eating in.   Genius!!   I never had to find a table even during the busy lunch hour...<br><br>I had the Thai Chili Chicken which was delish...  It&#39;s like chicken salad with Sweet Thai Chili sauce.  The baguette that the chicken is housed in is VERY fresh and with a slight crisp outside.  It really reminded me of a Banh Mi.  The price was under 3 pounds.  <br><br>They also make yummy breakfast baguettes.  I had the egg and bacon.  And the egg is basically egg salad.  Thought that was weird but it tasted pretty good.   One morning I did stop in hoping to grab some lunch stuff for an all day bus tour but they don&#39;t sell the lunch till later...<br><br>A few days into my London trip, and I realize this place is like Starbucks is to Seattle.  You will not have trouble finding one or several in close proximity. <br><br>They are all about using local in season ingredients, they donate to the homeless and they are OCD about recycling (will see signs on the wall everywhere).  Really wish there was one of these in the US.  Highly recommend!!  Well ..not really because you&#39;ll probably end up there anyways...lol.",

"reviewcomment":"Make your reservation for Dinings now! This small, Japanese restaurant in Marylebone can be completely booked even a week in advance if not more. We tried our luck with the waitlist, and I was so happy to hear there was an open table during the first seating! <br><br>The menu at Dinings changes, so your favourites may not be available at the next visit. However, this could just be an excuse to try everything now!<br><br>My recommendations:<br>- Toro fatty tuna w/ wasabi<br>- Tempura zucchini flowers<br>- Grilled chili garlic black cod<br>- Tempura strawberries w/ balsamic ice cream<br><br>The grilled chili garlic black cod is amazing, and hands-down my favourite dish from that night. The meat easily flakes off the skin, and the light chili sauce complements the fish perfectly. <br><br>The special open sushi roll &#34;Capricciosa&#34; is also a really fun dish. You don&#39;t really know what you&#39;ll be getting as the chef selects the fish to top your rolls. Each one is different and some were pretty extravagantly decked out. <br><br>You really can&#39;t go wrong with Dinings. The service is great, the sashimi is so fresh, and the combination of flavours are amazing. Make sure to check out their hand-written specials menu too!",

"reviewcomment":"STOP.<br><br>Do you know how good cornmeal crust pizza is? <br><br>I&#39;m lactose intolerant, so pizza might seem out of the question. But it turns out I still love pizza, without the cheese! This place earned a star before I even walked in the door by promptly and politely replying in the affirmative when I emailed to ask if their crust is lactose-free and if they have lactose-free topping combination options. So all was set for a delicious visit!<br><br>When myself and two friends arrived, we were greeted politely and seated immediately. My friends shared a whole pizza with two topping combinations and cheese, while I tried three slices (pizza here is served by the slice because there are so many topping combinations to try so it&#39;s best to mix and match.) I had:<br>-artichoke and spinach<br>-pepperoni, mushroom, and jalapeño<br>-pulled pork and slaw<br><br>All were awesome without the cheese. We also ordered a salad to share as a table. All the salads on offer had cheese in them, so the kitchen created a salad for us that wasn&#39;t on the menu:<br>-mixed greens salad with roasted apple, pear, and onion<br><br>It was delicious, and a perfect accompaniment to the pizza. Otto&#39;s willingness to create this salad for us really showed me they&#39;re able to go the extra mile in terms of service and accommodation of food allergies. They also have gluten free pizza crust, and a vegan cheese made from cashews (though I&#39;m allergic to those too, so I didn&#39;t try it!) <br><br>To top it all off, I had a fantastic floral IPA, which paired perfectly with the meal. There&#39;s a small but good beer selection here, which rotates regularly.<br><br>For the three of us, dinner came to just over £45. <br><br>Altogether, a delicious dinner, and very friendly service too!",

For just 20 pounds you will have a WHOLE lobster with fries and salad. The lobster was pretty big and it was worth waiting for it I must say. When we arrived, they said to us that we have to wait about 1 hours due to it was so incredible busy. We waited at the bar and luckily we can already sit at our table after waiting 15 minutes!<br><br>They also have a great lobster menu or you can even order bigger lobsters as well! I haven&#39;t tried the burger, but it looked sooo good as well!<br><br>I recommend you to go after peak hours to prevent you to wait so long, but definitely try the lobster!<br><br>Next time when I am in London I definitely will come back!",

My strict veggie friend recommended this place for after-theatre dinner and I have to say I was blown away by the food even though I am usually strictly NOT vegetarian. I liked the room too, friendly and smart without being too formal, looks more like a bistro really. Have the starter meze for two; it&#39;s a great way to try lots of the starters, though for some reason they wouldn&#39;t let us have a bigger one for 3 of us. For the mains we had a Thai curry, mushroom risotto cake (much more interesting and tasty than it sounds) and a root vegetable bake, all excellent. They have a very good wine list too. Very highly recommended.",

"reviewcomment":"Andrew Edmunds is a quaint European restaurant in SoHo in London. I had heard of Andrew Edmunds from friends before and it is quite highly rated on Zagat so decided to book dinner for a friend that had just moved to London that evening. When we arrived at Andrew Edmunds, we were surprised to see that the restaurant is around 8 tables or so that are closely packed (reminded me quite a lot of a small restaurant in Southern France). The decor is quite romantic with used wine bottles corked with candles burning on the table, a chalk board with up to date wine specials, and a handwritten menu. The wine list is phenomenal - they source their wine list from high-end retailers in London and buy the last few bottles of a bin at a significant discount. They truly pass along the discount to the costumer - bottles begin around £18 for their house red Corbieres and upward to hundreds of pounds for known vintages of French, Italian, Spanish, Australian, and Napa/Sonoma wines. The menu is filled with classically French and British dishes that are simple but well crafted. We decided on the winter stew, lemon sole, and lentil and aubergine for the three mains, along with the charcuterie for an appetizer, and the cheese plate for dessert. The Corbieres was splendid (and reasonably priced) and the mains were surprising great (plus, the price point was from £12.50 for the lentils to £22 for the sole, so quite reasonable for SoHo). The cheese dish was sourced from local farms outside of London and was one of the nicest cheese plates I have had in a long time. As an aside, Andrew Edmunds does not do online reservations and does not accept them more than a week in advance. Calling for reservations 3 or more days in advance is quite recommended in order to get a spot (especially for the weekends). The staff were attentive and helpful in selecting a dish, but were also not too hovering, so we felt we could sit for as long after our meal as we wished. The dishes were also well-timed, so courses did not overlap. Overall, Andrew Edmunds was a splendid restaurant. If you are looking for a higher end French/European restaurant to take a date or to catch up with good friends, Andrew Edmunds is a great choice.",

"reviewcomment":"Having lived in the West Kensington/Barons Court area for the last 18 months, it&#39;s kind of telling that I have very few regular eating haunts here.  Either I&#39;ll head eastwrds or I&#39;ll order in from Holy Cow.  Nevertheless, it still has a handful of quality establishments, one of which is Taiwan Village.  Located at the intersection of North End Road and Lillie Road (close to West Brompton Tube, and accessible on the 74/190/430 and 28/391 buses), Taiwan Village sits unassumingly, just opposite the restaurant which used to specialise in Indian and Chinese cuisine (yep, headscratcher that one).<br><br>The interior is small but very nicely furnished, and it&#39;s great for a slightly more intimate meal.  On top of this, the staff (mostly from Burma) are all extra friendly and helpful.  The menu is a mix of Taiwanese, Hunan, and Szechuan cuisine (the chef is Taiwanese), so it&#39;s a bit different from your usual HK-style fare, and also features a lot of chilli.  One thing I do like about this place is that you can ask them to cook a mystery meal for you for a fixed price (can&#39;t remember how much exactly, but it&#39;s maybe a bit less than £25?) which will invariably offer several things that you wouldn&#39;t usually order.<br><br>As far as individual dishes go, I really like the hot and sour soup - I&#39;m on an eternal quest to find the perfect one, and this one is as good as any I&#39;ve tried in London.  They also do some awesome ribs in a fruity, vinegary, spicy sauce.  The French beans fried in a chew yim-esque way are great too.<br><br>Ultimately, this is definitely one of my favourite Chinese restaurants in London.  Whilst the menu may not be as extensive as places such as Bar Shu, it&#39;s much more affordable, and the setting is much more intimate than pretty much any other I can think of - so if you want a quiet couples dinner, this is perfect.  I have been the only customer here at times and I&#39;m a little afraid it might move (although it&#39;s been around for quite a while), given its less-than-obvious location, so I implore you to go and eat!",

"reviewcomment":"Definitely one of the best Italian restaurants in London. While I was visiting my dear friend in London, she and her boyfriend took me to this, supposedly, one of Victoria Beckham&#39;s favorite restaurants. The decor was very classy and staff was very pleasant. <br><br>Our waiter brought a bread box and a mini-pizza plate with smile in the beginning. There were many different kind of bread in the box, and I had to try all the bread and rolls. They were delicious, but I had to stop as I didn&#39;t want to be full before ordering a real meal. We ordered a bottle of wine and several appetizers. We ordered Octopus Carpaccio, Salad, and Tomato soup (can&#39;t remember the name). I also had to order Watermelon martini since it was special on that day and looked very cute. It was very delicious.<br><br>We ordered Seafood pasta, Seafood risotto, Chicken dish (again, can&#39;t remember the names of the dishes...). The waiter explained about each dish with Italian accent (cute!). The foods were just delicious. We were really enjoying our conversation during dinner, and the waiter commented that we seemed very happy people with the accent (I guess I just loved the Italian accent). <br><br>We then had Tiramisu, gelato, Chocolate tart, and cream crape with another baked custard on top ( Can&#39;t remember the name...I&#39;m so bad...). We also had cappuccino that was just perfect. The waiter brought a pastry plate along with all the desserts we ordered, and our table was full of sweets that made me very happy. <br><br>We stayed for like two hours to finish all the food, and all this time, everyone here, the waiter, the sommelier, and the dessert guy (there was another waiter brought the dessert plate to show us Dolci of that day) were very pleasant. <br><br>I will be visiting London again soon, and I would definitely like to come back here again.",

"reviewcomment":"Galvin at Windows, featuring head chef Joo Won, is a gorgeous Michelin-starred restaurant overlooking Hyde Park in the London Hilton at Park Lane. The staff is knowledgeable, friendly, and even playful for such a usually serious atmosphere. One of our servers was a bit overbearing, but she lightened up by the end.<br><br>We were lucky enough to get a reservation right by the windows! I wish we came during a greener season, but the view was still beautiful.<br><br>We had their set lunch menu with a starter, main course, and dessert. Fortunately, there were 5 of us, so we had a great family-style tasting of each dish.<br><br>One of the starters, seared scallop with caviar had a rich, buttery foam and could have passed for an entree. It was so great. The smoked haddock fritters, Moroccan couscous &amp; lemon yogurt were my second favorite starter.<br><br>My risotto was a bit too rich/creamy for my taste, but a side of their seasoned carrots and lightly dressed salad really evened things out.<br><br>I highly recommend this place -- the set menu is delicious and does not require you to put out a lot of money for what you get. Yum! They even gave us postcards to send to our friends/family, and sent them off for us!",

"reviewcomment":"Quite the lovely Italian restaurant located in Notting Hill. I came here with a friend based on his recommendation. We arrived on a weeknight around 8PM and the restaurant was completely full. Luckily we made reservations and got a nice little table for two downstairs.<br><br>So... the bread. Holy crap, it&#39;s absolutely amazing. I had to restrain myself from eating too much. My friend even asked for a second basket. Slightly toasted on the outside with a soft middle. Dip those babies in olive oil and balsamic vinegar and you&#39;ve got yourself a appetizing treat, as well as a fully blown carbo loaded meal. <br><br>I ordered the Tagliolini con Gamberetti, Zucchine, Prosciutto Crudo e Pachino (Hand-made Tagliolini with Shrimps, Courgettes ,Parma ham and cherry tomatoes) and loved it. I hate to admit it, but I ate the entire thing in one sitting. *sigh*<br><br>Kudos to my friend for a picking a superb Italian restaurant! Great food, wonderful atmosphere, and bread that is to die for!",

A Belgian beer bar in London, YES! <br><br>Fantastic selection of beer and the owner was nice enough to stop and chat with us despite the night coming to an end.

No worries, that just gives us an excuse to revisit the Dovetail. <br><br>All in all, this is a great place. Nothing pretentious about it but at the same time the atmosphere is cozy.

"reviewcomment":"Moro is one of those places I&#39;ve wanted to eat at for ages but haven&#39;t because I don&#39;t like having to reserve ages in advance so fortunately we were able to get a table for 9pm on a Friday evening with only a few days notice.<br><br>It was great. Inside it&#39;s buzzing with a simple, open layout and open kitchen at the end. A long bar extends the entire length of the restaurant (taps menu only available at the bar).<br><br>Ordered the mushrooms on toast for starter which was excellent. Simple and with balanced flavours. They could have given the dish a fancy name with some unfamiliar funghi name on  char grilled crispy sourdough bread with olive oil from some single estate in Spain (which it all may well have been) but credit to them that they just called it &#39;mushrooms on toast&#39;. Sometimes pretentious menu descriptions fail to deliver when the actual dish shows up but in this case it was the other way round.<br><br>For mains I ordered chargrilled lamb with rice and some beetroot based sauce. That wasn&#39;t the actual menu description but just my memory of what I ate. The waitress mentioned the lamb would be served pink and was that OK. Yes, no problem. This dish was just delicious. A generous serving of yes, very pink lamb slices on a bed of rice and some other grains which had been slow cooked with spices and something else which just made it great and a cold beetroot based  sauce over the top. Back to the lamb. It wasn&#39;t rare in the normal sense yet tender and flavourful. Perhaps it was cooked sous vide and then finished on the chargrill....However they did it, it was just excellent.<br><br>For desert I opted for the Malaga raisin ice cream. So simple again and so good. What made it was the glass of sherry poured over with some giant raisins which may also have been sherry soaked. Yum.<br><br>Service was efficient and food arrived pronto, yet no feeling of time pressure at all even though tables were turning around us with only minutes between the next diners being seated.<br><br>I&#39;m looking forward to going back.",

"reviewcomment":"Bone Daddies is the only good place I hear about when it comes to ramen. So I finally made it on a Sunday for lunch, and I was quite happy to find there was no line. It&#39;s a casual interior with high tables and chairs. We were a group of 4 so the corner tables work best, otherwise sitting in a row would have been too difficult to chat. <br>They had plastic Japanese smocks which I absolutely loved; I instantly put it on and kept it afterwards. <br>For appetisers the croquettes are must-have (I liked them better than the fried chicken). Never had anything so good outside of Italy! For ramen I went for the tonkotsu ramen. I appreciated that the serving was so big but I thought the ramen noodle itself was too thin, and the soup was a bit too thick, but it did taste good especially with the egg. Each table has a container of garlic, a garlic crusher, and a sesame vial, which all I definitely took advantage of. <br>Overall I really enjoyed Bone Daddies: good setting, good food and good service!",

"reviewcomment":"Make your reservation for Dinings now! This small, Japanese restaurant in Marylebone can be completely booked even a week in advance if not more. We tried our luck with the waitlist, and I was so happy to hear there was an open table during the first seating! <br><br>The menu at Dinings changes, so your favourites may not be available at the next visit. However, this could just be an excuse to try everything now!<br><br>My recommendations:<br>- Toro fatty tuna w/ wasabi<br>- Tempura zucchini flowers<br>- Grilled chili garlic black cod<br>- Tempura strawberries w/ balsamic ice cream<br><br>The grilled chili garlic black cod is amazing, and hands-down my favourite dish from that night. The meat easily flakes off the skin, and the light chili sauce complements the fish perfectly. <br><br>The special open sushi roll &#34;Capricciosa&#34; is also a really fun dish. You don&#39;t really know what you&#39;ll be getting as the chef selects the fish to top your rolls. Each one is different and some were pretty extravagantly decked out. <br><br>You really can&#39;t go wrong with Dinings. The service is great, the sashimi is so fresh, and the combination of flavours are amazing. Make sure to check out their hand-written specials menu too!",

"reviewcomment":"A simple no fuss Japanese restaurant.  There is nothing  I could fault about the food in this place. I couldn&#39;t give it 5 stars because it was just simple Japanese comfort food, nothing out of ex-ordinary and all the usual Japanese dishes I could get in any other Japanese restaurant. Tokyo Diner focuses really mainly on one plate dishes like donburi and also their famous big portion bento boxes. There are also sushi platters but it just does not have a large a la carte menu. It&#39;s a place for a quick fulfilling dinner if you don&#39;t fancy Chinese in China town. <br>I do love it&#39;s concept of &#39;No Tipping&#39;. With its free tea, Japanese crackers and no service charge it felt like a Japanese Wong Kei&#39;s with better service and better food. Portions were just as big though with free refills of rice for those extra hungry ones. Awesome.<br>We started with starters of agedashi tofu, spinach goma, miso soup and pickles. The tofu was average, not the most silky I&#39;ve had but still very satisfying in a very well made dashi sauce. Spinach goma stood out the most although I wish they let it warm up a bit rather than it come out straight out the fridge, Still I love the nutty sesame sauce that made this dish so moorish. It tasted just like peanut butter but sweetened and gave the dish a slight sticky texture. It no longer felt healthy but indulgent instead. Wasn&#39;t a fan of the plum pickle that was too sour but the rest was fine.<br>My main of pork katsu was massive with a lovely marinated leaf salad on the side. It was one of the better ones I&#39;ve had with next chunky soft carrots and potatoes in the curry which was perfectly seasoned and flavoured, not too sweet or salty. The katsu was perfectly fried, a nice crunchy batter into a thick succulent tender piece of pork. Rice was fluffy and cooked perfectly. A good choice.<br>However weirdly enough I preferred my boyfriend&#39;s tamago don. Something so simple like on egg on rice was so good and comforting. Where my katsu curry cooled down very quickly my boyfriend&#39;s dish remained hot throughout due to the egg acting like a blanket. It was soft, mouthmetling and cooked in a dashi stock that wrapped it in a nice savoury flavour. Together with the al dente sticky rice it was just the perfect combination. <br>We also shared a zaru soba which was faultless again. A nice portion, noodles cooked as they should and sauce flavoured well. <br>The most disappointed part was our cold sake which tasted like they had watered it down. Still it did not effect our overall opinion of the place as we were very satisfied with meal. <br>I do love this place and will probably return very soon. The automatic push button door was a nice touch as it made my boyfriend feel nostalgic about his holiday memories in Japan as apparently those doors were common over there. Also that and the light wooden tables, Japanese staff, a large map of Japan and the rest of the decor. With that in mind and the cheap generous prices do prepare to queue or get there a bit early.",

I sure haven&#39;t. It&#39;s really good value, a meal box for £6 and you can have 2 fillings if you like or just load up on that lovely cochinita pibil, or 3 tacos I believe for the same price. Very filling but definitely savour it because you&#39;ll probably want more :) I can&#39;t stop thinking about it!

"reviewcomment":"So a few nights ago my friends and I were walking through the streets of South Kensington looking for a late night dinner, and where do you think we ended up? You probably guessed it--Jak&#39;s. The waiter nicely set up a table for us in the back so that we could have a private room. He made us feel like we were dukes and duchesses. And he was a riot, making sure we had smiles on our faces the entire time. <br><br>To order at this unique establishment of Mediterranean persuasion, you go to the counter and pick a main dish and two sides (or, you can order five sides; that&#39;s a whole lotta sides). I went for the mushroom and vegetable and goat cheese quiche paired with beets and mushrooms. Yum, they were phenomenal. Better ingredients, better food, Papa Jak&#39;s.",

The white bread of the barbecue pork bun was soft and light. <br>Even though the prices are exorbitant because you can pay 1/4 of the price for the same quality in China, in London this will the best it gets for quality dim-sum along with a great atmosphere.",

"reviewcomment":"Again, this review is just for the downstairs bar. <br><br>Atmosphere:<br><br>Almost indescribably chill vibe. As you walk in you&#39;re greeted by the sight of 5-6 really comfy couches, really chill music in the background, and anime being screened on one of the walls. Though we went at 2030 on a Friday, there were maybe 2 other groups, and 5 of us were able to get a seat. There&#39;s just something about the bar that makes it feel like you&#39;re in a secret spot that no one else knows about.<br><br>Drinks:<br><br>Pretty decent selection. 4 types of sake, 3 types of shochu, and around 12 sake and shochu based cocktails. Beyond that there&#39;s the usual selection of liquor you&#39;d expect to find in a bar. Prices are really reasonable too! They have Asahi on tap for £4, and the house sake starts at £4 as well. I only tried the 2 types of sake that the bartender said were slightly sweeter, but really enjoyed both (though I wish they had a larger selection).<br><br>post-10pm:<br><br>Around 2145 we contemplated moving somewhere else as the vibe was almost too chill for a Friday. However at 10 the staff informed us that they had to move all the furniture out of the way. So they cleared the floor, a dj showed up, the music went up just a tiny bit and from being a quiet spot, by around 2230 there were probably 40 people there. <br><br>It has to be said that I still left at 2300 but it really was the perfect place to start the night. Food wise I only tried the edamame which was good but after reading the reviews i&#39;ll be sure to try other nibbles as well next time.",

Supposedly, this was the only healthy food the friend would eat. Says a lot, right?<br><br>We rounded the corner and I spotted *beetroot* and *carob &amp; ginger* cubes! My taste buds are salivating and I&#39;m looking around noticing all the brightly colored food. I may have been bouncing with foodcitement. My friend dryly said &#34;this is it&#34;. <br><br>I was only in a snacking mood, so I ordered their raw food sweets. They were £1 each and I tried the carob &amp; ginger and beetroot with dates, almond, and fennel. The beetroot cube was the revelation. It actually made a worker behind the next counter stop and ask me what it was. The carob &amp; ginger was good, but since I&#39;m a ginger fanatic, I was hoping for more. It lacked the sweet or spicy bite I yearn for.<br><br>Regardless, this is a must go to destination. I hope to go next Sunday with an appetite for a roti wrap or rainforest box. Yum!",

"reviewcomment":"Ah, a small restaurant where the staff to table ratio is 1:1. This ratio is something you NEVER see in the UK. The restaurant is small (8 counter stools, 1 three-person table, and 2 two-person tables). Booking a reservation is a must. I was able to get an 8pm reservation on a Friday night by calling at 2:20pm the same day. I was shocked they could accommodate my request.<br><br>The food was good. I think I would rate the spicy tuna inside out roll at Whole Foods a bit higher but overall, the food here is great and the house white wine wasn&#39;t too shabby either.",

"reviewcomment":"Food is no-frills Italian fare, served up with a warm smile and hot from the kitchen located at the heart of this small restaurant where you can watch your server running in and out and helping to happily prepare your food.<br><br>The minute I walked through the door, I had a feeling of familiarity and comfort like going to a place where they know you and treat you like family. And with that family environment in mind, this place does not worry about primping their food or table setting - There are no trendy spins on recipes, no hip interior décor or polished wait staff - This is simple, honest Italian food and friendly service.<br><br>What I tried: Insalata Tricolore, Bruchetta, Garlic Bread, Spaghetti Bolognese, Lasagna Della Casa (my husband ordered the lasagna and I had a bite - wowie I&#39;d order this next time!) and a couple bottles of Chianti. I can&#39;t say this is the best Italian food I&#39;ve ever had, but it&#39;s one of the best food experiences in London for a taste from Nonni&#39;s kitchen (or Nonno/Pappi in this case, since there are only blokes running the place from what I could see). Go and enjoy - Buon appetito!",

My bad. <br><br>Our friendly server recommended the haddock and cod. The women working here are awesome. Efficient and willing to cover each other to meet needs of the dining area. Genuinely smiling and hospitable. <br><br>Fish was hot and crispy and once I squeezed the lemon wedge across the fish, our family dove right in. Mushy peas and gravy seemed to be a traditional favorite here so I jumped on that band wagon and added it to our Friday Fish Fry. I loved dipping my chips in the gravy which was thick and savory. <br><br>Great place for the best fish and chips in London, if you are like me checking off a foodie list.",

"reviewcomment":"Found this as #1 on the top five burritos of London, so I just had to give it try!<br><br>The line, for some, seems quite overwhelming during lunch time, but that is what is so fantastic about this food stand -- they provide fast, efficient, and great service, you just have to be prepared with your request as they go quickly!<br><br>I went with the fajita burrito which has peppers and onions instead of the black beans. My choice of meat was chicken, and I added sour cream, guacamole, and cheese to accompany the coriander-lime rice and veggies already included.  In my opinion, first the meat has got to be delicious, and the chicken was fantastic. But, what sets burritos apart are the veggies and optional additions -- daddy donkey has fab veggies -- cooked and prepared to the T.<br><br>All in all a fantastic spot for lunch, and place to satisfy your burrito craving!

But you can grab a drink at the bar whilst you wait for your table (45 min for us, bit longer than we&#39;d have liked, hence the loss of a star).<br><br>Anyway, the staff were a friendly bunch (even enduring my friend&#39;s attempt at speaking Spanish to them - cringey). We each ordered three dishes from the menu, there was plenty to choose from, but we stuck to the less than £8 dishes (some were upwards of £20 each).<br><br>It started arriving in waves - my favourite format for being fed - and each and every one of those dishes was utterly delicious, a mouth-watering welcoming assault on the tastebuds.<br><br>The two bottles of Rioja Zarabanda were also enjoyed (they were about £20 each).<br><br>So all in all, a relatively expensive meal for a northerner, but it was totally worth the money, it just needs to be a bigger restaurant to seat more people quicker!",

The sandwiches are pretty expensive, mine was £4.75, but believe me you get such a huge sandwich for the money, when I went to eat it, I picked it up and it was surprising how much food it was!<br><br> I got the Tricolore sangwich, which has mozzarella, basil pesto, tomatoes, avocado (they didn&#39;t have any fresh avocado at the time, but they had guacamole which is even better to me), salad, and sundried tomato, all in a nice grilled ciabatta. It was so tasty and I couldn&#39;t even finish it because of how much food it was. The staff was very friendly and helpful. There was pretty much no one at the shop at the time, so the service was relatively quick considering they put the sandwich together right there.<br><br> While a bit more expensive than a poor student would like to pay, I&#39;ll definitely come back to indulge again! :)",

"reviewcomment":"God I&#39;m confused. I thought this was part of the same chain that does Powder Keg Diplomacy but it turns out it&#39;s actually the one which does the Lost Society (makes more sense, name-wise), to which I *originally* thought PKD was the sister bar.  What I have learnt from visiting all three is that they&#39;re marvellous but PKD has nothing to do with any of them.  Sorry for leading you up the garden path.<br><br>That said, PKD and Lost Angel do actually bear some similarities: the cocktails are excellent, the bar staff are hipsterrific in the nicest possible way, and the interior is eccentric and comfy, albeit here slightly less bonkers than at the Powder Keg.  The space at Lost Angel is far larger, with an array of thoughtfully-placed seating (take note, Sloaney Pony) including wonderfully squashy sofas.  The ladies loos are actually gorgeous: up a flight of stairs and straight into the sink area.  I felt like I was in an upmarket, boutique hotel (with gothic undertones).<br><br>Mostly, though, the reason you want to pay the Lost Angel a visit is for the cocktails.  I was cycling past on my merry way, frozen to the bone and wondering where to while away the next hour until I was due to meet friends, when a sign outside urging me to pop indoors and try their fabulous mulled cider sent me screeching to a halt and almost into a bin.  I thought: &#34;These guys are related to Powder Keg Diplomacy! [NB see above: not true]  Their mulled cider is bound to be EXCELLENT&#34;.  It seemed as good a location as any, although as I bounded inside at 2:30pm and realised that it was entirely empty, I reconsidered.  Happily they assured me that they were in fact open, turned on the music and knocked me up the aforementioned mulled cider.  I love winter*: it&#39;s perfectly acceptable to fall off the wagon in the early afternoon, so long as your choice of booze has the word &#34;mulled&#34; in the title.  And it was bloody lovely; perhaps too sweet for some but not for me, and the sourness of the apple pushed through which balanced it out perfectly.  It was spiced and buttery and ooooh it warmed me right up.<br><br>And then because card payments required a minimum £10 spend it seemed sensible to start a tab (SENSIBLE) so I had to buy another cocktail (HAD TO) and one of the delightful barmen pulled up a pew next to me and asked what I liked to drink.  Admittedly he had very little else to do (I was still the only person there) but I really appreciated him taking the time to find out about my tastes and personally recommend a cocktail.  I went for something gin-based and spicy and when he came over to check how I was enjoying it, I felt ever so smug because I&#39;d detected cardamom amongst the delicate flavours and he was able to explain how they muddled it with the gin and I nodded along sagely as if I were fully aware of what &#34;muddling&#34; meant when I&#39;m not, really, it all just looks like stirring to me.  And then he got really excited about the gin and brought me over a taster and he was right, it was delicious, and we bonded.<br><br>And then it turned out that there was a 10% discount for checking in on Yelp (score!) and when I went to pay, I got the bill and it was just £9 total because he&#39;d rung up the cocktails at £5 each.  And I was all &#34;is this guy flirting with me? Oh, you&#34; and scrabbled around in my purse for change but luckily had the cash, and went and told everybody (including my boyfriend) that I&#39;d been undercharged because the barman fancied me and I knew all about mother&#39;s ruin and we had coquettishly bantered on the sofa, but then I looked on the website and it turns out that happy hour on Saturday is 12-7pm and all cocktails are £5.  That is SO CHEAP and doesn&#39;t even require flirting or a knowledge of gin!  Score.  So I felt a bit silly, but not so silly that I won&#39;t go back, and also grateful because it means I can do so on a Saturday afternoon with the boyfriend in tow and still get a cocktail for £5.  This place is amazing.  I can&#39;t wait to see what it&#39;s like with people in it.<br><br>* That said, I recently ordered a beer on a boat in Vietnam at 11am with an early lunch and my multinational table neighbours were astonished that I was drinking so early to which my responses included &#34;It&#39;s socially acceptable to have a beer at lunchtime&#34; and &#34;I&#39;m on holiday&#34; and &#34;I&#39;m British&#34; so perhaps the season is irrelevant.",

Their cheesecake is a beauty and is always delicious. <br><br>However, the creme de la creme for me is the Red Velvet Cake/ Cupcakes! My mouth is watering just thinking about it, it literally melts in your mouth.. a must try for red velvet fans! <br><br>All of their items are at a great price and size.

"reviewcomment":"I think this is by far one of my favorite restaurants in 2012.<br>The food: AMAZING!!! Highly recommend their Steak and Mushroom pie (see photo). The pie is just thin enough to get that buttery taste and the cruchness, but not too much to feel that&#39;s all you are getting of the pie; the sauce is rich and creamy; the steak is so tender and soft that they almost melt in your mouth... <br>I think it&#39;s one of The Best I have ever had, it is certainly to die for. All the other food are very good quality too (i.e. the Tuna starter - who says you can&#39;t get fresh sea food in London?)<br>The atmosphere: I have been here during lunch as well as dinner, both occasions it was busy but not TOO busy allowing you to fully enjoy the atmosphere and the food. The decoration of the restaurant gives a clean nice vintage feel, mixing it with the traditional British cuisine.<br>Price: considering it is in the middle of Mayfair and the quality of the restaurant, the price is very reasonable! The main courses are in average £10-15. If you order a main and a drink only, you can easily walk out with just paying £15 (say you order the pie and a soft drink) <br>The staff are young and trendy (and incidentally good looking!) but also friendly and attentive.<br><br>Try this place guys!

I&#39;ve eaten dinner (tapas) at the bar. I loved it and hope to be back soon.<br><br>If you&#39;re sick of another bottle of forgettable wine at a pub, then you&#39;ll really appreciate Portal. I enjoyed several of their reds. Normally I go for Duoro wine at a Portuguese place, but here the waiter suggested some other options which were even better!<br><br>Some of my favorite dishes were the selection of olives, squid tomato, and of course the padron peppers.<br><br>Gluten-free notes: They were able to tell me what was off limits and I could eat tons of dishes on the menu!",

"reviewcomment":"You know those restaurants where you have to choose quality over price or price over quality??? Well NOT @ Meze Mangal !!!<br><br>Due to its high quality of freshly prepared Turkish food and an amazing value for money people are ready to spend half an hour to even an hour queuing for a table :)<br><br>Been there - done that! What strikes you though is that you won&#39;t be just left in a queue looking at other people eat their delicious food! The owner ( who also actively takes part in serving and greeting himself) was thoughtful enough to treat us with free &#39;waiting&#39; starters to which we were also able to order a drink/ wine whilst waiting. <br><br>The place is especially amazing in cold season with its grill in the middle of the room and amazing views of &#39;grilled in front of your eyes&#39; various types of fish and meat ( I can already smell it). <br><br>This restaurant serves freshly baked bread with its mouth watering meze as one of the most popular starters there. You can have as much bread with your meze as you wish without having to pay extra. And it&#39;s right from the oven! Me and my fellow diners there find it addictive. <br><br>Moreover, the portions served ( both for starters and mains) are huge and can be shared ( which most guests do there) so you can order one starter and one main for two people and no one will leave unsatisfied!!<br><br>To my delight they have recently extended the restaurant but I&#39;m sure people still queue all week round. Because it&#39;s worth it!!",

"reviewcomment":"My decision to give this place a 5-star rating stems both from my desperation for Indian food and the fact that Diwana Bhel really is just that good. The bottom line is that my meal was great and that I&#39;m definitely coming back!<br><br>I came for dinner (the place was busy for a Tuesday) and ordered the Rava Deluxe Dosa (basically a Rava Masala Dosa), and I was very happy with it. The sambar was nice and spicy! The two chutneys tasted very fresh. I&#39;ll definitely be back for more.<br><br>One thing I don&#39;t like: you can&#39;t order any appetizers or drinks or chaat unless you&#39;ve ordered them alongside a main dish. As I love to make a meal out of a few appetizers, this annoyed me. I might have ordered some chaat alongside my dosa, but the food would have been too much! A money-making scheme, to be sure. I prefer restaurants to be less in my face about the fact that they&#39;re trying to squeeze as much money out of me as possible.<br><br>Tip: They don&#39;t like to seat you unless your whole party is at the restaurant.",

"reviewcomment":"All I wanted to eat in London was fish and chips and I searched Yelp for &#34;the best&#34; and in between stops at pubs, some rocking fish and chips would surely hit the spot.  We sought out Rock and Sole Plaice and this &#34;no frills&#34; fish and chips place dates back to 1871 and serves fish of your choice fried up with chips and other offered sides if you choose.  Portions are pretty big and cheaper to order to go but given that it was a cold november night, boyfriend and I opted to dine in, ordered a large cod fish and chips to share along with beers and tea for me.  Service was friendly, efficient and unobtrusive. Our cod was fresh and fried perfectly golden and crispy on the outside, moist and flaky on the inside and not too heavy and greasy at all accompanied by lemon and tartar sauce and accompanied chips were tasty as well.  I wanted to try their famed mushy peas but was too full, next time!<br><br>Joanna&#39;s mission to eat some good fish and chips accomplished!",

"reviewcomment":"I&#39;ve eaten on numerous occasions and the food is consistently good and of a pretty high standard. It&#39;s not Barrafina-style tapas, its a bit more traditional but they do like to serve up some interesting fusion places every now and then. That explains why its always packed, despite being in one of the most derelict (yes, you read right) areas of town.<br><br>I recently popped back for dessert after having Chinese at the nearby Silk Road and I was impressed about them accommodating us, despite having eaten our body weight in garlic.<br><br>I&#39;ve never had dessert here before but the Macadamia Nut Cheesecake was out of this world. The cocktails were good, but my friend&#39;s Vale Royal with cardamom and bay leaves certainly wasnt worth its £11 price tag. My Caipirinha was as good as it could get.<br><br>Go, have fun, drink a lot and spend too much for a place in Camberwell. Afterall its now gentrified.",

"reviewcomment":"This is a review of their afternoon tea. I&#39;ve never stayed in the hotel because I live here, but the pictures sure look nice! I&#39;ve had afternoon tea here, twice. If it&#39;s warm out, you&#39;ll want to see if you can sit on the terrace overlooking their garden, because, well, that is awesome. You sit there the whole time thinking, &#34;Wow, it&#39;s warm in London.&#34; If not, they have a lovely indoor dining room. Be sure to call in advance, especially if you&#39;re going there during the weekend, because it often fills up.<br><br>With the afternoon team, do come hungry. (Is that not a classy thing to say?) And be sure to wear something nice -- jeans and a t-shirt will probably make you feel out of place. Then you&#39;ll enjoy the usual assortment of sandwiches (crust cut off!), scones (clotted cream piled on), and mini desserts. Most people end up ordering their house tea, which is very good, and you can also opt to add champagne.<br><br>Gluten-free notes: Yes, they do gluten-free afternoon tea. It&#39;s best to call them in advance and let them know, and confirm that they&#39;ll have scones and sandwiches for you. Then you can eat just like everybody else. Amazing! Clotted cream is naturally gluten-free, by the way. London is great for gluten-free eaters.",
