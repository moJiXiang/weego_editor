There is a lot to take in and enjoy.<br><br>As soon as you get to the place you will notice a lot of crowd even out side as there is a fountain and a place to sink it all in. The huge columns are magnificent and should be admired before you step inside. To step in, well its free! Once you are in the architecture is mind blowing. Picture taking is allowed just keep your belonging close as it will get busy inside.<br><br>I would highly recommend a visit to this place when in Rome.",

"reviewcomment":"Love at first sight- the 12th sight and every single time after!! <br><br>I first saw this monumental landmark  back in 2009.My first trip to Roma and first trip to Colosseo. It was every bit as mind blowing as you&#39;ve pictured and then some. To think this landmark is still standing after almost 2,000 years- how can you not be blown away by it? <br><br>Needless to say I fell in love with this stunning beauty.  I&#39;ve been going back every summer since 2009!!  :)<br><br>Tips<br>My first trip- I went inside with a guided tour. If you are with a tour group, large or small, you skip the lines. Instead of 3 hours, you will spend about an hour. It was overwhelming and hot! ( Roman summers are hot and humid) <br><br>My second trip 2011- I skipped all the tour guides on this trip and had a much more relax and fun time. We walked to Colosseo during the day time for a peak of that beauty. And at night time. No matter how stunning Colosseo maybe during the day time, night time view is the one you want. So majestic with lights all around. It is simply magical. <br><br>After several more trips (last one in 2013)- I&#39;ve discovered a perfect time for daily Colosseo visits. Right before sunset. Colosseo closes at 5 pm. If you come right at 5 pm for a 6 pm sunset: you are set. You will avoid the tour groups/crowds and lines. If you want a perfect sunset pictures inside, come right around 4:30. You can avoid big lines and get right in. They won&#39;t kick you out till 6-6:30 pm. And you can get perfect sunset pictures with stunning lights. <br><br>If you come here after sundown - 9 pm: you will not see any tourists at all. Of course you won&#39;t be able to get inside but you can hang outside. Sit around the benches. You&#39;ll see a lot of Romans (couples, singles) just hanging out as Colosseo stand tall in the background. If you do come in September, bring a light jacket. It gets a little bit cold at night. The walk from via del coros to here will take you about a good 20-25 minutes one way. Overall- a night stroll should take you a good hour or two. And it is time well spent. You can stop at Vittorio Emanuele II and watch those soldiers. Take a long stroll beside the Forums. And get extremely excited as you walk straight down to this beautiful landmark. Doesn&#39;t matter how many times you&#39;ve seen it, it will still take your breath away. I&#39;ve seen it over 3 dozen times in 5 different summers...yet I can&#39;t wait to see it again!!  Absolute must see in Rome- both during the day and at night! Love love love.",

"reviewcomment":"Magnificent.  Being at St. Peter&#39;s was overwhelming.  We arrived early for the Scavi Tour which is a walking, guided tour of the necropolis upon which St. Peter&#39;s was built.  The tour includes a visit to the papal tombs and entry to the basilica.  I plan to take the tour again if ever I am lucky enough to get back to Rome.  It&#39;s not expensive but you will need to request tickets online in advance with the Vatican&#39;s Excavations Office. <br>Our guide was very informative and stayed with us after the tour to answer our questions.  <br>One word of caution, there are no facilities availalbe during the tour.  If you leave any part of the tour, they will not allow re-entry (even if they say they will).",

"reviewcomment":"I&#39;ve seen a lot of fountains, really enjoyed looking at them but never paid much attention to them. This fountain, Forntana di Trevi, however is so vastly different and so striking in every detail that one cannot help but pay attention to it. In fact no trip to Rome would be complete without seeing it as none of the pictures I&#39;ve seen do it any justice; it&#39;s that spectacular. <br><br>When visiting Fortana di Trevi, there is a must do, which is to turn your back on the fountain, take a coin in your right hand and toss it into fountain over your left shoulder....think of the song &#34;Three Coins in a Fountain.&#34; Don&#39;t worry, you won&#39;t be alone as it is estimated that 3,000 Euros a day are tossed into the fountain which are later collected to subsidize food for Rome&#39;s needy.",

"reviewcomment":"Piazza Navona is full of tourists during the holiday season.  The square is converted into a seasonal fair around this time.  Think holiday treats, ornaments, knick-knacks, paintings, street performers and gypsies.  Beware of pick-pockets!  The theme is the Feast of Epiphany and features the Epiphany witch which is a version of Father Christmas in Italy.  <br><br>Piazza Navona has long been a meeting place for all Romans.  There are open-air cafes, restaurants, a museum, and a church that flank this square.  The piazza is home to Bernini&#39;s Fountain of the Four Rivers (1647-1651).  Bernini&#39;s rival Barromini was originally given the commission but it was passed on to Bernini by Pope Innocent X.  The Church of Sant&#39;Agnese in Agone (1670) has a front facade that was designed by Barromini.  The piazza displays the best of Baroque art in all of Rome.  <br><br>Our Contiki group met here before moving on to other destinations within the city.  Since it is located in Central Rome, it&#39;s easy to find on a map and via roads.  The Fountain of the Four Rivers is quite beautiful and the there&#39;s an obelisk that is located nearby.  It&#39;s amazing to see something that has survived several hundred years and probably will continue to survive after we are long gone.  Simply amazing and worth the visit.",

"reviewcomment":"Three words:<br><br>Black. Truffle. Carbonara. <br><br>It was Christmas Eve Day and every spot we had tried to go to in Rome was closed. Low and behold though, like a glorious manger in Bethlehem, Da Francesco was open! <br><br>This is a small neighbourhood friendly spot, made up of both tourists and regulars. We were sat at once and menus placed down, but it didn&#39;t matter, I knew just what I wanted. Carbonara with a black truffle sauce. Oh yes. And it lived up to just what I wanted. The sauce and overwhelming in the best kind of way (if you don&#39;t like black truffle, stay away, as this is filled with it). The pasta hot, fresh, creamy, so good. Just what I wanted. I still wanted it today. <br><br>I wanted a glass of wine but it turns out they only do bottles (and small ones for those drinking by themselves). Oh well, if you insist. <br><br>We watched it get crowded so you may have to come early or wait, but the wait is worth it.

"reviewcomment":"Adore this place! Love this place! Go to this place--especially on Thursday night when there is live jazz, which (when good) easily captures my heart. It&#39;s such a sweet little spot, and even with recommendations from my Roman friends, I&#39;m more pleased with stumbling on this place than with the places the Romans have recommended.<br><br>The bartender and staff are incredibly friendly and hospitable (by far the best I&#39;ve seen in my visit to Rome, but even better than France and NL, where I live or have lived). They are kind, generous, thoughtful--Treating me (a foreigner) just like the others despite my lack of Italian.<br><br>The food is tasty and flavorful. But don&#39;t go just for the food.  Go for the adorable atmosphere. It&#39;s like having friends over to your living room. It&#39;s unpretentious, yet classy. It&#39;s cool and comfortable.  The clientele are mostly late 20/30/40 somethings, and on Thursday night, obviously appreciate jazz. I could stay here all night--(if I had jazz loving friends, but not sure it would be hard to convince with this atmosphere)! But even solo, this is a cool place to be (trying it out tonight!) <br><br>The neighborhood might have some tourist traps scattered about, but this isn&#39;t one of them! I haven&#39;t spotted any other non-Italian speakers and there&#39;s no one heckling you to come in (very good sign!).  <br><br>They have small plates of cold or hot dishes. More like little samplers, which is nice if you&#39;d like to try out a few different dishes. I had the parmigiana and tortino chocolate for dessert (both little plates) but wish I had room for more!  They also have a cocktail menu boasting all the classics.<br><br>If you know a bit of Italian (or can at least understand the written language), ask for the Italian menu.  Otherwise, you&#39;re missing out on some Roman or Italian specialties that are otherwise a mystery when written in English. <br><br>I especially love their antique singer sewing machine DJ table!<br><br>I had a list of other jazz spots and restaurant recommendations for this evening and whatever they are like, I don&#39;t care. I have stumbled upon the sweet spot. And you should too. Get here on Thursday night. You&#39;ll love it!",

It wasn&#39;t as packed as I&#39;d expect, considering the new Pope, but it was certainly busy. The line to enter the Basilica was extremely long, but we were very surprised with how quickly it moved.<br><br>Walking into the Piazza there are massive columns you pass to enter the wide, spread out Piazza. This thing is massive. Immediately I was hit with how impressive it is to be staring out over a place with millions of gathered. <br><br>The entire Piazza is surrounded by the columns and on top of them are awesome sculptures. While in line take the time to check them out. Zoom in with your camera if you have a good zoom and take a look at how extremely detailed the sculptures are - fascinating. <br><br>While the Basilica is the star of the show, the Piazza lives up to what you have always seen on TV.",

The smallish servings means mix and match at least three entrées for two people. Good shrimp dumplings were a nice start. My favorite entree was the Fried Noodles with shrimp and veggies.

I was so lucky that my hotel was literally steps away from this place when I visited Rome in early September. The flavors here are so intense and refreshing, it truly is an amazing concoction. The employees definitely know how to speak English, and will guide you through the flavor chart. I believe they make the gelato right next door/in-house which is wonderful. <br><br>There was lots of chatter about &#34;fake gelato&#34; while I was in Italy - gelato made from powder instead of real ingredients, but I can assure you this place serves REAL GELATO, and it will be the best gelato you have EVER HAD. <br><br>Please please please get the Siciliana flavor which is ricotta with chocolate chips and dried fruit, I wanted more and more and more of this. It&#39;s so refreshing, and light - really an amazing combination!<br><br>I wish I could fly back to Italy just for this...",

We went on a food tour earlier that day and actually found this place on their website, <a href='/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Featingitalyfoodtours.com&amp;s=6901e7cf24bcf9a3e74f6cd948c259d454d27c69dd3604d33d8a80c5db70628a' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>eatingitalyfoodtours.com</a>. I highly recommend taking the tour if you want an off the beaten track foodie experience.<br><br>I suppli can be a little scary if you don&#39;t speak Italian. I just pointed and smiled. Don&#39;t get me wrong, I attempted a little Italian to show respect but, there as no way I could order. We opted for a suppli and slice of marinara, and prosciutto pizza. The slices are sold by weight. The crust was so good, crispy and thin. Much better than the other place in Campo di Fiori that we visited the day prior. Everything was so good, we went back again for more suppli and pizza to bring back to the apartment for later. Both times we spent 5 euros or less. Talk about a deal. <br><br>Go, run, now!",

"reviewcomment":"What a great way to end a perfect holiday trip to the Eternal City. My husband and I dined here December 29, 2013. <br><br>La Terrazza dell&#39;Eden is located on the top floor of Hotel Eden, part of the Dorchester Collection.  It is located two blocks off of the Via Veneto and very easy to find on foot or by taxi.  The restaurant is expertly overseen by Executive Chef Fabio Ciervo, and earned a Michelin star in November 2012.<br><br>The restaurant offers a panoramic view of the city, which is best seen at sunset...needless to say we did not get to enjoy that as it gets dark at 4.30p in Rome in December and our dinner reservation was the earliest seating: 7:30p.  I imagine during the summer months the view is out of this world, because simply viewing the city illuminated in the evening was a treat.<br><br>The service was top of the line - attentive, courteous, helpful, and friendly.  Perhaps our lovely server could have been found to be too talkative to some, but I appreciated his light conversation.<br><br>I was impressed by the wine selection and the sommelier helped us pick a bottle that would accompany our dinner perfectly (tough as we were starting with lobster and ending with lamb - that&#39;s an easy fix: champagne with lobster!).  We did not do the tasting menu as it required the both of us to participate and some of the dishes would not work with my husband&#39;s food allergies.  We shared an antipasta (smoked lobster), a primi (I don&#39;t remember, but I know it was good) and a secondi (lamb shoulder - perfection) and couldn&#39;t have been happier.  What we ate was irrelevant - it all looked fantastic. Again, I must emphasize how great the service was.<br><br>Jackets are required.  And I love that.  I think that enforcing a dress code for a lovely restaurant adds to the evening: &#34;feeling&#34; dressed up is fun and seeing other lovely diners is enjoyable.  <br><br>Terrazza dell&#39;Eden is a *must-do*.",

"reviewcomment":"This is definitely one of the restaurants we always must come to when visiting Rome. We actually went twice the last time we were there, it&#39;s that good. The portions are huge and the service is warm. They have a very nice inside but also offer a lovely outside depending on where you want to eat. They have a giant menu, so there is probably something for everyone if there are some picky eaters among you. One of  my favorite dishes is the steak with tomatoes, it&#39;s seriously up there on the top five things ever eaten. Their pastas are also very good. I love their penne alla vodka, because it&#39;s not overly creamy or rich like you get here in the states, definitely the real thing. But then again it&#39;s Italy so if you can&#39;t get the real thing there than you&#39;re probably out of luck!",

"reviewcomment":"AMAZING. We had to wait for quite a while but it was SO worth it. It&#39;s in a inconspicuous area in the Jewish ghetto and was perfectly roman. We enjoyed an oven roasted artichoke that was to die for, then each had a dish of there home made pastas. I had the fettuccini with pesto and my mother had their ravioli with tomato basil. AMAZING, the scent of the pesto was overwhelming (in a good way) and the pasta... Oh wow. It was the best food since lasagna I had in Bologna (disclaimer: Bologna&#39;s pasta is out of this world). We each had a dessert and honestly, we would skip that and wander to a gelato stand instead. Absolutely go if you&#39;re in Rome",

Everything was fresh and authentic. <br><br>My friends and I avoid tourist restaurants like the plague and we will go out of the way for a good restaurant. We are so glad that we made the trip here. Just get there earlier if you want to beat the dinner rush. It&#39;s pretty small and it gets packed.<br><br>-Fried artichoke: perfectly seasoned with a little salt and not much else. Simple, yet delicious.<br>-Burrata: we are huge fans of burrata and this was the freshest  burrata that any of us have ever had. It was like a big twisted sack of fresh cream. This would have made the trip here worth it all on its own.<br>-Carbonara: A really hearty pasta dish that was the best I have ever had. It had big fried chunks of pork cheeks that start off chewy but then melt in your mouth. If you&#39;re a pork lover, definitely order this.<br>-Pasta Arrabiata: the pasta was really fresh and perfectly cooked. We&#39;re fans of spicy food and this does not disappoint. It&#39;s not an overwhelming amount of heat but it&#39;s got a good kick to it.<br>-House wine: cheap and satisfying. <br><br>My only lament is that I live across the ocean from this place. Otherwise I&#39;d be here once a week.",

"reviewcomment":"A true Roman restaurant in an area that is saturated by tourist traps. The food is wonderful: definitely order off the Specials list. The burrata ravioli is extremely addictive. Pasta is made in house and is ready in 5 minutes - just like it should be. Carbonara is a must-eat as well: when simple dishes are done well, there is no substitute. <br>Claudia is the daughter of the chef, and runs the front of the house (which consists of her mother, brother, and boyfriend) superbly. She is kind, intuitive, and knows a ton about food. Speaks flawless English as well, and never makes you feel as an outsider, which is a can make a visit to a foreign city just so much better. <br>The place is packed consistently, so I would suggest calling ahead. Have a nice Roman lunch at 2PM or dinner at 10. <br>Overall, an extremely satisfying experience, whether you are a local or passing through the Eternal City.",

"reviewcomment":"This is definitely one of the restaurants we always must come to when visiting Rome. We actually went twice the last time we were there, it&#39;s that good. The portions are huge and the service is warm. They have a very nice inside but also offer a lovely outside depending on where you want to eat. They have a giant menu, so there is probably something for everyone if there are some picky eaters among you. One of  my favorite dishes is the steak with tomatoes, it&#39;s seriously up there on the top five things ever eaten. Their pastas are also very good. I love their penne alla vodka, because it&#39;s not overly creamy or rich like you get here in the states, definitely the real thing. But then again it&#39;s Italy so if you can&#39;t get the real thing there than you&#39;re probably out of luck!",

Everything was fresh and authentic. <br><br>My friends and I avoid tourist restaurants like the plague and we will go out of the way for a good restaurant. We are so glad that we made the trip here. Just get there earlier if you want to beat the dinner rush. It&#39;s pretty small and it gets packed.<br><br>-Fried artichoke: perfectly seasoned with a little salt and not much else. Simple, yet delicious.<br>-Burrata: we are huge fans of burrata and this was the freshest  burrata that any of us have ever had. It was like a big twisted sack of fresh cream. This would have made the trip here worth it all on its own.<br>-Carbonara: A really hearty pasta dish that was the best I have ever had. It had big fried chunks of pork cheeks that start off chewy but then melt in your mouth. If you&#39;re a pork lover, definitely order this.<br>-Pasta Arrabiata: the pasta was really fresh and perfectly cooked. We&#39;re fans of spicy food and this does not disappoint. It&#39;s not an overwhelming amount of heat but it&#39;s got a good kick to it.<br>-House wine: cheap and satisfying. <br><br>My only lament is that I live across the ocean from this place. Otherwise I&#39;d be here once a week.",

Al pompiere had an old school atmosphere. Tucked away in the narrow streets of a Jewish neighborhood in Rome-dubbing it a &#34;Jewish Ghetto Classic&#34; that serves up the holy trinity of pasta dishes-Carbonara, Amatriciana and Cacio e pepe. The restaurant is actually located on the second floor. We may have heard a little bit of English spoken here and there, but it turns out we were surrounded by locals and quite elegant ones. The wait staff speaks English and they now how to read a tourist, but they gladly engaged with us in Italian. We came here for the &#34;holy trinity&#34; each thoroughly enjoyed our Spaghetti ala carbonara and Amatriciana. We started out with fried zucchini flowers- another typical Roman dish and burrata. Both the carbonara and the Amatriciana were decadent in every way. This meal was Among my favorites for classic Roman food away from the touristy plazas scattered throughout the city. The service was prompt and friendly. We felt right at home.",

I know it&#39;s silly to go hunting for Japanese food when I should be enjoying the Italian food in Italy.  But my cravings were calling. A girl wants what a girl wants! <br><br>So the restaurant is located on via de Mercedes and it was fairly easy to find.  We order sashimi for two and the fish was fresh.  The tuna was slight saltier than the tuna in had in Los Angeles and Japan..maybe it&#39;s a local kinda tuna.  The sashimi special also had white fish, sweet shrimp, mackerel, salmon, all very fresh, but it just tasted a little different than what I had before.  I&#39;m guessing the fish must be from locally. <br><br>This place is elegant and has excellent service, a great option in the land of pasta and pizza.",

We had someone make reservations for us, someone that was Italian.... when we arrived they realized we were English speaking and had to re-seat us in the servers section that spoke the most English. That was fine with us since our Italian was basically non existent. We ordered the suckling pig with the salt crust and were not disappointed. the dessert we had was also amazing although I cant remember what it was called, I&#39;m sure they are all good. The atmosphere was very nice and romantic (your in Italy everything is)  and the had nice exposed brick arch in the center of the second room which was very cute.  I would definitely come back here again.",

The restaurant&#39;s tone-on-tone decor provides a relaxed and contemporary, yet elegant setting which is a refreshing departure from most other Italian restaurants.<br><br>Me and my wife started with a whimsical appetizer of anchovies, cranberries and currants. We also had the pasta with shrimp and the sea bass. Both dishes were excellent and were cooked perfectly. We finished with a delicious phyllo cakes and chantilly cream dessert. <br><br>The wait staff are attractive and speak English fairly well which is very convenient.

"reviewcomment":"This certainly isn&#39;t the best Sicilian food in Italy, but it&#39;s really good for being outside of Sicily. Can be super crowded around lunch and dinner time, but they are very quick. Stick to the classic  Arancina al ragu (these are saffron rice balls stuffed and fried), for less than 3 euros you&#39;ll have a meal. This is not diet food. But if you&#39;re on a diet while you&#39;re vacationing in Italy you need to reevaluate your life choices. <br><br>All of their food is good and worth trying if you&#39;re in the area and looking for something cheap and easy. It&#39;s not a sit down place but you can get it to go and walk to Piazza Cavour if you prefer to sit and eat. The pizza here is a good option too, but I would choose the rice ball any day!.

"reviewcomment":"Another in my list of must-try food places in Roma, because of the Yelp reviews. When we got there, my friend, cousin &amp; I all kind of looked at each other, &amp; my friend asked, &#34;So..are we eating here?&#34; There were a bunch of servers out front, trying to invite people to come in. I said, &#34;Yes, Ok&#34;, &amp; they got us a table. The place kind of reminded me of TGI Fridays, it had a kind of fun party vibe &amp; there were lots of stuff on the walls, people showing their love for the restaurant (I posted a pic). <br><br>A lot of the customers were groups of what seemed like younger Americans, maybe college kids in Roma for vaca, or people that were maybe led there by Yelp. The place quickly filled with people as we let our server know what we were interested/not interested in. My friend is vegetarian, I&#39;m Pescetarian, &amp; my cousin is......normal.<br><br>It&#39;s worth pointing out that for the most part, we just said what we were/n&#39;t interested in, &amp; our server (which I thought was a good-looking Italian guy, very symmetrical - I think he might actually be the owner) determined what we most probably would like. He placed food on our table (the antipasto came after the main meal, we were surprised), &amp; we just gobbled everything down. I&#39;m still not sure what we ate there, but everything was great. This was the biggest meal we had in Europe. I remember thinking that I&#39;d be feeling stuffed &amp; &#39;grease-filled&#39; after the meal (as this has been my experience with Italian food - at least the &#39;outside-of-Italy&#39; variety), but no - the food was surprisingly flavorful, yet not super heavy.<br><br>The 1 thing I specifically remember (&amp; always will) was their fresh buffalo mozzarella. I think I mostly ate that juicy ball of goodness. Our server offered it to us, probably because he saw me eying the buffalo mozzarella he served to the people sitting at the table right next to ours. I really liked this mozzarella, because it was fresh, flavorful yet quite light (it was served on a bed of shredded lettuce). It wasn&#39;t heavy/greasy like the mozzarella used in pizzas (the kind of mozzarella I&#39;ve become accustomed to). After tasting Fraschetteria Brunetti&#39;s fresh buffalo mozzarella, I realized that the fast food pizza mozzarella a lot of us have learned to love is pure garbaj. Maybe their buffaloes eat other buffaloes for breakfast. Not sure.<br><br>Our bill came down to €88, which I thought was a bit steep, but there were 3 of us, &amp; like I said, this was our biggest meal during our stay in Europe, so I guess that was reasonable. Will eat there again when I go back to Roma :)<br><br>Tips: Their specialty is pork (hence the pig logo). You might want to give that a try :8) Also, they tend to serve antipastos (or at least that&#39;s how it was when we ate there) AFTER the meal. Didn&#39;t know that can happen. Hehe. The antipastos are definitely worth it, so maybe even split your main course with a friend! :)",

"reviewcomment":"I think dining out should be a comfortable experience, like dining at home but entirely more social. I don&#39;t think it should cost a lot (unless you&#39;re fine dining), and I don&#39;t think it should last under thirty minutes (unless you&#39;re pregnant). <br><br>I&#39;ve eaten at Burro e Sugo twice during my visit to Rome, and I have to say I really enjoy this restaurant. I like how the menu options are set out easily so you can have a sample of every course. The environment is cozy and the staff are really friendly, particularly the proprietor, Christian, who welcomes both Italian and the occasional non-Italian diners with energetic friendliness.<br><br>Everything is tasty, but I was most impressed by the delicious pomodoro bruschetta, the pappardelle with cinghiale and the homemade limoncello. The latter was better than anything I had around Naples, where they apparently invented the stuff. <br><br>Close to the Metro, fun times and lots of food; all things that lead to fun Roman times.",

"reviewcomment":"Our third time in Rome, my husband and I would only be there for one night and wanted to have a relaxed, romantic evening. We were staying in our favourite place, right beside the Pantheon, and wanted to eat somewhere close by. We thought it might be a bit challenging as it&#39;s such a touristy area, but we were lucky to find this gem. It&#39;s just a few minutes walk from the Pantheon, tucked away on a side street on the minuscule Piazza delle Coppelle. <br><br>We arrived very shortly after they opened and were lucky to get a table outside. It was a gorgeous evening. There are only a handful of outdoor tables and they are very close together. I walked through the restaurant later and it was a lot more spacious than I expected. Gorgeous, too. Don&#39;t hesitate to dine in the restaurant if outside isn&#39;t available.<br><br>They have a great wine list and their own sommelier, but we settled on a half bottle of house red for 9EUR. I didn&#39;t write down what we had, but looking at the menu now I&#39;m sure we had the Rigatoni all&#39;Amatricianella (Rigatoni Amatricianella style with cherry tomatoes, Norcia Bacon flambé with Cognac) and the Rigatoni amatriciana con guanciale di norcia (Rigatoni Amatriciana style with Norcia bacon and spicy tomato sauce). Both dishes were fresh down to the very last ingredient and oh so delicious. I wish I wouldn&#39;t have been so full, because I would have loved to order more food here!<br><br>Service was fairly prompt and friendly while still being professional. I&#39;m looking forward to dining here again the next time I am in Roma.",

"reviewcomment":"Tripa &amp; Caccio!!<br><br>Yumm yummm. I love this place and their beautiful outdoor seating. It is not right in the middle of all the crazy busy things. It&#39;s almost kind of hidden but it&#39;s easy to find. You can sit inside and outside but definitely choose outside for lunch. You can gaze into the buildings , narrow little cobble stone streets and people watch as you dine on their delicious offering.<br><br>Who gets steak in Rome? You should! Romans are known for their love of meat. Meat, offals and all things simple and cheesy. Baccala too but they didn&#39;t have it here.<br><br>Steak- great! Comes with a side of simple salad. <br>Caccio e pepe - this version of caccio e pepe is a wet one. Its wet and creamy. I prefer the dry style. But it is still tasty. They use a big pasta which is so divine.<br>Tripa - classic roman dish. Tripe in tomato sauce. Spicy too! Yummmm<br>Proscuitto and dolce! Yumm yumm.<br><br>Overall, it was a laid back lunch on a very hot summer day in Rome. Make sure you call ahead because you will need a reservation. This place is always packed! Service is efficient. If you speak italian, it gets even better :) Food will put you in a food coma. What&#39;s not to love??!",

And, the ingredients are super, super fresh. <br><br>A liter of average, chilled red house wine, three pizzas, a fried rice ball, a fried zuhinni flower stuffed with some sort of anchovy and ricotta and a large bottle of water for 40€!  <br><br>Great service in this neighborhood hotspot to boot.

We thought it might be a bit challenging as it&#39;s such a touristy area, but we were lucky to find this gem. It&#39;s just a few minutes walk from the Pantheon, tucked away on a side street on the minuscule Piazza delle Coppelle. <br><br>We arrived very shortly after they opened and were lucky to get a table outside. It was a gorgeous evening. There are only a handful of outdoor tables and they are very close together. I walked through the restaurant later and it was a lot more spacious than I expected. Gorgeous, too. Don&#39;t hesitate to dine in the restaurant if outside isn&#39;t available.<br><br>They have a great wine list and their own sommelier, but we settled on a half bottle of house red for 9EUR. I didn&#39;t write down what we had, but looking at the menu now I&#39;m sure we had the Rigatoni all&#39;Amatricianella (Rigatoni Amatricianella style with cherry tomatoes, Norcia Bacon flambé with Cognac) and the Rigatoni amatriciana con guanciale di norcia (Rigatoni Amatriciana style with Norcia bacon and spicy tomato sauce). Both dishes were fresh down to the very last ingredient and oh so delicious. I wish I wouldn&#39;t have been so full, because I would have loved to order more food here!<br><br>Service was fairly prompt and friendly while still being professional. I&#39;m looking forward to dining here again the next time I am in Roma.",

"reviewcomment":"I feel bad for those yelpers who had bad service here because with a takeaway place that deals with probably a hundred people every 30 minutes you really just have to 1) say hello in italian, 2) pull out more Euro than you think you&#39;ll need, 3) point at something you think looks good, 4) if the total is 8 Euro and you have a 10, drop the 10 and walk away with your goods before you get trampled!<br><br>Ok the service is rushed and short, the crowds are huge and pushy, but if you&#39;re looking for a nice little pizza hut or dominos, who do custom pizzas, stay home. If you&#39;re looking for an experience with some amazing pizza, great views and an eclectic mix of people from around the world... come here and as they say, Do as the Romans do. <br><br>Enjoy!",

"reviewcomment":"Our last trip to Italy (2013) and particularly Rome culminated on our last night with a rainy swervey taxi journey to Metamorfosi from Piazza Navarro. <br><br>We arrived in a cold drenched evening to the welcoming fresh modern interior of the restaurant. We were visiting in February, the off tourist season, and there were very few diners, this was all too fitting an ambiance for the evening.<br><br>We were treated to a nine course meal and drink pairings facilitated by the sommelier. EVERY plate delicious with a quick explanation and beverage history. Of particular note, the pumpkin risoto wrap was the star, although the menu is ever changing.<br><br>If you have a chance in Rome, and want some great deconstructionalist gourmet gastronomy in a city rife with old guard traditionalist ristorante, take a rainy day taxi to Metamorfosi.",

"reviewcomment":"We went here for dinner twice while in Rome for a week. It&#39;s in a very typical Roman residential neighborhood of Monteverde. Not touristy at all, but more for the local folks in the hood. They make an awesome pizza - not round  but more oval in shape - that is made with an &#34;antique crushed dough pizza&#34; method which is apparently more than 2,000 years old and was practiced here in ancient Rome that long ago. The crust is very light and fluffy. The toppings are great in variety. <br><br>The menu is fairly simple and consists mostly of appetizers, salads and pasta and  pizza. I&#39;d recommend people try the &#34;ancient pizza&#34; because you will never ever eat this kind of pizza anywhere else, its very unique as tastes great. One pizza plate is more than enough for one person and can be easily shared between two for not very much money. They also have great wines and desserts. Their prices are very reasonable and the host and wait staff are very helpful (spoke English) and welcoming. You will have a great dinner here.",

"reviewcomment":"Wonderful Trattoria in Rome! I DEFINITELY recommend this special spot if you want an authentic italian experience. I not only had a delicious meal but also a great evening. The owner, Simone, was so sweet and very accommodating. She allowed me to sample two outrageously good dishes as I was traveling on my own. The risotto with truffles was out of this world. Not many tables. The place was quiet around 8pm when I stopped by to put my name down for a seat. By 9pm all of the tables were full. 100% worth checking out if your in Rome.",

We had the 5 course tasting menu with a great and very rare white wine from a little island in Sicily produced by Hauner which was great for our seafood dishes.<br><br>The whole atmosphere of the restaurant is simply great and yes we had to reserve a few days in advance but it was well worth it. Definitely a place I will come back to on my future visits in Rome.<br><br>So glad I found this place. Now I can leave &#34;happy&#34; :)",

"reviewcomment":"Stopped in by chance looking for a place open late in the area. Me and my fiancé walked in and loved the look immediately. There were old Charlie Chaplin movies playing on a big screen against the wall, with wine bottles mounted all around the place. The place is run by two brothers who are great. Our server was the younger brother who was there helping out during the economic troubles in Italy. He was more fluent in English and said he learned English to finish reading the game of thrones books not translated next lol. Attentive is an understatement being we were of a select few there that late he hung out a bit with us til our food came out to not be invasive.<br><br>The food was great and somehow I after having my after dinner customary drink I felt like I ate but wasn&#39;t stuffed even though I ate a small feast. The place was reasonable for the area but pricey in an up scales NYC kinda way. <br>I loved this placed promising to check back in when I return to Rome.",

And boy was it fantastic (this rating is nothing short of a miracle, because I am usually not even a fan of carbonara sauce). <br>But let me start from the top. The coffee this place serves was some of the best we have had in Rome, with flavors not quite as &#34;burnt&#34; as in other places and therefore extremely smooth, balanced and tasty. <br>After taking a look at the menu and discovering their EUR 10 lunch menu (featuring 1 &#34;piece&#34; of bruschetta, your choice of pasta, 0.5l of water and a coffee afterwards) we decided to try it out. <br>The pasta was without a doubt the best pasta I have ever eaten anywhere and I am a true pastafan, so this is not a compliment I would give out easily.  <br>We came back 3 more times to have more of their delicious carbonara and just-as-delicious amatriciana sauce. To-die-for (both, the sauces as well as the pasta) <br><br>Definitely give this charming place with its nice decor, soothing music and awesome food a try if you&#39;re passing throughout one of the cutest streets in Rome (the street itself and it&#39;s artsy shops are worth a visit regardless if you&#39;re hungry or not). <br><br>Fantastico!

"reviewcomment":"We walked down the area from the top of Trastevere looking for a place to eat and ended up bit tired of looking (best way to find a good eating place in by looking at all the food being served in all the outdoor tables in Rome) so when we hit the square, we saw Sabatini and decided it looked like they have been around awhile so in we went.  We were greeted by 81 Year old owner who took to us as we seemed like real willing diners and he and his 86 year old brother then proceeded to serve one of the most memorable meals ever.  So simple yet so elegant and delicious!  We had cocktails and then some Crostini amuse which I knew then this place was going to be great....the toasts were perfect and the tomatoes flavorful and plump with drizzle of fine olive oil that belie the simplicity of these 3-4 ingredients.  We proceeded to have the San Daniele prosciutto shaved by the master himself, followed by a fresh Porcini pasta that blew my mind with another pasta of clams that had the the little bi-valves singing in my mouth as the texture was sublime.  Fresh sauteed Porcinis followed with touch of garlic and then the best leg of lamb maybe ever as the skin was crackling with just bits of salt and rosemary imbued into the succulent meat.  Finished with tiny strawberries in some fresh cream and we were blissful.  The elder brother even serenaded us and show us a pic of him and the Three Tenors (he is a baritone)!  Wine chosen by younger brother (age 81), a fine Multipulciano was lush with good structure and paired with the food beautifully. This was an afternoon spend the way lives should be enjoyed.  When you go...ask to see the Brothers...they are what great restaurateurs should be like!",

"reviewcomment":"Dining in Roma,  what a great thing to do, and especially with local friends that know the best places. Ai PIani is absolutely fantastic if you love seafood, love raw fish and love an adventure. <br><br>1.  Ambiance - A great location with outdoor seating and nice elegant indoor seating. This is a very sumptuous ambiance that is both formal and smart casual.  Very comfortable and relaxing!<br><br>2.  Food - Ahh,  <br><br>Start - first when you arrive, they will offer you something to drink and they recommended sparkling wine or prosecco which is just like champagne. Nice way to start the culinary experience.<br><br>Bread - They start you off with Carta da Musica, which literally translated is Music Sheet.  It is a thin bread very crispy and a Sardinian specialty. Very tasty!<br><br>Appetizer - <br>We had a special chef recommendation of Crudo Misto which is a mix of raw fish like langoustine, shrimp and a white fish. Very, very tasty and simple.  If you like sushi, you would like this very much.<br><br>We also had the Moscardini, small baby octopus and Fried Alici, small sardines that taste very nice.  The texture and the light taste is great.<br><br>The meal-<br>Spigola al sale - Sea Bass baked in Salt, absolutely perfect baked fish, flaky and tender.  You don&#39;t taste the salt at all, it just keeps the moisture in.<br><br>Astice alla catalana - Lobster Catalan which is cooked Lobster mixed in with I am not sur what, but if you love seafood, you will love this.<br><br>If you are ready for a treat, and love to try things, check this place out. It is fantastic!",

"reviewcomment":"This certainly isn&#39;t the best Sicilian food in Italy, but it&#39;s really good for being outside of Sicily. Can be super crowded around lunch and dinner time, but they are very quick. Stick to the classic  Arancina al ragu (these are saffron rice balls stuffed and fried), for less than 3 euros you&#39;ll have a meal. This is not diet food. But if you&#39;re on a diet while you&#39;re vacationing in Italy you need to reevaluate your life choices. <br><br>All of their food is good and worth trying if you&#39;re in the area and looking for something cheap and easy. It&#39;s not a sit down place but you can get it to go and walk to Piazza Cavour if you prefer to sit and eat. The pizza here is a good option too, but I would choose the rice ball any day!. Friendly staff, albeit usually rushed to move the line along.",

We found it on yelp and had to walk a couple blocks to find it but when we got to the beginning of the street- just look for the bright lights, loud chattering or follow the yummy food scent.<br><br>They had a very extensive wine list. The wait were attentive and food was brought out at a reasonable amount of time. <br><br>I had the lobster pasta and was thrilled to have fresh lobster pieces! The only downfall about my dish was that they were still in the shell but at least they were fresh and I was given all of the utensils needed to prey out the meat.<br><br>I&#39;ll definitely stop by again when Im in the neighborhood!",

"reviewcomment":"This was far and away the nicest restaurant that I went to while in Rome. My AirBnb host suggested it for a place that most tourists would not necessarily go to because it is relatively far from the tourist attractions.<br><br>Flavio used to be the chef at a different restaurant and then decided to go off on his own. This takes &#34;hole in the wall&#34; to a new level... it really does feel more like a hole in the side of a small hill. But it&#39;s quite lovely inside, and I would suggest dressing &#34;european casual&#34; at least.<br><br>The menus are completely in Italian, which was somewhat challenging. I went with my waitress&#39; suggestion for my appetizer (fried artichoke hearts), which was great! For my main, I had the &#34;house special&#34; ravioli - also very good. I finished everything off with a house tiramisu, which was very good as well.<br><br>Their red house wine (vino della casa) was good. Would I suggest going here? Yes, but it was kinda hard for me to find... Piramide is probably the closest metro... so if you have the time and patience... this place is great!",

"reviewcomment":"Went in for coffee at the bar, came back 3 more times for their fantastic pasta!<br>I guess the first sentence in itself already says everything you need to know in order for you to give this place a try...<br><br>A super charming, modern-chic small café/&#34;bistro&#34;, this place has exceptionally good pasta, great coffee at really fair prices and a great lunch special that&#39;s worth trying out.<br>After coming in to get a EUR 1 espresso at the bar we had a look at the menu and took some recommendations from the bar tender to try the house-made carbonara pasta. And boy was it fantastic (this rating is nothing short of a miracle, because I am usually not even a fan of carbonara sauce). <br>But let me start from the top. The coffee this place serves was some of the best we have had in Rome, with flavors not quite as &#34;burnt&#34; as in other places and therefore extremely smooth, balanced and tasty. <br>After taking a look at the menu and discovering their EUR 10 lunch menu (featuring 1 &#34;piece&#34; of bruschetta, your choice of pasta, 0.5l of water and a coffee afterwards) we decided to try it out. <br>The pasta was without a doubt the best pasta I have ever eaten anywhere and I am a true pastafan, so this is not a compliment I would give out easily.  <br>We came back 3 more times to have more of their delicious carbonara and just-as-delicious amatriciana sauce. To-die-for (both, the sauces as well as the pasta) <br><br>Definitely give this charming place with its nice decor, soothing music and awesome food a try if you&#39;re passing throughout one of the cutest streets in Rome (the street itself and it&#39;s artsy shops are worth a visit regardless if you&#39;re hungry or not). <br><br>Fantastico!

"reviewcomment":"We walked down the area from the top of Trastevere looking for a place to eat and ended up bit tired of looking (best way to find a good eating place in by looking at all the food being served in all the outdoor tables in Rome) so when we hit the square, we saw Sabatini and decided it looked like they have been around awhile so in we went.  We were greeted by 81 Year old owner who took to us as we seemed like real willing diners and he and his 86 year old brother then proceeded to serve one of the most memorable meals ever.  So simple yet so elegant and delicious!  We had cocktails and then some Crostini amuse which I knew then this place was going to be great....the toasts were perfect and the tomatoes flavorful and plump with drizzle of fine olive oil that belie the simplicity of these 3-4 ingredients.  We proceeded to have the San Daniele prosciutto shaved by the master himself, followed by a fresh Porcini pasta that blew my mind with another pasta of clams that had the the little bi-valves singing in my mouth as the texture was sublime.  Fresh sauteed Porcinis followed with touch of garlic and then the best leg of lamb maybe ever as the skin was crackling with just bits of salt and rosemary imbued into the succulent meat.  Finished with tiny strawberries in some fresh cream and we were blissful.  The elder brother even serenaded us and show us a pic of him and the Three Tenors (he is a baritone)!  Wine chosen by younger brother (age 81), a fine Multipulciano was lush with good structure and paired with the food beautifully. This was an afternoon spend the way lives should be enjoyed.  When you go...ask to see the Brothers...they are what great restaurateurs should be like!",

Ai PIani is absolutely fantastic if you love seafood, love raw fish and love an adventure. <br><br>1.  Ambiance - A great location with outdoor seating and nice elegant indoor seating. This is a very sumptuous ambiance that is both formal and smart casual.  Very comfortable and relaxing!<br><br>2.  Food - Ahh,  <br><br>Start - first when you arrive, they will offer you something to drink and they recommended sparkling wine or prosecco which is just like champagne. Nice way to start the culinary experience.<br><br>Bread - They start you off with Carta da Musica, which literally translated is Music Sheet.  It is a thin bread very crispy and a Sardinian specialty. Very tasty!<br><br>Appetizer - <br>We had a special chef recommendation of Crudo Misto which is a mix of raw fish like langoustine, shrimp and a white fish. Very, very tasty and simple.  If you like sushi, you would like this very much.<br><br>We also had the Moscardini, small baby octopus and Fried Alici, small sardines that taste very nice.  The texture and the light taste is great.<br><br>The meal-<br>Spigola al sale - Sea Bass baked in Salt, absolutely perfect baked fish, flaky and tender.  You don&#39;t taste the salt at all, it just keeps the moisture in.<br><br>Astice alla catalana - Lobster Catalan which is cooked Lobster mixed in with I am not sur what, but if you love seafood, you will love this.<br><br>If you are ready for a treat, and love to try things, check this place out.

The staff did seem to care for our plight, but normally this would mean instant low rating.<br><br>BUT the food was just too good. The carbonara was a new tasting experience, silky smooth and different from other places we&#39;d been to. Buffalo Mozz / Prosciutto was good too as was a meat plate we ordered. But yeah, the Carbonara made it for us. Will come back, despite long wait.<br><br>Tips would be to definitely make a reservation (probably earlier in the night as service/waits can get delayed) and not be late for it (saw another couple wait as log as us after showing up 15 mins late).",

"reviewcomment":"This place was a great!! We found it on yelp and had to walk a couple blocks to find it but when we got to the beginning of the street- just look for the bright lights, loud chattering or follow the yummy food scent.<br><br>They had a very extensive wine list. The wait were attentive and food was brought out at a reasonable amount of time. <br><br>I had the lobster pasta and was thrilled to have fresh lobster pieces! The only downfall about my dish was that they were still in the shell but at least they were fresh and I was given all of the utensils needed to prey out the meat.<br><br>I&#39;ll definitely stop by again when Im in the neighborhood!",

"reviewcomment":"Located in the Monteverde area, this small restaurant with Middle Eastern flavor is among Rome&#39;s hidden gems. Everything rotates around the Mezés, fixed price entries that go from a delicious hummus, to tzatziki, a delicious yogurt cheese, a vegetables cream and the awesome &#34;frittelle di zia Esterina&#34;. There&#39;s also an option for happy hour to enjoy a glass of wine and one mezè for just €7.<br>After this round of entries here are the main courses: my Jerusalem&#39;s filled chicken with rice, pine seeds and cinnamon was amazing, but they serve also a shawarma plate, a good beef, cous cous and some pasta dishes.<br>At the end a good glass of sweet Sicilian zibibbo wine and a delicious Libanese cannolo... <br>It&#39;s been a bit pricey, but worth it.",

"reviewcomment":"Lasagna heaven!!! This sweet little restaurant was right around the corner from our hotel. I loved the food so much, I may stay at the same place in the future just to be close to this restaurant. I ate here twice during my stay and probably would have eaten here again if I&#39;d have gone sooner. The restaurant is very sweet with great romantic lighting. The waitstaff was very nice and made great suggestions. The house red was tasty and inexpensive and the rustic antipasti plate was generous and varied. We had the pumpkin lasagne, the mushroom and truffle lasagne, and the pasta amatriciana. All were superb! This was where we had our best meals in rome.",

Beautiful ivy drapes over the side of the building this place just oozes atmosphere.<br><br> This is the place to be for a fancy tipple or two. It&#39;s expensive but worth it. You can sit with an apertif and watch the flow of people coming and going from Piazza Navona. It&#39;s usually busy and full of classy, gorgeous Italians.<br><br> This place is right beside two of my favourite places in Rome - La Botticella wine bar and Bar del Fico. So if you&#39;re stopping by here you may as well try the other two out also. They&#39;re literally steps away from each other.",

"reviewcomment":"My bf &amp; I went spent 9 days in Rome during December 2012 and this was our first dining experience in Italy. The food here is fantastic and the service was friendly. It is hidden in a narrow street so it may be difficult to find. I recommend asking a local for directions which is what we did.<br><br>We loved the pasta dishes in cream sauce here - most notable would be the vodka sauce, carbonara &amp; prosciutto/peas/broccoli combo. The thin crust pizzas cooked in a wood oven here is excellent. Crust is chewy and plenty of toppings. Our favorite was the prosciutto &amp; fungi pizza. Pizza&#39;s are huge so we had to take leftovers back to the hotel with us. Their panna cotta is to not be missed! Perfect texture and is served with a drizzle of raspberry sauce. <br><br>Overall, we loved this place so much that we came back 3 times! Very affordable (10-12 euros per dish) and authentic. I highly recommend this place and you won&#39;t be disappointed. Will stop by here again if we make it back to Rome in the future. It&#39;s that good!",

"reviewcomment":"It was my and my friends first visit to Rome, so eating was pretty hit and miss. This place was actually recommended and we were able to work it in. <br>We all liked the place, good atmosphere and the staff was pretty attentive for Italy. I am used to American style dinners, done in an hour, but when in Rome... This is the typical first, second course, etc. dinner place. The food was good. We had the artichoke appetizer. The tuba steak was okay, just not much seasoning. That seems to be the normal for main dish meat/fish at a lot of places I are in Italy. <br>Overall, it&#39;s worth a try. The Jewish ghetto was a pretty cool neighborhood. It&#39;s been about a month since I was there, so it&#39;s hard to remember the specifics. It wasn&#39;t bad, though. My friends liked it, too.",

Better than the stuff you get in the touristy areas by far, and about half the price.<br><br>But it&#39;s located in a residential area located on the other side of Termini, so it&#39;s out of the way on a fairly empty street. We were staying at the Hotel Eurostars, so it was nearby.<br><br>We went late around 9:30 and it fills with young locals. We split a pizza for under 6 Euros and added a couple of suppli. They have specials by the slice as well, and we saw one guy eating a pizza topped with those yellow potatoes. Pretty much no English is spoken so if you don&#39;t speak Italian you&#39;ll have to grunt and point.<br><br>I wish we had pizza like this in America, I&#39;d realistically eat it 3-4 times a week.",

The restaurant is pretty small, not even 10 tables, and the menu very traditionally Roman. Also the prices seem from the past, with a dish for just a few Euros, even though I must say portions are not very generous. <br>A recommendation though: get there early to get a table, but also to get more food choice. In fact the waiter deletes dishes from the menu when they&#39;re over, and they close when there&#39;s no more food!",

This place is great for breakfast, the cornetti are made in their laboratory right across the street, but get there early to make sure they still have some. I prefer the one with semi di pappavero (poppy seeds). My friend used to live around the block from here and their patio outdoor seating was always a nice place to discuss shenanigans from the night before and recover from hangovers. Their cappuccino are perfection and the barista was always super friendly. The only place I give this place 4 stars instead of 5 is because the cashier (1st stop- pay before you order) ALWAYS acted as if it was such a bother that any customer need to pay. Seriously, you&#39;re a cashier, it wouldn&#39;t hurt to smile or say hello to your customers (but I guess I have an over-friendly American expectation of good customer service). <br><br>I&#39;ve also had dinner here and, like the breakfasts, everything was always the best quality even if the service was sometimes lacking. <br><br>Bravi! ma sorridete un po&#39;, no?",

"reviewcomment":"This was the best restaurant experience of our ten days in Rome.  Why they don&#39;t have a star or two from Michelin I don&#39;t understand.<br><br>They do have two Yelp reviews - both five stars.  Now they have three, all five stars.  Thank you Yelp.  Without those reviews we would not have gone.<br><br>The setting is fabulous, both naturally and with the way they&#39;ve decorated it.  The restaurant is a large high ceiling room in back of their wine shop.  It&#39;s classic Roman, but new and fresh and spacious.  Solid wood tables, beautiful stained glass windows up high, and an impressive modern stained glass ceiling.<br><br>Our service was excellent, but that disappeared behind the awesome meal we had.  We started with zucchini flowers, stuffed with ricotta cheese, and baked.  Served on a bed of sun dried tomatoes.  This makes my list of top ten appetizers I&#39;ve ever tasted.  <br><br>We then shared an order of mezze maniche, a large pasta that was the freshest pasta I had in Rome.<br><br>My main course was scabbard, a very tasty fish I&#39;d not had before.  The long filets of the fish, cooked with Parmesan cheese, were served on a thick piece of eggplant, with cooked cherry tomatoes and olives as a side dish.  As with the zucchini flowers dish, this was a masterful combination, with all the flavors balancing one another, in this case all strong flavors.  It was wonderfully tasty.  I liked having the tomatoes and olives combination on the side, so on each bite I could decide how much of which items I wanted to combine each time.<br><br>Accompanying the meal we started with an excellent mecita, the had another great Abruzzo white wine.<br><br>This, to me, is a destination restaurant.  The entire meal was a culinary experience.  When they get their Michelin star, we will be able to say &#34;we knew them when...&#34;",

The food was authentic (I&#39;m a big fan of authenticity) and the ambiance and service was great. <br><br>I had the Garbanzo and Chorizo soup as an appetizer, which was absolutely phenomenal, and my husband and I shared a plate of different types of meat. Divine. The servers speak Spanish, as well as Italian, and the price is cheaper than what I expected for 3 Euro signs. <br><br>Definitely a must if anyone needs a break from all the Italian food. Also, make a reservation if possible. It got very full at around 9 pm on a Saturday.",

The service was great and the outside seating had perfect ambiance. I had the Spring Tagliatella and the Grilled Roman Lamb. Both hit the spot nicely.

OH EM GEE this was to die for.  The richness and flavor is unique and unlike anything i have ever tasted before.  Word of advice, definitely get a pasta or some bread to balance the rich flavor.<br><br>I highly recommend that if you are in the Trastevere area, that you stop in for a meal.  You will not regret your decision, I promise.",

"reviewcomment":"I&#39;m no tourist. I&#39;m an American who grew up in Las Vegas, lives in Boston, and has spent a lot of time in Chicago, NYC, and San Francisco -- all great eating towns. But I also lived in Pigneto for five months, and have eaten all over Rome. <br><br>It doesn&#39;t matter where you&#39;re staying in Rome. It&#39;s worth the trip to get to L&#39;Idillio.<br><br>Going on the food alone, L&#39;Idillio is easily in the top five restaurants in Rome. When you also include the service and the price (... which is very reasonable, especially considering the amazing food), L&#39;Idillio is perhaps the best in Rome.<br><br>It&#39;s a family restaurant. Don&#39;t let his jeans and t-shirt or his young age fool you: when you talk to the son/host Andrea, you&#39;re talking to a genius. There&#39;s not a single detail of the restaurant that escapes his attention. (For example, we asked for a wine recommendation one night. His answer: &#34;Such-and-such wine was grown on the same estate where the wild boar in tonight&#39;s ragu comes from, so I would go with that.&#34; Spot on.) But unlike other geniuses, Andrea is easy-going and very approachable, in English or Italian.<br><br>It&#39;s easy to see that his mother, the chef, is also a genius. There are traditional dishes on the menu that are executed perfectly. But there are also some of her creative innovations, like the appetizer &#34;semifreddo di grana&#34;: a savory grana-based ice cream served with prosciutto. (Grana is a hard white cheese, like parmesan.) Absolutely amazing.<br><br>Or for dessert, try the chestnut ice cream, drizzled with chestnut honey. Andrea recommends it with a glass of sweet marsala wine. <br><br>And Andrea is a genius.",

"reviewcomment":"First Yelp fail! I&#39;ll start with the positives. The view was great. There was no wait. And the pizza crust was great. Unfortunately, it was mainly downhill from there. The mushroom pizza was bland, though the crust was nice. The swordfish steak was thin, fishy, and dry. And the lasagna was straight up chef boyardee. Truly mushy and tasted like it came out of a can. The house red was interesting. Kind of sweet and fizzy. My husband found it hilariously delicious. I would never return and wish I would have gone back to De Francesco&#39;s for the third time in three days.",

"reviewcomment":"This is my favorite place in Roma.  Granted I have only been to Rome twice, but both times, I have eaten here.  I will make it a tradition.  When I had been in Rome last summer, we asked the cab driver for a more homespun restaurant.  He delivered.  it is very authentic and not pretenses and yet the food is fresh and not so pricy!  And while I wouldn&#39;t say it is the highest quality fo0od, it is really good, and the environment is wonderful.  I actually walked past it this time, and then did backsteps like you see in a cartoon.  I was like, I AM SO EATING HERE AGAIN!<br>The neighborhood is Fantastic and Alive (Trastavere).  I was just there this month (November) and ate outside regardless of the slight coolness.  It was a Friday night, I dined alone.  My friend&#39;s flight was canceled due to the Hurricane in the US.  However, with the extremely animated waiter, I never felt alone.  He was flying through the space, taking orders, delivering food, moving chairs and tables.  But he would take the time to sit with you and take your order. <br>When I had been in Rome last summer, we asked the cab driver for a more homespun restaurant.  He delivered.  it is very authentic and not pretenses and yet the food is fresh and not so pricy!  <br>The wine is local, the place is crowded with families and groups of 10 or more trying to get a table at 10pm.  LOVE IT!",

"reviewcomment":"My husband and I are from Portland, Oregon and we love sushi, I mean LOVE sushi. So after eating a ton (literally) of pasta we wanted some comfort food from home. We Yelp searched and found Taki and thank god that we did!! It was the best dining experience that we have had in Italy after being here for 4 days. The waitress was extremely friendly and helpful with the menu that was in Japanese and Italian. She spoke English so we were able to ask for some of our favorite sushi rolls and make some changes. The sushi was fantastic! Extremely fresh and well made!! We HIGHLY recommend this place to anyone who loves sushi and if you are wanting some variety in Rome. Just a heads up it is a little pricy, but since sushi is a comfort food and everyone was so welcoming it was a wonderful slice if home for us and worth every penny. Also, we did need to ask for wasabi but they brought us a great mound of it and they had some interesting Italian style options if you are adventurous. And the cheesecake dessert was heavenly. I would add more stars if I could, thank you Taki for a memorable night! :)",

I remember countless times looking up between the buildings at the city lights in the August sky and thinking how it couldn&#39;t be real. It was so beautiful that it looked like it had to be a movie set. I mostly was at the tiny tiny pub next to Jonathan&#39;s Angels, if its still there, I believe the same owner. Both are great.

The nice and friendly staff offers a good quality buffet, even though it&#39;s a bit too vegetarian and some meat would be appreciated. Wine selection is very good and prices honest. There&#39;s a nice terrace to stay fresh in the hot Summer nights while sipping a glass of wine with friends, and free Wi-Fi within the bar.",

The hotel is spotless clean and so was the room. Spacious and comfortable. Breakfast was delicious.

"reviewcomment":"Slip into this spot if you&#39;re looking for a selection of local Italian microbrews and a little bit of pub food. I&#39;ll havta say, my review of this place is influenced by the fact that they apparently used to have a menu focused on integrating beer into the food. That menu has since been replaced by their take on &#34;American street food&#34; which means build your own burger. Most of the beers had that light, homebrew-y taste that doesn&#39;t live up to the expectations I have for craft beer. It&#39;s an experience for sure, but not one I&#39;d say you have to seek out.",

Unfortunately  I arrived earlier than their opening time and instead of being told to come back in an hour I was simply told they&#39;re closed, while the man cleaning the floors was only concerned that my daughter was stepping on a floor he had completed mopping. My potential business is the reason why he was mopping the floor. And if the place felt I wasn&#39;t good enough for their business then I likewise would let people who care about how they get treated the possibility of experiencing the same. I simply took my business across the street to a nice mom and pop pizza shop where I was treated with warmth and kindness and spent far less. Shame on Pizzeria San Marino.",

Now I don&#39;t know a lot about food, but if I am willing to walk a mile with my achy flat feet, to come back the next day and eat again at the same place, it is just amazing. <br><br>Ok, so this place has to be in my top ten in rome where I dined. I was here for lunch and came back the next day for dinner. I loved it, the staff was super friendly, the owner, Andreas was very helpful and an absolute pleasure to talk to and really when you have good food all around the city what really sets a place aside is the service. This place offered that on top of the exceptional food.  The bruschettas were amazing, the best in town. If I remember correctly they make their own bread and that makes the difference. I think we had tiramisu for dessert on both days and it was just divine.  5 stars, and since its election season here in the US - I am the king of rome and I endorse this message !",

Everyone who works there are very friendly and speak english for all the tourists out there. Its a bit of a walk from the main part of Rome, but i think it&#39;s worth every step. They have a bruschetta menu, a pasta menu, pizza menu, huge salad menu, f*ucking amazing mojitos and beer. It&#39;s really an establishment that cannot be beat by taste. it&#39;s the ultimate lounge, dive bar and restaurant all combined.

"reviewcomment":"This was the best meal my wife and I had in Rome.  This is the type of place the tourist guide tell you to try and find, and I would recommend being adventurous when going as the typical tourist dishes can be found anywhere.  The wait staff knew as much English as we knew Italian, but they were very patient and very friendly.<br><br>The menu presented had all dishes detailed in 3 languages (Italian, German, and English). They have a chef recommendation section that you should really consider ordering from (if they took the time to select these dishes, they must be proud of them).  They seem to specialize in meats and there are many classic roman dishes as well as local dishes most tourist places ignore. All the dishes we had were excellent and very reasonably priced for the portions. <br><br>We started with an appetizer of steamed clams that was very good, and had a nice seasoned flavor that I wouldn&#39;t have thought to try with seafood.  It was almost like a basil or oregano flavor. Very tasty and not too filling.<br><br>From the chef&#39;s selection menu, I ordered the wild boar and I think it is one of the best prepared meats I have ever had.  I am used to boar having a gamey flavor to it, but there was none of that in this dish.  It had a very flavorful rosemary marinade that really made this dish.  I would order it again in a heartbeat.<br><br>My wife ordered a spaghetti bolognese.  The sauce was flavorful, but it is at almost any place you order it in Rome.  I think she would have been more adventurous if she went back as she thought I was crazy for ordering the boar, but was really impressed when she tried it.  She really enjoyed the dish though.<br><br>We had a desert but I don&#39;t know what it was called.  Due to the language barrier, we were shown the desert options and we picked the chocolate cake looking option that was highly recommended by our waitress.  It was very tasty and highly recommended by both myself and my wife.  Be aware that it is very dense and 1 piece should be more than enough to share.<br><br>For appetizer, dinner, desert and wine the cost averaged to 23€ per person.<br><br>This place is great as long as going into the experience:<br><br>1. You are willing to try something different<br>2. Are willing to try out your Italian speaking skills<br><br>One last thing to note, they do allow smoking in the restaurant itself.  This does bother some people so be aware.",

"reviewcomment":"After more than a week of non stop pasta and pizza in Italy, my friend and I decided that we should see what other types of foods Rome has to offer. After looking all over we saw that there was an Indian restaurant that had pretty good reviews. Jaipur for dinner it was!<br><br>To begin our meal we got an order of vegetable samosas that were absolutely delicious. It may be the best thing I had at the restaurant. They were perfectly cooked and scrumptious. We also got an order of naan that was great too. For my meal I decided on getting the Jaipuru Murgh. It could have been better, but it was still pretty good. My friend got the chicken Tikka Masala, which she said was great. I tried a bite of it, and I thought the Tikka Masala was better than my meal. For dessert I got the Kulfi which is an almond and pistachio ice cream which was amazing. I loved it! My friend got the Nariyal ki Kulfi which was a coconut ice cream. My friend claimed it was the best coconut ice cream she had on the trip.<br><br>Overall, Jaipur was very tasty! I was a much appreciated and much needed change from the usual Italian fare offered throughout Rome.",

We had two appetizers, two entrees (and one salad), and two desserts.  We also had a carafe of red wine, and two shots of limoncello at the end.  The total bill came out close to €80.",

Separated into several small rooms, to give privacy to their customers and that feeling of a house dinner, the personnel barely speak any Italian but can serve original Chinese food cooked in a real good way. On the other hand forget about most of the Chinese dishes you eat anywhere else, they&#39;re probably just an adaptation to our habits. If you want to experience the real Chinese tradition, this is definitely the place.<br>Note: credit cards not accepted, free WiFi available.",

We went for lunch after out morning Vatican tour and were immediately made to feel welcome, even though Dino and tony were still having their lunch! We speak zero italian, and had no idea what we were getting or how much it cost. We did learn &#34;uno for due&#34; which is what you want to know when you eat here.  1 meal for two people. Eat everything they offer, but share. That is the best advice I can give. The food is phenomenal, especially if you wash it down with the wine. For dessert don&#39;t miss out on the Marsala to drink. They bring you a whole bottle and get very upset if you don&#39;t attempt to finish it. Really an awesome place to eat in Rome. Oh and by the way- we were there for 2 hours, are and drank to our hearts contention, and the bill came to under 50€.",

"reviewcomment":"This place is great.  We had our wedding here- a ceremony, followed by a lunch for about 60 people.  The food was excellent, and the location is beautiful- a nice green, spacious area outside, and lovely seating indoors.  Giovanni, the restaurant manager, took extremely good care of us throughout the planning process, and treated us and our guests extremely well on the day of our wedding.  In fact, our lunch went two hours past the time we reserved, and he didn&#39;t give us any trouble at all.  We were extremely pleased, and would recommend this place to anyone looking for a great lunch or dinner in a beautiful setting.  Also great for parties, as we had our after-party here too, with more excellent food and happy guests!",

"reviewcomment":"So first, being American, it&#39;s not common for me to sit at long tables with total strangers. I thought it would be weird, and in fact it was a bit weird at first, but you get used to it. While we didn&#39;t converse with the people next to us, they were nice enough and said hello and then just went about their conversations.<br><br>And second, being American, my expectations of service are a little different than what you end up getting in Europe. At busy times, they seat you and don&#39;t really bother with you unless you flag them over ... so I guess that&#39;s a cultural thing that I just need to get used to. Regardless, our waitress was efficient enough that it didn&#39;t bother me. She was pleasant and gave suggestions for buying a glass of wine (even though it&#39;s not in the menu anywhere). She also brought out the accoutrements with our food (i.e., the salt and pepper, the cheese, etc.) without being asked.<br><br>The food was quite good. The bread was tasty, though be warned they charge you for it if you eat it. I&#39;d recommend the cacio e pepe; a simple dish of pasta, butter, cheese and pepper, which is definitely greater than the sum of it&#39;s parts. It was simple, elegant and very flavorful. The gnocchi was also quite good; you could tell the sauce was fresh and it had nice flavor. They also brought <br><br>Taking cue from other European eaters, we stretched the meal out to 1.5 hours and had a couple nice glasses of wine and enjoyed the hustle and bustle of a popular tourist street.<br><br>Another plus was that it&#39;s very close to Trevi fountain, so you can make it an extra romantic evening with your sweetie by finishing up dinner and grabbing some gelato to savor at the fountain (with a thousand other people doing the same thing).",

Caccio e pepe for me was really good. The wife&#39;s carbonara was mediocre. Pasta was too hard - not yet al dente - and we didn&#39;t care for the flavor.

"reviewcomment":"This was far and away the nicest restaurant that I went to while in Rome. My AirBnb host suggested it for a place that most tourists would not necessarily go to because it is relatively far from the tourist attractions.<br><br>Flavio used to be the chef at a different restaurant and then decided to go off on his own. This takes &#34;hole in the wall&#34; to a new level... it really does feel more like a hole in the side of a small hill. But it&#39;s quite lovely inside, and I would suggest dressing &#34;european casual&#34; at least.<br><br>The menus are completely in Italian, which was somewhat challenging. I went with my waitress&#39; suggestion for my appetizer (fried artichoke hearts), which was great! For my main, I had the &#34;house special&#34; ravioli - also very good. I finished everything off with a house tiramisu, which was very good as well.<br><br>Their red house wine (vino della casa) was good. Would I suggest going here? Yes, but it was kinda hard for me to find... Piramide is probably the closest metro... so if you have the time and patience... this place is great!",

Unfortunately  I arrived earlier than their opening time and instead of being told to come back in an hour I was simply told they&#39;re closed, while the man cleaning the floors was only concerned that my daughter was stepping on a floor he had completed mopping. My potential business is the reason why he was mopping the floor. And if the place felt I wasn&#39;t good enough for their business then I likewise would let people who care about how they get treated the possibility of experiencing the same. I simply took my business across the street to a nice mom and pop pizza shop where I was treated with warmth and kindness and spent far less. Shame on Pizzeria San Marino.",

"reviewcomment":"We found the Osteria del Pegno, after passing on all the places in and near the Piazza Navoa. Their specials looked promising and had tasty sounding items on it, so we took a chance. It was an iffy chance because most of the restaurants we&#39;d passed closer in to the piazza Navona were crammed with people and this one was dead empty (although one young Italian couple came in later.) They had a very extensive menu, with explanations in English, so it was obvious that they get lots of tourists, but I wanted to try one of their specials. I went out to re-read their special board and ordered tagliarini with fresh porcini mushrooms and ravioli with spinach and riccota. Both sounded good so I had the taglarini and my wife ordered the ravioli. Both turned out to be wonderful - my tagliarini was much better than a similar meal we&#39;d had just last night - and we&#39;d thought that was good. It contained mushrooms that were much fresher and hadn&#39;t been cooked to mush - they were nice and firm. The mushrooms had been sauteed in garlic - LOTs of garlic and olive oil and basil. After I was done with the tagliarini, there was still a lot of oil left on the plate that made for a great bread dip - which was also quite good. The raviolis were simply two enormous raviolis - each about 4 inches square. They were covered in a saffron sauce that had been made with so much saffron the sauce was bright yellow and it smelled really strongly of saffron. Both were very good, but I liked mine better - I&#39;m a sucker for the porcini mushrooms. <br><br>We returned for lunch on a weekend and it was very crowded and we were lucky to get a table. We had the same table as before but their specials didn&#39;t include the raviolis so my wife settled for the tagliorini with porcini mushrooms. I was going to try their involtini but luckily I spotted coniglio and made a quick switch. It was coniglio al la Ischia - cooked as is done on the isle of Ischia. It was a half a rabbit that had been cut into thirds and then braised, the brown sauce appeared to be a wine sauce that didn&#39;t have a lot in it but it was decidedly garlic and contained some halved cherry tomatos. I wasn&#39;t initially going to have any wine for lunch, but after seeing the rabbit, I had to go for it - and then I found they had a Barolo by Marchese di Barolo for only E30 - that was the clincher. It was really good. I can&#39;t find rabbit at restaurants in the states so when in Rome... After lunch, we had a cafe and I then had a lemoncello. After a quick trip down to the toilet, when I returned there were two more lemoncellos on the table. The waitress had brought them by and compliments of the house. How nice! <br><br>This is most definitely a place to eat.",

Everyone who works there are very friendly and speak english for all the tourists out there. Its a bit of a walk from the main part of Rome, but i think it&#39;s worth every step. They have a bruschetta menu, a pasta menu, pizza menu, huge salad menu, f*ucking amazing mojitos and beer. It&#39;s really an establishment that cannot be beat by taste. it&#39;s the ultimate lounge, dive bar and restaurant all combined.

"reviewcomment":"This was the best meal my wife and I had in Rome.  This is the type of place the tourist guide tell you to try and find, and I would recommend being adventurous when going as the typical tourist dishes can be found anywhere.  The wait staff knew as much English as we knew Italian, but they were very patient and very friendly.<br><br>The menu presented had all dishes detailed in 3 languages (Italian, German, and English). They have a chef recommendation section that you should really consider ordering from (if they took the time to select these dishes, they must be proud of them).  They seem to specialize in meats and there are many classic roman dishes as well as local dishes most tourist places ignore. All the dishes we had were excellent and very reasonably priced for the portions. <br><br>We started with an appetizer of steamed clams that was very good, and had a nice seasoned flavor that I wouldn&#39;t have thought to try with seafood.  It was almost like a basil or oregano flavor. Very tasty and not too filling.<br><br>From the chef&#39;s selection menu, I ordered the wild boar and I think it is one of the best prepared meats I have ever had.  I am used to boar having a gamey flavor to it, but there was none of that in this dish.  It had a very flavorful rosemary marinade that really made this dish.  I would order it again in a heartbeat.<br><br>My wife ordered a spaghetti bolognese.  The sauce was flavorful, but it is at almost any place you order it in Rome.  I think she would have been more adventurous if she went back as she thought I was crazy for ordering the boar, but was really impressed when she tried it.  She really enjoyed the dish though.<br><br>We had a desert but I don&#39;t know what it was called.  Due to the language barrier, we were shown the desert options and we picked the chocolate cake looking option that was highly recommended by our waitress.  It was very tasty and highly recommended by both myself and my wife.  Be aware that it is very dense and 1 piece should be more than enough to share.<br><br>For appetizer, dinner, desert and wine the cost averaged to 23€ per person.<br><br>This place is great as long as going into the experience:<br><br>1. You are willing to try something different<br>2. Are willing to try out your Italian speaking skills<br><br>One last thing to note, they do allow smoking in the restaurant itself.  This does bother some people so be aware.",

"reviewcomment":"This place is simply fantastic!<br>You&#39;ll find Augusto on the small Piazza dé Renzi in the prencint of Travestere, which has become a haven for tourist looking for that thing that the Italians do best: food. Only thing is, the area becomes like any other tourist precint, bowing to the wishes of the tourists and losing the tradtional touches and tastes. This place seems to have maintained it though. And it is far from overstated, the most simple, but delightful restaurant I found in the area. I looked for this place especially on account of a friend&#39;s recommendation, and needless to say I was not disappointed. Decor is very simple. The tables and chairs outside don&#39;t match, and are covered in a paper table cloth. This proves very useful later on when the waiter uses it to write down your bill, before replacing it for the next guest ;) The menu is a printed on a piece of paper and kept inside a plastric sleeve. Beer comes in &#34;long necks&#34; (750mL bottles) and wine pured out of barrels at the bar. Service is on the spot and helpful and the dishes are very simple but delish. The Italian style of eating is not trying to create a dish that has everything happening at once, but to do one flavour, and do it well, in small quantities, so you have enough room for your antipastos, pasta, primas, secondis and dolches. These guys nail this. <br>In short, food was fantastic, atmosphere charming, and the real give away that tells you how good this place is? Situated in the tourist precint, this place was full of basically locals (us being the exception ;) )",

We had two appetizers, two entrees (and one salad), and two desserts.  We also had a carafe of red wine, and two shots of limoncello at the end.  The total bill came out close to €80.",

Separated into several small rooms, to give privacy to their customers and that feeling of a house dinner, the personnel barely speak any Italian but can serve original Chinese food cooked in a real good way. On the other hand forget about most of the Chinese dishes you eat anywhere else, they&#39;re probably just an adaptation to our habits. If you want to experience the real Chinese tradition, this is definitely the place.<br>Note: credit cards not accepted, free WiFi available.",

"reviewcomment":"THE BEST RESTAURANT IN ALL OF ROME - but seriously.  I lived in Rome for 4 months and absolutely loved this place.  The prices are sensible, the food cannot be beat and the owners and staff go above and beyond.  I fell in love with this place and whenever friends and family came to visit this was our first stop.   <br><br>Anything you order is going to be amazing.  And it helps that they offer an english menu.  I recommend the Carbonara, the rigatoni with tomato sauce and sausage, the pasta with shrimp and each of the soups was delicious. To be honest, I never had a bad meal here and everyone I went with always had wonderful things to say as well.  I really cannot say enough good things about this restaurant.  Great ambience for a date night or fun place to go with a group.  Definitely a must on any trip to Rome.",

"reviewcomment":"We got 2 sandiwches/pannini&#39;s  for a total of 4.60 Euro at the Deli section of the store.  Really cheap for lunch if you ask me and tons of locals and tourists go to this shop.  They are very friendly and even take credit card.  They also sell a European to US (3 prong) adapter for laptops if you need it.  They eat their panini&#39;s cold, which in the states, we usually eat ours toasted/heated.  I got used to it.  I would definitely come here again.<br><br>Had their caffe espresso and caffe macchiato at their sit down location just next door to their deli shop.  Great place to sit on the side of the street and just to people watch and to watch the street vendors trying to sell their &#34;gooey/gel&#34; toy. Their espresso was VERY strong and bitter.  I like mine to be a little sweeter so I added a whole pack of sugar into it.  The macchiato was nice and creamy.",

"reviewcomment":"One thing that has always struck me about Rome is the lack of choice when it comes to international cuisine. The city is unsurprisingly full of Italian restaurants, but if you want something a bit different, then it can be tricky to find somewhere good.<br><br> Cue my surprise and pleasure when I discovered Maharajah, tucked away down a fairly quiet road in Rome. Specialising in tandoori cuisine, but also with a good selection of curries, the quality and presentation of the food is very good, combining with a very pleasant atmosphere (although, better on the ground floor than in the basement) and excellent service. Mains are about EUR10-EUR14, rice is cheekily priced at EUR6, and naan EUR3. They also do some very reasonable set menus around the EUR25 mark.<br><br> As a Brit who misses his curry, I&#39;ve been dying to find somewhere good in Rome, and Maharaja hits the spot nicely.",

"reviewcomment":"I may have found my new favorite pizza place in Rome.<br><br>Think Pizzarium, but less touristy and half the price.<br>As soon as you enter Pizzeria Florida, grab a ticket near the entrance and wait your number. There are many people in peak times, but the lines go fast and the delicious, unique, mouthwatering pizza is worth it.<br><br>I will be coming back multiple times and attempt to try all of the fantastic flavors.",
