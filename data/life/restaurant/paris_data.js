"reviewcomment":"Wow! For a Wednesday night, this place was crazy busy. I&#39;m so glad that I made reservations via Open Table.<br><br>My dining partner was running late. There&#39;s a big sign at the host stand stating they only hold reservations for 10 minutes.  Yikes! Thankfully,  they were nice enough to seat me even though my friend arrived 20 minutes late.<br><br>They have a great vegetarian selection which is why we picked Saffron.  We shared the saag paneer and a special dish with eggplants. The naan sampler was a great choice...especially if you&#39;re a carboholic like me.",

Fried Banana, Sweet Potato, and even a Tequila based ice cream were all on the menu and all were sure darn tasty. My favorite was the Fried Bananas (I need this in my life soon ASAP), followed by the Tequila and Sweet Potatoes. I never even know they made Tequila ice cream but def was feeling the taste and light hints on my palate. <br><br>Next time I host a party I think I&#39;ll reach out to this business. My friend said they cater to most flavors/ideas so I think this will be a nice treat for my guests, you know, something uniquely delicious. <br><br>I even heard I can scoop some flavors up at Whole Foods so I&#39;ll be looking for that if I get an itch prior..<br><br>All around very very tasty.",

The food is excellent, and the service is great.<br><br>The Burl Kogi Sammy offers a very unique taste that satisfies a particular (indescribable) craving. You will know what I mean the second you try it. <br>This place is very small, but there&#39;s no chance I will dock it a star for that. After all, it&#39;s in SF. If you have to eat close by and there is no room in the cafe, I recommend the short walk to Huntington or Union Sq. Park to eat in the sun.

"reviewcomment":"I had been entering the lottery for a party of 2 for months and months and months, so when I received word there would be a dinner the weekend our friends were coming to visit, I said, &#34;What the hey!&#34; and entered us for 4.  <br><br>The attention to detail that Lazy Bear expounds is unbelievable. Every plate, every bite is flawless. I have quite the laundry list of allergies and, while back in the kitchen -- which by the way they totally encourage you to go to and give you gelato if you do! -- I heard Chef David start to recite them by heart and make sure those ingredients were kept off my plate. <br><br>While the food (and the price) is nothing short of upscale, the experience is as relaxing and carefree as can be. BYOB (or wine in our case) and they&#39;ll even chill it for you if you&#39;d like. There is no pressure to dress up, the wonderful people running this joint are very gregarious and approachable, and everyone around you is making yummy sounds and having a good time, so you can too!<br><br>Our friends were at a loss for words afterwards, except to record every morsel they ate and muse over the incredible bread and butter. And all my fiancé had to say was, &#34;Enter us into the lottery from now until forever.&#34;",

It was really beautiful to I think its at a hotel this place. Its funny because when I got out of my car I was walking around a little confused which direction the front door was located at, and suddenly I realized it was really quiet and the building was beautiful and made out of brick and there were flowers, and a limo..and I go deja vue that I was in a past life on an episode of the bachelor.. my boo ( I dont know what to call him ,we arent official yet because I am weird but thats another story haha)  walked up and saw the confusion on my face and I told him &#34; I feel like I am on the Bachelor, where is my Rose &#34; hahah but yah we went inside and it is almost cave like in there, each table has a hot pot.. the food is really good, we had a pre fix menu for Valentines day. I also tried one of their Mojitos . <br><br>I would def return here. I know it was a little pricey ( I didnt look at the bill! ) but I would def come back here , our server was incredible, I cant remember her name but she was sweet and attentive.

"reviewcomment":"Prior to visiting Cowgirl Creamery, I knew jack about cheese. My first intro to &#34;cooking&#34; was to toast two slices of Kraft processed cheddar on white bread, and tried not to burn the hell out of it. This was when I was about 8 and had to make my own after school snack. Gourmet enough for an 8 year old, but heavily scoffed by the Mission Hipster (wait, aren&#39;t Mission Hipsters mostly Asian American TechHead dork types these days now wearing collar shirts and taking notes with a clip pen and paper pad at the sooshy bar? Doh...)<br><br>But as an adult, the world is thy oyster, or wheels and wheels and wheels of fine high end gourmet cheese! Such is the case at Cowgirl Creamery cheese store at the Ferry Building, a deli and a smorgasboard of variety.<br><br>We are blessed to live in an area that makes great use of natural quality resources, as well as having knowledgeable folks who turn this stuff into various types of magic. Cowgirl Creamery makes some unbelieveable cheese, but they also put in the effort of being a distributor of cheese made by other independent Californian cheese farmers/makers, so you can buy some very interesting selections in addition to their own products.<br><br>I dropped by CC with the intention of buying some cheese....but it wasn&#39;t for your average frou frou picnic of spreading Mt Tam with Acme bread, while downing a Blue Bottle or Sightglass with some Hog Island oysters and stone grilled Frog Hollow Farm peaches, followed by some porchetta sandwich, with a side of some Miette Cupcakes smothered with Boccalone lardo slices all around, some bao&#39;s from that funky Chinese place, and ending with a hot milk tea from Out The Door followed by a fun time on the throne... <br><br>The object of the game was to find several cheese varieties from hopefully a one stop shop (I actually made two separate stops in the end) to pair with three different flavor profiles of pinot noir wine, and a burgundy from France! I love a good challenge.<br><br>I settled on the following<br><br>Cowgirl Creamery&#39;s Red Hawk<br><br>Basseri from Baringa Ranch in Marshall, CA <br><br>Mt Tam (for a separate consumption)<br><br>Cypress Grove goat milk with dill<br><br>First of all, the Mt Tam is goregeous like everyone says. A really smooth triple cream with a hint of....mushroom. Great for any application, and you can even melt it with other cheese for whatever reason. It spreads great as well.<br><br>But...for wine pairing, particularly strong pinot noir and burgundy, the Red Hawk is a show stealer. It is as they say, a Mt Tam with a rind, but it is actually a bit firmer and pungent/stronger with a nice umami component. Much so that if you melt the Red Hawk a bit (e.g. for grilled cheese) it can be incredible, ditto for Mac Cheese. <br>But, you want to unwrap the cheese after purchasing and let it air out. The center then becomes a bit softer, and the more you eat and drink (wine), the more flavor intense it becomes. Burgundy (and pinot) pairs well with a stinky French cheese called Epoisse (which is the famous cheese from Burgundy region)....but with a Red Hawk, you can get something fairly close apparently. So if you have a pinot and a burgundy, drink the pinot first, and try some Red Hawk with it. Then let the Red Hawk sit, and then move on to the Burgundy....both will taste even more intense.<br><br>The Basseri (meaning &#34;farm house&#34;) is actually a Basque style sheep milk cheese. It is a firmer variety and also pairs incredibly well with a slightly lighter yet fruitier type of pinot noir (we were blessed to have Anthill pinot noir that evening). My first choice from CC was to try Fat Bottom Girl&#39;s sheep milk cheese, but they did not have that, so the salesperson recommended Basseri. Do try a sample of this!<br><br>OK I&#39;m done with cheese nerding out.<br><br>CC may not have all the varieties you have, but certainly worth a stop if you want to taste and get a very good selection of local artisanal cheese. Even if you are visiting from out of town, drop by and see this place for yourself. Remember to take a # from the right side wall, if you need help, have questions, or want to taste.",

"reviewcomment":"I love good sandwich and Deli Board definitely delivers!<br><br>Where Ike&#39;s is all about the sauce, deli board is all about the meat, and man do they give you a lot of meat!<br><br>I&#39;ve tried a few different sandwiches here recently. The Ron is pretty good, it&#39;s essentially a good cheese steak with TONs of meat plus some avocado. <br><br>The real winner here though (of the ones I&#39;ve tried so far) is the &#34;$$$&#34; - pronounced &#34;money&#34; by the lady who handed me the sandwich. Really delicious warm and gooey with TONS of flavor and meaty goodness! It contains brisket, corned beef, kosher salami, muenster cheese, cheddar cheese, cherry peppers, cole slaw, Board sauce all on a warm french roll. A delicious combination!<br><br>Be warned that you may have to wait, especially on a weekday lunch, but Deli Board is definitely worth the wait.",

"reviewcomment":"This is a thoroughly delightful little spot to grab a really yummy sandwich - no fanfare, no mentions of grass-fed-well-massaged-happy-go-lucky-meats, just super tasty, well-executed sandwiches.<br><br>As promised in other reviews, the lady running the show is so friendly and sweet, you kind of want to cancel your day and stay to eat more sandwiches. This wouldn&#39;t be a bad thing, either, because the turkey melt with avocado, mayo, mustard (x 2) and cranberry sauce on Dutch bread was simply delicious. The kind of delicious where your lover calls you while you&#39;re eating it, and you don&#39;t pick up the phone.<br><br>I will be going back regularly to try the other options, as everything looked so authentic and yummy.<br><br>Pro tip - take the time to sit down and eat outside the shop or somewhere nearby, so you can do this sandwich justice by eating it fresh. I grabbed one to go while on a walk and by the time I got home, a bit of sogginess had occurred. 100% my fault for not jumping on the sandwich straight away. I&#39;m sorry, turkey melt; next time I&#39;ll do right by you.",

"reviewcomment":"Submarine Center is most definitely one of my favorite places in the city.  I stumbled upon it by complete accident when I moved to the area last year, and I&#39;ve been frequenting this place, and introducing friends to it, ever since.  <br><br>Before I even get into the food, big shoutout to the guys who work at this place.  The employees here are awesome!  Although sometimes I wonder if they ever go home or take days off, because it&#39;s the same amazing guys in there making sandwiches every time I go in.  But it&#39;s great to always be welcomed by friendly faces, and they&#39;ve even started to memorize my order (which is impressive, because this place is BUSY.)<br><br>The sandwiches are amazing.  Pretty basic, but there&#39;s just something about them that puts them above all the rest.  I do love how they stick all of the sandwiches in the oven for a few minutes to get the cheese nice and melted and they bread perfectly toasted.  <br><br>I could seriously go on for days about how much I love this place, but I&#39;ll refrain from writing an essay about sandwiches.  The place is very small and unsuspecting, but do NOT underestimate it! It&#39;s incredible.  It does get busy around lunch and dinner, but it&#39;s worth the wait.  It&#39;s also worth the drive out to West Portal if you don&#39;t already live out in that area of the city.  GO!  This is the easiest 5-stars I&#39;ve given on Yelp.",

Good selection of salads and sandwiches, and the food is very fresh and tasty.

They greeted me promptly and everyone was warm and friendly.<br><br>We started with the tiger prawn ravioli which was cooked in a light sauce and melted in your mouth. It was fantastic as it was unique.<br><br>She had the duck confit and I had the lamb. I expected a small dish being European but there was a good amount on my plate.<br>Her duck was good and tasty although my lamb was probably the best I have ever had. I&#39;m still thinking of this it!!!<br><br>It included a small bed of greens which were very flavorful as with the pommes landaise which were tasty but a tad but greasy.<br><br>All in all food was great, service was great and made for a great Saturday night. We didn&#39;t drink but the check wasn&#39;t even too bad either. Perfect place for a date in the city, hope to go back and tear up their filet!",

You do have a cheese pot but there are other pots with olive oil for steak and poultry and seafood.. and then for dessert to... <br><br>The service here is immaculate. It was really beautiful to I think its at a hotel this place. Its funny because when I got out of my car I was walking around a little confused which direction the front door was located at, and suddenly I realized it was really quiet and the building was beautiful and made out of brick and there were flowers, and a limo..and I go deja vue that I was in a past life on an episode of the bachelor.. my boo ( I dont know what to call him ,we arent official yet because I am weird but thats another story haha)  walked up and saw the confusion on my face and I told him &#34; I feel like I am on the Bachelor, where is my Rose &#34; hahah but yah we went inside and it is almost cave like in there, each table has a hot pot.. the food is really good, we had a pre fix menu for Valentines day. I also tried one of their Mojitos . <br><br>I would def return here. I know it was a little pricey ( I didnt look at the bill! ) but I would def come back here , our server was incredible, I cant remember her name but she was sweet and attentive.

"reviewcomment":"To the point: This place is a must visit. The food is excellent, and the service is great.<br><br>The Burl Kogi Sammy offers a very unique taste that satisfies a particular (indescribable) craving. You will know what I mean the second you try it. <br>This place is very small, but there&#39;s no chance I will dock it a star for that. After all, it&#39;s in SF. If you have to eat close by and there is no room in the cafe, I recommend the short walk to Huntington or Union Sq. Park to eat in the sun. The service is great, the staff is beyond pleasant!<br><br>Check it out!",

But we always cut them in half so we both get half of each. <br><br>I also love having no idea what any of the plastic wrapped goodies on the counter are. Sometimes when we are feeling ballsy we but one and eat it. Those are a lottery, cause even after eating them I couldn&#39;t tell you what they are. Sometimes they are sweet and some times, not so much.<br><br>They have puddings? In the fridge with jelly or nuts or something in them. They are in the bottom of the fridge, those are good too. But I also couldn&#39;t tell you what they are. <br><br>I guess I could ask what all of them are. But if you are there at lunch it&#39;s very fast, and if I&#39;m not, I feel like if I knew it would take some of the fun out of it! <br><br>Over all they are super fast at making the sandwiches and they are on top of remembering who ordered what with out a computer.

"reviewcomment":"City Smoke House catered my boyfriend&#39;s surprise party earlier this year. My guests were very pleased with their meal (I had chefs at the party and they gave it the thumbs up). It was great to also have no delivery charge for being in SF. <br><br>Communication: We communicated primarily through email. I contacted them just about 2.5 weeks before the event. They were timely in all communications and incredibly responsive/helpful. When the gentleman came in to set up the food, he was on time and very polite. <br><br>Food: I opted for the 3 meat/3 side combo. I ordered for 23 people, but I probably could&#39;ve gotten away with ordering for 18-19 or a smaller combo. I ended up with more than 23 people and we had plenty of leftovers (if not almost too much).  I ordered the pulled pork, beef brisket and rotisserie chicken for the meat. The pulled pork and brisket were the stars of the meal. For the sides, mac &amp; cheese, baked beans and collard greens.",

"reviewcomment":"I took my two boys (13 and 16) for a long weekend in San Francisco.  We stayed at the Courtyard Marriott, which has 3 pizza places within a half block of the hotel.  I looked all of them up on Yelp and this one had the best reviews, so we decided to try it.  After a LONG day walking around the city, we were exhausted and hungry.  The place is small, but wasn&#39;t too busy for a Saturday night.  All outdoor seating, but they have heat lamps so it wasn&#39;t cold at all.  We ordered 2 pizzas between the 3 of us.  We had a cheese pizza and a pepperoni pizza.  Our friends that were with us had the pizza panini.  Everything we ordered was delicious. They use very fresh ingredients in everything, and the pizza is thin crust, but the crust is amazingly delicious.  They say the pizzas are supposed to be sort of individual sized, but we had 2 pizzas between 3 of us and there were a couple of extra pieces, so our friends ate them.  We could not waste that delicious pizza!<br><br>They serve beer and wine, although a limited selection, and sodas, which are in a case and you help yourself.  Very informal, but definitely worth a visit.  We liked it so much that we decided to go back again a couple of nights later.  <br><br>The second time i ordered a ceasar salad, which was $9 so i though it would be fairly large.  it was really just an individual portion.  I think the pizza&#39;s and other items on the menu are reasonably priced, but $9 for a ceasar salad...really?",

"reviewcomment":"The wait for this small, cute, and delicious seafood bar was two hours! I think a lot of people waited over two hours for this place and that two hour wait was so worth it!<br><br>The BF and I came here on our day trip to SF.  We arrived there was a bunch of people waiting outside since the restaurant is so small and there&#39;s no wait room inside. I put my name on the board (the board is located by the door) along with the time we arrived. The worker told us it would be about an hour and a half wait for a party of two so we walked around and checked out bars/shops around the vicinity.<br><br>Two hours later we were finally seated! We sat at the bar and the seating was very tight. To my right (literally we were touching elbows) was another customer and behind me was another customer sitting at a table.  I had to make sure I didn&#39;t move otherwise I would hit all those around me, including my BF! We ordered a dozen of oysters and the cioppino bowl to share. The oysters were super fresh and melted in my mouth. Get these if you like oysters! The cioppino was so flavorful and loaded with fresh and yummy seafood. The broth and garlic bread was legit. Man, I wanted to eat more of that garlic bread. SUPER LEGIT! The bowl was larger than my head! Thank goodness we shared. Even then, we took a lot home because we were unable to finish the meal. <br><br>The service was excellent! The workers were friendly and chatted with us freely. The restaurant is super small and crammed but that&#39;s what makes this place special. It was clean, the staff was amazing, and the food was even more amazing. I walked out and told everyone who was outside waiting outside it&#39;s worth the two hour wait. The hungry people outside looked relieved :)",

Next,we ordered the bouillabaisse which was the perfect portion of each seafood. The bread definitely added to the finishing touch for the soup. My friend ordered the duck, which was moist and delicious. For desserts, we ordered the French toast which was different than the breakfast French toast and super creamy with that yummy hazelnut cream. I ordered the chocolate rum cake which was perfect with the rum raisin ice cream. <br><br>Everything was just perfect for the price. The place gets crowded and can get a little tight with tables close by, but honestly it did not bug me. Just be sure to make a reservation in advance.

"reviewcomment":"Two words...pure wow! Such a little gem tucked in a residential neighborhood. Food and service was amazing!! The waiter really made our night...what a funny guy! <br>My friend was flying out of SFO and we tried to spend his last day here in SF doing touristy things. He has never tried French food in the US so of course I turned to yelp to find the perfect dining place.<br> We started off with 3 appetizers: a plate of cold cut/cured meat (procuitto, duck, chicken pâté, rabbit pâté, beef, pork butt rolled in bacon - forgive me but I don&#39;t remember all the fancy names for the meats but it was amazing!!), garlic butter escargot, beef tartare. Although I&#39;m not a beef eater myself, I heard the tartare is to die for. If my bf could, he would&#39;ve licked the plate clean. We ordered entrees to share: mussels in curry-garlic white wine w/side order of fries , medium rare duck over a bead of greens and potatoes with liqueur soaked cherries, and scallop risotto. Everything was just perfectly cooked and executed. The plating of every dish was beautiful. By the time we finished our meal, every plate was scraped clean. Who says you have to leave a tiny bit of food on your plate to be polite?!? Not us!  We were showing the chef we REALLY enjoyed every last bit of food. <br>    We ended the night with creme brûlée. It was silky and creamy- so rich and delicious! I will go back to try their strawberry in peppered balsamic vinegar. It was highly recommended but we didn&#39;t have space for 2 desserts.<br><br>I will be back soon!!! Loved everything about this place. :)",

My childhood friends mom does fondue every xmas eve so thats always something that I have to look forward to once a year. I love fondue ! Popular to the misconceived notion , its not just cheese. You do have a cheese pot but there are other pots with olive oil for steak and poultry and seafood.. and then for dessert to... <br><br>The service here is immaculate. It was really beautiful to I think its at a hotel this place. Its funny because when I got out of my car I was walking around a little confused which direction the front door was located at, and suddenly I realized it was really quiet and the building was beautiful and made out of brick and there were flowers, and a limo..and I go deja vue that I was in a past life on an episode of the bachelor.. my boo ( I dont know what to call him ,we arent official yet because I am weird but thats another story haha)  walked up and saw the confusion on my face and I told him &#34; I feel like I am on the Bachelor, where is my Rose &#34; hahah but yah we went inside and it is almost cave like in there, each table has a hot pot.. the food is really good, we had a pre fix menu for Valentines day. I also tried one of their Mojitos . <br><br>I would def return here. I know it was a little pricey ( I didnt look at the bill! ) but I would def come back here , our server was incredible, I cant remember her name but she was sweet and attentive. I will def come back here !! :) great place for a date. .",

I&#39;ve only had beer at this place, and not at Suppenküche, so I can&#39;t compare them on that point. <br><br>Beer - my friends got one of the specials in a 2 liter boot. It was expensive ($20 per liter) and not quite my cup of tea (or boot of beer?). I on the other hand, got a hefewizen on the regular menu ($5.75 for 1/3 liter) and loved it. <br><br>Pork cheek (special) - loved it! Tender, marinated perfectly, served with noodles (seemed like they were spaetzles). Only wished there were more of the noodles - so chewy and yummy! <br><br>Wienerschnitzel - nom nom nom. Thinly sliced meat with thin crust, fried to perfection. I thought it was great! <br><br>We also got two other dishes - one chicken and another that I don&#39;t remember. Both of them were yummy. We also got two dessert dishes - an apple strudel and a jam cookie (?). Both were not too sweet and well executed in general.               <br><br>All in all, I would go back to this place any time I feel like having hearty fried food with good beer.",

"reviewcomment":"Great small shop with friendly service with a smile!<br>    This was our first visit walking around the area of Glenn Park, close to the BART station, pretty clean and safe neighborhood.<br>    We got the 1/2 lb of parmesiano reggiano was for shredding on top of a pasta dish was melt in your mouth goodness (invest in a  microplane, is a small grater that you will love for this purpose).  The 1/2 lb double creme Gouda was mild and smooth was for a cracker cheese and salami appetizer with also the 1/2 lb orange cheese with chives and onions was so unique and delicious. total was under $20.<br>     Gourmet pastas, maple syrup, found red currant jelly for $4 for a rib recipe I&#39;ve been wanting to try.  The have triple creme brie, too rich for guests to devour, but maybe next time!",

"reviewcomment":"In true Judy fashion, I have a new obsession: English afternoon tea. I&#39;ve never been this excited about something British related since the Spice Girls. Yeah, I&#39;m bringing it waaay back. <br><br>I experienced my first afternoon tea sesh at Lovejoy&#39;s Tea Room with my two besties on a gloomy Sunday. We were ooh-ing and ahh-ing over their adorable and vintage tea sets, the cozy yet regal decor, and the impeccable sweet and savory finger foods.<br><br>My friends and I each ordered the Queen&#39;s Tea Set which includes two sandwiches served with cabbage salad (coleslaw), organic spring greens, mixed fruits, one scone, a crumpet, a Petit Four (small dessert), and a tea biscuit. Essentially, it is a buffet with petite foods. How cute! And let&#39;s not forget the bottomless tea pots (it is called afternoon TEA). I decided on the White Peach which paired well with the food because it was not overwhelmingly strong. A light and sweet drink to accompany our little delights.<br><br>Now for the tea sandwiches! My friends and I divided and conquered. We sampled six different tiny crustless sandwiches (* denotes favorite):<br>- Cucumber &amp; Cream Cheese<br>- Chicken-Apple-Walnut Salad*<br>- Salmon Mousse<br>- Bay Shrimp &amp; Mayonnaise <br>- Chicken &amp; Asparagus*<br>- Lovejoy&#39;s Daily Special* <br><br>I can&#39;t remember what was in their special but there was chicken involved, and it was simply delicious. You can&#39;t go wrong with any of the sandwich choices. All of their daintily cut sandwiches are packed with massive flavors. We also loved the blueberry scones, which were soft and light. Spread some of their tantalizing strawberry jam and you are in sweet pastry heaven. The crumpet was the only thing that we weren&#39;t crazy about. It&#39;s a waffle-cake hybrid: part waffle in texture but tastes like pancake. It was also very fluffy and hard to cut. We were presented with an assortment of Petit Fours after our meal. I had some type of mocha confectionery--a dense brownie coated with mocha. Mmmm, diabetes!<br><br>Loyejoy&#39;s is the perfect spot for an afternoon with friends, a romantic date, or a classy bridal shower. We were smitten with the perfectly mismatched china and eclectic setting. This place is essentially an antique shop that serves tea. I&#39;m pretty sure if my grandmas were British, they would be sitting in a place like Lovejoy&#39;s sipping on some tea and petting their furry kitties.<br><br>Quick tips:<br>- Make reservations because seating is limited and due to its popularity, Lovejoy&#39;s accommodates very few walk-ins. <br>- There is a two hour maximum seating time and they will kindly inform you that your time is up and you need to bounce (not in those exact words).<br>- Use the restroom before you leave! Trust me, with all of that tea you&#39;re gulping down, you don&#39;t want to risk it. <br><br>Pinkies up!",

My childhood friends mom does fondue every xmas eve so thats always something that I have to look forward to once a year. I love fondue ! Popular to the misconceived notion , its not just cheese. You do have a cheese pot but there are other pots with olive oil for steak and poultry and seafood.. and then for dessert to... <br><br>The service here is immaculate. It was really beautiful to I think its at a hotel this place. Its funny because when I got out of my car I was walking around a little confused which direction the front door was located at, and suddenly I realized it was really quiet and the building was beautiful and made out of brick and there were flowers, and a limo..and I go deja vue that I was in a past life on an episode of the bachelor.. my boo ( I dont know what to call him ,we arent official yet because I am weird but thats another story haha)  walked up and saw the confusion on my face and I told him &#34; I feel like I am on the Bachelor, where is my Rose &#34; hahah but yah we went inside and it is almost cave like in there, each table has a hot pot.. the food is really good, we had a pre fix menu for Valentines day. I also tried one of their Mojitos . <br><br>I would def return here. I know it was a little pricey ( I didnt look at the bill! ) but I would def come back here , our server was incredible, I cant remember her name but she was sweet and attentive.

"reviewcomment":"This is a food truck that&#39;s parked next to Fed Ex by Napoleon St at Evans Ave. The hours are actually 6pm- midnight. I ordered the double burger with everything: Bun, 2 Burger patties, Bacon, Egg, Frankfurter, Ham, Cheese, Corn, Lettuce, Tomato, Grilled onion and Pineapple. I thought this burger was delicious but...I thought $12 was a little steep. $12 for a burger from a guy who&#39;s cooking in the back of his van, that&#39;s a price for a gourmet sit down joint. I wasn&#39;t quite full after the burger so I had another dinner after this and I don&#39;t think I&#39;m a big eater. But I really liked the burger and I&#39;m a sucker for pineapples. I also LOVE bacon and eggs on any burgers or sandwiches. I really want to give this place 4 stars but just because they had eggs and bacon I give them 4.5 stars and since I always round up, I&#39;ll give them 5 stars. <br><br>Also the cook seemed to be very conscience about cleanliness. I noticed he had gloves on and was conscience about cross contaminating with money.",

"reviewcomment":"Our first trip to Chinatown ended in a hike up to Henry&#39;s thanks to the reviews here on Yelp. I had a hard time believing a five-star restaurant could be reasonably priced. Boy am I glad we took the chance.<br><br>Our waitress recommended the meat pie to start, and it was excellent. It&#39;s served in four slices that are probably big enough to each be an appetizer alone.<br><br>I always order a house special when I&#39;m at a new restaurant, and at Henry&#39;s those specialties are smoked Hunan-style. I decided to get the Marty&#39;s Special, because I thought it was funny, since my name&#39;s Marty and I don&#39;t see it often.<br><br>The waitress thought I had been here before and said I knew how to order, because the Marty&#39;s Special is fantastic. The chicken in it was good enough but the pork was worth the price alone. Tender and smoky, it was easily the best I&#39;ve had yet.<br><br>We also got the fried rice and the hot and sour chicken, which were both good but didn&#39;t hold a candle next tithe meat pie and the smoked pork. Next time we&#39;ll just get those two and share; it&#39;s plenty for two people.",

My childhood friends mom does fondue every xmas eve so thats always something that I have to look forward to once a year. I love fondue ! Popular to the misconceived notion , its not just cheese. You do have a cheese pot but there are other pots with olive oil for steak and poultry and seafood.. and then for dessert to... <br><br>The service here is immaculate. It was really beautiful to I think its at a hotel this place. Its funny because when I got out of my car I was walking around a little confused which direction the front door was located at, and suddenly I realized it was really quiet and the building was beautiful and made out of brick and there were flowers, and a limo..and I go deja vue that I was in a past life on an episode of the bachelor.. my boo ( I dont know what to call him ,we arent official yet because I am weird but thats another story haha)  walked up and saw the confusion on my face and I told him &#34; I feel like I am on the Bachelor, where is my Rose &#34; hahah but yah we went inside and it is almost cave like in there, each table has a hot pot.. the food is really good, we had a pre fix menu for Valentines day. I also tried one of their Mojitos . <br><br>I would def return here. I know it was a little pricey ( I didnt look at the bill! ) but I would def come back here , our server was incredible, I cant remember her name but she was sweet and attentive.

"reviewcomment":"So I&#39;m not from Eastern Europe but all of my relatives / grandparents are - and this is the food I&#39;ve grown up with. Short and Sweet - it&#39;s very good and such a great new experience vs. going to the German Restaurants around town that don&#39;t take reservations and have gotten Americanized. This food is not spicy and it&#39;s not supposed to be. It&#39;s an excellent representation of what I grew up with - Pierogies and all. <br><br>I&#39;ve been bragging about this place to all of my friends and finally remembered to review it. ######HashTag LOVE IT. just jaggin bout the hash tags. <br><br>Stopped in here on a Sunday evening - all quiet on the western front - just a few tables seated. The owner and his waitress were working. My pally - my friend - Bob J on here highly touted this place - I looked at yelp and saw both good and bad - but you know - some people have really 5 Star expectations at a dive bar so you can&#39;t trust everyone. <br><br>The owner recommended a Czech beer that was delicious and I haven&#39;t seen it before at the other German/European jaunts that I go to on a regular so that was a nice surprise. <br><br>I ordered the Hungarian Goulash - a great word to say anytime of the day and it was very good. I will have it again definitely. My friend ordered the Homemade Pork Sausage and they were OUTSTANDING. <br><br>We finished with the Apple strudel and OMG it was soooooooo good. A perfect ending to any meal. I highly recommend and it&#39;s okay to wait a bit for your reservation - making a reservation on a Friday/Saturday night does not guarantee that you&#39;ll be sat at that very moment. It blows me away when people complain about having to wait on a weekend - take a seat at the bar, have a beer or a glass of wine and anticipate a hearty delicious meal. <br><br>Entrees are mostly 15 to 20. Extremely reasonably priced.",

"reviewcomment":"Absolutely spectacular. Special occasion? Romantic outing? Glutton at heart? You should treat yourself to an amazing dinner.<br><br>The dining room is not that big. From the outside it looks like it&#39;s part of an housing complex, yet once you get into the main room it&#39;s reminiscent of a retrofitted wine cellar (look at the beams on the ceiling). It felt like there were maybe a dozen or so tables.<br><br>The menu is prix fixe only and you can choose between three course and five course. In our party the men opted for the five while the women did the four. If I were to do it again I&#39;d definitely do the four course. Five courses is just way too indulgent.<br><br>Food is great. Presentation and flavor are excellent. The Italian cuisine felt very Californian-inspired, with the seasonal produce and common favorites. Many dishes had nice spins on them. There wasn&#39;t one dish that I had a problem with. A standout to me was the sunchoke soup with seared brussels sprouts and sous vide egg.<br><br>Once you&#39;re done with your luxurious meal, you&#39;re not really done. You actually get to choose as many treats as you want from a dessert cart. This does not disappoint. It all looks so good. At this point I was just forcing myself to eat. So on top of the five course meal you also get an amuse bouche, bread, and dessert cart. Time to run a marathon.<br><br>Service is spot on. My only problem with service, and it&#39;s not really with service, is that the floors are really sensitive to movement. Whenever someone walks by you, you can hear it and feel it. It&#39;s a glaring oddity especially when everything else is done right. You might not notice it as much if you sit on the sides, but we had center stage.<br><br>____<br><br>Prepare your stomach for a flavor onslaught.",

The deserts (European style cheesecake and poppyseed cake), which are baked by the aunt, are delightfully rich in that old world way without the cloying sweetness or heaviness of traditional American deserts. <br><br>If you&#39;ve travelled in that part of Europe, The smell of their sausages and meats will transport you back.

"reviewcomment":"Honesty, if I could keep this place a secret I would but I can&#39;t help posting a review about it. <br><br>I happened upon this place by accident. We were wandering around the city for the day exploring the ferry building and china town, we&#39;d walked all the way to the end of the wharf and decided to walk up to North Beach. <br><br>Naturally we got hungry and had a quite a selection of restaurants to go to but nothing stood out to us. At one point we looked up and noticed a line of people standing outside this tiny unassuming building. Coupled with the amazing smell wafting from the door we joined them immediately without knowing what was in store or what we were waiting for. Needless to say, I&#39;m glad we did. <br><br>Be advised it&#39;s cash only but there&#39;s an ATM in the back if you forget. The pizza comes out in sheets, hot out of the oven it&#39;s cut into generous squares, and each one is heated for you before being tossed on a wicker plate along with a fork and knife (the only way to eat this pizza). It is my strong belief that the fork and knife method is to keep you from attempting to fit the whole slice in your mouth at once. <br><br>They have plain cheese, pepperoni or sausage, combo, pesto veggie, and clam and garlic. Not a single topping falls flat in my book. The crust is PERFECTION and I am VERY particular about my pizza crust. This is what pizza is supposed to be like!They also serve great beer on tap. <br><br>I have tried every slice more than once now and none of them fall short of amazing. By far this is my favorite pizza place possibly of all times. Every chance we come to the city we make a point to get a few slices. Its worth standing in line for!",

My childhood friends mom does fondue every xmas eve so thats always something that I have to look forward to once a year. I love fondue ! Popular to the misconceived notion , its not just cheese. You do have a cheese pot but there are other pots with olive oil for steak and poultry and seafood.. and then for dessert to... <br><br>The service here is immaculate. It was really beautiful to I think its at a hotel this place. Its funny because when I got out of my car I was walking around a little confused which direction the front door was located at, and suddenly I realized it was really quiet and the building was beautiful and made out of brick and there were flowers, and a limo..and I go deja vue that I was in a past life on an episode of the bachelor.. my boo ( I dont know what to call him ,we arent official yet because I am weird but thats another story haha)  walked up and saw the confusion on my face and I told him &#34; I feel like I am on the Bachelor, where is my Rose &#34; hahah but yah we went inside and it is almost cave like in there, each table has a hot pot.. the food is really good, we had a pre fix menu for Valentines day. I also tried one of their Mojitos . <br><br>I would def return here. I know it was a little pricey ( I didnt look at the bill! ) but I would def come back here , our server was incredible, I cant remember her name but she was sweet and attentive.

"reviewcomment":"I love chicken burgers and chicken sandwiches and fried chicken and bread and all of these things. You might say I consider myself a chickenoisseur.<br><br>My lords, ladies and gentlemen, I have a serious announcement to make.<br><br>This was the best fried chicken sandwich I&#39;ve ever had in my life.<br><br>FO REALZ.<br><br>Or perhaps I should say &#34;chicken sando&#34;, which I genuinely did not connect with the word sandwich until I asked for it and the guy repeated my order back to me minus the O and plus the WICH. Ahhhh so this is what this exotic &#34;sando&#34; means. Excellent! I&#39;m even more excited.<br><br>We fortunately managed to grab a table; a couple of screens were showing sports (UEFA Champions League on one, ice hockey on the other. Actual ice hockey! On the TV! So American!) but weren&#39;t distracting. What I DID find distracting - in a good way - was the wall plated entirely with car license (look, I spelt &#34;licence&#34; the noun like the verb, just like a native!) plates. I loved looking at these and trying to choose my favourite state design. They&#39;re so cool and colourful that they make a lovely decorative addition.<br><br>Briony C is right - get a paper menu for detail and check your app to find out what people recommend. I personally recommend everything on the menu except the chicken sando because all of those are for me, you can have anything else you like but all the chicken sandos are mine mine mine. I don&#39;t even have the adjectives. I try to formulate &#39;em but they just turn into drool.<br><br>I have a thing that I feel next time I go to San Fran I ought to try places I haven&#39;t tried before... but I will definitely be back at Garaje anyway.

"reviewcomment":"After wanting to try this place for more than a year, I finally got the chance last night.  A few tips: go with at least three other friends so you can try as many dishes as possible, line up (starts at the door and wraps to the window so you can watch the chefs preparing the food) around 3:30-4pm on weekends if you don&#39;t have a reservation (55% of the tables are for walk-ins) and there&#39;s no sign on the door or building!  If you&#39;re within the first group of 20 or so, you&#39;ll get a seat, otherwise, they&#39;ll give you a time so you can walk around and not have to wait in line.<br><br>Our favorites:<br><br>Homemade potato chips with roe and creme fraiche: only complaint is it only comes with around 6 chips!<br><br>Hamachi on a crispy nori chip: We ordered two of these... so good.  Tastes like hamachi poke.<br><br>Duck liver mousse with almond biscuits: so rich and tasty.  Be sure to ask for extra biscuits at no charge.  You&#39;ll need them for the extra mousse.<br><br>Mendocino sea urchin, ginger-scallion pancake with soy-lime sauce: a little like a Korean seafood pancake with a fresh urchin on top.<br><br>Tofu custard with bacon: better as a dessert<br><br>Quinoa porridge with wild mushrooms and ginger: like Chinese rice porridge, but with tons more flavor. <br><br>Guinea hen dumpling: Steamed dumpling with lots of flavor.  Love the mushroomy broth.<br><br>Braised Pork Belly: excellent sauce, perfectly cooked skin<br><br>Good, but just above average:<br><br>CA state bird with provisions: their specialty.  It&#39;s a fried quail with a lemony, leeky sauce on the bottom.  Pricey and less meat than two chicken wings.<br><br>Garlic Bread with Burrata: like a Chinese fried donut at the dim sum restaurants, but with a glop of cheese.<br><br>Grilled beef &amp; broccoli with umeboshi and bonito<br><br>Guava tres leches: tres leches with a side of guava jelly and whipped cream.<br><br>Oysters with chili oil, sesame seeds: $2 each.  It was good, but I might be spoiled with the Hog Wash at Hog Islabd Oyster Depot.<br><br>Skip:<br><br>Grilled beef broccoli with umeboshi and bonito: Good, but a little tough and pricey for 8 cuts of steak.   Might want to order the bone marrow instead.<br><br>Pork spare ribs: a little burnt, average flavor<br><br>Corkage is $25 for a 750ml bottle, $50 for a 1.5L bottle.",

"reviewcomment":"Tony and his staff are possibly evil geniuses. I grew up eating good pizza on the East Coast in NYC, Boston, NJ and New Haven. This has warped my view of what I deem as good, or edible pizza. So far, this place is one of two places in California that has pleased me. The owner is friendly, informative and from NYC. And he knew all the great place in New Haven. This place has some of that California styles pizza options available without compromising it&#39;s New York roots in what arguably has to have been my best ever pizza experience.<br><br>The margareta pizza, 2013 worlds best pizza winner is a crowd pleaser. Delicious, perfect, elegant and everything you would want in a margareta style pizza. They have a pizza called the New Yorker, 2013 best pizza in the US. It&#39;s coal fired, meaty, with homemade sausage and so delicious. <br><br>The owner knowing my New Haven root even offered to get the edges a &#34;little extra charred&#34; as would be common in New Haven. They did so, without burning the bottom which impressed me, or overcooking it. Yes, charring on food is bad for you... Dude, this is Pizza not Salad, get over yourself.<br><br>This place also features a good wine list, decent bar and tap list. Helpful staff, nice ambiance, a little pricey but cheaper than the Pizza Factory (a place that disappointed me).<br><br>Important this place is busy, book reserations ahead, order as take away(out) or don&#39;t be shocked to have to wait forever on a Saturday night for seating. Turn around time for the food is fair, seating time can be less than desirable. It is however worth the wait, and likely the best pizza without question on the entire west coast. <br><br>This is unless your a Chicago pizza fanatic. if so, please go back on a plane to your frozen tundra to eat your loaf of bread with ketchup and continue to think, misguided as you as it would be that somehow that is pizza. Really? I weep for you, I don&#39;t understand how Chicago style is considered pizza.",

My childhood friends mom does fondue every xmas eve so thats always something that I have to look forward to once a year. I love fondue ! Popular to the misconceived notion , its not just cheese. You do have a cheese pot but there are other pots with olive oil for steak and poultry and seafood.. and then for dessert to... <br><br>The service here is immaculate. It was really beautiful to I think its at a hotel this place. Its funny because when I got out of my car I was walking around a little confused which direction the front door was located at, and suddenly I realized it was really quiet and the building was beautiful and made out of brick and there were flowers, and a limo..and I go deja vue that I was in a past life on an episode of the bachelor.. my boo ( I dont know what to call him ,we arent official yet because I am weird but thats another story haha)  walked up and saw the confusion on my face and I told him &#34; I feel like I am on the Bachelor, where is my Rose &#34; hahah but yah we went inside and it is almost cave like in there, each table has a hot pot.. the food is really good, we had a pre fix menu for Valentines day. I also tried one of their Mojitos . <br><br>I would def return here. I know it was a little pricey ( I didnt look at the bill! ) but I would def come back here , our server was incredible, I cant remember her name but she was sweet and attentive. I will def come back here !! :) great place for a date. .",

"reviewcomment":"I hired Laurent and his team for a 200+ person VIP event in the Napa Valley. I had not worked with him before, but was very impressed with his professional and prompt emails, his attention to detail and flexibility with last minute changes. His team arrived 15 minutes early, set-up quickly and smoothly and never missed a beat. As an event manager, sometimes one of the hardest tasks is managing vendor details, but hiring Laurent and his team was an effortless process and I would do it again in the future. <br><br>Not to mention, above all, the dessert crepes were delicious! Thank you so much.",

"reviewcomment":"Brenda&#39;s has been a favorite breakfast spot for about two years since the fiance first moved up here.  While I have been lucky and not had to wait too long to be seated on any visit, I can definitely see why there tends to be long lines and wait times.  Brenda&#39;s seating areas are a tad smaller but that is not a big deal and the food more than makes up for the crowded space.  <br>   The beignet&#39;s are delicious and extremely large easily one can be shared between two people, and while my favorite beignet&#39;s are from Cafe du Monde in New Orleans, I would say these are close second.  I have yet to try the crawfish beignet but that is on my list for next visit for sure.  Besides serving up delicious beignets, Brenda&#39;s grits are full of flavor and cheese just the way they should be. <br>    I have tried both the pork belly cheddar girts with egg and the shrimp and cheddar grits and both were just as delicious as they sound.  The pork belly grits had a perfectly poached egg on top which allowed for the yolk to ooze out and spread into the all ready creamy grits and when combined with the pork belly it was spot on.  I tried the shrimp and grits on my most recent trip before I took BART to SFO for a flight to San Diego, the dish was perfect with just the right amount of plump shrimp and a tomato bacon sauce that while it had some kick it could have had a tad more spice added to it. But overall the dish was delicious and kept me feeling a satisfying full from about 11am until dinner.<br>      The shrimp and goat cheese omelet is just as scrumptious and the other dishes and just as filling.  The omelet takes up a large portion of the plate, there is no skimping on food portions here, and is fully stuffed with plump shrimp and creamy soft goat cheese chunks that when mixed with the sauce on top form this nice creamy tomato sauce with every bite.  <br>       I am planning to go back soon and order not only the crawfish beignets but also off of their lunch menu and then the Sunday Supper.",

All the quiches have a lot of the filling (bacon, veggies, cheese, etc), instead of being mostly egg), which I appreciate. <br><br>Every bread is good.<br><br>This is a place where you can grab a meal or individual baked goods to take home, both sweet and savory. <br><br>But it IS a bakery, if you come in at the very end of the day you might get something that&#39;s a little more dry or has absorbed flavors from something else it sat next to all day in the case -- that&#39;s just how bakeries work.",

"reviewcomment":"My husband and I recently dined at Benu for my birthday, and we were very impressed with the restaurant. Usually, fusion restaurants try too hard to &#34;transform&#34; Asian cuisine. However, Corey Lee did an excellent job of maintaining the taste, texture, and essence of each dish by only making slight variations.<br><br>Our favorite courses included: <br>-Beggar&#39;s purse of treasures from the oak: This small bite was packed with flavor.  It contained pureed black truffle, Parmesan cheese, Iberico ham, and a soft-boiled egg.  The beggar&#39;s purse was excellent and very unique.<br><br>-Lobster coral xiao long bao: My husband really liked the addition of lobster coral to the classic xiao long bao. It added richness and depth to the typically pork-filled dumpling.<br><br>-Salt and pepper squid: A squid ink cracker topped with diced squid, sliced serrano pepper, green onions, and dollops of cream. This small cracker was full of umami and one of my favorite bites!<br><br>-&#34;Shark&#39;s fin soup&#34; with crab, egg white, and Jinhua ham: One of the signature dishes from Benu, which features faux &#34;shark fin,&#34; made from hydrocolloid gel, in a broth of double chicken stock and ham. The soup was served piping hot, and the flavor of the broth was very good. If I were blindfolded, you could have fooled me into thinking it was real shark&#39;s fin!<br><br>-Beef rib steak with hearts of palm, wood ear mushroom, and burnet: The meat was cooked perfectly. The steak was juicy, tender, and went great with the hearts of palm. My husband easily could have eaten 5 more slices :D<br><br>-Sesame white cake with salted plum: When we first saw this course on the menu, neither of us thought we would like it. However, it turned out to be really really good. The subtle sesame flavor complemented the fluffy white cake and butter cream frosting. The frosting was some of the best butter cream frosting I have had--it was light, slightly sweet, and not too rich. I preferred the cake by itself, but there was a salted plum sauce that you could drizzle on top.<br><br>-Burnt white chocolate cake with chocolate crust: This was a complimentary dessert served for my birthday, and although it didn&#39;t look like much, it was absolutely delicious! We compared it to the TKO from Bouchon but even better. <br><br>One observation we had was although the staff was always professional and attentive, we didn&#39;t find any of the servers to be very warm. For example, the only time they wished me a Happy Birthday was when they served the complimentary dessert, and it was very brief. A few times, when my husband or I gave compliments about a particular dish we had just finished, the servers did not seem particularly interested in what we had to say (they gave a generic, &#34;Thank you&#34; and took the dishes away). This is one area where Benu could improve, given they are a Michelin 2-star restaurant.<br><br>Overall, however, we found our dinner to be a carefully planned and well-executed meal. Lee is no doubt a talented artist and chef, and I would highly recommend dining at Benu!",

"reviewcomment":"Probably the best sushi I&#39;ve ever put in my mouth!  I came here with two other friends to celebrate my friend&#39;s new job (thanks for treating us Joe!)  The restaurant is small, warm and typical of a SF boutique restaurant--lots of wood accents, painted black ceilings, and exposed incandescent light bulb fixtures.<br><br>But more importantly, the food.  Again, the best sushi I&#39;ve ever sank my teeth into.  We each did the chef&#39;s tasting menu.  16 assorted slices of heaven!  Skip the soy sauce, skip the wasabi, and just enjoy the fish with the light touches of glaze.  Best. Sushi. Ever.<br><br>There can be a wait, but scribe your name on the waiting list, jet across the street to cask house to enjoy a pre-dinner drink.  Saru is well worth the wait!<br><br>Can&#39;t wait to go back to try their chirachi during lunch, until then...go get yourself some delicious sushi at Saru!",

"reviewcomment":"The minute I bit into my Classic Tarte Flambée - it was love at first bite.  It came to no surprise to learn that esteemed owner Alex holds two Masters Degrees and comes from generations of master cooks passed down from his family, along with his pedigreed partners, Scott and Shane, a concoction mix of intellectual passions!  What a great team! APPLAUSE, APPLAUSE!<br><br>Their uniquely and well thought of dishes, reminded me of a high noon tea experience during my stay at The Peninsula Hong Kong, San Franciscan style!  First glance at their menu, WOW!,  Everything looked scrumptious!!  Thankfully, I had my trusted YELP mobile and bookmarked this place many thanks to Elite YELP friend &#34;Maria M.&#39;s&#34; recommendations from her recent visits here which left ordering, a breeze!<br><br>-- (1) Do try their Classic Tarte Flambée prepared with Bacon, caramelized Onion, Cheese, Chives and Crème Fraîche.  A must try and no is not an option. It is light and crispy and will melt in your mouth.  It left my highly opinionated BFF speechless!  That is correct, speechless.!! :p<br><br>-- (2) Their Croque Josephine - Croque Napoleon topped with One Poached Egg left me wanting more!!  Their organic house salad was just excellent.<br><br>-- ( 3) Their Chocolate Hazelnut Tartufo - A heart of dark chocolate ganache surrounded by velvety hazelnut gelato, and coated with hazelnut praline and meringue was just fantastic.  And of course, it wouldn&#39;t be complete without my cappuccino which did not disappoint!<br><br>Customer service was FIRST IN CLASS that would put The Hong Kong Peninsula a run for their money.  We cannot wait to come back for more for an exploration of their menu over and over again.  Our next on the list to try will be their Artisanal Salumi Plate and their Smoke Salmon.  I will leave the dessert for a surprise for the next visit!<br><br>Noeteca is a very pet friendly place and provides a cool water bowl for your pooch.  It is casual yet sophisticated and when it gets down to your palate, OUTSTANDING!<br><br>Cheers! :p",

My childhood friends mom does fondue every xmas eve so thats always something that I have to look forward to once a year. I love fondue ! Popular to the misconceived notion , its not just cheese. You do have a cheese pot but there are other pots with olive oil for steak and poultry and seafood.. and then for dessert to... <br><br>The service here is immaculate. It was really beautiful to I think its at a hotel this place. Its funny because when I got out of my car I was walking around a little confused which direction the front door was located at, and suddenly I realized it was really quiet and the building was beautiful and made out of brick and there were flowers, and a limo..and I go deja vue that I was in a past life on an episode of the bachelor.. my boo ( I dont know what to call him ,we arent official yet because I am weird but thats another story haha)  walked up and saw the confusion on my face and I told him &#34; I feel like I am on the Bachelor, where is my Rose &#34; hahah but yah we went inside and it is almost cave like in there, each table has a hot pot.. the food is really good, we had a pre fix menu for Valentines day. I also tried one of their Mojitos . <br><br>I would def return here. I know it was a little pricey ( I didnt look at the bill! ) but I would def come back here , our server was incredible, I cant remember her name but she was sweet and attentive. I will def come back here !! :) great place for a date. .",

Local greens and potato and garlic all roasted..  Tasty! <br><br>Potato dumpling kumla. Onion ragout. Lingonberry. Lardon . Brown butter. Individually, the components were OK, but when you took a bite and it had a bit of everything including the lardon, it s amazing! All for the lardon on the side  so that it stays crispy! <br><br>Skrieg, wild Arctic cod. Sunchoke cream. Salmon roe sorrel chanterelle mushroom. Just like the potato dumpling, take a bite with a little bit of everything, amazing  the fish alone was buttery and delish!! <br><br>Squab breast. Potato florette. Cabbage forest mushroom. Lemon tarragon jus. The squab was made two ways, roasted and also confit, juicy tasty meat. The bone in leg was a bit hard to eat off the bone since it&#39;s cooked to a medium rare. But still yummy. A bit sad for me since the bone is always my favorite part. <br><br>Pretty decor. I love this place. Will have to come back as we both have a lot of other dishes we want to try!",

"reviewcomment":"Date night, we dropped in early Saturday evening without a reservation (before it became quickly crowded), and we were early enough to get seated.  Samuel (the gracious and friendly owner) greeted us right away -- cozy, intimate, classic San Francisco charm with excellent service, attentive, but they know when to give a couple their time together as we sat along the booth wall side by side.<br><br>This Istrian restaurant flavors come alive starting with the Dungeness crab salad (with lots of tasty crab), their signature grandmother&#39;s specialty -  pan-fried potato gnocchi balls in a brown sirloin sauce laced with cumin, delicious!  Then on to the tender rack of Lamb with Dijon mustard &amp; herb crust served with a potato, eggplant and pesto napoleon.  Ending the meal with Panna Cotta with port wine and berries was decadent to share.  Eating here is a must-do!",

I finally went for the kimchi fried rice with beef while my friend got the spicy tofu soup (snooze, I wanted him to get an entree..). <br><br>Anyway, they &#34;cook when you order&#34; as they so kindly remind their customers with a sign in front. It&#39;s a little bit of a wait for the food, but it&#39;s totally worth it and it&#39;s authentic!! The kfr was delicious and so was the soup! I&#39;m coming back to try their kalbi.<br><br>Tip: they close at 9 but stop taking food orders at 8:40pm",

My childhood friends mom does fondue every xmas eve so thats always something that I have to look forward to once a year. I love fondue ! Popular to the misconceived notion , its not just cheese. You do have a cheese pot but there are other pots with olive oil for steak and poultry and seafood.. and then for dessert to... <br><br>The service here is immaculate. It was really beautiful to I think its at a hotel this place. Its funny because when I got out of my car I was walking around a little confused which direction the front door was located at, and suddenly I realized it was really quiet and the building was beautiful and made out of brick and there were flowers, and a limo..and I go deja vue that I was in a past life on an episode of the bachelor.. my boo ( I dont know what to call him ,we arent official yet because I am weird but thats another story haha)  walked up and saw the confusion on my face and I told him &#34; I feel like I am on the Bachelor, where is my Rose &#34; hahah but yah we went inside and it is almost cave like in there, each table has a hot pot.. the food is really good, we had a pre fix menu for Valentines day. I also tried one of their Mojitos . <br><br>I would def return here. I know it was a little pricey ( I didnt look at the bill! ) but I would def come back here , our server was incredible, I cant remember her name but she was sweet and attentive.

"reviewcomment":"If you&#39;ve never been to this show in San Francisco you missed out! The tent itself at the Pier stood out to get your attention. So there&#39;s no excuse not to have seen this show! Spectacular! Awesome! Fun! And so unique! The performers were all perfect in their own way. This was a 5 course dinner and a show and I was so satisfied at the end of the night. My b.f. was also very happy. The service was pretty good too. The only complaint we had was where we were seated. There were these big beams that were holding up the tent and we got stuck slightly  right in front of one of them. You can choose to sit right in the mix with the performers but prepare to be part of the show. The comedians WILL be making fun of you no matter what. We had a blast though. This tent can only hold about 100 to maybe 150 people so there&#39;s not that much room. But you won&#39;t even notice because the show is SO GREAT! We wanna go again once they settle down in their new location.",

"reviewcomment":"Excellent Japanese cuisine! Everything was amazingly fresh.<br><br>You must sit at the bar and order the omakase. The chef is incredibly focused and talented. He creates his food with such heart. You can&#39;t sit at a table. It&#39;s not the same experience. I kind of felt sorry for the other guests at the tables. There is no cool music or fancy ambiance. It&#39;s just a traditional Japanese restaurant.<br><br>The presentation of the food was meticulous yet delicious. It blends so beautifully together. If you&#39;re looking for big plates and being stuffed to the gills than this place isn&#39;t for you. They don&#39;t have the fancy rolls, grilled meats, noodles or fried tempura. The food is delicate and refreshing.<br><br>We had such an amazing time speaking and sharing our evening with the master chef! He was kind enough to educate us on different topics pertaining to Japan. I was on my way there to hike Mt. Fuji and of course, enjoy the local cuisines. In his younger years, the chef, used to mountaineer up Mt. Fuji in the winter. Badass. He definitely cooks with a lot of confidence and knowledge. Don&#39;t be afraid to ask questions. He&#39;s pretty quiet but accommodating. <br><br>I would say that the food at Kiss Seafood was quite comparable to what you may find in Japan. They really keep the food authentic. As in Japan, good ingredients are not cheap. A lot of their ingredients are flown in from Japan. You get what you pay for. Of course, I personally wouldn&#39;t pay almost a million dollars for a big fat tuna! I&#39;m just happy to get to share in some of the goodness!",

"reviewcomment":"Fat Angle turned our ordinary Thursday into an awesome Thursday. Service was great, beer selection - amazing, food - delicious. We couldn&#39;t have asked for more.<br><br>They don&#39;t take reservations but we only had to wait 10 minutes to sit at the bar. The beer list was a comical mixture of modern day brewing but the bartender was great with recommendations and tastings of ones I was interested in.<br><br>My wife and I have eaten here twice now and haven been let down. A kale salad and chicken pot pie made for a perfect dinner on a cold rainy day or any day. Thanks Fat Angel. Until we meet again.",

"reviewcomment":"1. The roasted aubergine sammich is made from angel kisses and unicorn hugs. It&#39;s only available sometimes though, I guess when angels are in season or whatever.<br><br>2. Who doesn&#39;t love vinegary kale salad? Big enough to share so get one alongside your sammiches, and have your lunch date be like a sustainable californian version of lady and the tramp...lady and the tramp with kale. <br><br>3. I come here 3 times a week minimum, that should say enough about how much I love this place. <br><br>4. If you complain about the lines being too long or the hipsters in the too long line, you need to understand two things: the line is long because all those people know that sammiches made of angel kisses are worth the occasional 15-20 mins of queuing, and secondly, those ironic t-shirts with weird animals and children&#39;s TV characters your line companions are wearing are excellent conversation starters to pass the wait time.",

My childhood friends mom does fondue every xmas eve so thats always something that I have to look forward to once a year. I love fondue ! Popular to the misconceived notion , its not just cheese. You do have a cheese pot but there are other pots with olive oil for steak and poultry and seafood.. and then for dessert to... <br><br>The service here is immaculate. It was really beautiful to I think its at a hotel this place. Its funny because when I got out of my car I was walking around a little confused which direction the front door was located at, and suddenly I realized it was really quiet and the building was beautiful and made out of brick and there were flowers, and a limo..and I go deja vue that I was in a past life on an episode of the bachelor.. my boo ( I dont know what to call him ,we arent official yet because I am weird but thats another story haha)  walked up and saw the confusion on my face and I told him &#34; I feel like I am on the Bachelor, where is my Rose &#34; hahah but yah we went inside and it is almost cave like in there, each table has a hot pot.. the food is really good, we had a pre fix menu for Valentines day. I also tried one of their Mojitos . <br><br>I would def return here. I know it was a little pricey ( I didnt look at the bill! ) but I would def come back here , our server was incredible, I cant remember her name but she was sweet and attentive. I will def come back here !! :) great place for a date. .",

YES PLEASE! <br><br>You know this place is good when there&#39;s almost always a group of customers eating outside and the aroma of the slow roasted rotisserie chicken is wafting through the air within 10 feet of the door entrance. <br><br>They have meat as well as vegetarian sandwich options. Boar&#39;s head deli meats &amp; cheese by the pound, Zappo&#39;s chips, pickles, sides (potato/pasta salad), and even whole rotisserie chickens are sold here.<br><br>People there are super nice. We brought a group of friends here for their first time and the lady behind the counter even offered him a sample of their sauce. <br><br>Win.",

"reviewcomment":"My dude took me here for our first (first of many I hope ) Valentines Day.. <br>The food is outstanding. My childhood friends mom does fondue every xmas eve so thats always something that I have to look forward to once a year. I love fondue ! Popular to the misconceived notion , its not just cheese. You do have a cheese pot but there are other pots with olive oil for steak and poultry and seafood.. and then for dessert to... <br><br>The service here is immaculate. It was really beautiful to I think its at a hotel this place. Its funny because when I got out of my car I was walking around a little confused which direction the front door was located at, and suddenly I realized it was really quiet and the building was beautiful and made out of brick and there were flowers, and a limo..and I go deja vue that I was in a past life on an episode of the bachelor.. my boo ( I dont know what to call him ,we arent official yet because I am weird but thats another story haha)  walked up and saw the confusion on my face and I told him &#34; I feel like I am on the Bachelor, where is my Rose &#34; hahah but yah we went inside and it is almost cave like in there, each table has a hot pot.. the food is really good, we had a pre fix menu for Valentines day. I also tried one of their Mojitos . <br><br>I would def return here. I know it was a little pricey ( I didnt look at the bill! ) but I would def come back here , our server was incredible, I cant remember her name but she was sweet and attentive. I will def come back here !! :) great place for a date. .",

"reviewcomment":"I want to write a review of this because I haven&#39;t been to a fancy-pants restaurant for a while, and this one was great. <br><br>The ambiance is very old-school, and even though I am now a grown woman of 30, I still felt conspicuously young and too flamboyantly dressed. But, whatever. It was a special occasion. The service was still great and warm and friendly. Bonus points for getting me an extra brioche bun when I asked.<br><br>The food was Japanese-French fusion, which sounds suspect, but was very well executed. I gather they have recently changed the menu to be more set and have fewer add-on options, which I think is a good call. Tempting but expensive add-ons always kind of harsh my mellow at super-fancy restaurants. Part of the pleasure of it is just sitting down and not having to make any decisions.<br><br>Our menu for the evening was:<br><br>-Some kind of forgettable amuse-bouche. Maybe involving some kind of gelatin texture? <br><br>-Black truffle tart with black truffle sauce. Excellent. Very mushroom-y, in a good way. Fabulous texture on the pastry crust. Not too heavy or overwhelmed by all of the truffle-ness.<br><br>-Cauliflower mousse with uni, Osetra caviar, scallop tartare, &#39;dashi&#39; geleé and cherry blossom smoke. This was probably my favorite thing. I am often skeptical of overly fussy molecular-gastronomy dishes like this that involve (literal) smoke and mirrors, but this was a winner. Excellent blend of novel textures and flavors that all came together beautifully.<br><br>-Lobster ravioli and mushroom with parsley puree. This was very good, and the lobster was better than most lobster I&#39;ve had on the west coast. And more great mushroom texture and flavor. It didn&#39;t wow me quite as much as the other dishes, but that&#39;s only in comparison to the other outstanding things we got.<br><br>-Then came the brioche and butter, which I liked so much I had them bring me another helping. Even though I knew there was so much more food coming. NO REGRETS.<br><br>-Wagyu beef two ways--braised with mashed potatoes and greens, and seared with a wasabi foam. OH MY GOD THIS WAS SO GOOD. <br><br>Another type of dish of which I am generally skeptical. I feel like there is so much highly-touted fancy beef at fancy restaurants that I have not been overly impressed by. A lot of the supposed wagyu and &#34;kobe&#34; beef I&#39;ve had has been pretty good, but didn&#39;t seem to justify the exorbitant prices. I also tend to think that any kind of steak at a super high-end restaurant is sort of a boring choice compared to the other kinds of concoctions that get put together. <br><br>This was a different story all together. This is definitely the best beef I have ever had. Yeah, I said it. I am sure of it. It was absurdly tender without being mushy, and the flavor was out of control good. Both presentations were excellent and really complemented each other, and the wasabi foam was great and not gimmicky like I feared. BEST. BEEF. EVER. For reals.<br><br>-Dessert--chocolate and white chocolate ganache in cocoa powder with chocolate ice cream, and then another course of tiny cookies on our way out the door. Dessert was honestly kind of disappointing. Like, of course it was good, but the other courses had me expecting something exceptional. That&#39;s okay, though. I feel like lots of bakeries and fancy restaurants do compelling sweets without delivering on all the savory dishes, so I will still take this place over most comparable restaurants any day.<br><br>Oh, slight ding for not really having any non-alcoholic beverages. I think they had coke and sprite. Come on, this is a fancy place! Have some nice juice or ginger beer or something. I guess they&#39;re focused on wine, not cocktails, and there isn&#39;t really a great substitute for wine. <br><br>Great spot, excited I got to eat here. Nice to be able to do once in a while for a very special occasion.",

"reviewcomment":"I recently moved back to SF and wasted no time in checking out any new vegan places that have opened since the last time I lived here. I haven&#39;t gotten to check out many of the other new places (in addition to old favorites) since I love Underdog. I initially planned to live in the Inner Sunset, so I was looking forward to going to Underdog often. I ended up in a different neighborhood, so I specifically take my dog to Golden Gate Park for walks as often as possible so I can grab lunch at Underdog first. (It&#39;s a win-win for both of us...)<br><br>Although the entire menu isn&#39;t vegan/vegetarian, there are quite a few vegan sausage options on the board, and all (or at least most) of the sides are vegan. I&#39;m sure the other vegan options are great, but the first time I went I ordered the vegan Polish and it was so good that I can&#39;t bear not to get it every time I go back. Maybe the guy who said the wheat bun was bad got one from an off batch, because I always get the wheat bun and it&#39;s never disappointed. I like their grilled onions topping, and last time I tried the Underdog secret sauce and it was really good.<br><br>For the sides I&#39;ve tried the cole slaw (really fresh and tasty, and it was a huge portion) and the tater tots and chili tots. The chili tots were really good as well. One time the tots were a little undercooked, but I&#39;d probably eat them frozen if you put them on a plate in front of me, so they were still good.<br><br>Seating is limited so if you go with a party barge posse be prepared to stand. But that&#39;s like a little bit of NYC right here in San Francisco. There are signs on the wall reinforcing Underdog&#39;s green credentials, and I like that they strive to be a responsible/green operation and also develop a little sense of community.<br><br>To the people complaining about the prices: do you eat at restaurants very much? Going out to eat is expensive across the board these days. This is a business and not a charity. If you want to go out to eat but don&#39;t like paying for food that&#39;s what Taco Bell is for... Underdog is worth every penny!!",

"reviewcomment":"I&#39;ve been in SF for 3 weeks for work (this is starting week 3), I&#39;ve visited Koo twice and plan to once more before I leave.<br><br>There&#39;s not a ton I can add that has not already been said, but I will reiterate the highlights and add what I can that&#39;s new:<br><br>Fresh wasabi, this is great.  My preference is to sit at the sushi bar and have the sushi chef simply use this instead for my sushi (I like it traditional style on the inside and typically don&#39;t season after the chef).<br><br>The Spoonful of Happiness is exactly what it claims to be.  I typically stick with plain nigiri or sashimi, but the chef said on my second visit I needed to try it.  He was right.<br><br>They have a great selection of fish, some local and some deep-sea Japanese ones too, their daily catch has yet to disappoint.  And the quality is excellent, very fresh, good sized pieces, and the right amount of rice.<br><br>While there I also tried Yebisu, a rice beer.  This was a bit flat and dry, but I mean flat in a good way.  If you have ever tried Boddingtons, you&#39;ll understand.  It&#39;s not as flat as that, but it&#39;s reminiscent.<br><br>The service was also very good, my water and hot tea were never empty, the chef was very prompt with my orders, and they called me a cab at the end of each evening.<br><br>If you love sushi and want a great experience in SF, go to Koo.",

"reviewcomment":"I come here when I need to get shit done. I like to indulge myself with a Havana Latte and veggie breakfast burrito, plug in to an outlet, log on to the (fast) free wi-fi, and get to to work. Staff are friendly hipsters catering to the hard-working hipster crowd. The music is ok but I&#39;ll often wear headphones because I get distracted listening to people talk about their start-ups. Love the large windows, and the staff were helpful with pulling down the blinds a bit so the sun wasn&#39;t blinding everyone upstairs. People might complain about the prices, but maybe they don&#39;t go to cafes in the city very often.<br><br>Tips: <br>Don&#39;t drive, parking in the area is almost impossible during business hours.<br>Observe the no-laptop times/tables.",

My childhood friends mom does fondue every xmas eve so thats always something that I have to look forward to once a year. I love fondue ! Popular to the misconceived notion , its not just cheese. You do have a cheese pot but there are other pots with olive oil for steak and poultry and seafood.. and then for dessert to... <br><br>The service here is immaculate. It was really beautiful to I think its at a hotel this place. Its funny because when I got out of my car I was walking around a little confused which direction the front door was located at, and suddenly I realized it was really quiet and the building was beautiful and made out of brick and there were flowers, and a limo..and I go deja vue that I was in a past life on an episode of the bachelor.. my boo ( I dont know what to call him ,we arent official yet because I am weird but thats another story haha)  walked up and saw the confusion on my face and I told him &#34; I feel like I am on the Bachelor, where is my Rose &#34; hahah but yah we went inside and it is almost cave like in there, each table has a hot pot.. the food is really good, we had a pre fix menu for Valentines day. I also tried one of their Mojitos . <br><br>I would def return here. I know it was a little pricey ( I didnt look at the bill! ) but I would def come back here , our server was incredible, I cant remember her name but she was sweet and attentive. I will def come back here !! :) great place for a date. .",

I&#39;m sure all the other Filipino dishes are delicious as well, but the BBQ is what I come for! Those BBQ pork and chicken skewers are amazing! If you can&#39;t decide what to order here for some reason, get those! They pack the sticks so full of huge chunks of delicious meat for less than $2 each. So awesome.<br><br>This restaurant is a hole-in-the-wall and I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll smell it before you see it. They probably get a bunch of customers from that waft of mouthwatering BBQ scent alone. I think most people order take-out because the place is pretty small, but there is some space inside to dine in if you want to.",

"reviewcomment":"Exploding Egg Sandwich = fantastic!<br><br>Enough has been written about the sandwich that I won&#39;t waste my breath here. But.... <br><br>...This place has cracked the code on the country potatoes that accompanies most breakfast entrees. 99% of the time, these potatoes are just fillers to make sure you hit that &#39;brunch food coma&#39; no matter the size of your main entree. The potatoes here are totally worth eating. I ate every molecule while only taking a couple of bites at other joints before giving up. Lots of crunchy edges here and minimal soft starchy centers. It both satisfies the country potatoes part of the brain as well as the FRENCH FRY loving part of the brain. These puppies must be deep fried here (and I love it). Just like the egg sandwich, so simple, yet no one else pulls it off like Plow. The abundance of rosemary is the icing on the cake. This herb is so cheap, wonder why more people don&#39;t use it liberally. It grows like weeds 365 days in most CA backyards.<br><br>Waitress #1 warned me the egg sandwich might explode. I bit in to it, and indeed it popped, covering my hand and watch with egg yoke porn. It&#39;s a miracle the kid at the next table didn&#39;t lose an eye. Waitress #2 saw this, went inside, wet a towel (with warm water) and brought it to my table. Excellent service! Even better, I went for lunch on a weekday and had zero wait. For the above reasons, I have to give this place 5 stars. <br><br>TIP, use your knife and cut the egg sandwich in half to &#39;pre-pop&#39; the yoke.",

I&#39;ve been here several times since my sweetie lives close by, and they give excellent service! Warm cheesy queso and chips (which is a bowl of melted yummy cheese with bits of jalopeno in it) with lots of chips.<br><br>Today I had the pleasure of eating Brunch here! (only on Sundays) my sweetie and I split the Chilaqules (YUM!) but the dish that we were salivating over the most was the Carnitas hash. Wow, I am still thinking about it. Crisp carnitas with potato, grilled onion and pablano chiles, with two eggs on top. The coffee also has a hint of mexican cinnamon...I almost didn&#39;t yelp about it since I wanted it to be my little secret....but I want them to keep there brunch going! <br><br>It&#39;s super casual, lots of couches (instead of tables, but they do have a few tables) and what can I say, I love this place.",

"reviewcomment":"Wooly Pig, how I miss being close to you.<br><br>For the three months when I worked around the corner from Wooly Pig, I frequented the cafe 1-3 times a week. Even with the plethora of tantalizing restaurants in the neighborhood, Wooly Pig kept me coming back for more. I ate nearly every sandwich on the menu, enjoyed every panna cotta, sipped tea and lemonade, and supped all the soups I could. Each dish and drink is unabashed in its flavor - the ingredients really shine. On top of this, owner Lieng and his staff are just about the nicest people you&#39;ll meet.<br><br>My favorites:<br>+ Bahn Mi - I actually prefer this over the Wooly Pig<br>+ Cream of Shiitake Mushroom soup - I want this in heaven<br>+ Curry Udon Soup - Comforting, like a favorite sweater; note: there was one soup that I thought was a little salty - can&#39;t remember any more if it was this one<br>+ Thai Tea Panna Cotta - Oh so good<br>+ Honey ginger tea - Not for the faint of hearts, as this is super gingery; but if ginger is your thing, definitely get this<br><br>Also delicious:<br>Briny Egg, Mozzarella Pesto, Wooly Pig, Croque Monsieur, Vegi, Almond Panna Cotta, Corn Chowder<br><br>Not as into:<br>~ Kahlua Pulled Pork special - too saucy for me, ended up taking a drop home on my pants...<br><br>Wooly Pig, please come to the South Bay or Peninsula!",

My childhood friends mom does fondue every xmas eve so thats always something that I have to look forward to once a year. I love fondue ! Popular to the misconceived notion , its not just cheese. You do have a cheese pot but there are other pots with olive oil for steak and poultry and seafood.. and then for dessert to... <br><br>The service here is immaculate. It was really beautiful to I think its at a hotel this place. Its funny because when I got out of my car I was walking around a little confused which direction the front door was located at, and suddenly I realized it was really quiet and the building was beautiful and made out of brick and there were flowers, and a limo..and I go deja vue that I was in a past life on an episode of the bachelor.. my boo ( I dont know what to call him ,we arent official yet because I am weird but thats another story haha)  walked up and saw the confusion on my face and I told him &#34; I feel like I am on the Bachelor, where is my Rose &#34; hahah but yah we went inside and it is almost cave like in there, each table has a hot pot.. the food is really good, we had a pre fix menu for Valentines day. I also tried one of their Mojitos . <br><br>I would def return here. I know it was a little pricey ( I didnt look at the bill! ) but I would def come back here , our server was incredible, I cant remember her name but she was sweet and attentive.

Just bought some marrow bones, but their stock will tide me over until my homemade is done (Dr. Says stock should be slow cooked for about 36 hours and these guys do theirs 4-8 hours).

Sushi. Ever.<br><br>There can be a wait, but scribe your name on the waiting list, jet across the street to cask house to enjoy a pre-dinner drink.  Saru is well worth the wait!<br><br>Can&#39;t wait to go back to try their chirachi during lunch, until then...go get yourself some delicious sushi at Saru!",

"reviewcomment":"I love chicken burgers and chicken sandwiches and fried chicken and bread and all of these things. You might say I consider myself a chickenoisseur.<br><br>My lords, ladies and gentlemen, I have a serious announcement to make.<br><br>This was the best fried chicken sandwich I&#39;ve ever had in my life.<br><br>FO REALZ.<br><br>Or perhaps I should say &#34;chicken sando&#34;, which I genuinely did not connect with the word sandwich until I asked for it and the guy repeated my order back to me minus the O and plus the WICH. Ahhhh so this is what this exotic &#34;sando&#34; means. Excellent! I&#39;m even more excited.<br><br>We fortunately managed to grab a table; a couple of screens were showing sports (UEFA Champions League on one, ice hockey on the other. Actual ice hockey! On the TV! So American!) but weren&#39;t distracting. What I DID find distracting - in a good way - was the wall plated entirely with car license (look, I spelt &#34;licence&#34; the noun like the verb, just like a native!) plates. I loved looking at these and trying to choose my favourite state design. They&#39;re so cool and colourful that they make a lovely decorative addition.<br><br>Briony C is right - get a paper menu for detail and check your app to find out what people recommend. I personally recommend everything on the menu except the chicken sando because all of those are for me, you can have anything else you like but all the chicken sandos are mine mine mine. I don&#39;t even have the adjectives. I try to formulate &#39;em but they just turn into drool.<br><br>I have a thing that I feel next time I go to San Fran I ought to try places I haven&#39;t tried before... but I will definitely be back at Garaje anyway.

I&#39;m a picky eater, don&#39;t judge me.<br><br>i was a bit disappointed they didn&#39;t have the option for a sourdough roll, but sliced sourdough was just fine. i got turkey with bacon on sourdough, with lettuce, red onions, and mayo. the turkey was amazing! and they put a good amount of bacon which is usually not the case most places. the lettuce and onions were super fresh and there was just enough mayo.<br><br>needless to say it was the best sandwich any of us had had in a long time, and we have already ordered twice more since the first time! and there will be plenty more to come in the future.",

"reviewcomment":"It&#39;s time I reviewed this place because I live right around the corner and have been her about 5 times already. I like to support local businesses; not because I feel sorry for them, but because they make great food and treat you like family and I do think it helps their business to Yelp it.<br><br>I read the negative reviews for this place, and ask you to consider the people who wrote them. Have they been to the restaurant multiple times? Did they have preconceived notions about what they wanted? Do they seem like someone you would want to share a table with or are generally help, well-adjusted individuals? I think I have an idea for my next screenplay. <br><br>Now to the food *not for thought*. I came here without knowing what a pierogi was, and was foolishly expecting a filling and meat-heavy piroshki-like experience. So I avoided it for a while, and of course I was wrong. These babies are light and not too greasy, yet they absorb alcohol well (for your hangovers). The flavors range from very powerful (the buffalo, which is too powerful for me) to very subtle (I like the goat cheese the best). Avocado and mushroom are both good choices. I haven&#39;t tried the bacon one yet, as I don&#39;t eat very much pork. In the end, I think all of them are pretty good and just different enough to keep you coming back for more.<br><br>My favorite part is the the various toppings included with your meal. Both the asparagus and cucumber salads are really light and refreshing, mixing wonderfully with the flavor of any pierogi. The hummus and sour cream are fun. And, ooh! look! there is wonderful sauerkraut and sweet red cabbage finely chopped! They really tie it all together and make it so fun to eat. That&#39;s what Stuffed brings to the table; it&#39;s casual, lighthearted and hearty without being disgustingly filling. I actually don&#39;t feel that &#39;stuffed&#39; if I just order 2 pierogis and call it a day. <br><br>As the neighborhood improves I think this place has the potential to become an institution. The owners, Andy and Dana, are there every night serving you personally with heart and soul. You get to watch them make the food right in front of you. Dana&#39;s dad bottles the wine. No techie vibe here. They are improving their menu and evolving, and I&#39;m just so thankful to have something besides pizza and burritos to eat while I sit and drink my beer and watch the Nature Channel with my girlfriend on one of their two huge TV&#39;s. Hey, you guys, keep up the great work!",

"reviewcomment":"The. Best. Hash. Browns. Ever!<br>Okay, I admit I secretly love McDonald&#39;s oil-dripping hash browns as much as the next fat kid. But Griddle Fresh&#39;s fresh hash browns are the bomb! Okay, they&#39;re basically the same thing as what you&#39;d get at any other diner, but made into a thinner layer and seasoned. That&#39;s it. That&#39;s the secret guys. But the difference it makes!! It eliminates the unseasoned and unfried bits of poor potato hidden in the middle of an average pile of hash brown. Every tiny strip gets to turn golden brown and crispy, and eaten! No potato left behind. And I didn&#39;t even need ketchup.<br><br>And my side of Smoked Salmon Tartine? Also delicious. Comes with practically one whole avacado on brioche bun.<br><br>On top of that, service was great-I definitely recommend this place!",

"reviewcomment":"The food here is soooooo good!! We shared the appetizer sampler, the fried plantains and the pollo pibil. <br><br>The appetizer sample had 6 items on them and they were all so good. The flavors are well balanced and the fried stuff are fresh and didn&#39;t taste greasy. The salsa that come with the chips is amazing, too -- mild but so well balanced and flavorful.<br><br>The waiter was nice enough to split the entree for us even though we didn&#39;t ask for it. Very sweet of him. The chicken is fall off the bone tender and the sauce is just perfect. The rice has nice texture and flavor and the black bean sauce on top marries all the flavors together.<br><br>We got a free dessert (the flan) for checking in on yelp. It was pretty good flan, as far as flans go.<br><br>I forgot to take my credit card before I left and the waiter was nice enough to run more than a block to hail me down and return the card to me. I will certainly be back to try their other dishes.",

My childhood friends mom does fondue every xmas eve so thats always something that I have to look forward to once a year. I love fondue ! Popular to the misconceived notion , its not just cheese. You do have a cheese pot but there are other pots with olive oil for steak and poultry and seafood.. and then for dessert to... <br><br>The service here is immaculate. It was really beautiful to I think its at a hotel this place. Its funny because when I got out of my car I was walking around a little confused which direction the front door was located at, and suddenly I realized it was really quiet and the building was beautiful and made out of brick and there were flowers, and a limo..and I go deja vue that I was in a past life on an episode of the bachelor.. my boo ( I dont know what to call him ,we arent official yet because I am weird but thats another story haha)  walked up and saw the confusion on my face and I told him &#34; I feel like I am on the Bachelor, where is my Rose &#34; hahah but yah we went inside and it is almost cave like in there, each table has a hot pot.. the food is really good, we had a pre fix menu for Valentines day. I also tried one of their Mojitos . <br><br>I would def return here. I know it was a little pricey ( I didnt look at the bill! ) but I would def come back here , our server was incredible, I cant remember her name but she was sweet and attentive. I will def come back here !! :) great place for a date. .",

You simply cannot go wrong with this one. You got your Pastrami, turkey, provolone, tomatoes, red onion, peperoncinis, lettuce, mayo &amp; mustard on a crunchy ciabatta bread. They were out of the French, but no complaints here! <br><br>I Never got to try the Hainan Chicken everyone&#39;s been raving about :( Bring it back, please?! <br><br>Note: Prepare to wait about 10-15 mins for your order and with only 3 small tables in the establishment, it&#39;s best to order to go or for pickup :) In short, I had a wonderful first experience here and would gladly pay $10 a sandwich any day for this place!

Even with the plethora of tantalizing restaurants in the neighborhood, Wooly Pig kept me coming back for more. I ate nearly every sandwich on the menu, enjoyed every panna cotta, sipped tea and lemonade, and supped all the soups I could. Each dish and drink is unabashed in its flavor - the ingredients really shine. On top of this, owner Lieng and his staff are just about the nicest people you&#39;ll meet.<br><br>My favorites:<br>+ Bahn Mi - I actually prefer this over the Wooly Pig<br>+ Cream of Shiitake Mushroom soup - I want this in heaven<br>+ Curry Udon Soup - Comforting, like a favorite sweater; note: there was one soup that I thought was a little salty - can&#39;t remember any more if it was this one<br>+ Thai Tea Panna Cotta - Oh so good<br>+ Honey ginger tea - Not for the faint of hearts, as this is super gingery; but if ginger is your thing, definitely get this<br><br>Also delicious:<br>Briny Egg, Mozzarella Pesto, Wooly Pig, Croque Monsieur, Vegi, Almond Panna Cotta, Corn Chowder<br><br>Not as into:<br>~ Kahlua Pulled Pork special - too saucy for me, ended up taking a drop home on my pants...<br><br>Wooly Pig, please come to the South Bay or Peninsula!",

"reviewcomment":"I&#39;ve stayed in this area a few times when visiting SF, but only on this most recent trip was I privy to the deliciousness being pushed out of Archive just around the corner...<br><br>On a drizzly night, a group of five of us were in need of some comforting carbs after a night of partying, and seeking a calmer environment to enjoy them in. Archive was just the ticket. A friendly man, who I can only assume is the owner/manager, greeted us at the door and immediately accommodated our group in their quaint indoor seating area - no wait on a Wednesday night. Shortly after squeezing us in, they expanded our table to more comfortably seat us and never once rushed us out or gave us any side-eye when we settled in for 2+ hours to chat and catch up. <br><br>Their house pizzas listed on the menu will give your decision making skills a run for their money since they all sound so enticing. Truffle mushrooms? Yes, please. My girl Trish threw some roasted onions on hers like a boss, I suggest doing that. I settled on the house pepperoni, which I only had the self control to stop eating after I looked down at only two slices left (all else eaten by moi.) Que embarrassing. <br><br>The cider they serve on tap out of Portland is really great, the cheese plate was legit and plenty to share among the group. It was served with fig spread, honey, and gluten free crackers for our intolerant friends - something the friendly boss man picked up on without us even asking. <br><br>From now on, Archive will be on my list of musts when visiting the Bay Area.",

My childhood friends mom does fondue every xmas eve so thats always something that I have to look forward to once a year. I love fondue ! Popular to the misconceived notion , its not just cheese. You do have a cheese pot but there are other pots with olive oil for steak and poultry and seafood.. and then for dessert to... <br><br>The service here is immaculate. It was really beautiful to I think its at a hotel this place. Its funny because when I got out of my car I was walking around a little confused which direction the front door was located at, and suddenly I realized it was really quiet and the building was beautiful and made out of brick and there were flowers, and a limo..and I go deja vue that I was in a past life on an episode of the bachelor.. my boo ( I dont know what to call him ,we arent official yet because I am weird but thats another story haha)  walked up and saw the confusion on my face and I told him &#34; I feel like I am on the Bachelor, where is my Rose &#34; hahah but yah we went inside and it is almost cave like in there, each table has a hot pot.. the food is really good, we had a pre fix menu for Valentines day. I also tried one of their Mojitos . <br><br>I would def return here. I know it was a little pricey ( I didnt look at the bill! ) but I would def come back here , our server was incredible, I cant remember her name but she was sweet and attentive. I will def come back here !! :) great place for a date. .",

"reviewcomment":"Came here for Brunch on a Sunday morning. My bf and I made a last minute decision, and he found reservations on Opentable that morning. Score! We got here around 10:30am, when it seemed like SF was still sleeping. The restaurant was very quiet, but it was pleasant. The interior of the restaurant screams fine dining, but the food prices are fair for the quality of food. I think this is a great place for brunch if you&#39;re tired of waiting in line (i.e. Plow, Mission Beach Cafe), and just want to relax on your day off!<br><br>We started off with the beignets -- I was expecting something crispy, kind of like the ones in NOLA. But, we actually got beignets that looked like donut holes! Except rolled in cinnamon sugar...man they were delicious. I also liked the dipping sauces included: the huckleberry preserves and creme anglais. This was a great starter!<br><br>I really wanted the burger my bf kept telling me about. We are always in search of the best burger in SF, and he claimed this was one of them. The burger was fantastic. It&#39;s composed of different types of meat, which made it softer than usual. The fries were very good too - the perfect medium thickness (not too skinny like McDonalds, not too thick). They were nice and soft. <br><br>My bf got the pastrami and grits, which he really loved. No regrets here!<br><br>The service is extremely personable. The Burmese waiter we had was always making jokes with us, as if we had dined there all the time (it was my first time). Everyone was just so friendly. I guess this is what you expect for a 1-Michelin star restaurant!<br><br>I can&#39;t wait to come here for dinner sometime. The hostess on our way out told us about &#34;Burgers and Burgundy&#34; on Sunday nights, where you eat the burger and a glass of Burgundy wine. The regular menu looks great too, although on the pricier side. I&#39;d like to come back whenever I have the chance (or credit).",

I&#39;m a picky eater, don&#39;t judge me.<br><br>i was a bit disappointed they didn&#39;t have the option for a sourdough roll, but sliced sourdough was just fine. i got turkey with bacon on sourdough, with lettuce, red onions, and mayo. the turkey was amazing! and they put a good amount of bacon which is usually not the case most places. the lettuce and onions were super fresh and there was just enough mayo.<br><br>needless to say it was the best sandwich any of us had had in a long time, and we have already ordered twice more since the first time! and there will be plenty more to come in the future.",

It&#39;s one of the breakfast spots in the city, and as soon as you sit down with your food in front of you, it&#39;s easy to see why.<br><br>Seriously, those 2,000+ reviews do not lie. This is the legit spot for eats.<br><br>I went with a friend on a Friday morning at about 9am. It was packed when we got there, but the line moved quickly (don&#39;t expect the same during the rush hour or during the weekend, then you will wait.) It&#39;s a spot that&#39;s larger than it looks, with tables extending to the back. The menu is simple but amazing, and everything is upped on quality and size. Not just pancaked but blueberry cornmeal pancakes. Not just an omelette but a delux hand crafted omelette with ingredients minced and spread throughout rather than just stuffed into the centre. You get the deal.<br><br>Plus, they have probably the best breakfast deal in the entire city. The Open Road: two eggs, bacon, eggs or sausage, homefries, and two giant pancakes, all for $13. Yes, yes, and more yes, every time. <br><br>Eat here, pass out, enjoy life. This is a true blue spot for sure.",

"reviewcomment":"holy shit.  HOLY SHIT.  The chicken wings here were SOOOOO GOOOOOOOOD.  I am NOT a chicken wing fan but this place.. won me OVER.  We ordered a lot of the other dishes, but they were honestly... not worth it and really bland.  (fried rice, veggie dishes etc).  The chicken wings would be the only thing that I would order here. I got really lucky, because I heard the lines are ridiculous but i waited like five minutes at most.  <br><br>Now to talk about the chicken wings: perfectly crispy outside, the sauce is sweet but not too sweet (no we did not eat rice.  Why waste stomach space on rice when you can fill your stomach with that protein!), it was moist NOT dry!!!!! and it was just amazing!!  The glaze and crispy outside is what makes this chicken SO DAMN GOOD.  Seriously try this place out but only the chicken.  I do NOT suggest ordering the other dishes.  It may LOOK good, but its bland as hell.",

There&#39;s a big sign at the host stand stating they only hold reservations for 10 minutes.  Yikes! Thankfully,  they were nice enough to seat me even though my friend arrived 20 minutes late.<br><br>They have a great vegetarian selection which is why we picked Saffron.  We shared the saag paneer and a special dish with eggplants. The naan sampler was a great choice...especially if you&#39;re a carboholic like me.",

"reviewcomment":"Service was marvelous!!!<br><br>We walked in with a barely 2 years old child we were babysitting. He was crying and screaming and ohmygoodness, I was hungry! The waiter seated us at the front and probably saw that our kid was going to be a real disturbance to the surrounding customers and offered us a table in the back. Thumbs up for that! There was no customers in the back, but the kid was still making a fuss for a bit. Minutes later, he had quite down after some distractions. The waiter even gave him a ballon to help.<br><br>Now onto the food: <br>- Lotus Blossom - What a great combo! Some crunchiness from the lotus and cucumber &amp; some flavorfulness from the spicy tuna (and probably a mix of other fishes) = LIPSMACKING DELICIOUS!<br><br>- Seaweed Salad - Cute appetizer. Almost tasted the same as anywhere else, but better! It was topped with some &#34;rolled-into-a-flower&#34; daikon.<br><br>- Lunch Sashimi - 9 pieces total + salad + soup. I have to say, the soup and salad could be better than the sashimi itself! The miso soup wasn&#39;t salty, which is a plus! There was a few pieces of spinach and deep fried bean curd (better it was bean curd) in the soup. It&#39;s really good, trust me. You&#39;ll be licking your bowl afterwards. The salad had the best dressing ever! It was light and refreshing. The sashimi (Salmon, Tuna, and one more that I don&#39;t remember) was a pretty thick cut and satisfying. <br><br>- Uni - For $9 = Mouthdrooling. It&#39;s huge!<br><br>- Double Tuna Roll - Spicy tuna on the inside with fresh&amp;grilled tuna on top. Spicy tuna wasn&#39;t extremely spicy where you&#39;ll have to down yourself down with water. It was just right, that you&#39;ll be able to taste the flavors. <br><br>Presentation on ALL the dishes was 100X prettier than the sushi places around here and around Geary Blvd!<br><br>Wanted to try the oyster shot, but they were out. BUMMER... But I will definitely be back for more!",

Local greens and potato and garlic all roasted..  Tasty! <br><br>Potato dumpling kumla. Onion ragout. Lingonberry. Lardon . Brown butter. Individually, the components were OK, but when you took a bite and it had a bit of everything including the lardon, it s amazing! All for the lardon on the side  so that it stays crispy! <br><br>Skrieg, wild Arctic cod. Sunchoke cream. Salmon roe sorrel chanterelle mushroom. Just like the potato dumpling, take a bite with a little bit of everything, amazing  the fish alone was buttery and delish!! <br><br>Squab breast. Potato florette. Cabbage forest mushroom. Lemon tarragon jus. The squab was made two ways, roasted and also confit, juicy tasty meat. The bone in leg was a bit hard to eat off the bone since it&#39;s cooked to a medium rare. But still yummy. A bit sad for me since the bone is always my favorite part. <br><br>Pretty decor. I love this place. Will have to come back as we both have a lot of other dishes we want to try!",

"reviewcomment":"Men love food just as much as they love women. <br><br>Well, maybe the latter more if all women looked like the &#34;most beautiful woman in the world&#34; aka Gwyneth Paltrow. *Sarcasm*  People Magazine, way to tell all the girls in America that the ideal is a Hamptons Barbie doll (sans big tits) who proclaims she &#34;rather smoke crack than eat cheese from a can&#34; or would &#34;rather die than let her kids eat a cup-a-soup&#34;. Sorry honey, but not everyone can afford an $800 Valentino iPad case or have the means to regularly fly to Paris for a $70 lip balm. At least she doesn&#39;t give a shit about being the most hated celebrity in hollywood. Props to her for that.<br><br>Cholo Soy is a place that would get Paltrow&#39;s French silk panties all up in a bunch. It&#39;s located in lobby of Plaza Adelante; next to Dr. Teeth. The soulful, Peruvian cuisine draws humble working class carb-loving carniwhores. &#34;Carbs are evil and meat is dirty&#34;, according to her. Whatever Paltrow, go suck on a cucumber. The rotating menu is in Spanish and offers three slow braised meat entrees per a day served with rice and beans. Appetizers of ceviche and causa are available every day. All the dishes are $5, $6, or $10. Menu: <a href='/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1cNrb5X&amp;s=bdec1cf26548e87e94c100b18aa5acd7300c66e876ab631b5e9185ba815371f5' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>bit.ly/1cNrb5X</a> and <a href='/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F18hpT0e&amp;s=21b0339b33ce0043689347a5ea894c0960782b9a519a71b776414c4a746c22a1' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>bit.ly/18hpT0e</a>. Cash only.<br><br>Their current opening hours are limited because it&#39;s based on when the plaza is open. However, the owner told us they plan on extending their hours and open on Sundays in the future once they work something out with the plaza&#39;s owner.<br><br>There&#39;s only three tables and counter seating available so come during off peak hours if you wanna grub in or you can always take your order to go. We grabbed the last available table a little after 1 pm on a Saturday afternoon. We were also the only non-natives there and I&#39;m sure stuck out like a sore thumb but the welcoming owner didn&#39;t make us feel that way. This is one of the reasons WHY I phucking love this place. You know it&#39;s legit when all the customers are natives and there&#39;s not any hipsters in sight...yet.<br><br>The only thing I could decipher off the menu was the Ceviche ($5): <a href='/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2FIArVld&amp;s=48df88fb1eb678c8eeab577f74620e59002a19112d4e2e83e5ff3981b0a49dba' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>bit.ly/IArVld</a>. I&#39;m usually not a fan of ceviche as I find the citrus to overpower the delicateness of the fish but this one was solid especially for the price tag. The fish was firm and the leche de tigre was bold without causing you to pucker your lips. I love the accompanying fried corn kernels for the satisfying crunchy texture contrast. <br><br>We shared two entrees, the Cabrito Norteno de Cordero (lamb shank - $10) and Guisado Norteno de Pollo (chicken - $6) which were both excellent. You can tell they were a labor of love having been stewed for hours. The chicken was fall-of-the-bone tender and filled with savory deliciousness: <a href='/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F18hqy1w&amp;s=c1c8de3cde9995cf2cbe4d96a8138a62d8a6f970c5bed4346f93ac9259387460' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>bit.ly/18hqy1w</a>. The fork tender lamb shank was robust with spices: <a href='/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1b9aljr&amp;s=2fc86c512334df47fb49eeb81594b59252340bdf6e0c5e058989d844a1209f87' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>bit.ly/1b9aljr</a>. I normally don&#39;t care for beans but the accompanying beans had a lovely richness to them. <br><br>I washed everything down with a Chica Morado (purple corn drink - $2) which was refreshing and not too sweet: <a href='/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F18b75ms&amp;s=10a43092670f58eb1bdd8235e9732c4693a955ead3ee74724d59ea3ab60c04f8' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>bit.ly/18b75ms</a>. <br><br>Cholo Soy is the epitome of Peruvian homestyle cooking at its finest. You also gotta love that it&#39;s very easy on the wallet. Well Mr. NSS did. Our entire meal cost less than one-thirds of Paltrow&#39;s lip balm! Take that Black Friday shoppers at Walmart fighting over the last...toothbrush holder. True story. *Le sigh*",

And it was the best fruit bowl I have ever ordered.  All varieties of fruit, and not just the cheap melons like most restaurants.<br><br>I ordered the French toast, and my husband ordered the pancakes.  Both were very delicious and fresh.  The OJ seemed to be freshly squeezed and tasted good, and the coffee tasted great, more of a dark roast which I prefer!

My childhood friends mom does fondue every xmas eve so thats always something that I have to look forward to once a year. I love fondue ! Popular to the misconceived notion , its not just cheese. You do have a cheese pot but there are other pots with olive oil for steak and poultry and seafood.. and then for dessert to... <br><br>The service here is immaculate. It was really beautiful to I think its at a hotel this place. Its funny because when I got out of my car I was walking around a little confused which direction the front door was located at, and suddenly I realized it was really quiet and the building was beautiful and made out of brick and there were flowers, and a limo..and I go deja vue that I was in a past life on an episode of the bachelor.. my boo ( I dont know what to call him ,we arent official yet because I am weird but thats another story haha)  walked up and saw the confusion on my face and I told him &#34; I feel like I am on the Bachelor, where is my Rose &#34; hahah but yah we went inside and it is almost cave like in there, each table has a hot pot.. the food is really good, we had a pre fix menu for Valentines day. I also tried one of their Mojitos . <br><br>I would def return here. I know it was a little pricey ( I didnt look at the bill! ) but I would def come back here , our server was incredible, I cant remember her name but she was sweet and attentive.

"reviewcomment":"Wow, a 5-star experience!!!  My bf made reservations for a Sat night @ 7pm 4 people the day before. It was that easy to get a reservation, probably because this restaurant is only a few months old. Upon arriving, they were pretty swamped. We got there on time, but weren&#39;t seated until maybe 7:15pm. However, once entering, we recognized Thommas, our favorite waiter (once captain) from Michael Mina. It turns out many of the people from the Michael Mina group (Ryan, owner of Stones Throw, the ex Chef de Cuisine of Michael Mina, and our host Thommas) had jumped ships to this new American restaurant in Russian Hill. Thommas immediately gave us champagne while we were waiting for our table.<br><br>Highlights:<br><br>1) Duck Pate &amp; Mousse with Pretzel - closest thing to foie gras you can get in this state! So good...pretzel was to die for too...it was super fresh and soft. Not your typical Auntie Anne&#39;s! <br><br>2) Squid Ink Conchiglie Pasta with clams. PERFECT FOR ALL YOU SQUID INK PASTA LOVERS! The pasta was cooked perfectly, al dente, with yummy seafood touch from the clams. Can&#39;t come here without ordering. My only complaint is that I wish it were an entree, rather than a pasta. Too small for someone&#39;s meal unless you really eat like a bird.<br><br>3) Fish...which I believe was Halibut. They Sous-vide&#39;d it, so it was cooked perfectly, very soft and pretty much a poached fish. They took this one off the menu though unfortunately, I couldn&#39;t find it! =(<br><br>4) Lamb was ordered twice at our table. It was very good - I typically don&#39;t like lamb, but this was cooked in a way where it did not taste like lamb (the best). If you are a lamb lover, order this dish!<br><br>Ambiance was young, loud, dark, fun, similar to Pesce. Food was phenomenal. However, parking was awful. My bf and I ended up hiking up the hill from Van Ness in the rain, not the best way to end your Saturday night! Do yourself a favor and allow 45 mins to find parking. If you get there early, treat yourself to a cocktail!<br><br>Can&#39;t wait to return for a family member&#39;s birthday!",

Especially tonight&#39;s. We had the lemon pappardelle with their bolognese sauce and it was plate-licking fantastic. The bolognese sauce was probably one the most rich and flavorful I&#39;ve ever had. My husband knew he was in for a great meal when he smelled the delicious sauce bubbling in the kitchen. <br><br>The total was only $16 for dinner for two. You get good, quality meal you can whip up in no time at home for half the cost you&#39;d spend at a restaurant. <br><br>My mother in law and sister in law are coming over this weekend for the holidays.

"reviewcomment":"How much do I love Source? I was here three times in the past week on my visit to SF. As I type this, I&#39;m going through the w/ds, since my last bite of incredible veg/non GMO food was a mere 18 hours ago.<br><br>Besides the food, I also want to mention that the past three times service was above and beyond! Last Sunday night, when I asked about hot sauce (it&#39;s my thing), I was given several options, including a  beyond blazin&#39; habanero sauce (I was told they used to ask people to sign a waiver before indulging) and then a less teary green sauce that was the waiter&#39;s favorite. How nice that he cared! Hot sauce addicts unite, right?<br><br>On Monday, I brought my team here for lunch, but called ahead to order, not realizing that you only do this when taking out. I felt bad about wasting all those takeout containers, but the waitstaff and manager were anything but snarky about all of this and helped us get situated at a table, making sure that our order was all correct. I realized that because I had already used my CC when ordering, that a gratuity had not been added, yet we were still very much attended to, again, above and beyond! I made sure to go up and take care of all of that (just mentioning so you know I always do right by waitstaff, friends :)<br><br>And last night, my final meal here *sob*-- again, I noticed how nice the cashier was, offering options because they had run out of things, knowing that one of us was GF. On that note, expect to be told if there is even the slightest hint of gluten in an item. They are so informed about their menu. <br><br>In my previous review, you&#39;ll see that I recommended the Buffalo Bites and Living Platter. And now I recommend the vegan artichoke/spinach dip that you&#39;d *swear* contained a rich parmesan cheese rather than cashew butter, truffle oil and what might actually be nutritional yeast. My favorite sandwich is the Cluck Avocado Club that is overloaded with all of the items described (those &#34;oink&#34; bits are joys in texture and taste!!) Note to self: next time leave off the cheese (vegan or otherwise). You totally don&#39;t need it. I also had them leave out the caramelized onions because I&#39;m not a fan. The spinach/artichoke dip is perfect to mix in with the sandwich (not to mention dipping your fries into) and there is just too much food for me to even consider eating the fresh roll (though I tasted it and wanted to expand my stomach so that I *could* eat it!)<br><br>Although I typically avoid fake meats like the plague, Source&#39;s are well made and GMO-free, so they aren&#39;t the rubbery &#34;soy protein&#34; bits you&#39;re used to having to suffer through (though admittedly most of my vegan friends that miss meat actually enjoy those horrors). I think that the fake meats here will please both those who eschew and those who enjoy such things. <br><br>Also, it bears repeating: their fries may very well have brought tears of joy to mine eyes.",

"reviewcomment":"4.5* rounded up<br><br>Range is my go-to restaurant in San Francisco - solid food and nice ambiance (modern and minimal, yet cozy; fancy but not pretentious) though with tightly packed tables. It has become much easier to get a reservation since they lost their Michelin star but the quality has remained the same. Overall, the food is fairly simple and consistent - if you prefer complexly prepared dishes with a swirly melange of flavors, foam, etc you may find Range disappointing; I have a foodie friend who thinks it&#39;s over-rated for this exact reason. Desserts tend to be on the less to moderately sweet side. Good, friendly bartenders and a nice bar that is generally always full.",

My childhood friends mom does fondue every xmas eve so thats always something that I have to look forward to once a year. I love fondue ! Popular to the misconceived notion , its not just cheese. You do have a cheese pot but there are other pots with olive oil for steak and poultry and seafood.. and then for dessert to... <br><br>The service here is immaculate. It was really beautiful to I think its at a hotel this place. Its funny because when I got out of my car I was walking around a little confused which direction the front door was located at, and suddenly I realized it was really quiet and the building was beautiful and made out of brick and there were flowers, and a limo..and I go deja vue that I was in a past life on an episode of the bachelor.. my boo ( I dont know what to call him ,we arent official yet because I am weird but thats another story haha)  walked up and saw the confusion on my face and I told him &#34; I feel like I am on the Bachelor, where is my Rose &#34; hahah but yah we went inside and it is almost cave like in there, each table has a hot pot.. the food is really good, we had a pre fix menu for Valentines day. I also tried one of their Mojitos . <br><br>I would def return here. I know it was a little pricey ( I didnt look at the bill! ) but I would def come back here , our server was incredible, I cant remember her name but she was sweet and attentive. I will def come back here !! :) great place for a date. .",

I also got a cookie for my 1.5-year-old coffee date (before you ask, I&#39;m a nanny!). <br>As I waited, my date gobbled the cookie up and thoroughly enjoyed it!<br>It wasn&#39;t long before I got my latte &amp; I was headed for the counter to add some sweetener (because I usually have to adjust lattes to my taste), but I took a sip and my eyes lit up, the clouds parted for the sun to shine through, &amp; I&#39;m pretty sure I heard some magical chimes for a second...<br><br>It was just the right sweetness that I didn&#39;t need to add anything or feel like I&#39;d get a toothache &amp; just the right temperature that I didn&#39;t burn my tongue on that first sip.

I&#39;m going to opt for Santaneca as mine.<br><br>Pupusas are slinging out of the kitchen and the piping hot little pancakes ooze pork, cheese, loroco (twenty-five cents extra), and beans. The priciest pupusa is $2, so eat up!<br><br>The soups are where Santaneca really shines though. We&#39;ve so far only had the caldo de res (beef soup) and the sopa de pescado (fish soup), and both have been perfect for chilly days. Big chunks of flavorful meat, lots of veggies, and the lemons really give a nice tang to the soup. I still have no idea what to do with the accompanying tortillas, but I&#39;m working on it.<br><br>The atole makes a nice dessert too, and it comes in a big bowl. Corn bisque, basically.<br><br>Never much of a wait even though it&#39;s a small place right by the BART.<br><br>The fried plaintains are super popular, but I haven&#39;t had a chance to try them yet since the entrees are so hefty!",

"reviewcomment":"Could it be true? Could one really eat in North Beach without having to deal with tourists? Yes!<br><br>Hubby found this gem thanks to other Yelpers and selected it for his birthday dinner.  It&#39;s a tiny little place with 4 outdoor tables so you can eat with your pups plus room for 10 more people inside and a few more tables hidden upstairs.<br><br>I really felt like I was in Italy. The owner is Italian, the servers were from Naples as was the chef. They yelled at each other in Italian. Everything was &#34;no problem&#34;.  Want to mix and match entrees - no problem! Another wine glass - no problem! Try the cannoli filling - no problem! More bread - no problem!<br><br>The menu changes based upon what they find fresh. That night they had an elk steak and lots of specials with baby octopus.  For the first time,  I tried squid ink pasta with lots of fresh seafood (including those baby octopus). Delicious!  Enough garlic and other spices to not need salt or other seasoning.  I found that I actually like ink squid pasta (very salty) and baby octopus  (yes, they take off the heads).<br><br>We wrapped up with the ricotta cake which tasted like it was made by an Italian &#34;nonna&#34;,  the panna cotta was light and delicious and the lemon sorbet came in a real lemon.<br><br>They ended the experience  with complimentary shots of limoncello  (this was after 4 glasses of wine so it may have been orangecello).<br><br>Lovely atmosphere! Lovely service! Wonderful food!<br><br>Don&#39;t forget to make a reservation. Wave to me if I see you there.",

"reviewcomment":"Saha is at the top of my list of go-to restaurants in the Bay Area. I had one of the most delicious meals I&#39;ve ever had there!<br><br>My wife and I went to Saha in October. The bus ride and walk to the restaurant were a little sketchy (not in the best neighborhood), but it&#39;s well worth the meal. We had to wait a few minutes but were seated and taken care of by a wonderful waiter. He was very attentive to us (and my wife&#39;s vegan and gluten-free diet) and helped us choose the best dishes. We definitely splurged and ordered more than we needed: a few small plates and a few large plates. The hummus and pita (even the gluten-free pita) is out of this world! The roasted cauliflower and falafel were so good, and our main dishes were very tasty. I would&#39;ve loved to have had some dessert but we just didn&#39;t have enough room.<br><br>Though we had all vegetarian dishes, there were plenty of meat options as well, which is why we will definitely be coming back here when we have visitors in town!",

Unlike many taquerias, they have a full bar, and Bulleit was just $6 per (large) glass. We also had Patron and Don Julio Anejo for $9 per shot, which is pretty good for SF.<br><br>The ceviche was excellent, and it was served almost like nachos. They do a great job with the salsa and had the right ratio of tomatoes to onions to cilantro. I don&#39;t remember the name, but they have a chicken super nachos that might be the best I&#39;ve had.<br><br>The staff was super welcoming and accommodating - even though we had finished our food and were just enjoying the bar, they gave us some chips and nachos, they set up extra tables for us, and we even got to enjoy a mariachi band iwth a blue violin.",

My childhood friends mom does fondue every xmas eve so thats always something that I have to look forward to once a year. I love fondue ! Popular to the misconceived notion , its not just cheese. You do have a cheese pot but there are other pots with olive oil for steak and poultry and seafood.. and then for dessert to... <br><br>The service here is immaculate. It was really beautiful to I think its at a hotel this place. Its funny because when I got out of my car I was walking around a little confused which direction the front door was located at, and suddenly I realized it was really quiet and the building was beautiful and made out of brick and there were flowers, and a limo..and I go deja vue that I was in a past life on an episode of the bachelor.. my boo ( I dont know what to call him ,we arent official yet because I am weird but thats another story haha)  walked up and saw the confusion on my face and I told him &#34; I feel like I am on the Bachelor, where is my Rose &#34; hahah but yah we went inside and it is almost cave like in there, each table has a hot pot.. the food is really good, we had a pre fix menu for Valentines day. I also tried one of their Mojitos . <br><br>I would def return here. I know it was a little pricey ( I didnt look at the bill! ) but I would def come back here , our server was incredible, I cant remember her name but she was sweet and attentive.

Senor Sisig certainly found the secret to making the best burrito there is, just like Facebook found the secret of what people like, ATTENTION!

But Griddle Fresh&#39;s fresh hash browns are the bomb! Okay, they&#39;re basically the same thing as what you&#39;d get at any other diner, but made into a thinner layer and seasoned. That&#39;s it. That&#39;s the secret guys. But the difference it makes!! It eliminates the unseasoned and unfried bits of poor potato hidden in the middle of an average pile of hash brown. Every tiny strip gets to turn golden brown and crispy, and eaten! No potato left behind. And I didn&#39;t even need ketchup.<br><br>And my side of Smoked Salmon Tartine? Also delicious.

"reviewcomment":"This place is amazing!  I&#39;m thinking of another sandwich right now.  The meat is very tender.  I just discovered the cheddar beer sauce on the sandwich took this already great sandwich to the next level.  Mushroom and cheese is my favorite.  They also serve vegetarian varieties.  <br><br>Service is always great.  Food comes out in 10 minutes, as promised.  If they can do anything to service a customer, they will.  They keep the condiments stocked nicely and if they aren&#39;t, the cashiers will do it if you ask.  Very down-to-earth staff, who can hold a conversation.  There is one TV here to watch the major game of the week.  I was watching the Saints play the Hawks yesterday (who the Niners will run all over).  <br><br>Bonus:  This is the only Philly Cheesesteak joint which I have seen them bring local snacks of Philadelphia here.  I just tried their Utz chips, but they also sell peanut chews among other Philadelphia favorites.",

If you&#39;re watching your figure as I do on and off.... Lol you can hit up the salad bar or get a half sized sandwich. It&#39;s affordable, and the ladies are super friendly. At 12, hell yea there will be a line.... for good reason! I love this place!<br><br>To Justin: Who left a 1 star rating.<br><br>You clearly needed a hug that day. Give them another chance, first of all the shop is run by a woman and with 3 female assistants. And if the place was so bad you would not have been waiting in line with  other people for 20 minutes.....  :)<br><br>Don&#39;t waste your time with this sorry excuse for a sandwich shop I sat in line for 20 minutes watching the owner watches employees do all his work for him . there was a thick film of grime over the splash guard in the sandwiches didn&#39;t even look all that great. I don&#39;t know whyanyone would give this place great reviews because he was rather disgusting if you ask me.  save your money and don&#39;t support rude business",

My childhood friends mom does fondue every xmas eve so thats always something that I have to look forward to once a year. I love fondue ! Popular to the misconceived notion , its not just cheese. You do have a cheese pot but there are other pots with olive oil for steak and poultry and seafood.. and then for dessert to... <br><br>The service here is immaculate. It was really beautiful to I think its at a hotel this place. Its funny because when I got out of my car I was walking around a little confused which direction the front door was located at, and suddenly I realized it was really quiet and the building was beautiful and made out of brick and there were flowers, and a limo..and I go deja vue that I was in a past life on an episode of the bachelor.. my boo ( I dont know what to call him ,we arent official yet because I am weird but thats another story haha)  walked up and saw the confusion on my face and I told him &#34; I feel like I am on the Bachelor, where is my Rose &#34; hahah but yah we went inside and it is almost cave like in there, each table has a hot pot.. the food is really good, we had a pre fix menu for Valentines day. I also tried one of their Mojitos . <br><br>I would def return here. I know it was a little pricey ( I didnt look at the bill! ) but I would def come back here , our server was incredible, I cant remember her name but she was sweet and attentive. I will def come back here !! :) great place for a date. .",

I had a passion fruit or guava cocktail after dinner and it went so well with dessert!<br><br>Con&#39;s:<br>-I was not able to eat more as I was extremely satisfied. <br><br>Highlights of our menu:<br><br>Petrole sole- delicious seafood dish. I highly recommend trying it. It comes layered with 3  different delicacies. At the base is a tender filet of fish, then what I think is sea urchin, then caviar. It is served with a light sauce and mushroom accents on a bed of mashed potatoes.<br><br>Seared Filet Mignon with a lobster truffled mac &amp; cheese en brioche accented with a red wine, shallot, thyme bordelaise sauce.

I happened to be walking by Super Duper and they have veggie burgers and GARLIC Fries! Yes, garlic fries. No meat in the garlic fries so you better believe I didn&#39;t miss out an opportunity to try them.<br><br>The cashier was very nice and their service is quick. They handed me a buzzer and I only waited about 5 minutes to get my order. I only had enough time to pick a place to sit and take a peak at what others ordered. A burger joint is so hard to come to when you can&#39;t eat meat, I definitely can&#39;t wait to come back and try a REAL burger. <br><br>Anywho! The veggie burger was great! Perfectly cooked fresh veggie pattie with all the toppings as well as avocado and jack cheese between what a bun should be -- an equal number of soft and firm. This was so filling, but not too much that I felt overstuffed.<br><br>This was a great pair with the highly talked about garlic fries. If only there were a way to capture scent... Man! I wish you guys could smell these things and I mean that in a good way. The fries come with FRESH not powdered garlic like some places and topped with cheese.  And again, THE SMELL!!!! mmmmmmm ... So good... It&#39;s definitely too much for me, if your out with someone it would be good enough to share between two people. But maybe that&#39;s just my opinion. <br><br>Oh and I also gave up soda for lent-- they have a delicious lemonade with brown sugar. <br><br>Price wise... Yeah, they are a little pricey I ended up paying a little over $14 for my veggie burger, garlic fries and drink, but I don&#39;t mind paying for good food.<br><br>To sum it up: <br><br>Veggie Burger: Super<br>Garlic Fries: Duper<br>Lemonade: Delightful<br><br>Thank you for a great Sunday night dinner (:",

"reviewcomment":"So I have been waiting and needing a new experience to bring me back to writing awesome reviews and Whalah! I stumbled across the Millennium!!!!  The first thing that comes to mind is the essence of the inner layout and the precarious placement of its urban location.  The inner parts of this restaurant reminded me of a 1950&#39;s high scale restaurant perhaps in lower Manhattan or Harlem and for some reason I was waiting for Duke Ellington or John Coltrane to appear with quartet and play some unconventional Jazz standards.  In addition, located in the lobby of the Hotel California and smack in the middle of the cities lower Tenderloin District placement could have not been more advantageous or suitable .<br><br> I love the hustle and bustle of SF especially on a Friday or Saturday night, its actually a very nostalgic type of feeling traveling to the location and arriving in front of such a befitting landmark.  When it comes to Vegan food I&#39;m severely biased and well reserved in my opinions of great experiences however, when required too I succumb.  The Millennium in my opinion is a mix between extremely fine dining and shot of morphine intravenously, simply because it really provides the ultimate experience as it pertains to dining and enjoying food.  The atmosphere was filled with positive energy and before I had a bite I almost was certain my experience would be quite overwhelming and worthy of a complete experience and not just conventional dining.  I arrived and was greeted at the front door but the house was extremely packed so while waiting I proceeded to the bar for some libations.  The bar is awesome and worth your undivided attention for many locals drop by just to briefly pregame and continue...  I would definitely come here just to sit at the bar in fact perhaps I will!<br><br>In summation, I ordered the Coconut crusted tofu with curry and a side of lightly steamed kale greens and a chocolate almond midnight for dessert.  The food was ecstatically jubilant and left me in an intense state of euphoria.  They far exceeded beyond my expectations in every regard.  I can still taste the intense but appropriately placed spices and herbs drifting across my palate.   Mind you the prices are not cheap I spent $50 bucks for my fare not including tips or drinks but I must say it was worth $100...   This experience was &#34;Rapturous&#34; subsequently leaving me as if I accomplished my most important task of the day by merely walking through the door.  Its almost unfair to have such a pleasant experience simply because it makes for a disappointing series of events to occur as I explore new options  (note to self)  don&#39;t set such high expectations for upcoming destinations. <br><br>This place is busy especially on weekends so if you plan on coming be prepared to wait if not make a reservation.  I highly recommend making a reservation!!!  I wholeheartedly recommend this establishment and can assure you with certainty you will not be disappointed....  This place is one of the reasons SF is perhaps one of the best cities on the planet...   You MUST Go HERE!  Immediately..........",

My childhood friends mom does fondue every xmas eve so thats always something that I have to look forward to once a year. I love fondue ! Popular to the misconceived notion , its not just cheese. You do have a cheese pot but there are other pots with olive oil for steak and poultry and seafood.. and then for dessert to... <br><br>The service here is immaculate. It was really beautiful to I think its at a hotel this place. Its funny because when I got out of my car I was walking around a little confused which direction the front door was located at, and suddenly I realized it was really quiet and the building was beautiful and made out of brick and there were flowers, and a limo..and I go deja vue that I was in a past life on an episode of the bachelor.. my boo ( I dont know what to call him ,we arent official yet because I am weird but thats another story haha)  walked up and saw the confusion on my face and I told him &#34; I feel like I am on the Bachelor, where is my Rose &#34; hahah but yah we went inside and it is almost cave like in there, each table has a hot pot.. the food is really good, we had a pre fix menu for Valentines day. I also tried one of their Mojitos . <br><br>I would def return here. I know it was a little pricey ( I didnt look at the bill! ) but I would def come back here , our server was incredible, I cant remember her name but she was sweet and attentive. I will def come back here !! :) great place for a date. .",

If you can get over there before the menu gets changed I would highly suggest ordering the Ricotta Cavatelli. Great news as you can order half orders of the pasta!! So you can try a couple if you&#39;d like. The Cavatelli was delicious. Probably my favorite of the night even though the Sea Bass was amazing. But pasta just always hits for me. The Sea Bass I finished so quickly my date was astonished as was I. I meant to offer him a bite but next thing I knew it was gone. Ooops. He ordered half orders of the spaghetti, cavatelli, and steak &amp; fries. Plates were cleaned.<br><br>For dessert I got the Young Ginger Pavlova which was bonkers. If you are a fan of meringues and coconut I highly recommend it.<br><br>I&#39;ll certainly come back.",

It was a cozy romantic atmosphere, great service and food! I got a creamy shrimp pasta any my husband got a a meat and pork pasta special both were amazing! It may be because I&#39;m expecting and eating for two (my excuse) that I ended up finishing my entire entree, which was a good size portion. Bruschetta is a must, so fresh and flavorful! <br><br>We passed on the dessert menu, we were so full, but the server gave us a complimentary Panna cotta dessert topped with fresh fruits.. he said it was for the &#34;baby&#34; haha!!

"reviewcomment":"So I just started this thing called Coffee Meets Bagel and saw this place serves bagels for breakfast so I thought it be a fun place to meet my &#34;bagel&#34; here. <br><br>I waited for 40 minutes. No show. No text saying she&#39;d be late...no response. So while I was waiting I looked over the entire menu, observed the folks casually enjoying their morning brews in the parklet seating area, and checked out some of the small details of the shop. <br><br>This place is like the perfect combination of things: bike shop, coffee shop, good food, and even beer with a happy hour! Can this place be more hipster than that?! <br><br>Anyway, I chalked up the date as a loss and ordered myself a breakfast bagel to go and went home. The bagel hit the spot and I&#39;m glad that I at least got to enjoy some kind of bagel! <br><br>I shall return! Hopefully I&#39;ll have a more successful bagel and check out the little garden in the back. Oh! And don&#39;t forget that the cafe is cash only.",

"reviewcomment":"Wow. So good that I feel the need to write a review in the middle of my meal here!<br>I completely understand why Quince got upgraded to a Michelin 2 star last year.  Definitely everything I have come to expect from restaurants at this level. Incredible service, intricate, imaginative dishes and elegant ambience. I am dining here by myself and the staff has made me feel very comfortable and welcome. <br>Many 2 and 3 star restaurants where I have eaten are usually excellent but seem to imitate the Ferran Adria\ Thomas Keller style. While I am not denigrating this in any way (to the contrary) it is a delight to experience haute cuisine that borrows from this school but also creates something very unique. The menu seems to very much express the current season (spring) without being too light. Quite expensive but if you are a true foodie it&#39;s worth every penny. Epic.<br>Well, time to get back to the food!",

My childhood friends mom does fondue every xmas eve so thats always something that I have to look forward to once a year. I love fondue ! Popular to the misconceived notion , its not just cheese. You do have a cheese pot but there are other pots with olive oil for steak and poultry and seafood.. and then for dessert to... <br><br>The service here is immaculate. It was really beautiful to I think its at a hotel this place. Its funny because when I got out of my car I was walking around a little confused which direction the front door was located at, and suddenly I realized it was really quiet and the building was beautiful and made out of brick and there were flowers, and a limo..and I go deja vue that I was in a past life on an episode of the bachelor.. my boo ( I dont know what to call him ,we arent official yet because I am weird but thats another story haha)  walked up and saw the confusion on my face and I told him &#34; I feel like I am on the Bachelor, where is my Rose &#34; hahah but yah we went inside and it is almost cave like in there, each table has a hot pot.. the food is really good, we had a pre fix menu for Valentines day. I also tried one of their Mojitos . <br><br>I would def return here. I know it was a little pricey ( I didnt look at the bill! ) but I would def come back here , our server was incredible, I cant remember her name but she was sweet and attentive.

The choice of what kind of meat I want in my burger, how I want my burger, the old fashion milkshakes made with their homemade ice cream, different type of fries with different type of toppings. Everything about this place was awesome and made me wish I would find myself on Union Street in San Francisco more often.<br><br>And let me tell you, they don&#39;t skimp on anything. The style burgers were huge and with plenty of ingredients. But not overwhelming with ingredients that you couldn&#39;t find the meat. It was well proportion. I&#39;m glad my friend and went with a style rather than trying to build my own burger. With so much to choose from, I don&#39;t think I would have ever made a final decision.",

After telling the server that it was my birthday, he immediately went and filled up a glass of their finest beer, and insisted that this one was on them. Anthony was as pleasant as can be and made me feel right at home.<br><br>Still, the food was just as great as the friendliness. I had a delicious upper deck sandwich, which was accompanied by a tasty side salad. I was very impressed by how fast the service is, and how they created a sandwich this good and this beautiful so quickly.<br><br>Finally, the ambience of the cafe is the perfect harmony of its three functions; as a cafe, coffee shop, and bar. Light music, wifi, well lit interior, and awesome seating. I highly recommend this place. I came here as my only meal in San Francisco, and I am pleasantly surprised.<br><br>This place has a ton of character, and is executed very well. You&#39;d do well to stop by, if even just for a drink. Mission Public is fantastic.",

"reviewcomment":"This is by far my favorite steakhouse. My uncle celebrated his birthday here and it went perfectly. My aunt worked with the sweetest lady-I forgot her name, who literally did everything she could to accommodate our needs and made sure our dinner party ran smoothly.<br><br>They made us custom menus too! (check my photos)<br><br>As soon as I walked into our private room downstairs, waiters were literally feeding me crab cakes and shrimp like I was a queen. The appetizers are delicious. I&#39;ve eaten a lot of crab cakes in my time and these were the BEST. I was shoving shrimp and crab cakes into my mouth nonstop for a good 15 minutes.<br><br>I felt like a spoiled kid. The second my glass was empty, a waiter was already over my shoulder refilling it. <br><br>I ordered:<br><br>Salad w/ Little Gem &amp; Romaine, Parmesan Vinaigrette, Crispy Capers, Olive Crostini, Nisoshi, Poached Egg: Absolutely delicious. This took salad to a completely new level. The poached egg was the perfect addition to the salad.<br><br>Prime Rib: This is what made me fall in love with Alexanders. Words cannot describe how much I enjoyed this slab of meat. There was a point where I was so full I wanted to cry but I pushed myself to finish because it was so good. Any kind of food isn&#39;t appetizing when you&#39;re full but this WAS. I knew I would regret it the next day if I didn&#39;t finish it- THAT&#39;s how good it was. <br><br>Banana Creme Tart: This isn&#39;t an item on the menu. The chef made it specially for our party because banana cream pie is my uncle&#39;s favorite dessert. The restaurant literally created a new dessert because they HAD to make my uncle&#39;s birthday perfect. Amazing. This place is just amazing. This also became my new favorite dessert. It was SO delicious. Despite eating so much that my stomach was about to explode, after a bite of this I HAD to finish the entire thing. I got a second plate because I couldn&#39;t get enough. It pains me to know that this is not a permanent item, I would order five plates of this every time I come.<br><br>They also gave us this delicious cotton candy after dessert. It was also amazing.<br><br>They also provided us with our own private bathrooms which were basically zen gardens. I wish I took pictures and could show you! Our dining room was beautiful, classy, and comfortable. I felt extremely underdressed.<br><br>This was the best dining experience I&#39;ve ever had. The waiters were super friendly and socialized with us. We all became friends with them by the time our party was over. I knew all about their families and life-changing experiences. How crazy is that? Alexanders will forever and always be my favorite restaurant. Who ever runs this place does a hell of a job and all the employees are angels.",

"reviewcomment":"I love this place! I&#39;ve been here several times now and have noted consistency in the service as well as the food, which are the basic staples of a good restaurant.<br><br>The menu is vegetarian based, but you will not mind it as much because every dish is so flavorful. I personally love getting the Thali dishes because they offer a little bit of everything so you get to sample more. The mango lassi is very yummy here, which is not always an easy feat to accomplish in my books.<br><br>Service is always great - the staff is friendly and efficient with your orders. I will be coming back here again and again! :)<br><br>Parking is street, but there is also a garage behind the establishment. Enjoy!",

Not even sure how to describe it but it was delicious. <br><br>And the fried chicken...was heavenly. The flavor was everything! Sweet, salty, and with a bit of a kick. I can&#39;t express how amazing this eating experience was. <br><br>Lastly, for dessert we got an apple tart? Or something like that. The pastry part was very crispy but good. It worked really well with the fruit, sauce, and ice cream. <br><br>The decor was beautiful and trendy. Service a tad slow but allowed us to digest a bit in between courses.",

My childhood friends mom does fondue every xmas eve so thats always something that I have to look forward to once a year. I love fondue ! Popular to the misconceived notion , its not just cheese. You do have a cheese pot but there are other pots with olive oil for steak and poultry and seafood.. and then for dessert to... <br><br>The service here is immaculate. It was really beautiful to I think its at a hotel this place. Its funny because when I got out of my car I was walking around a little confused which direction the front door was located at, and suddenly I realized it was really quiet and the building was beautiful and made out of brick and there were flowers, and a limo..and I go deja vue that I was in a past life on an episode of the bachelor.. my boo ( I dont know what to call him ,we arent official yet because I am weird but thats another story haha)  walked up and saw the confusion on my face and I told him &#34; I feel like I am on the Bachelor, where is my Rose &#34; hahah but yah we went inside and it is almost cave like in there, each table has a hot pot.. the food is really good, we had a pre fix menu for Valentines day. I also tried one of their Mojitos . <br><br>I would def return here. I know it was a little pricey ( I didnt look at the bill! ) but I would def come back here , our server was incredible, I cant remember her name but she was sweet and attentive.

"reviewcomment":"As many of you know, construction vehicles in front of a sandwich joint are the 5-star Yelp review of yesteryear.  So on my way to work, where I am frequently inconvenienced by double-parked work trucks clogging up the street, rather than banging my steering wheel and yelling terrible things, I smile and think, &#34;Thanks for the tip, fellas!&#34;<br><br>That&#39;s the low-tech story of how I found Freddie&#39;s, a beautifully simple-- but far from run-of-the-mill-- Italian sandwich shop:  double-parked trucks.<br><br>Warning to pretentious food snobs:  the wonderfully drab interior of this sandwich shop will not translate well over Instagram and there is no Sonoma squab liver pate or tea leaves pooped out by monkeys on the menu.  <br><br>Head&#39;s up to my veggie brethren: the vegetarian sandwich is deliciously fresh, with a touch of herbaceous crunch.  It goes far beyond some boring-ass deli sandwich, hold the meat.  There&#39;s also a falafel option.<br><br>A tip for my girls who is always on diets:  the small (6&#34;) sandwich is just the right size for keister control.<br><br>To thems who would never really call themselves foodies but like to put interesting things in their mouths:  there&#39;s herbs in the mustard that add a delicious brightness to your sammy.  There&#39;s also a freshly-baked sweet onion roll bread option, and you can add hot or mild pepper spreads, garlic spread or even cranberry sauce to any sandwich. And of course, there&#39;s a wide variety of Italian cured meats.<br><br>Word up to children of the 70&#39;s and 80&#39;s:  they serve carrot and raisin salad.  No, I don&#39;t want to eat it!  But it&#39;s cool, right?<br><br>Freddie&#39;s has been around since 1926.  1926, beeches!  That&#39;s a lot of cumulative construction crew cred. (And also pretty much guarantees that Joe DiMaggio enjoyed a sandwich here, too, btw.)  Tucked away in that mildly unfashionable North Beach-slash-Fisherman&#39;s Wharf zone, it has somehow quietly survived douchefication and hippies and earthquakes and the middle school kids across the street, so you and I and every dude in a hard hat within two miles can enjoy a tasty sangwich.",

"reviewcomment":"I LOVE this place!!! My bf and I discovered this place when we were on a healthy kick last summer and decided to give it a try. We&#39;ve never once regretted it. All the items are delicious AND healthy for you! Best part is that the calories are already calculated and laid out for you to see to have a better idea of what to choose and how much. We both keep coming back to our two faves: the meatloaf and the bulgar with wild mushrooms. Yum yum! <br><br>We&#39;ve met and spoken with the owner several times. Everyone that works there is super nice, friendly, and helpful. It&#39;s just such a shame that this is the only location as it&#39;s a bit of a drive for us, but we willingly make the trek every month or so.<br><br>Parking is fine during the day time, but as evening approaches it becomes increasingly difficult. <br><br>I think the prices are fair given how much you would spend at another fast food joint for much less healthy food. But no kidding - the clean living can cost you a couple of pretty pennies. <br><br>I&#39;m so in love with this place, I swear even their WATER is phenomenal! :P Please try this place out if you&#39;re considering. Also, you can take extras to go to heat up another night - one less drive to go though!",

It&#39;s a MUST! <br>My friend and I got sat at the chefs counter and it was such a treat! Johnny, the chef was so nice and friendly. He chit chatted with us all night and we had the pleasure of watching him cook our delicious food-he&#39;s pretty easy on the eyes too! ;) <br>This place is really special and completely unpretentious.

The Best iced tea I ever had in my life <br><br>it&#39;s actually unsweetened tea but perfectly flavored by the fresh pieces of watermelon...OMG, i could drink this all day, every days<br>I don&#39;t think I or anybody else could make this better. <br><br>I can&#39;t wait to come back tomorrow to try more items on the menu.<br><br>I want to make mangos my new lunch spot :)<br><br>I left relaxed and happy,<br><br>the price is right considering the quality and freshness of each ingredients and the hand crafting skills of Angelica.<br><br>definitely a better option in that neighborhood",

My childhood friends mom does fondue every xmas eve so thats always something that I have to look forward to once a year. I love fondue ! Popular to the misconceived notion , its not just cheese. You do have a cheese pot but there are other pots with olive oil for steak and poultry and seafood.. and then for dessert to... <br><br>The service here is immaculate. It was really beautiful to I think its at a hotel this place. Its funny because when I got out of my car I was walking around a little confused which direction the front door was located at, and suddenly I realized it was really quiet and the building was beautiful and made out of brick and there were flowers, and a limo..and I go deja vue that I was in a past life on an episode of the bachelor.. my boo ( I dont know what to call him ,we arent official yet because I am weird but thats another story haha)  walked up and saw the confusion on my face and I told him &#34; I feel like I am on the Bachelor, where is my Rose &#34; hahah but yah we went inside and it is almost cave like in there, each table has a hot pot.. the food is really good, we had a pre fix menu for Valentines day. I also tried one of their Mojitos . <br><br>I would def return here. I know it was a little pricey ( I didnt look at the bill! ) but I would def come back here , our server was incredible, I cant remember her name but she was sweet and attentive. I will def come back here !! :) great place for a date. .",

The server was very helpful and pointed out the most popular dishes. We ordered the Lomo Saltado, which was beef with rice and fries, Arroz con Pollo, which was chicken, rice and peas in a cilantro sauce and the Aguadito de Mariscos which is a seafood soup.<br><br>The Lomo Saltado &amp; Arroz con Pollo were amazing!!!! Full of flavor. The soup was okay, I felt that it needed a little bit more flavor but it was still good.<br><br>I plan on coming back and trying different dishes!",

"reviewcomment":"Hidden in an alley, yet gets pretty packed for lunch! Buckwheat and gluten free crepes? A galette is a form of crêpe made with buckwheat flour, it is an open-faced crepe. Galette is located in an alleyway off Kearny. It&#39;s only open for lunch so get there early, take a whiff while you wait and eat the heavenly little love on your plate. It&#39;s already one of the more pleasant FiDi lunch options (with just-added dinner, Wed.-Fri.): casual, order-at-the-counter ease. The space is minimalist reminds me of a restaurant in The Village in New York, very simple yet quaint.<br><br>Ordered the number #8  the Brie-hugger  because I love brie it was so tasty and since the gallete is so thin I was expecting it to be very light but it was very filling.   The salad was very tangy and refreshing. <br><br>Also got the special that day the Roasted Beet Salad also a very generous serving.  Delicious! Was too stuffed to even try the dessert galette but there is always a next time! Five stars that is how happy I was with my lunch!",

Rice was perfect. Curry was also perfect. I asked &#34;spicy&#34; and was happy with the level of spiciness. The guys who work there were really friendly and fast. <br><br>The place is really small but we didn&#39;t have trouble with seating at all. So what if it&#39;s not a fancy place with real dishes and silverware? It&#39;s delicious, fast, and no expensive.",

"reviewcomment":"Ok we went for Sunday dinner, took our 7 and 9 year old (they eat at places like this a lot-but would not necessarily say kid friendly). Usually the only problem with taking our kids is not the kids but the restaurants assumption about kids- some places stick us at cruddy tables, ignore us (assuming low check) that kind if thing!<br>Park Tavern was absolutely 1st class from the minute we walked in!<br>The hosts were kind and accommodating  from the get-go. Out waiter Hudson was awesome, friendly-attentive and patient with the kids (we like them to ask questions and order for themselves).<br>The manager, Steven...checked on us throughout the night...and was also very friendly, accommodating and seemed pleased we were there!  We will be back many many times-oh and the food!!! OMG OMG! Brussel sprout chips, mussels, burger, pork chop, deviled eggs, wagu jerky, And prawns....everything was better than GOOD, and the wine was superb!<br>Can&#39;t thank Hudson, Steven and all of the staff for making ALL if us feel welcome, comfortable and appreciated!",

"reviewcomment":"As I promised myself, my very first EVER review is going to Tekka. <br><br>For about 2-3 months before I actually ate here, I would fall asleep staring at the pictures of their sashimi combos on my phone (not joking). My boyfriend brought me here for my birthday and we ran into some traffic and didn&#39;t there until about 6pm. From all the other reviews, 6pm is considered &#34;late&#34; if you wanna make the 7:15pm seating, so I started getting nervous that we wouldn&#39;t make it. When we got there, there was no one there, and there was still no line even at 6:45pm, so I started to think it was closed for the day since I also read that they like to close randomly without notification. People walked up and mumbled that it was closed, and the two girls that showed up in line were also convinced they wouldn&#39;t open. We waited until 7:20pm, and right when we were about to leave, a car pulled up, and it was Nobu &amp; his cute little wife! We got in at about 7:45pm and were seated in front of his work station. There were about 8 of us total. Soon after we got seated, we were served green tea, and his wife took our orders.<br><br>We ordered:<br>Sashimi combo<br>Agedashi tofu<br>Hamachi kama<br>2 unagi nigiri (1 piece per order)<br>2 uni<br>2 scallop nigiri<br><br>Their nigiri is HUGE--about half the size of my chopsticks. The sashimi combo came with easily 48 pieces of extremely fresh sashimi that Nobu cuts in front of you. I liked how the agedashi tofu came with a mountain of bonito flakes, but the sauce was kindof thick, like a teriyaki sauce. The hamachi kama--GET IT. IT IS AMAZING. The meat is so moist and the crust is crispy, salty, and lemony. GET IT.<br><br>Overall, we over-ordered. A group of 2 people next to us left spending about $75, and we left spending ~$115 after tip and tax (oh yeah, CASH ONLY). Tekka is definitely on the low spectrum of $$$ because you&#39;re getting a LOT more than what you would at any other restaurant for the same price. And--Nobu and his wife are so cute! When we left, they stopped what they were doing, smiled, and yelled &#34;arigato!&#34; The wait is worth it, especially with their extremely reasonable prices and high quality of food. Next time I&#39;ll order the spicy tuna roll--it looked huge and packed with strips of tuna! Eat here! I&#39;ll definitely be back.",

"reviewcomment":"As mentioned in my previous review, 15 Romolo is a great bar with totally underrated food. And if food is underrated, then brunch at 15 Romolo is the most underrated meal here but that needs to change. This is brunch done right. <br><br>Let&#39;s start with waffle shots. It&#39;s 15 Romolo&#39;s amuse bouche for boozy brunch and boozy it is. Bite sized waffle sprinkled with powdered sugar dunked into a bourbon/rum and coffee liquer shot. Now I&#39;m ready for brunch. But wait let&#39;s order a Bloody Mary first. By far one of the spiciest Bloodys in the city but it&#39;s mighty tasty. If spicy is not your thing, then the Beetlejuice is a nice gin and beet alternative. or just get a glass of punch because as it says on the menu, &#34;without a drink in hand, brunch is just breakfast.&#34;<br><br>Menu changes somewhat often which is great for variety but sad to see old favorites like the fried chicken biscuit go away. It&#39;s almost like the dinner version but throw in some egg, bacon, and hashbrowns. Yum! But my new favorite brunch item on the current brunch menu is the country fried steak. Tenderized beef breaded, fried, then smothered in gravy accompanied by some over easy eggs and hashbrowns plus some salad for balance. So satisfying for brunch. <br><br>I love boozy brunch at 15 Romolo. If you like happy hour here, you need to stop by for brunch. I think the bar best explains why themselves: &#34;If 15 Romolo is a well-kept secret, then our weekend pnchdrnkbrnch is f-ing Narnia!&#34;",

"reviewcomment":"Great place for fancy schmancy dim sum!!<br><br>I thought the bill was going to be horrendous from previous reviews, but it really wasn&#39;t that bad.  Comparable in price to Yank Sing, but a much swankier, high end, hip and exclusive feel to it.  I think two of us ate for about $120, and that&#39;s a no holds barred meal, smorgasbord of food, also including seafood and drinks.  All the dishes were about $6-12 each, except the main lobster with spinach noodle, which ran about $28 but was weeellllllll worth it. YUM.<br><br>Each dish comes out artistically presented on a plate or in a bamboo steamer.  Each dish more delicious and beautiful than the last!!  The only unimpressive dish was the fried rice.  We ordered the chocolate orange dessert and were blown away not only by the taste, but the pop rocks added an outside-the-box texture and the presentation includes an interactive display of melting the outer shell of the chocolate ball right before your eyes and revealing the light and fluffy truffle innards.  Oh and it had edible gold flakes all over it too.  You basically feel like you are literally eating royalty.  <br><br>Great place to take a guest or a group if you really want to impress.  We came for lunch and it wasn&#39;t too busy, but I could totally see this place hopping on a Friday/Saturday night.  The bar is huge and looks like it could be a lot of fun for a group of people or for those looking for a good time ;) ;)",

We were brought out an array of recommendations from the ladies, and each dish came with a story or a memory to match the delicious food presented to us. <br><br>For some reason, German dining is always warm and inviting, but at Walzwerk, the bar is set high.",

"reviewcomment":"In my estimations thus far Okina is the best &#34;authentic&#34; style sushi place in San Francisco. If you crave California style fusion rolls laden with avocado, spicy mayonnaise, chicken, etc. do not waste your time coming here, this is purist sushi. <br><br>The spartan menu consists simply of nigiri, sashimi, and beer. Sashimi is priced the same as nigiri, which is fairly unheard of. Once you go you will realize this is because he uses the same sized sashimi cuts for both the sashimi and the nigiri. What fish is available will vary each time you come, as allegedly he only opens the restaurant with the freshest fish of the day. <br><br>Important to note, if you cannot make and keep a reservation do not come here. Walk-in dining is virtually unheard of and somewhat frowned upon at this tiny 12 person seating restaurant. They take reservations same day if you call the hour they open and it is possible to book a day or two in advance which is HIGHLY advisable as they book up for the entire weekend fast! <br><br>The bottom line: best raw authentic sushi, hours and reservations take some attention to detail to successfully execute, overall completely worthwhile, real hole in the wall, bring a date or a friend not a group.",

My childhood friends mom does fondue every xmas eve so thats always something that I have to look forward to once a year. I love fondue ! Popular to the misconceived notion , its not just cheese. You do have a cheese pot but there are other pots with olive oil for steak and poultry and seafood.. and then for dessert to... <br><br>The service here is immaculate. It was really beautiful to I think its at a hotel this place. Its funny because when I got out of my car I was walking around a little confused which direction the front door was located at, and suddenly I realized it was really quiet and the building was beautiful and made out of brick and there were flowers, and a limo..and I go deja vue that I was in a past life on an episode of the bachelor.. my boo ( I dont know what to call him ,we arent official yet because I am weird but thats another story haha)  walked up and saw the confusion on my face and I told him &#34; I feel like I am on the Bachelor, where is my Rose &#34; hahah but yah we went inside and it is almost cave like in there, each table has a hot pot.. the food is really good, we had a pre fix menu for Valentines day. I also tried one of their Mojitos . <br><br>I would def return here. I know it was a little pricey ( I didnt look at the bill! ) but I would def come back here , our server was incredible, I cant remember her name but she was sweet and attentive.

"reviewcomment":"Took me a while to find a great shawerma in Seattle and once I did it became my go to place for years. After moving to SF a few years ago I was determined to find something similar to my beloved Garlic Crush so I hit up Yelp and tried every single middle eastern place I could find in the city. After eating a lot of mediocre wraps in many highly rated establishments I was beginning to lose faith in this cities palate for good middle eastern food.<br><br>Just when I thought all hope was lost, Oasis grill pulled me back in. This was a tiny place close to my apartment that I&#39;d overlooked for some reason. I&#39;ve since become a regular at Oasis and have eaten here dozens of times. Their spicy chicken shawerma wrap is my go to order, it is juicy, filling and absolutely delicious! So far the best shawerma I&#39;ve found SF - I grew up in the middle east so I know my shawermas really well. Their falafels are pretty awesome too so I usually grab 2 or 3 with every order as a side. Make sure to get extra tahini sauce.<br><br>Some pro tips:<br>- The lines can be long, but they&#39;re very good about taking orders over the phone so I highly recommend doing that if you&#39;re in a hurry or just dont like waiting. <br>- There are also no tables to dine-in but you could always go to the open courtyard in front of the Hyatt (on the Ferry Building side) that has tons of tables. Its just across the street and there&#39;s a decent view. If thats too far (which it isnt) you can also go to Ziggy&#39;s Burgers couple of doors down which is owned by the same business - apparently they encourage that.<br><br>There is another location at 4th and Howard but for some reason I prefer the food at Drumm street. They&#39;re also opening up two more stores as far as I know, 3rd and Market and 1st and Minna.",

"reviewcomment":"Sooo good. Went on a coworker&#39;s recommendation. He said get the egg-salad sandwich. I NEVER get the egg-salad sandwich anywhere, but I am glad I followed his advice. It was made of huge pieces of boiled egg, lightly spiced and not too mayonnaise-y. Super fresh and delicious. Also huge. <br><br>AND they offer gluten-free bread. I am one of those annoying gluten-intolerant people, so it makes me really, really happy when I can get a big ole sandwich just like everybody else. Another plus: the gluten-free roll they use is as big (or close to as big) as the regular rolls, so you don&#39;t get skimped on the size of your sandwich. You gluten-free people out there know the tiny 3-inches-across thing most sandwich shops give you when you order gluten-free bread. For me, Tony&#39;s sandwich was two full meals.<br><br>UPDATE: I went back for lunch today. The guy at the cash register was super-nice and the tuna sandwich I had was stellar.  Fresh and yummy. I&#39;d add a star if I could.",

"reviewcomment":"Best place to get a cheese steak this side of South Philly. At this location you get all the vibe and attitude.  <br><br>Make sure you pick up a frequency card.  You might think you&#39;ll never go back, but as their slogan says, Caution, may be habit forming.  Want a healthy alternative?  They do have Chicken and Vegetable alternatives.  <br><br>This is not a Wit Wiz type of place.  Standard sandwich asks if you want peppers, onions, and cheese.  Small is 7&#34; and large is 10&#34;<br><br>A good recommendation is to put them on auto-dial.  Phone orders allow for you to skip the line when you arrive.<br><br>This place has been savior for many late nights at the adjacent UCSF clinic while waiting for loved ones.  There are many other locations in the Bay Area.  I&#39;ve only been to the other one in Berkeley",

My childhood friends mom does fondue every xmas eve so thats always something that I have to look forward to once a year. I love fondue ! Popular to the misconceived notion , its not just cheese. You do have a cheese pot but there are other pots with olive oil for steak and poultry and seafood.. and then for dessert to... <br><br>The service here is immaculate. It was really beautiful to I think its at a hotel this place. Its funny because when I got out of my car I was walking around a little confused which direction the front door was located at, and suddenly I realized it was really quiet and the building was beautiful and made out of brick and there were flowers, and a limo..and I go deja vue that I was in a past life on an episode of the bachelor.. my boo ( I dont know what to call him ,we arent official yet because I am weird but thats another story haha)  walked up and saw the confusion on my face and I told him &#34; I feel like I am on the Bachelor, where is my Rose &#34; hahah but yah we went inside and it is almost cave like in there, each table has a hot pot.. the food is really good, we had a pre fix menu for Valentines day. I also tried one of their Mojitos . <br><br>I would def return here. I know it was a little pricey ( I didnt look at the bill! ) but I would def come back here , our server was incredible, I cant remember her name but she was sweet and attentive. I will def come back here !! :) great place for a date. .",

Once you manage to navigate past the depressing scenery of drug addicts and homeless, you get to this restaurant and it&#39;s all worth it. <br><br>Last time I had a small cup of the Tom Kha soup with tofu and the satay chicken as appetizers. One word - Excellent!  For the entree I ordered the Lamb Yellow Curry with the brown rice for a side. This was amazing as well. <br><br>This time I ordered the Tom Yum soup with veggie chicken for an appetizer. Golly what flavors!  The soup is the perfect appetizer for a cold San Francisco night. For an entree I ordered the Pad Ped spicy with veggie chicken and brown rice.  Excellent and flavorful as expected. <br><br>The unique combination of friendly, prompt service along with excellent vegetarian food presented elegantly is the reason why I am giving it 5 stars.  I wish we had a restaurant like this in Dallas.",

My source for Nopa suggested to do brunch and book a reservation whatever time of day I actually decided to come. <br><br>My source was right: this place is constantly busy and with good reason. The food is out of this world and the service is impeccable. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever encountered a well-informed staff since my restaurant trip in Las Vegas to Twist. I ended up coming here for dinner and I believe I had the sea bass (I honestly forgot which fish it was) and it was absolutely delicious. I never knew you could cut orange peels into a meal and eat them, let alone enjoy eating them! Mind blown for sure. <br><br>For dessert, I tried the dark chocolate tart with goat cheese ice cream. At first me and my friend were like, &#34;um, why goat cheese ice cream?!?&#34; As soon as we got our order, our tone changed to &#34;holy crap, GOAT CHEESE ICE CREAM!!&#34; Needless to say, our adventure to Nopa was ACA-MAZING!!! <br><br>I&#39;m now on the hunt for more wonderous goat cheese ice cream.

"reviewcomment":"Some of the reviews for this place are confusing. This is only one of the SF locations, so make sure you&#39;re looking at the correct address before you go. It&#39;s really just a bakery without all of the other foods that I guess are at the other location. This place has bread (duh), coffee, and I saw a big cauldron of I-don&#39;t-know-what. <br><br>I went here just for bread and bought a 1lb sourdough. $3 and some change. I was pleasantly surprised that they offer to cut it for you. Yes, thank you. :) <br><br>Another note: I went really late in the evening just before they closed, and the bread was still wonderful and fresh. I&#39;ve run into issues with stale bread at other bakeries when I&#39;ve gone just before close. Not this place!",

"reviewcomment":"I am a HUGE fan.<br><br>I&#39;ve been by a few times but lately I realize how good this place is.  The Italian Combo on Sourdough is legitimately delicious.  Holy Cow.  This is a good sandwich.  The meat is generous and tasty.  The bread is really good.  I get mine with lettuce, tomato, onion, mayo, oil and vinegar, and pepperoncini sauce,  Yum.  <br><br>I also liked the Bagel (sesame) with Eggs and Cheddar.  (In fact, I&#39;ll have it for breakfast tomorrow.)  <br><br>They have single cans of Diet (Canada Dry) Ginger Ale.",
