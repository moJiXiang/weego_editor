"reviewcomment":"Max City is AMAZING! Jason and his team catered our October 2013 wedding in Pasadena and we can&#39;t say enough about their food and their service. We talked to them last year when we started planning the big day and they were quick to respond to all inquires, professional and even found another wedding in the area where we could stop by undetected, behind the scenes, to test everything out. We knew right away we&#39;d found our the right guys. <br><br>For the wedding we went with brisket, ribs and bbq chicken. Sides included cornbread, mac n cheese, baked beans and cucumber salad. We also asked Max City to cater at the cocktail hour. We went with the bacon wrapped dates, grilled cheese with mini pickle and a german dish Jason helped design of sausage and sauerkraut (to go with our German biergarten theme). We got SO many compliments on all of the food. We were initially worried our vegetarian guests might have a hard time finding something on our meat-centered menu, but we also got nothing but praise from them- one of them even going to say that the sides at our wedding were better than any vegetarian dish they&#39;d been served at any prior weddings. Our guests went back for seconds and some thirds! The food was THAT good! <br><br>We would recommend Max City to anyone and now can&#39;t wait for them to open up their restaurant!",

"reviewcomment":"Wow! This place is literally a hidden gem...no joke, it&#39;s hidden.   It&#39;s on the backside of the building (not facing Wilshire but rather the parking structure).  You can cut through McDonalds all the way to the back and you will find Deli-In.  It&#39;s closer to the Normandie side of the building directly facing the entrance to Wifit Gym.<br><br>Though this is an asian owned establishment serving latin cuisine, don&#39;t knock it.  The food is incredible, the amount of latin clientele showed me that the place is legit. <br><br>I tried a breakfast burrito with bacon and it was yummy. It had the crispiest hash brown and I&#39;m a sucker anything potato related.  I also read that they had good pupusa&#39;s and thank you yelpers, it was delicious!  If you&#39;ve never tried pupusa&#39;s before, it&#39;s an El Salvadorian pancake like dish - you can get it with meat or simply with bean/cheese which seems to be the best way to go!  <br><br>The service was probably the best part of the whole experiencel and everyone seemed to be a regular.  If you like hole in the walls, great food and good service, check this place out.",

"reviewcomment":"Prepare yourself for the best traditional Memphis-style beef ribs ever--flat-out sensational. The velvety, succulent meat here simply glides away from the bone. Ask for extra sauce on the side so you can appreciate the complexity of the seasoning.<br><br>The Pizza dough is prepared fresh and made to order all the ingredients are fresh and local. Because of the simplicity of the ingredients and taste and flavor it can easily be compared to Pizza served in Italy. <br><br>Prices are much cheaper than their competitors. It&#39;s clean and has an A from the health Department. Usually it&#39;s big issue with these small joint but this is squeaky clean. <br><br>But most importantly their customer service is off the hook!!!  Everyone is super friendly. This place is definitely a Must Go for all food lovers.",

"reviewcomment":"I had just landed to LAX with a 2-hour drive ahead of me. Of course there was no decent grub on the 6-hour flight from Baltimore and I was rushing and hadn&#39;t packed my brown bag. So I opened up the Happy Cow app and chose the closest vegan eatery from my location dubbed Stuff I Eat. Yes, I was in nutritional heaven.<br>Going through the menu was daunting due to the plethora of magnificent and colorful choices. Serving both cooked and raw meals, Stuff I Eat ascertains that every meal is comprised of protein, fiber, complex carbs, good fats and vitamins and minerals. I selected a fresh juice and the Nut Burger, which was paired with a salad, baked potatoes and steamed veggies. I knew I shouldn&#39;t have eaten it all, but who knew when I would return. Babett was in the kitchen working her culinary magic as usual and came out to check on me. She was congenial, energetic and ultra friendly. After speaking for a few moments on health and fitness - yes, she loves to run - she stated her age and I almost spilled my green juice. &#34;Sixty what,&#34; I shouted! I would have estimated 42 years old at the most. Amazing how plant-based foods heal, nourish and enliven opposed to age, sicken and diminish like meats and dairy. The experience was unforgettable and I left very appeased. <br>After a few days I was driving back to LAX for the return flight home. Of course I was running late again but had to chance it and made another pit stop at my new favorite LA Vegan Pro establishment. Since, I have taken quite a few friends and business associates to Stuff I Eat. You should see the look on omnivore&#39;s faces when they bite into a Nut Burger! Babette is also an accomplished singer and entertained us with a live performance while we ate enjoyably. What a beautiful and energetic spirit I thought. So make sure to visit when you are in the Inglewood area. Or simply plan a special trip to get you some of the enchilada pie, Lava Burrito, Carrot Croquettes, or my favorite, The Nut Burger!",

"reviewcomment":"I LOVE PORTOS! I have heard about this place for the longest time and I used to live right by the one in North Hollywood. I can&#39;t believe I had never gone. Mostly just because I was always in a rush and the lines there are pretty outrageous. Depending on time of day I guess, but every time I have gone I have had to wait in a decently sized long line. But let me tell you, it is worth it.<br><br>I love that they serve mojitos as well. I didn&#39;t even know until my friend treated me to one of those heavenly drinks, during one of our lunch date outings. It wasn&#39;t very strong but who cares, I&#39;m not planning on getting plastered at 2 in the afternoon. Anyways, it was real mint and fresh fruit, super refreshing and yummy.<br><br>I love there rum cake here as well. The last time I got it it was really soggy though. But I&#39;m not sure if it was because we didn&#39;t eat it right away. There are these really yummy potato balls, they have meat so vegetarians should avoid. But my husband loves them, he couldn&#39;t stop raving about them after he tried them. <br><br>I love the guava cheese pastries as well as other random treats I tried. They always have fresh bakery items and LOTS of variety so you can pick and choose according to whatever your mood and preference is that day. Enjoy!",

The two-person staff manning the station at the Crossfit/Yoga session for Yelp&#39;s Passport to Glendale was pretty professional; they were friendly, efficient and open to conversation which was nice. And if that wasn&#39;t good enough, their burger was bombnom. <br><br>I didn&#39;t know what it was at first so I cheated and looked it up online but I&#39;m pretty sure they served their Signature Burger, which consists of grass- fed dry- aged beef, homemade garlic cilantro aioli, sweet onion marmalade, sharp cheddar, and wild baby arugula, served on a Brioche bun. It was yummy in my tummy! Meaty, juicy patty sandwiched between soft sweet bread buns and complimented well with melted cheese, bitter greens and sweet sweet onions. Goodness, I just drooled. <br><br>Can&#39;t wait to hopefully run into them again sometime in the future! :)",

"reviewcomment":"I love this food truck! I am a huge fan of Hawaiian shaved ice and Get Shaved hits the spot and fulfills my cravings every time! They have a good selection of flavors to choose from. My favorite combo is their One Love which is melona, mango, and watermelon. Sometimes I like to substitute watermelon with strawberry or fruit punch to give it a different kind of taste. Either way it is still delicious!<br><br>The texture of the ice is amazing. Smooth and soft just like how Hawaiian ice should be. A great addition to this dessert is vanilla ice cream--I don&#39;t know what brand they use but it is really rich, creamy, and fluffy--it compliments the ice really well. You also have a choice of condensed milk or sour spray as an additional free topping. Get the condensed milk and avoid their white macadamia ice cream (it tasted horrible).<br><br>Their service is great. If you go often they remember who you are. They usually come to the Diamond Bar area on Wednesday nights; you can follow them on Twitter and find out when they are coming! Definitely a must try and have.",

"reviewcomment":"Man oh man this establishment knows it has to jump through hoops to maintain its 5 star (well, almost 5) rating on Yelp. They have a HUGE banner that states the fact that they have a high yelp rating, and once you walk in, you&#39;re greeted right away. I asked for a takeout menu and was promptly told the most popular dishes and asked what I was in the mood for. I got the chicken lovers combo, and sat and waited while it was prepared. The waitress asked if I wanted a beverage while waiting, which was considerate. I expected just a tap water, but lo and behold, she brings a fancy cold glass jug of water with a fancy goblet type of glass as I wait. Who does that? Lusy&#39;s Cafe/Grill does! lol. <br><br>As for my food itself, I was not disappointed. The chicken shish was perfectly prepared, it was moist, succulent and very well seasoned, and the perfect temperature. It also had another sort of chicken kubideh and that was also delicious. The meal came with rice, a salad, hummus and pickled turnips. I searched EVERY yelp review for this place, and nobody mentioned the pickled turnips, which were a lovely deep pink/or light red hue. They were SO GOOD! Who ever even heard of such a thing? Not I! I didn&#39;t even know what kind of vegetable it was, except for the fact that it was some sort of root veggie and pickled. Now I know I like them!  The hummus was nicely seasoned, too, with some (I think) paprika on top. <br><br>Lusy&#39;s is a great little mom and pop shop. I admire the owner for starting a restaurant and that this is clearly a labor of love for her. She has earned this hard-won reputation, and I wish her the best. One suggestion? I wish they had dolmas!",

"reviewcomment":"Max City is AMAZING! Jason and his team catered our October 2013 wedding in Pasadena and we can&#39;t say enough about their food and their service. We talked to them last year when we started planning the big day and they were quick to respond to all inquires, professional and even found another wedding in the area where we could stop by undetected, behind the scenes, to test everything out. We knew right away we&#39;d found our the right guys. <br><br>For the wedding we went with brisket, ribs and bbq chicken. Sides included cornbread, mac n cheese, baked beans and cucumber salad. We also asked Max City to cater at the cocktail hour. We went with the bacon wrapped dates, grilled cheese with mini pickle and a german dish Jason helped design of sausage and sauerkraut (to go with our German biergarten theme). We got SO many compliments on all of the food. We were initially worried our vegetarian guests might have a hard time finding something on our meat-centered menu, but we also got nothing but praise from them- one of them even going to say that the sides at our wedding were better than any vegetarian dish they&#39;d been served at any prior weddings. Our guests went back for seconds and some thirds! The food was THAT good! <br><br>We would recommend Max City to anyone and now can&#39;t wait for them to open up their restaurant!",

"reviewcomment":"As good as it gets.<br><br>If I was to ever be asked what my favorite fine dining experience was, it would be at Mastros. The experience and food is worth every penny. <br><br>I&#39;m not really a steak lover-- I&#39;m more drawn towards seafood. This place almost made me into a steak lover though. How can a cow be so tender and full of rich buttery flavors?? Yet charred so perfectly on the outside to give the steak the perfect balance between tenderness and texture at the same time? Oh wait, Mastros has it down for sure! <br><br>Parking isn&#39;t really an issue here. Most people valet their cars right in front or there&#39;s some street parking and a parking structure across the street. I prefer valet parking. It&#39;s easy and convenient in my opinion. When you get inside, you see what you expected: beautiful, grand decor. Beautiful restaurant with beautiful people everywhere-- we in Beverly Hills for sure! <br><br>We had reservations but there was like less than a 10 min wait for our table so we grabbed a drink at the bar conveniently located near the entrance. We were then escorted to our quiet, dainty table on the first floor. I&#39;m glad we were seated on the first floor since I had heard that it can get pretty loud on the other floors. Our server was probably the most professional server I&#39;ve ever met. By professional I don&#39;t necessarily mean the friendliest or chattiest-- I mean straight up professional.. every detail you would expect in an upscale restaurant. Impeccable service for sure. <br><br>I think the bread restaurants serve in the beginning of the meal is a good sign of how the rest of the meal is gonna go... Shitty bread, usually shitty meal (not in all cases of course). This place has the best bread ever!! There&#39;s a soft, long pretzel bread that I couldn&#39;t stop eating! I fought the urge so I could enjoy the rest of the meal. <br><br>For an appetizer, we ordered the Alaskan red king crab claws and sautéed sea scallops. Both were delicious. I loved that our appetizer was seafood since our main entree was definitely going to be meaty. For the main entree, we ordered the bone- in ribeye (medium) and the porterhouse (medium rare). Both dishes were perfection. I love that the steak comes out on plates that will almost burn your hand if you touch it. I don&#39;t want my $60+ steak to get cold in five minutes! It also cooks the steak a little more while it sits on your plate. I only ate half of mine since the steak was gargantuan but it was a real treat heating it up the next day and eating it while watching some hbo. As sides we ordered the lobster mashed potatoes (of course we did!) and creamed spinach. Both complimented the steak perfectly. I mean c&#39;mon, what doesn&#39;t sound enticing about lobster mashed potatoes?? You can really taste the butter and lobster infused with every bite of potato. For dessert, we ordered the butter cake (why of course we did..). It&#39;s famous and ordered by everyone for a reason, people! It&#39;s scrumptious! Delightful! Buttery! Try it. It&#39;s a great finish to a great meal. <br><br>This place just had it down all around-- service, taste of food, professionalism, ambience, etc. I can&#39;t wait to go back!",

At this point I tell Todd the mood I happen to be in and magically (in almost no time) he&#39;s given me the perfect haircut. Every Single Time!

"reviewcomment":"I have to admit this place was a little expensive... I wanted to order a small drink (kind of like a smoothie) and it was $10! Uhhh I can buy 3 burgers with that at McDonalds homie. <br><br>BUT the food was delicious, clean, healthy, and the service was also very good. The place is clean, cute and the music was great! Some of my friends needed a to-go box and wanted a box for their chipotle sauce for their French fries but the lady working just gave us new chipotle sauces! Other places would charge for extra sauce so that was really nice of her.<br><br>I would definitely go back to this cafe because they have a lot of different foods to choose from and from what me and my 3 friends ordered (all different), everything was good so I&#39;m excited to see what else they have to offer",

My only complaint would be to echo another reviewer below and say that the carne asada can be a bit dry, best to stick to other meats. The sides are plentiful, the sauce on point, dollar tacos, friendly service, what more can you possibly ask for?<br><br><br>A+",

"reviewcomment":"Seafood from a taco truck are you crazy!!! Yeah thats what I said... turns out its actually very very very good!<br><br>When I think of having seafood the last thing that comes to mind is having seafood from a lunch truck- UNTIL now.  Rolling up to 4th and Rose isn&#39;t much of a view and the location isn&#39;t on a main stretch of Venice beach but it adds to the mystique of it all.  The few times Ive been here its been pretty busy but the line and wait are quick, people are friendly, and food is definitely good eats!<br><br>My all time favorite thing to order here is the tostada de ceviche- finely minced fish, tomato, cilantro and onion on a crispy tostada, with a slice of freshly sliced avocado. Its fresh, its light, and seasoned perfectly!  Its just a great snack especially on a warm day.  <br><br>The tacos here are pretty good as well.  The tacos de asada is pretty standard. The meat is nicely cooked, juicy and seasoned well. The tacos de chicharron are really good.  Nice and fried, seasoned and delicious.  Tacos are served with pinto beans but you can opt out.  The salsa isn&#39;t very spicy and does need a little salt but still pretty good compared to other salsa I&#39;ve had.  <br><br>Overall, the snacks here are simple but oh so good.  Try it then become a regular like me!",

I can say with full confidence, I know my laffa, hummus, tahini et al. And Joe&#39;s knows it best.<br><br>Where to begin? The obvious place is the bowl of fried pita chips sprinkled with zatar at the counter to tie you over until your order is ready. They&#39;re more addictive than french fries -- I dare you to try and eat just one. The owners know it too which is why they provide little containers with a pair of tongs next to the pita chips. <br><br>The laffa is made fresh on the premises and rivals any laffa anywhere. It&#39;s so tasty you can eat it on its own but then you&#39;d miss out on the seasoned shawarma, creamy hummus and lemony fresh salad to wrap in it. That said, I had the shawarma in a laffa today and I&#39;m still reveling in my meal. <br><br>I also want to note how the owners/workers at Joe&#39;s are conscientious good people. I was dining with my toddler and they purposely made our meal quicker than other peoples&#39; meals who were ahead of us in line. Knowing full well that toddlers are ticking time bombs, I found it very sweet of the staff to keep this in mind. In this world where manners are disappearing and very few people even hold doors open for moms and newborn babies, the folks at Joe&#39;s are really genuinely nice people. Given that their food is positively excellent, their conscientiousness is just the cherry on top.",

"reviewcomment":"Oh, Medocino Farms. You&#39;re the only place (so far) that I don&#39;t feel guilty for buying a $10 sandwich to go. Yes, it is that good! <br><br>With all the raving reviews I&#39;ve read for months, I was quite skeptical about Mendocino Farms. Would it be worth the hype? It definitely was. <br><br>I&#39;ve tried a few of their sandwiches, and none of them disappointed. The flavor was there, and the portion was decent, considering that it&#39;s sandwiches they&#39;re selling. <br><br>I&#39;ve never eaten at this particular location; I&#39;d walk here during my lunch break once a while and get something to go. The lunch rush is a bit crazy - a bunch of people ordering and waiting for their food, and a bunch of people walking around/squirming to find a place to sit or stand, and a fair number of people surrounding the area asking for free samples of various salad-y foods. <br><br>Despite the popularity of Mendocino Farms, I&#39;ve always left happy with a delicious sandwich. <br><br>Their spicy lemongrass bahn mi came in ciabiatta bread, panini style. I&#39;m not great with choosing breads to go on sandwiches, so I leave it to them or go with the default. Although I thought it looked a bit small, it was the best &#34;bahn mi&#34; from a non-specialized bahn mi place. I couldn&#39;t get much of the spiciness of the lemon grass, but the tenderness of the meat and how well the flavors went together in that panini left me wanting more. Their other bahn mi was good too, but it was much messier. <br><br>Their farm sandwich/turkey sandwich was good too. They sure do an awesome job with combining ingredients. <br><br>They also have gluten free bread, which is $1.50 or $2.00 more. Unfortunately, you could tell it is gluten free bread, so I&#39;d recommend (if you&#39;re getting gluten free bread) getting a super flavorful sandwich on it. Not the turkey, but the Italian. YUM! <br><br>Their menu contains numerous amazing sandwiches, salads, and more. You can also customize your sandwiches, but I just leave it up to the experts. Usually when you walk in, someone takes your order and checks certain boxes on a piece of paper (what kind of bread, etc etc). Then you wait for your name to be called and then pay (or pay after you order). They have some salads/sides that you can sample while waiting, such as curry rice, etc. (they probably rotate these).",

"reviewcomment":"Their sandwiches, oh man. They are amazing. I&#39;ve tried all the combinations they have and no surprise, they are all good. It can run bit on the pricey side for a sandwich but man these are some good &#34;artisan&#34; / &#34;fancy&#34; sandwiches. <br><br>Their wine selection...are good from what I hear. I don&#39;t drink wine so I&#39;m not gonna sit here and say their selection is good or whatever. They sell Orangina at the store, which goes perfect with their sandwiches. They also sell bunch of small goodies (artisan chocolate, chips, and etc). <br><br>Parking can be a bit hectic. On Sundays, the lot across the store is free for an hour, I believe.",

"reviewcomment":"This is as good as it gets, for what it is. It&#39;s never going to be Joel Robuchon in Vegas, but it doesn&#39;t want to be. The space is fluorescent, loud, and the videos are playing music in Arabic. The atmosphere is spartan, but convivial.  And the waitstaff attentive and proud of their product. They should be. The product is great.<br><br>Made a first visit here on Friday to see what the hoopla and 388 yelp reviews were all about. We were four people, and ordered the feast for two, plus the lamb chops. <br><br>The salads were fragrant and homemade. The hummus smoother than Marlene Dietrich&#39;s voice. The baba ganoush mouth watering. The falafels crisp on the outside, and somehow not dry inside. Grade: A.<br><br>Then came the meats. The chicken. Maybe the best ever chicken kabob, why also were not dry.  The lamb was succulent. And it all came on a hill of rice that was impossible to make a dent in. It seemed to regenerate as we ate it.<br><br>The kicker was the complimentary baklava at the end. Better than any, ever. Not drippying goo. Just scrumptious, like the final note of Beethoven&#39;s fifth. <br><br>Have tried a number of Lebanese places in multiple cities. This is the best yet. <br><br>Sat inside, but there&#39;s outdoor seating too.<br><br>Total bill for four, with tip: $70.  That&#39;s with tea, drinks, etc.",

"reviewcomment":"this is my new favorite place and too bad its 2 hrs away. the first time we went they were still in their old tiny spot, the second time they took over the hair salon next door and grew about 10 times in size. <br><br>one great thing about L.A. like any &#34;real&#34; big city they have pretty much anything your looking for in terms of food. kashrut in LA is like kosherpalooza for my wife, we&#39;ve done burbank, pico blvd, ventura blvd and encino to get our kosher fix. so you can imagine what our choices are like in SD when we want something like Nagila&#39;s on pico blvd falafel. oh... we have falafel (greek, lebanese, iraqi, persian, turkish) but there&#39;s nothing like nagilas falafel. even the ones in NY don&#39;t compare.  <br><br>both times i&#39;ve had their shawarma in the laffa with just israeli salad and tahini and it is theee BEST chicken shawarma ive had EVER. i&#39;ve had more than my fair share of shawarma and like any great food every one can be different flavor and texture wise. some places adds way too much cumin and turmeric and that&#39;s all you taste not ta-eem. also some places you end up getting shredded pieces from the spit, ta-eem you get good bite sized chunks. <br><br>fyi - try not to overfill the lafa because it takes away from the flavors of the shawarma. israeli salad and tahini with a little dip of their green and red hot sauce and you will be in shawarma nirvana.   <br><br>their schnitzel is good but cambridge farms kitchen in burbank is better. their sides though was killer and it reminded us of a psuedo kosher place we had in SD called tiki taka grill. <br><br>for those that think its just a kosher place, DON&#39;T. you don&#39;t need to be kosher to appreciate ta-eem cause i&#39;m so-so the complete opposite of kosher, but my wife is kosher but she isn&#39;t. she won&#39;t mix meat and dairy or eat pork but she will eat shellfish and we don&#39;t have separate flatware at home. i call it NY kosher. i just wished more places like ta-eem realizes that you can have a kosher business model away from the jewish neighborhoods and do real well that can also cater to people like me, and i&#39;m sure ta-eem gets a lot of us. ultimately if its great food it doesn&#39;t matter if its kosher or halal, its just great food. i just wish SD would get on board.",

The chicharron threw me off as I was expecting the crunchy ones but here they have it smothered in a sauce.  Although it was not crunchy it had a good flavor.  The tortilla here is thicker than what you typical get.  I think since most of their tacos are more sauce based it requires a thicker tortilla to hold it.<br><br>Chorizo ~ <a href='http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/guisados-los-angeles?select=HSYA1OE5V5LFPQ3JOEQkVw#AppH9qgzKNEJmPV4ogS2Kg'>yelp.com/biz_photos/guis…</a> After having a small piece of a friends chorizo I had to order one for myself.  As stuffed as I was I really enjoyed this taco and would definitely be one that I order next time.<br><br>The one thing that would have taken my first Guisado experience up even more would have been a cold glass of michelada.  But I really enjoyed the melon aguas fresca.<br><br>Eyes ~ Oh my which 6 do I start with!<br>Nose ~ I  smell goodness!<br>Ear ~ Lots of happy people eating.<br>Mouth ~ Oh Man why did I wait so long to get here!<br>Tummy ~ So stuffed and satisfied!",

"reviewcomment":"I love this food truck! I am a huge fan of Hawaiian shaved ice and Get Shaved hits the spot and fulfills my cravings every time! They have a good selection of flavors to choose from. My favorite combo is their One Love which is melona, mango, and watermelon. Sometimes I like to substitute watermelon with strawberry or fruit punch to give it a different kind of taste. Either way it is still delicious!<br><br>The texture of the ice is amazing. Smooth and soft just like how Hawaiian ice should be. A great addition to this dessert is vanilla ice cream--I don&#39;t know what brand they use but it is really rich, creamy, and fluffy--it compliments the ice really well. You also have a choice of condensed milk or sour spray as an additional free topping. Get the condensed milk and avoid their white macadamia ice cream (it tasted horrible).<br><br>Their service is great. If you go often they remember who you are. They usually come to the Diamond Bar area on Wednesday nights; you can follow them on Twitter and find out when they are coming! Definitely a must try and have.",

"reviewcomment":"Like usual, I had a great experience at Sasabune last night. We had reservations at 7:30 and we were seated promptly. We received a complimentary sparkling peach sake in honor of Valentines Day and also their one-year anniversary which falls under the same day. They offered an omakase meal for $65 and up and a preset menu (the dishes were listed on the menu whereas for omakase you don&#39;t know what you&#39;re getting) for $50. We opted for two omakases. <br><br>This is what came out (in order): <br><br>cucumber &amp; seaweed sunomono salad, albacore sashimi, tuna sashimi, ono sashimi, toro sushi, bluefin tuna sushi, red snapper sushi, kanpachi sushi, mussels (served two different ways), japanese oyster, yellowtail sushi, salmon sushi, sweet shrimp sushi (with the fried head), large scallop sushi, stripejack sushi, uni sushi, ikura sushi, butterfish sushi, chu toro handroll, blue crab handroll, and a yuzu sorbet. <br><br>My favorites were the snapper, sweet shrimp, large scallop, stripejack and butterfish sushi. Everything was amazing though. There wasn&#39;t one dish I didn&#39;t love. After the meal was over, we were asked if we wanted to add any a la carte items but we were full after the omakase, sparkling sake, cold sake, and beer. Service was great. There seems to be good teamwork-- all the workers were attentive to us rather than just our server who took our order. We sat at a table but we will definitely sit at the bar next time so we can interact with the sushi chef. I also liked how quiet and not too packed the restaurant was even on Valentines Day. We never felt rushed, which is nice especially on Vday. I cannot wait to go back!!!!!",

"reviewcomment":"Late lunch and I stumbled upon this place with the help of yelp. At first I thought I was lost or that the place has closed down until I found the small entrance to this place. The atmosphere is laid back with drawings and paintings on the walls. The lady, I believe is the mother that helped me, was very kind and sweet. Since it was my first time she gave me my space and did her thing until I was ready to order. With the help of the reviews they received in Yelp, I fell for the turkey avocado sandwich. <br>Turkey avocado my friends, the best I&#39;ve had in a while. The cranberry, almonds, the eggs, each bite was different. Each bite made me more curious about the sandwich. It was so delicious! <br>Even when there were other customers coming in, ordering from the the daughter I believed, the mother checked up on me to see how my sandwich and drink were. <br>My drink is another story. It tasted so fresh I feel refresh every sip. It&#39;s called sparking blackberry vinegar. I just wanted to try everything! <br>This place is definitely one of the places that&#39;s a must. Perfect for lunch. Check them out!",

I thought was ok.  <br><br>Like all taco trucks, the food is generally hard to judge by from the outside.  But one thing for sure, when you see that juicy chunk of pork butt on the burner right outside, you can begin to imagine how youre going to sink your teeth into a bite that plays over and over again until this alone can bring your cravings to a satisfaction.  The dude thats carving the pork must be totally feeling it because he is doing an awesome job making sure each taco is nicely packed with evenly cut meat.  If by chance you had 3 you&#39;ll come back for 6.<br><br>There are just too many good tacos in LA.  I hope that this place will be one of the longstanding ones.",

"reviewcomment":"Discovered Gang Nam thru Yelp when I searched for Korean tofu bowl. What?!? A place not in Ktown? This I have to see. <br><br>Came here with my girlfriends for dinner. I used to live in the neighborhood and realized it&#39;s in the former Paddy Rice location. Small dining space, modern decor, with crystal chandeliers and a fridge by the cashier/takeout counter with beverage options. (FYI BYOB). <br><br>The food? It is the bomb. All of us raved as we ate. We ordered spicy pork with mushroom, kimchi and seafood tofu bowl combos but sadly they ran out of jap chae and seafood pancake at 8pm on a Thursday. The 14 banchan offering was generous and has that homemade made-with-love feel. This place trumps BCD or Beverly Soondofu. Our ordered food came piping hot, flavorful and take note as other yelpers warned, spicy means spicy here. Usually I get spicy at BCD and it&#39;s not really spicy. Here I can only handle medium and it&#39;s clearing my sinuses in the best of ways!<br><br>I told the sweet older Korean lady serving us that we&#39;ll definitely be back. That was Thursday. I&#39;m going back today (Sat) for takeout! Service is a little slow (small crew?) and they close early at 9pm/Sundays but this is a sweet local business and def worthy of patience and regular support! Go Yelpers Go!",

"reviewcomment":"Chocolate lover here and when I give this place 5 stars, you can bet it&#39;s because they got the best-tasting Belgian delights in town. Chose several pieces from their chocolate selection -- all looking fantastic and tasting absolutely fresh and delicious. The rose essence chocolate and the orange-crusted chocolate look and taste amazing. And the best part: heavenly hot chocolate. It feels like the heavens opened up and the angels are singing up there after my first sip. I am definitely coming back here.<br><br>And by the way, customer service was great and they have parking at the rear of the store. This will be my new go-to place for sweet treats in Santa Monica.  :-)",

And I so love coming here. <br><br>The waiters are bright eyed and bushy-tailed and take the time to talk to you. <br><br>Oh and the coffee is excellent - strong and distinct. The Papas Omelette is simple and healthy. It skips on all that extra oil and buttah - you just get GOOD omelette!! Go savory with the Papas Omelette, or sweet with the Belgian waffles. <br><br>Recently tried their macarons - which are good! Must try other things that Yelpers say are good, too.... <br><br>There is a cute patio area outside and you can watch all the people and their dogs trot by. Sigh makes me want a dog....",

"reviewcomment":"Healthyca is my current favorite place to get my salad fix. I work in Burbank and live in the Valley so location-wise, this place is awesome. Parking is street-only but that&#39;s not usually a problem when I go (around 6PM).<br><br>Speaking of awesome, let&#39;s talk salad. I am a prolific salad-eater (I love meat too, don&#39;t get me wrong, but I&#39;ve always loved a hearty salad) and had been looking for a place that does salad right for ages. I have to give Healthyca 5 stars on all points: volume, freshness, composition, dressing. In fact, their salads are so volume-y, if I&#39;m not starving when I start in on one, I sometimes have to save about a third of it to finish later. My favorites are the Avocado Caprese and the Chinese Chicken. I&#39;ve tried every salad except for the Ratatouille and  the Albacore, and they&#39;ve all been good except the Chilled Orient, which was just okay because the soba noodles were a little soggy (maybe because I always take it to go, they get soggy by the time I get home? I suppose I could always just cook up some soba of my own). <br><br>For the side, I always get the Quinoa salad, which is flavorful and, hey, quinoa can do no wrong, right?<br><br>The last time I got the Noho Sausage which was also tasty, and made me want to try some of their hot dishes. <br><br>I was disappointed to find that they changed their hours; they now close at 7PM instead of 9PM which makes it a little harder for me to go there with friends. But, it doesn&#39;t keep me from ordering from my office and picking up on my way home. There&#39;s not a whole lot of seating anyway so be warned, it&#39;s not a fancy sit-down kind of restaurant. But the food is excellent, and that&#39;s what counts!<br><br>Please stay in business forever!!!!!",

"reviewcomment":"I took a day off work to play around and go to lots of new (to me) places in LA.  I&#39;ve read about the Sushi Gen lunch special and have wanted to try it for a while.  <br><br>When they say you need to get here early, you really do!  We went on a Monday at  10:00 am (it opens at 11) and there were already some people in line - maybe 15 or 20?  We decided we were going to chance it so we drove the two blocks over to the LA Flower Mart and did a quick walk around for 15 minutes and then came back.  We were back by 10:30 am and the line was now long!  We waited until 11 when the restaurant opened and just missed the first seating.  We put our names in and went over to the little Asian grocery store nearby.  We bought a couple snacks and a beer which we paper-bagged while walking around  and then went back to the line about 45 minutes later.  They seated us shortly thereafter.<br><br>The $15 dollar lunch special comes with an assorted sashimi platter, rice, miso soup, some soft tofu, and some picked vegetable.  The sashimi isn&#39;t the most beautiful cuts you&#39;ve ever seen, but it still tastes great and I was stuffed!  Can&#39;t wait for my next day when I play hookie from work!<br><br>Insider tip: The Japanese ladies waiting in line in front of us told us that the jewelry store that is right next door has good prices and they often shop there while waiting in line.  This time was no exception - one of them bought a beautiful pearl pendent on a gold chain while we were waiting!",

"reviewcomment":"AMAZING is the word that comes to mind when reflecting back on my dining experience at Tar &amp; Roses.  From the moment I entered the front door we were greeted and seated immediately.  Our server came by within a minute, poured water into a recycled wine bottle turned into a drinking glass (such a cool concept).  I would really love a set at home.<br><br>We had a 6pm reservation on a Wed and the place was packed!!!  This isn&#39;t a huge restaurant but the vibe was excellent. The noise level was just right...not too loud but I felt a very positive energy most likely brought on by the fact that the patrons were very pleased with the food, service and overall experience. <br><br>They don&#39;t have a full bar but their beer and wine selection was very nice. I ordered their house red - t&amp;r redfords red (syrah, grenache from santa barbara). I&#39;m normally a Cab drinker but since it was on the pricier side, i decided to opt with their house red. It was a phenomenal glass of wine and I highly recommend anyone who enjoys an excellent glass of wine as you won&#39;t be disappointed.  <br><br>Now onto the highlight of our evening...the food. Everything was spectacular!<br><br>---oxtail dumpling / san bai su / chili / green onion<br>---braised lamb belly / minted apple chutney<br>---wood roasted brussels sprouts / pancetta / chestnuts / mustard<br>---shellfish pot / scallops / clams / mussels / shrimp / maitake / curry<br>---squid Ink Fettuccine / Octopus / Tomato <br><br>Oxtail dumpling was excellent. A must try!  Braised Lamb Belly was on the fattier side which isn&#39;t to my liking but the meat portion was extremely tender and the flavor was perfect. The Brussels Sprouts with the pancetta was another great dish. Shellfish Pot and the Squid Ink Fettuccine were to die for. Absofreakinglutely marvelous!  I don&#39;t want to go into too much details about the dishes. I suggest that you go and experience it for yourself, I guarantee you will not be disappointed. <br><br>Never did I see my water glass empty, our server was always around, I felt like I had my own private person but he was not at all intrusive. The food runners were friendly, the empty dishes were taken away quickly, they hire top notch people at this top notch establishment. <br><br>Life is too short to miss out on something so great!<br><br>I must also send a shout out to my AMAZING friends John L and Ama L who made this all happen. I am blessed to call them my foodies-in-crime.  They are westside foodies who have helped to expand my knowledge outside of LA East.  A million thanks!",

Nice, authentic Japanese dish choices, like clover and gingko soup, and a few fishes I&#39;m not brave enough to try yet.<br><br>The prices are pretty typical of most sushi joints, but the kicker is, when you order - for instance - a spicy tuna roll, you get the rice and veg in the roll, and the top is piled with the spicy tuna.  So, you&#39;re actually getting what seems to be a little more quantity of food than you do with other rolls.  My husband and I can gorge ourselves on sushi and sashimi, and waddle out for about $60 (no booze).  <br><br>The albacore is always flawless. The yellowtail has never been less than perfect.<br><br>You should make a reservation. They open at 5pm. Shortly after, any night of the week, they&#39;re mobbed with customers.  Park out on Saticoy and walk to the strip center, unless you want to make yourself crazy trying to get a spot.",

You can choose from 5 of their doughs, I choose flax whole grain, then you choose your sauce or sauces, veggies, roasted veggies and last but not least your meats. You can choose however many kinds of meats you want and then they take your name and put your personalized pizza in the oven. Takes about 6 minutes to get it and it tastes great! No matter how you personalize it, it comes out to about 8 bucks, pretty cheap if you ask me. Give this place a try and you won&#39;t be dissapointed!",

The rib eye was awesome as it was a medium sized thick slab of meat.  <br><br>one thing I really like about this place is the service.<br>the friendly hostess was able to sit us in a reasonable time, even though we had a page of people waiting before us. the waiters are all super friendly and nice. when we asked for more banchans/waters/napkings/etc, they actually provided us with a genuine smile. You dont&#39; really get that kind of service in ktown kbbq restaurants.<br><br>you can street park, but the valet parking is only $2.<br><br>ooh also, they have  WOOD FIRE BBQ PIT, which makes this place eve more awesome!",

Everything here is fantastic and can be ordered to go either by phone or online. They take reservations which is definitely needed if you have more than 2 people. <br><br>I absolutely love the vegan soups of the day and from October to December, Rose puts a delicious comforting pumpkin soup into rotation. The Chevre goat cheese sandwich is my favorite but the Brie/Spinach one is great as well as it is heated into some yummy melty toasted goodness.<br><br>Can&#39;t wait to start on their breakfast menu next!",

I was overwhelmed by their menu...my eyes couldn&#39;t keep up with my brain &amp; stomach at the same time. I just asked the guy behind the register &#34;What do you recommend?&#34; He suggested to get a sampler plate, it consist of three mini tostadas. He asked &#34;which three of the fifteen would you like to try?&#34; We went with Mariquita, Mango and the Zombie. <br>Trippy names but great flavors.<br><br>The Mariquita tostada  is shrimp ceviche topped off with the Chef&#39;s peanut/walnut sauce.<br> Zombie tostada is fish ceviche with &#34;Zombie sauce.&#34; <br>The mango tostada is shrimp ceviche, mango, carrot sauce and habanero.<br><br>The empanadas de camaron were large and very tasty especially with that green sauce.<br>The Vida Loca tacos were interesting...fried tacos stuffed with potato and shrimp with a side of seafood consome.<br><br>Anywhere we go and where they serve camarones aguachiles...I have to try them. I was impressed with them freshness and flavor of the shrimps in the green sauce.<br><br>If you know me...I rarely order dessert...But today we had to. They suggested the Capirotada...not overly sweetened... It was just right.<br><br>I must comeback and try the strawberry &amp; honey shrimp ceviche.",

They have a HUGE banner that states the fact that they have a high yelp rating, and once you walk in, you&#39;re greeted right away. I asked for a takeout menu and was promptly told the most popular dishes and asked what I was in the mood for. I got the chicken lovers combo, and sat and waited while it was prepared. The waitress asked if I wanted a beverage while waiting, which was considerate. I expected just a tap water, but lo and behold, she brings a fancy cold glass jug of water with a fancy goblet type of glass as I wait. Who does that? Lusy&#39;s Cafe/Grill does! lol. <br><br>As for my food itself, I was not disappointed. The chicken shish was perfectly prepared, it was moist, succulent and very well seasoned, and the perfect temperature. It also had another sort of chicken kubideh and that was also delicious. The meal came with rice, a salad, hummus and pickled turnips. I searched EVERY yelp review for this place, and nobody mentioned the pickled turnips, which were a lovely deep pink/or light red hue. They were SO GOOD! Who ever even heard of such a thing? Not I! I didn&#39;t even know what kind of vegetable it was, except for the fact that it was some sort of root veggie and pickled. Now I know I like them!  The hummus was nicely seasoned, too, with some (I think) paprika on top. <br><br>Lusy&#39;s is a great little mom and pop shop. I admire the owner for starting a restaurant and that this is clearly a labor of love for her. She has earned this hard-won reputation, and I wish her the best. One suggestion? I wish they had dolmas!",

The Papas Omelette is simple and healthy. It skips on all that extra oil and buttah - you just get GOOD omelette!! Go savory with the Papas Omelette, or sweet with the Belgian waffles. <br><br>Recently tried their macarons - which are good! Must try other things that Yelpers say are good, too.... <br><br>There is a cute patio area outside and you can watch all the people and their dogs trot by. Sigh makes me want a dog....",

"reviewcomment":"What can I say? I love this place! JC and his cousin are awesome. Since this is a small place, I&#39;ve never had to wait any length of time for my food. And that counts a lot when u only have a set time for lunch at work.. We all know each other by name now after the few times I have visited- it feels like home. Where else can I go for lunch by myself and actually have an on-going conversation with the owner and chef? No where else but JC&#39;s.. <br><br>I don&#39;t leave many reviews for any businesses- but when they are deserved, I have to take the time to show my appreciation. Well, actually, my big belly&#39;s appreciation. :) <br><br>I ordered the pulled pork sandwich with fries today- not my first time trying it, and definitely not going to be the last. Its served on a hamburger bun and loaded with a great portion of awesome and tender pulled pork tossed in BBQ.. I say tossed cuz I was watching JC cook my meal and sure enough, he tossed that juicy pork all up in that BBQ sauce. MMMM! lol. I&#39;ve been to other places where their pulled pork sandwich is their specialty and is known to be &#34;the best around&#34; and these other restaurants never live up to that claim. But JC certainly knows what he is doing- the pork is juicy and soft and the sauce is damn tasty.. It&#39;s NOT one of those pulled pork sandwiches that fall apart and get all over the place cuz whoever made it drenched it in sauce to cover up poor pork quality- JC&#39;s pulled pork is perfectly sauced and perfectly proportioned in my book. <br><br>Next to this delicious sandwich is a HEAP of fries. I&#39;m a big fan of fries. And these fries DON&#39;T disappoint at all. The seasoning JC uses is  like a Lawry&#39;s seasoning salt, but wayyyyy better! <br><br>If I have the time at work tomorrow, I&#39;ll be stopping in again to try one of their Mexican dishes.. I hear their Asada is fantastic.<br><br>Final thought: <br>I can taste the LOVE in every single bite- JC and the crew know what&#39;s up when it comes to preparing awesome meals!",

The gentlemen which I assumed was the manger was super accommodating and asked us if we had been to Cilantro before and let us know how everything works. <br><br>We ended up getting the Asada fries which were pretty delicious. We also ordered some chicken and asada tacos. Very tasty meats.  What I love is that I am able to add whatever I want to my tacos. Most Mexican fast food joints always add the same thing to their tacos....onion, salsa &amp; cilantro. I don&#39;t eat two of these three condiments. The homemade pesto&#39;s were impressive...very tasty. Most of the condiments offered were impressive.<br><br>I also tried the sweetened lime and agua fresca drinks. Unfortunately, the agua fresca was too watered down. I should have taken a sip while I was still there. I&#39;m sure it was delicious when it was freshly made but late in the afternoon the ice pretty much watered it down. Aside from this, everything was very yummy and we will definitely be back.",

Awesome music, art vibe - the kind of spot you want to hang out at.<br><br>The Hair: never before have I been able to say something emotional and abstract (&#34;I want to look like a sexy/creative woman, but still management worthy) and get a perfect haircut. At this point I tell Todd the mood I happen to be in and magically (in almost no time) he&#39;s given me the perfect haircut. Every Single Time! I never get &#34;upsold&#34; product and the prices are insanely low for the quality and talent. <br><br>They&#39;re super accommodating about getting you in (I&#39;m always last minute before events).

There is an amazing view of LA as far as the eye can see. The roof was a bit open while we began, so it was al fresco which I love as a New Yorker in LA in February. There was live jazzy music. <br>The Service, cocktails and food was amazing and reasonably priced. <br>No cell phone calls, texts, pictures or anything are allowed.  Please keep that in mind so as to not embarrass yourself! <br>PHOTOBOOTH is super fun.",

Dino&#39;s Famous Chicken, which is the ultimate flavored grilled chicken that you will ever have.  The chicken comes to you in this bright orange color.  It&#39;s been marinating for who knows how long to get that flavor and color soaked into the meat.  But once you get it, you will want more.  We&#39;ve had it before with just the chicken with all the sauce and spices on top.  I would recommend getting it that way versus getting it over fries.  We got it over fries before and the fries soak up all the juices which sounds good when you think about it but it wasn&#39;t that good in my opinion.  It&#39;s better ripping up that juicy sweet chicken meat and dipping it into the juices.  So YUMMY! <br><br>Another dish there that will probably clog all your arteries but is worth trying is their DUI Fries.  It&#39;s Pastrami and Carne Asade Chili Cheese Fries.  It&#39;s a heart attack waiting to happen but it&#39;s so just GOOD!  It comes in a huge serving and we had to bring home extras sharing between three people!  But you know what, it&#39;s even better the next day warmed up in your microwave.  <br><br>They also have orange bang which is always delicious!  <br><br>The place itself is definitely a hole in the wall.  Dirty floors and tables.  Don&#39;t expect it to be clean but hey, if you want good food for cheap, you have to sacrifice some luxuries.  Parking can be bad too but it&#39;s such a good place for some cheap good food and I can see why it would be packed especially at night.  It&#39;s good drunk food.",

"reviewcomment":"Hmmm today I want some delicious tacos so I turn to yelp to help me locate a spot on my way to the outlets. Low and behold this spot pops up and I began reading and looking at the photos. <br><br>As soon as I saw the homemade tortillas I was sold! Oh my God!! This place has been around for years and I just now discover it?? I am an ashamed Angelina for sure!! <br><br>Two tacos de asada was perfect since they are fairly large. The tortillas were fluffy and thick, asada was tasty and the toppings were amazing! Pickled cactus and guacamole. Hello sweet thang!<br><br>It&#39;s a little store and they serve hot foods. Hoy meats by the pound. There is no place to sit, however there is a short counter right outside so you either eat standing up, in your car or go to the park :) <br><br>This is my favorite taco spot above all others! I love yelp!!",

We ordered the Super Ninja Roll, Rainbow Roll, Yellowtail, Salmon, and Albacore sashimi. Everything was good.<br><br>The place could be fixed up a bit, but by comparison to the neighborhood, up to par. <br><br>The only downside is that the service is a tad slow, but I&#39;m not downgrading my stars because the service is great and the people are friendly.<br><br>WARNING: If you don&#39;t like wasabi, ask for NO WASABI on your sashimi.

Every fish I tried melted in my mouth like butter.   It&#39;s Omakase Style, for those of you that don&#39;t know, you walk in and just tell the Chef what you don&#39;t like so he doesn&#39;t use that specific thing while creating the sushi pieces his way and surprises you with his genius creations.   They will not do Specialty rolls or California Rolls here, this place is the real deal.   This is definitely one of my new favorite Sushi places.  Yay!   <br><br>It is in a strip mall and it is really small inside but the service is excellent and  the fish is as fresh as it is going to get. I love that he uses very little rice when making that beautiful piece of fish sit on top- you have to wonder if there&#39;s rice under it.  Freshly made Wasabi too- which I barely used there was no need.   He did a smoked Salmon and regular Salmon side by side with this thin (tape) looking piece on top that had a tab bit of sweet flavor to it...Geez it was phenomenal.  My taste buds was gripping that thing in the most delightful way. <br><br> We got 4 plates each with two pieces on each plate for $100.  For amazing sushi so worth it.   If you love real sushi you will love and appreciate this place. This place isn&#39;t for those that love those big specialty rolls covered in mayo sauce.",

You can barely eat dinner at home for under $10. <br><br>I really didn&#39;t expect to like this place much, because I thought ti was gonna be another weird taco place.  But the food  is interesting, tasty, satisfying and affordable.",

His piano skills were off the hook. His arpeggios sounded so clean, and in terms of his technicality, it was just flawless. Do I really need to mention anything about his singing? Go listen to his songs on YouTube. <br><br>This venue is very small, but it makes the experience that much more intimate and is perfect for singers/songwriters. A couple seats located near the front of the stage. They have a full bar with reasonably priced drinks. The bartender was super nice as well.

So when I saw the word Detox I had to check it out. <br>   Going in, the employee behind the counter was very helpful and friendly. He explained all the juices and gave enough samples to allow me to know which juice I wanted to buy. I bought the detox elixir, sport 50/50 and the alkalizer tonic. <br>    I LOVE all of them. It all depends on preference and your palate when it comes down to the juices. I love how they&#39;re already juices and guaranteed to be fresh. I mean I don&#39;t have time to be waiting 30mins for juice. I will totally come here if I start a 3 day cleanse. Hopefully it can supplement a blueprint cleanse.

"reviewcomment":"*2 Michelin Stars*<br><br>So, I decided to stop being lazy after all these years of being an active &#39;Yelper&#39;. Couldn&#39;t think of a better place to start writing reviews than my first 2 Michelin Star experience at Melisse. DineLA played a key part since their prix-fixe was $85! Went with my cousin on their last day of the event. <br><br>First thing you recognize, well for me at least, was the dated sign of the &#34;No cell phone&#34; policy. That of course would be ignored by a lot of the diners that night. Other than the standout sign, you&#39;re greeted very warmly by the hostess. They have a FREE coat check which is nice. The place was smaller than I imagined, but that&#39;s not necessarily a bad thing. Fancy and welcoming. Didn&#39;t feel stuffy at all, and the music choices weren&#39;t sleepy like if you know what I mean.<br><br>We got lucky with a booth against the wall since I knew I was going to be in stealth mode and take pictures. Didn&#39;t want to be all out in the open, even though I saw it happen a lot throughout the night. Now, onto the food:<br><br>Menu consisted of a 5 course tasting with the optional supplement of their famed, Black Truffle Risotto for $55.<br><br>Amuse Bouche: <br>Grapes stuffed with goat cheese and finished off with a pistachio crust. Very nice on the palate to start the experience.<br><br>Half bottle of wine:<br>We were recommended a 2009 Domaine Tempier Bandol by the sommelier. It was fantastic. Went with everything we had that night. Pricey at $75 for half a bottle, but it was worth it.<br><br>Bread basket:<br>Now, I can&#39;t remember all the breads, but they had about 4 different choices I believe. They all were great. I&#39;m a huge carb loading, bread guy. The butter that they give us is probably one of the best I&#39;ve ever tasted! We must&#39;ve asked for at least 3 more. (NO shame)<br><br>1st course: The pomegranate cowboy oyster was amazing. Large shell that held (2) oysters in it. The purple foam was fresh, very clean, and light. Very picturesque! <br><br>2nd course: <br>Wagyu beef tartare w puffed rice. I enjoyed it. Then again, I enjoy anything that&#39;s tartare. You add Wagyu beef to the front of that, I&#39;m sold. The puffed rice was a first, but it went well. I could have done without it too though.<br><br>3rd course: <br>Chatham bay Cod &amp; the supplement of the Black truffle risotto. Cod was cooked perfectly. Great texture that paired well with the cauliflower, mushrooms, &amp; hazelnuts. However, onto the star of the night. Two waiters came over with one of them carrying a big brown box. He then opened the box in front of us, inviting me to smell inside. In the box, I saw 3 black jewels of truffles. Smelled fabulous! The other waiter definitely told us that he was about to MAKE IT RAIN in here. He wasn&#39;t lying. The risotto on the table was filled with an ENTIRE shaved black truffle. It was on the verge of a bit too much I&#39;d say, but it was still amazing. <br><br>4th course:<br>Tea smoked grilled beef ribs &amp; Quail. Both again were awesome. The beef ribs definitely is the better choice imo. Whatever that &#39;secret&#39; bbq sauce they use, IT WORKS! Both entrees were portioned fairly. Just enough to satiate yourself before dessert.<br><br>5th course: Chocolate, peanut butter, coffee. Chocolate was rich! I&#39;m not a big dessert fan. Let&#39;s just add that little tidbit. The panna cotta was one of the better one&#39;s I&#39;ve had though. Very tasty and light. Coffee ice cream was great too! <br><br>Parking:<br>Got lucky w street parking! If you&#39;re not so lucky, I believe their valet is $8.<br><br>Overall:<br>I&#39;d definitely visit Melisse again. It&#39;s one of the most raved about restaurants here in LA and they deserve all the praise they&#39;ve received. I had no complaints with the service, food, or atmosphere. An amazing night with the cousin that probably lasted a bit more than 2 hrs!<br><br>1st ever review, COMPLETE!",

"reviewcomment":"Staying two blocks away for a business trip, so wandered in my first night in Beverly Hills for dinner. Was lucky to get a seat at the bar counter. It was a Monday night, and it was packed. Good sign.<br><br>I ordered a Negroni while deciding what to eat. Note to bartender, a proper Negroni is stirred, no shaken. But not the end of the world.<br><br>I ordered the chicken sandwich and the fries. The fries were perfectly cooked, and came with both ketchup and a spicy mayo for dipping. And I liked that they brought them out quickly without waiting for the sandwich to be done. The chicken sandwich was very good, definitely among the better chicken sandwiches I&#39;ve had. But in the ranking of exciting things to eat, I have to admit chicken sandwiches are not high on my personal list. So while tasty, I couldn&#39;t help but stare and be jealous of the great looking hamburger served to the guy down the counter. I had to come back!<br><br>So went back the next day for lunch, ordered the kale salad to start, and the hamburger. The kale salad was perfectly prepared. Extremely tasty. The hamburger, I must admit, was among the best I&#39;ve had in a long, long time. Something about all the elements really working together to create an exceptional sandwich - the meat, the cole slaw, just the right amount of the secret sauce, mayo, pickle. Delicious.",

My son had the Saffron Chicken plate w/ Cesar salad and basmati rice... the chicken was moist and full of flavor- delicious. My girl- Pear and Cranberry salad... A mountain of greens, candied walnuts, capers, cucumbers, tomatoes, goat cheese, cranberries, and pears... She says it was amazing.

"reviewcomment":"My roommate and I came here to &#34;celebrate&#34; her breakup. Really we came to get out of the house and cheer her up a bit, but Doc made sure to turn it into a celebration. He introduced her to Fireball and chatted with us before going to make our lamb chops. <br><br>Speaking of lamb chops, my mouth and mind cannot handle the memory of its goodness. It is 8:53am and I am ready to eat it again. And again. And again. <br><br>We also had the shrimp and grits, and chicken and waffle sliders. Both were delicious, but I have decided I cannot live without the former. It was perfection. <br><br>All the dishes we got were $16. I think that&#39;s totally reasonable considering  how happy me, my mouth, and my stomach were upon departure. I also strongly believe one should eat local, so I&#39;m a huge fan. <br><br>Great staff. Doc is the real deal. The fact that he does some of the cooking makes me like the place even more.

"reviewcomment":"Seafood from a taco truck are you crazy!!! Yeah thats what I said... turns out its actually very very very good!<br><br>When I think of having seafood the last thing that comes to mind is having seafood from a lunch truck- UNTIL now.  Rolling up to 4th and Rose isn&#39;t much of a view and the location isn&#39;t on a main stretch of Venice beach but it adds to the mystique of it all.  The few times Ive been here its been pretty busy but the line and wait are quick, people are friendly, and food is definitely good eats!<br><br>My all time favorite thing to order here is the tostada de ceviche- finely minced fish, tomato, cilantro and onion on a crispy tostada, with a slice of freshly sliced avocado. Its fresh, its light, and seasoned perfectly!  Its just a great snack especially on a warm day.  <br><br>The tacos here are pretty good as well.  The tacos de asada is pretty standard. The meat is nicely cooked, juicy and seasoned well. The tacos de chicharron are really good.  Nice and fried, seasoned and delicious.  Tacos are served with pinto beans but you can opt out.  The salsa isn&#39;t very spicy and does need a little salt but still pretty good compared to other salsa I&#39;ve had.  <br><br>Overall, the snacks here are simple but oh so good.  Try it then become a regular like me!",

"reviewcomment":"What isn&#39;t there to love? A highly understated Armenian bakery on Glenoaks - though I&#39;d say most things are understated in the Armenian community with a few exceptions.<br><br>First of all, and probably most importantly, everything is fresh. Most things you order will be made, baked, assembled when you say so. This is really, really nice. With a few items that sit around on the front counter, ready to go if you&#39;re in a rush, it&#39;s just nice to have everything come out of the oven fresh and crispy when you want it.<br><br>We had a pile of freshly baked lahmajun, khachapouri, and a falafel wrap. My favorite? Probably the lahmajun. They definitely have their own mix of spices going on, like everyone does. The bread was very thin, crispy, and topped with well-seasoned meat. We tried both the regular and spicy versions. Both great. Loved how thin it was.<br><br>The khachapouri was also freshly baked and ready to pick apart. We wanted it a little crispier than usual and the eggs less runny - though next time we&#39;re keeping it runny. They use their own blend of cheese, butter, and spices. It&#39;s great. They have an in-house soujouk which we opted for.<br><br>Finally, the falafel. Again, like everywhere ever, they have their own mix. It&#39;s very &#34;pure.&#34; A simple mix without much messing around. Lots of garlic. Nice and crispy, wrapped in fresh lavash they bake there (of course). Simple wrap and reasonably priced. I tend to like a more Arabic-style falafel with lots of greens inside, but that doesn&#39;t take away from Sipan&#39;s.<br><br>With the two funny and knowledgeable guys running the counter up front - it&#39;s a really great place to be. I&#39;d definitely be back again. We felt taken care of and at home having some great Armenian food.",

You&#39;ll need to make a reservation in advance--maybe a couple of weeks--but trust me, it&#39;s worth it.<br><br>The occasion was my birthday and yes, I felt special. We were sat immediately and our waiter (all of them had thick Italian accents) greeted us and brought bread to our table. It was flat, crispy and salted deliciously, served with a Fergalo pasta (chopped tomatoes, cucumber, olive oil and tiny bits of pasta). It was good enough to be the entire meal.<br><br>We ordered a couple of glasses of wine, then the sauteed scallops with mushrooms and balsamic. They were amazing. Dense, slightly sweet and flavored to perfection, we knew then that we&#39;d found greatness! As impressed as we were at this point, we weren&#39;t expecting to be as blown away as we would soon be...<br><br>For dinner, we ordered the homemade Black Truffle Spaghetti with sausage and Lasagna Verde. The lasagna was baked perfectly with crispy edges and a cheesy layered center. It was topped with thin slices of baked spinach. The Spaghetti was hands down the best Italian dish I&#39;ve ever had. The flavors were intense and wonderful. The pasta had the perfect balance of firmness and flavor and our waiter shaved large slices of black truffles on top at our table. Every scrumptious bit exploded with flavor and reminded me of how good life can be!<br><br>I highly recommend Angelini Osteria! But when you go, try not to wolf it all down too fast. This meal is best enjoyed with patience to savor every delectable bite. Go get it!",

I can not even begin to describe.

He said this was one of the best he&#39;s had. Their meats are sooo juicy, tender and full of flavor. <br><br>We shared family style 2 entrees, beef soltani kabob and the chicken soltani kabob. These are good if you want  variety since each soltani comes with 2 different skewers. Also shared between 3, the hummus, yogurt with moussier and shirazi (this is not printed on the menu). <br><br>2 entrees 3 sides perfect for 3 people with leftovers or feeds 4 people comfortably. <br><br>I LOVE the service here as well. The waiters are very sweet and very accommodating.You never have to ask for things twice and they know what you want before you utter the words out of your mouth!",

Both sandwiches are very flavorful and it just depends on my mood which one I get since the pork belly is a fattier meat. <br><br>An equally awesome reason I come here is for the curried couscous. I&#39;ve never had anything like it before and I haven&#39;t had anything like it since. Try as I may, I&#39;ve never found a recipe able to replicate it so alas, I must come back to Mendocino Farms to get my fix. It&#39;s packed with so much flavor and I love those chunks of cauliflower in there too. <br><br>Their other sides are also pretty awesome and the great thing is they let you try samples of all of them for free! Beware, one small sample will most likely not be enough to satisfy you and you&#39;ll end up buying 2 or 3 sides. <br><br>Friendly and fast service, and the people working there always seem so happy.

The two-person staff manning the station at the Crossfit/Yoga session for Yelp&#39;s Passport to Glendale was pretty professional; they were friendly, efficient and open to conversation which was nice. And if that wasn&#39;t good enough, their burger was bombnom. <br><br>I didn&#39;t know what it was at first so I cheated and looked it up online but I&#39;m pretty sure they served their Signature Burger, which consists of grass- fed dry- aged beef, homemade garlic cilantro aioli, sweet onion marmalade, sharp cheddar, and wild baby arugula, served on a Brioche bun. It was yummy in my tummy! Meaty, juicy patty sandwiched between soft sweet bread buns and complimented well with melted cheese, bitter greens and sweet sweet onions. Goodness, I just drooled. <br><br>Can&#39;t wait to hopefully run into them again sometime in the future! :)",

I was extremely full off this one plate. I got the loko modo, komodo 2.0, mp3, and the blazin shrimp. I fell in love with the loko modo and komodo 2.0! Both had a unique and asian fusion spin on the tacos. They were also a little spicy, which is great since I love a hint of spice in my food. The presentation is also very cute and colorful. I can&#39;t wait to try the other tacos. <br><br>You also have to order the parmesan fries. Delicious.<br><br>Lastly, don&#39;t forget the lychee lemonade.

"reviewcomment":"Thank god you have to make weekend reservations months in advance. Otherwise I would be so fat. <br><br>I came here as a party of 4. We ordered 3 appetizers, a pizza, 4 pastas, and dessert. Our waiter told us we  couldn&#39;t do it. But we did it. I didn&#39;t care I was uncomfortably full for the next two days because this place is delicious. Everything is good but if I had to rank my meal in order of most to less favorite it would go like this<br><br>Squid ink pasta: so delicious. SO delicious<br>Uni pasta: I always order this when we come here and it never disappoints<br>Farro salad: we got this because the waiter recommended it and had no expectations of it. Everyone at the table loved this. <br>Pizza: the crust is crispy, the sausage is spicy. Its just an all around good pizza<br>Octopus carpaccio: good but not as wow as everything else<br><br>We also had two bottles of wine and the bill came out to ~100/person which was really a great deal considering half that was wine.",

"reviewcomment":"Like usual, I had a great experience at Sasabune last night. We had reservations at 7:30 and we were seated promptly. We received a complimentary sparkling peach sake in honor of Valentines Day and also their one-year anniversary which falls under the same day. They offered an omakase meal for $65 and up and a preset menu (the dishes were listed on the menu whereas for omakase you don&#39;t know what you&#39;re getting) for $50. We opted for two omakases. <br><br>This is what came out (in order): <br><br>cucumber &amp; seaweed sunomono salad, albacore sashimi, tuna sashimi, ono sashimi, toro sushi, bluefin tuna sushi, red snapper sushi, kanpachi sushi, mussels (served two different ways), japanese oyster, yellowtail sushi, salmon sushi, sweet shrimp sushi (with the fried head), large scallop sushi, stripejack sushi, uni sushi, ikura sushi, butterfish sushi, chu toro handroll, blue crab handroll, and a yuzu sorbet. <br><br>My favorites were the snapper, sweet shrimp, large scallop, stripejack and butterfish sushi. Everything was amazing though. There wasn&#39;t one dish I didn&#39;t love. After the meal was over, we were asked if we wanted to add any a la carte items but we were full after the omakase, sparkling sake, cold sake, and beer. Service was great. There seems to be good teamwork-- all the workers were attentive to us rather than just our server who took our order. We sat at a table but we will definitely sit at the bar next time so we can interact with the sushi chef. I also liked how quiet and not too packed the restaurant was even on Valentines Day. We never felt rushed, which is nice especially on Vday. I cannot wait to go back!!!!!",

The atmosphere is laid back with drawings and paintings on the walls. The lady, I believe is the mother that helped me, was very kind and sweet. Since it was my first time she gave me my space and did her thing until I was ready to order. With the help of the reviews they received in Yelp, I fell for the turkey avocado sandwich. <br>Turkey avocado my friends, the best I&#39;ve had in a while. The cranberry, almonds, the eggs, each bite was different. Each bite made me more curious about the sandwich. It was so delicious! <br>Even when there were other customers coming in, ordering from the the daughter I believed, the mother checked up on me to see how my sandwich and drink were. <br>My drink is another story. It tasted so fresh I feel refresh every sip. It&#39;s called sparking blackberry vinegar. I just wanted to try everything! <br>This place is definitely one of the places that&#39;s a must.

"reviewcomment":"India&#39;s Restaurant may not be 5 star in any one specific category alone, but all put together, it deserves full marks in my book.<br><br>From the street, India&#39;s Restaurant does not seem much to look at, but once inside I was pleased to find a clean, spacious, and comfortably appointed restaurant that belied the exterior.  There is lot parking and if you&#39;re lucky, you&#39;ll nab one of the spots right away like I did.  On weekend nights, I can see parking becoming a bit of a premium.<br><br>The staff here is so friendly and helpful.  They may not be flashy or super talkative, but they speak through their kind and thoughtful service.  Our water glasses were refilled and we were served complimentary dessert.  Kudos to the last item in particular especially when I used the Yelp $20 for $10 deal (cannot be applied for buffet) to pay down my meal.  They could have easily protected their margins, but instead decided to treat their patrons the same regardless. <br><br>I was quite pleased with the food as well.  I can think of just a handful of places where I&#39;ve had better Indian food, but India&#39;s Restaurant is definitely one of the better Indian restaurants I&#39;ve tried in LA.  The food isn&#39;t flashy, but authentic and tasty.  The lamb vindaloo was excellent - lamb was tender and the sauce was delicious, although if you like things spicy, opt for the Spicy level as the Medium level felt tame to me.  The Dahl Makhnee was also excellent - lentils were perfectly cooked and awesome with the next dish we ordered.  The vegetable biryani is no joke.  I went with our server&#39;s recommendation to get the vegetable version and it did not disappoint.  A must get if you&#39;re ordering any curry.  The garlic naan is also quite good and should be ordered to accompany any meal here.<br><br>Without the deal, our dinner came out to $36 and change.  And we were stuffed and walked out with leftovers.  With the Yelp deal, it came out to $16 (so $26 total when you account for the $10 deal I paid for).  That&#39;s a steal for what we ate.  There&#39;s a 15% off discount offer too if you check in online.  When you take really good food, great service, and price it very reasonably, you deserve 5 stars in my book.  I will definitely be hitting up India&#39;s Restaurant again.  It looks like I finally found my go-to-Indian restaurant in LA.",

"reviewcomment":"Everything about this place is superb (ok, maybe not the sketchy location)! I was greeted with a vey warm welcome by the owner. I started off with some guacamole as an appetizer and was not disappointed. The guac was freshly made upon ordering. Coming from someone who lives in Dallas, this blew any &#34;Tex-Mex&#34; guacamole, that I&#39;ve had in Texas, out of the water.  For my entrée, I ordered the three crunchy tacos and, again, was not let down. The tacos weren&#39;t bland unlike most Tacos I&#39;ve ordered from &#34;authentic&#34; Mexican restaurants. The tacos packed a lot of flavor, but we&#39;re very messy (which in my opinion is better). It was served with a generous serving of rice and beans. <br><br>What really sold me on this place, was the customer service. I&#39;m on a business trip, so I ventured out to this place alone. I felt like I was with a close family friend the whole time I was eating, because the owner was so friendly and generous. As I waited for my food (which was not long), the owner initiated a friendly conversation that carried on throughout my visit. She even went as far as telling me to let her know if I didn&#39;t like something on my plate to let her know and she&#39;d whip something else up free of charge. <br><br>The only downfall to this place was the sketchy location. The facility itself was not bad at all, it just seemed to be in a rough part of town. I hope to go back more throughout my project at LAX and I highly recommend anyone else in the area do the same if you want to try good authentic Mexican food and support a local business!",

He explained every little detail to us and we made a very good choice thanks to him. I&#39;m not to much if a humus fan but my boyfriend is and he loved it. The portion where big and healthy. <br>We learned from Charlie that you have to ask for your bill coz Lebanese don&#39;t bring the bill until you ask for it. If you bring it without asking it make a Lebanese feel like you get kicked or rushed out.  Nice way of looking at it that way. <br>Thank you Charlie. Till the next time",

"reviewcomment":"this is my new favorite place and too bad its 2 hrs away. the first time we went they were still in their old tiny spot, the second time they took over the hair salon next door and grew about 10 times in size. <br><br>one great thing about L.A. like any &#34;real&#34; big city they have pretty much anything your looking for in terms of food. kashrut in LA is like kosherpalooza for my wife, we&#39;ve done burbank, pico blvd, ventura blvd and encino to get our kosher fix. so you can imagine what our choices are like in SD when we want something like Nagila&#39;s on pico blvd falafel. oh... we have falafel (greek, lebanese, iraqi, persian, turkish) but there&#39;s nothing like nagilas falafel. even the ones in NY don&#39;t compare.  <br><br>both times i&#39;ve had their shawarma in the laffa with just israeli salad and tahini and it is theee BEST chicken shawarma ive had EVER. i&#39;ve had more than my fair share of shawarma and like any great food every one can be different flavor and texture wise. some places adds way too much cumin and turmeric and that&#39;s all you taste not ta-eem. also some places you end up getting shredded pieces from the spit, ta-eem you get good bite sized chunks. <br><br>fyi - try not to overfill the lafa because it takes away from the flavors of the shawarma. israeli salad and tahini with a little dip of their green and red hot sauce and you will be in shawarma nirvana.   <br><br>their schnitzel is good but cambridge farms kitchen in burbank is better. their sides though was killer and it reminded us of a psuedo kosher place we had in SD called tiki taka grill. <br><br>for those that think its just a kosher place, DON&#39;T. you don&#39;t need to be kosher to appreciate ta-eem cause i&#39;m so-so the complete opposite of kosher, but my wife is kosher but she isn&#39;t. she won&#39;t mix meat and dairy or eat pork but she will eat shellfish and we don&#39;t have separate flatware at home. i call it NY kosher. i just wished more places like ta-eem realizes that you can have a kosher business model away from the jewish neighborhoods and do real well that can also cater to people like me, and i&#39;m sure ta-eem gets a lot of us. ultimately if its great food it doesn&#39;t matter if its kosher or halal, its just great food. i just wish SD would get on board.",

As I picked the mess up off the ground and sadly sat on the curb to attempt to eat it anyway (sadness), the guy actually came out of the truck looking for me and said &#34;the girl wants you.&#34;  I went over to the truck and she was making me 3 new tacos. Gratis.<br><br>Despite being stared at by them for being caught in the act of eating ground tacos I instantaneously became forever loyal to this truck.  And I got 6 tacos for the price of 3, yay!!!!",

"reviewcomment":"I had just landed to LAX with a 2-hour drive ahead of me. Of course there was no decent grub on the 6-hour flight from Baltimore and I was rushing and hadn&#39;t packed my brown bag. So I opened up the Happy Cow app and chose the closest vegan eatery from my location dubbed Stuff I Eat. Yes, I was in nutritional heaven.<br>Going through the menu was daunting due to the plethora of magnificent and colorful choices. Serving both cooked and raw meals, Stuff I Eat ascertains that every meal is comprised of protein, fiber, complex carbs, good fats and vitamins and minerals. I selected a fresh juice and the Nut Burger, which was paired with a salad, baked potatoes and steamed veggies. I knew I shouldn&#39;t have eaten it all, but who knew when I would return. Babett was in the kitchen working her culinary magic as usual and came out to check on me. She was congenial, energetic and ultra friendly. After speaking for a few moments on health and fitness - yes, she loves to run - she stated her age and I almost spilled my green juice. &#34;Sixty what,&#34; I shouted! I would have estimated 42 years old at the most. Amazing how plant-based foods heal, nourish and enliven opposed to age, sicken and diminish like meats and dairy. The experience was unforgettable and I left very appeased. <br>After a few days I was driving back to LAX for the return flight home. Of course I was running late again but had to chance it and made another pit stop at my new favorite LA Vegan Pro establishment. Since, I have taken quite a few friends and business associates to Stuff I Eat. You should see the look on omnivore&#39;s faces when they bite into a Nut Burger! Babette is also an accomplished singer and entertained us with a live performance while we ate enjoyably. What a beautiful and energetic spirit I thought. So make sure to visit when you are in the Inglewood area. Or simply plan a special trip to get you some of the enchilada pie, Lava Burrito, Carrot Croquettes, or my favorite, The Nut Burger!",

This is coming from someone who loves food, and is considered a huge &#34;foodie&#34; by all her friends and family. I came here with my boyfriend and we sat through lunch repeating &#34;oh my god..this is SO good&#34; &#34;it&#39;s crazy how good this is&#34;. <br>We almost missed this place. Looks like a little home, and that&#39;s exactly what you get! You walk in and this amazing woman people called &#34;mama&#34; tells you to sit. At this point you need to brace yourself for the best meal of your life. <br>Long story short, they&#39;re catering our party Saturday. <br>Get the chicken breast, pork, best hummus we&#39;ve ever had, &#34;crazy salad&#34; is amazing.",

"reviewcomment":"Like many others, I discovered this place after the Mark Bittman article in the New York Times.  It&#39;s now framed in the restaurant so you can point it out to newcomers.  I&#39;ve brought hordes of newcomers, and urged many of my friends to try this place because it&#39;s delicious, and we need to support the non-chains.  I&#39;ve sent a lot of repeat customers to Adana.<br><br>So when my in-laws visited from NYC and mentioned they have never had Armenian food, I knew we had to scratch that off their bucket list.  They are not foodies nor adventurous eaters -- can&#39;t use chopsticks, hold the sushi, just Uncle Ben&#39;s converted rice.  These creatures of habit loved everything they sampled, from the hummus to the Persian salad.  As we made our exit, my mother in law told Edward they&#39;d like to come back on their next visit.   Whew.  Score one for the daughter-in-law.<br><br>We&#39;ve enjoyed many dishes since July 2013:  lamb chops, pork ribs, cornish hen, beef koobideh, chicken koobideh, honeycake.  The ikra is the best, and I often order it to go for holidays where it&#39;s always a hit and great advertisement for Adana.   <br><br>There&#39;s still no real signage, which is ironic since it&#39;s next door to the sign store.  <br><br>There is a new menu, Edward continues to innovate and remind of me some dishes I need to try.  As one would expect, the prices have risen since that NYTimes review, about 30% since last July.  Happy for them, a little sad for financially challenged me, but hopefully success breeds success.",

"reviewcomment":"It is been a pleasure to visit this place at a beautiful Sunday afternoon with less crowded parking around the area. It is a great place with a very different restaurant taste compare to all its neighborhood in my opinion. A purple contemporary design filled restaurant with some of very inspirational dishes. We have 4 people and order a lots of dishes with the scotch egg, Brussels and belly, seafood stew, kimchi flatbread, Bulgogi Burger, panna cotta and taho. <br><br>Scotch Egg were quite an amazing dish with the barely done egg yolk melted along with the crunchy outside. Eat it once the dish were serve to enjoy the heat !<br><br>Brussels and belly are a very full feeling dish as a small plate because the pork belly has it fat to fill your stomach. The Brussels were very well seasoned to balance the taste from the whole dish. I didn&#39;t find a hint of plainness(which I hate in a lots of fatty meat dish that they thought the veggie should actually be plain to balance the taste...very wrong according to my taste bud) I personally choose this as the best dish from all.<br><br>The seafood stew amaze our friend with its little spicy flavor(remind me of thai food) and the great bite feeling of the squid. I haven&#39;t have a great bite from the squid from quite a long time and the squid today were cooked so perfectly I actually took 2 rings from my gf&#39;s dish( HAHAHAHAH.) The shrimp were tasteful and blend in very well. The song were flavorful with out the MSG attack after. The song blend exceptionally well with the bread it come with and trust me....trade off the glass noodle with your friend and enjoy all 2 breads by dipping it in with the soup. It is simply some great enjoyment you can find from food.<br><br>The bulgogi burger would be my second choice for someone who need to some meat to fill the stomach.It come with fries and a big burger that a very well cooked. It is not a really special dish that only happen here but they just done this dish very well. The buns were soft and the burger were cook properly.The fries were not too salty but it is a very personal thing that you can add additional salt. <br><br>The Panna cotta were a very popular dish but I was surprise how it work along with the black rice. The jelly feel cotta just blend well with the black rice and taste wonderfully good. It is not too sweet but a very light dessert after such a heavy meal.<br><br>Taho gave me a very traditional douhua feeling with its ginger base red sugar soup. The crumble were mix with the blue berry to add more flavor and layer from the whole dish. <br><br>I am very satisfy with this visit and the food were gladly filled my tummy and just wanna visit them when they have new item come out in their menu. Both server that work today are very professional and patient with us(we have a small baby and they are very considerate on how to assist us park the stroller). Overall, a great and wonderful dinning experience!",

What more could you want. <br><br>FAVORITES:<br>- The Original Hoy Ka Noodle with Soup and Pork (Only $3.95 for a small bowl and $5.95 for a large! Don&#39;t forget to pick your noodle! My favorite is Egg Noodle!)<br>- Chicken Pad See Ew (Honestly one of the best pad see ew&#39;s I&#39;ve had ANYWHERE)<br><br>I wish I could review more of their dishes but these top two are so good, it&#39;s all I ever get whenever I go! Seriously, that noodle soup is SUPERB! <br><br>PRO TIPS:<br>- Ask for the little jar of tiny chilies in fish sauce. Not too spicy and makes everything taste DOUBLY AWESOME!<br>- I love spicy food but when I come here I always ask for MILD and it&#39;s STILL super spicy! If Mild isn&#39;t spicy enough, feel free to add extra red chili from the little jar at your table!<br>- TRY THE COCONUT PALM JUICE!! Tastes like brown sugar coconut juice. Amazing. Comes from the nector of the flower from the coconut palm tree. Very unique and refreshing drink!",

"reviewcomment":"Healthyca is my current favorite place to get my salad fix. I work in Burbank and live in the Valley so location-wise, this place is awesome. Parking is street-only but that&#39;s not usually a problem when I go (around 6PM).<br><br>Speaking of awesome, let&#39;s talk salad. I am a prolific salad-eater (I love meat too, don&#39;t get me wrong, but I&#39;ve always loved a hearty salad) and had been looking for a place that does salad right for ages. I have to give Healthyca 5 stars on all points: volume, freshness, composition, dressing. In fact, their salads are so volume-y, if I&#39;m not starving when I start in on one, I sometimes have to save about a third of it to finish later. My favorites are the Avocado Caprese and the Chinese Chicken. I&#39;ve tried every salad except for the Ratatouille and  the Albacore, and they&#39;ve all been good except the Chilled Orient, which was just okay because the soba noodles were a little soggy (maybe because I always take it to go, they get soggy by the time I get home? I suppose I could always just cook up some soba of my own). <br><br>For the side, I always get the Quinoa salad, which is flavorful and, hey, quinoa can do no wrong, right?<br><br>The last time I got the Noho Sausage which was also tasty, and made me want to try some of their hot dishes. <br><br>I was disappointed to find that they changed their hours; they now close at 7PM instead of 9PM which makes it a little harder for me to go there with friends. But, it doesn&#39;t keep me from ordering from my office and picking up on my way home. There&#39;s not a whole lot of seating anyway so be warned, it&#39;s not a fancy sit-down kind of restaurant. But the food is excellent, and that&#39;s what counts!<br><br>Please stay in business forever!!!!!",

"reviewcomment":"Thank you Yelp! for helping me find this place! Over the the last several months it has become one of my favorite spots in the valley. :)<br><br>My favorite sandwich (although they&#39;re all delicious!) is the Imported Prosciutto Sandwich-- Caprese style (with fresh mozzarella, basil and tomatoes instead of the traditional deli toppings) on their giant freshly made ciabatta bread. The sandwich drizzled with balsalmic vinegar and a little olive oil. Swoon! To die for! You have the option for domestic or imported prosciutto for a few extra bucks. Splurge a little on the imported. Trust me. It&#39;s worth it! <br><br>This place not only has fantastical sandwiches but they&#39;re a Mecca for all things Italian as far as your kitchen and stomach are concerned. From fig jams to truffle oil, blood orange sparking water and hazelnut chocolates...all homemade pastas, breads, sauces and desserts. They&#39;re phenomenal! They even have dishes like homemade Butternut Squash ravioli that they&#39;ve hand packaged and stuck in their freezer section for an easy &#34;homemade&#34; Italian meal. You just can&#39;t go wrong. You can order hot food here or take it home to cook later. Plus its been around for decades and has the sweet old school charm I just adore. Some days a cute 85-year-old man, who I assume is the owner, sits at a table by the window just sipping on a coffee and watching the comings and goings of his shop. . Major hearts for this place.",

There isn&#39;t any seating really, so just pop a squat on the curb.<br><br>My favorite is the Lomo Arigato truck. They are there every week as far as I know, so it&#39;s always a good fallback when none of the other trucks catch your eye.

The way the meat is cooked and cut up makes it amazing. The tenderness, seasoning, and along with the condiments, make this place a must go! <br><br>Each taco comes out to about $1.50, which is common for a taco now a days.

Order 3-4 to get full since they are small. The Chinese chicken salad is literally the best Chinese chicken I&#39;ve ever had out of any other place I&#39;ve been too. The dressing is perfect. It has a bit of a sweet and tangy flavor all in one. Its delicious. The greens are extremely fresh and frisp...never soggy. I devoured that salad and wanted more when i was done! I <br><br>The service here was on point as well. Soon as i put my fork down they came and asked to take my plate and wiped off my table. They were on it in there, i saw people leaving and tables being cleaned right away! This place is a must try if your in this are for lunch. Oh, the truffle fries are great too!

"reviewcomment":"Came here last Sunday on the 23rd for my birthday brunch with my lady friends.  I live in Newport Beach but had my girls come in from San Diego and SF for the weekend celebration of my life.  We were staying nearby and had been yelping brunch spots and this one was so near us and about a 10min walk.  (Sidenote: I had even considered coming here for dinner and drinks the previous Friday but it just didn&#39;t work out because you can&#39;t get 6 girls ready in time to go anywhere.)<br><br>Anyway, we had made reservations and were quickly seated by the owner, Martin.  We were seated upstairs, which gave a bit more intimate feel that I loved.  The day was sunny and warm, couldn&#39;t have asked for a better day to brunch.  Martin was such a sweetheart, he brought us out champagne, OJ and a bottle of rosé cava (which he topped off our mimosas with) and they looked just beautiful.  Worthy of Instagram.  He suggested different plates for us to try and we loved all of them.  <br>  -Jalepeño Yellowtail: so fresh and flavorful, we had to get 3 orders.<br>  -Chicken and Waffles: again, we got 2 orders to share and even another order of just the chicken.  Finger lickin&#39; good.<br>  -Breakfast Quiche: so soft and fluffy, spinach blend that melts in your mouth with a flaky, buttery crust.  <br>  -Eggs Benedict, Chipotle Scrambled Egg Tostada: didn&#39;t try either of those, but they looked fab.<br><br>The mimosas kept a&#39;flowin and the staff was incredibly sweet and helpful.  I had an amazing time here and will be back again!  The only thing I can say is that the music selection was a little off, a DJ would have been cool to have, but I&#39;m not sure if this particular part of the neighborhood would allow such thing for Sunday Brunch.  Maybe I just wanted to hear party music cause of my birthday mood.  Nonetheless, I had a spectacular time here!  The owner Martin seemed busy running the place but always made sure to check on our party and the rest of the staff were very accommodating.  Until next time!",

"reviewcomment":"This is MY taco guy!  I don&#39;t go to anyone else!!! Since 2006, I&#39;ve been coming to see this guy!  He&#39;s awesome.  He used to do a few different styles of meats that he no longer offers but I can tell you, they all contributed to my rather portly figure.  No matter! This is a good thing and don&#39;t I know it.  When there was a Yelp-UYE taco crawl through this neighborhood, I made sure to suggest that we start here. And, we did.  Since then, we&#39;ve had friends return to enjoy these delectable bites.  Some of my favorites are his tacos de pastor, tripa, chorizo, pollo, and buche.  I&#39;ll try anything he cooks up for me.  He remembers my by name, as well as my family.  He&#39;s only here on the weekends now and I can assure you, his supply runs out rather quickly.  I have suggested that friends hire him for gigs as well.  Some have and they have never been disappointed.  He makes a mean guac but it isn&#39;t always available.  I love his marinated onions, salsas and other taco condiments.  You can really spice things up that way.  I&#39;m SERIOUSLY TALKING TO YOU, yes you!  This is a MUST TRY spot.  My last meal on earth, I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if this was one of the very first things that I&#39;d mention. It&#39;s that good. Even better, while other taco spots are hiking up their prices, Arturo has stayed at a solid $1 per item. I&#39;m talking about tacos are each $1, and drinks as well. You can bring your own tupperware, like my wife does, and ask for so many dollars worth of chicken, asada, or whatever type of meat it is that you&#39;re craving.  You will NOT be surprised.  Some folks even make a salad at home and come just for $2 of meat to add to their salad. Arturo will do what he can to accomodate you, and all his guests.  Sometimes there is a line but believe me, it&#39;s worth every moment.  You will NOT be disappointed. I&#39;m just glad to have been able to share my taco guy with so many others. And, although I am not the first to yelp this spot, I know that my review will help to fetch him a few more hungry souls. <br><br>And yes, if you can&#39;t figure out which cart is his or where he is, he&#39;s usually the one on the right side of the street, if you&#39;re coming down the street from just having exited at verdugo off of the 2 freeway.  He&#39;s just after the church, next to a phone poll that has a cross on it.  <br><br>Even better, talk to Arturo.  Ask him about how his kids are doing, etc.  He&#39;s the most friendly guy.",

Kimchi, Seasame Seeds and some spicy sauce. OMG!  So frickin good!  It literally was like a Korean lunch in hot dog form. So then I got the Hanoi Dog. Basically think of a Ban Mi hot dog. Pickled Daikon, more spicy sauce and a cajun sausage. It was incredibly delicious and very creative.  After about 20 minutes, I had to get another. My girlfriend and I split a Tokyo and Thai dog.  The Tokyo had dried seaweed, crunchy shrimp crisps and a wasabi mayonnaise.  It was like eating some gourmet sushi roll. The Thai dog had a peanut Satay sauce, crunchy shrimp crisps and some other stuff I can&#39;t remember, but DAMN!  So tasty.<br><br>Apparently these guys are usually outside the Roger Room (on Beverly) every Thursday night. I highly recommend you stop by and try one of these insanely creative and yummy hot dogs. They are one of a kind and super delicious.<br><br>Enjoy!!",

From the empanadas, the chimichanga (not a burrito) and the fish they grill outside. They have Cucarachas, not the bug but this brown sauce poured over almost crispy shrimp, it&#39;s the best. <br><br>I highly recommend this place without a doubt, I&#39;ve been coming here for years. I take the hour drive here whenever I get a chance.",

"reviewcomment":"I was at a friends office in Torrance one day and could smell something really good!  He told me he had some soul food from a place in LA.  He didn&#39;t remember the name of the restaurant but remembered the area he bought it from.  Based on what he had told me, it wasn&#39;t too far from my church.  Sunday morning, my Mom said she wanted to find the restaurant and so we did!  I logged into Yelp and did a local search from soul food.  Several restaurants came up but this one had an address near the location my friend had described.  <br><br>We find the location, see a lady walking through the parking lot heading towards the restaurant.  My Mom asked her if she&#39;s eaten here before and she said she comes every week.  We get out, go in to take a look and decide to stay and give it a try.  We&#39;re so so glad we did!  We ordered the smothered pork chops, mashed potatoes, cabbage, macaroni &amp; cheese and buttered corn.  Oh my were we pleasantly pleased!  <br><br>While eating, our amazing server along with other staff members came by our table to make sure we were taken care of.  One of the people that stopped by was &#34;Grandpa&#34; - i was later told he&#39;s the youngest son of the owner.  He along with the other staff members were very friendly with all the customers.  Our server later brought out a banana pudding and peach cobbler - compliments of Grandpa for my Mom&#39;s birthday.  As if that wasn&#39;t enough, Grandpa told the lady at the table next to us (Ms. Cookie - also the lady from the parking lot) that the cookies were in the oven.  She looks at us and says &#34;don&#39;t leave, you have to have cookies with Ms. Cookie.&#34;  Shortly thereafter,  a server  brought over two containers of fresh baked Oatmeal Raisin Chocolate Chip cookies - they were AWESOME!!!<br><br>As if we needed anything else to make us love this place ... there was more.  One of the customers was and elderly man.  When he finished his food, a server called a cab for him as he had taken the bus to the restaurant.  Grandpa had them cancel the cab and Grandpa drove him home - that&#39;s customer service at it&#39;s finest!  <br><br>We&#39;ll definitely be eating at this restaurant again!  Thanks for a great experience Mama Joan&#39;s Soul Food!!!",

Toppings include all the good stuff: coconut shreds, gogi berries, chia seeds, etc.<br><br>This is a small business and b/c the two girls were so friendly, it made me want to help them out and write a review.  Plus, the acai is amazing.

I have tried plenty of mexican food in hopes of changing my mind, but nothing has been able to make me question my disinterest for mexican food until I ate at this food truck. I got a simple carne asada burrito. <br><br>First off, the burrito was huge. I was like I was practically carrying a small baby. I couldn&#39;t finish half of it. I was so stuffed.<br><br>Second off, I was thrown off by the cheap price of $4.50. <br><br>Third off, I actually really liked it. The meat is extremely juicy and very soft.

And the fact that it feels like you&#39;re eating in a garden from the chairs, tables and decor =)<br><br>Pros:<br>- That personal connection with the owners Danny and Lisa. LOVE them! <br>- BEST HANDS DOWN PAD THAI IN THE WORLD!!! I eat plenty of Thai food and others do come close but nothing has ever been as delicious as Thai Victory. Whatever they put in that stuff gets addicting. None of that overkill Pad Thai with tamarind sauce.<br>- Also try their homemade limeade or lemonade = XTC<br>- If you get their lunch specials, they usually throw in a bunch of other good stuff - fried banana, soup and salad<br>- Good portions to take home and eat for breakfast, lunch and dinner the next day all over again =D<br>- Bc of the boyfriend and I eating there so often, they knew exactly who we were so lazy days of not wanting to cook, we can easily call them about what we wanted and arrive with food ready on the table.<br><br>Cons:<br>- Yeah the whole cash thing sucks BUT don&#39;t let that deter you from trying them out (Newbies!)<br>- No more quick access to delicious Thai food now that we&#39;ve moved farther away.<br><br>Either way, you&#39;ll pretty much have a good experience and DELICIOUS FOOD to go along with.",

Love the concept - sooo many sodas to choose from, whether you like your soda sweet (the bf&#39;s Mexican cane-sugar coke) or clean (my dry cucumber sparkling water; 45 calories!).<br><br>We both chose the special of the day: breakfast burritos with chorizo/bacon, potato, eggs, jack cheese, and pico de gallo on a spinach tortilla. His with a side of salt and pepper chips, and mine with kale salad.  So good. With tip came out to about $25. (We don&#39;t usually tip much when it&#39;s self serve, but the service was that good)<br><br>Next time: pulled pork on brioche and the Pop&#39;s burger are on the list. <br><br>FYI: Soda Pop&#39;s caters, but also runs a catering company called S&amp;P Catering for special events/weddings, etc.",

"reviewcomment":"If you are not down to wait for delicious soul food, then don&#39;t even bother reading this. The wait is approximately 30-40 minutes during the weekend, sometimes even an hour wait, depending on what time you arrive, but it&#39;s so worth it! Despite the wait, the owner and the waitress were super friendly and greeted everyone who walked in and jock down their names and even gave them a menu to look over, so once you are seated, you can just order on top of your head! <br><br>Let&#39;s talk about their menu. If you&#39;re a health freak, don&#39;t worry, Serving Spoon has a great selection for you. You can select food from low carb choices to i-just-want-everything-on-my-plate . You want protein? You&#39;ll get protein! You want vegetarian? You&#39;ll get vegetarian! You want everything above? Prepare your stomach, because their combination is enough to share for two! <br><br>We came on a Sunday, and they have a white board that states their special, and we ordered their chicken with gravy and it comes with two sides so we got the mac &amp; cheese and yam. I ordered T-bone steak, which came with grits and sunny side up eggs. You have no idea how flavorful the chicken and the t-bone was! Note: most of their food is made with butter! Yes, butter yam, butter pancakes, butter almost everything! The grits was my favorite side, and second would be the yam. DO NOT leave butter out when you&#39;re eating grits, because you&#39;ll be missing out. <br><br>Love almost everything about the place. You know it&#39;s soul food kind of place when they&#39;re bumping soul music while everyone&#39;s eating. <br><br>Parking: You can either TRY to park in their parking lot, which is shared, OR the streets, which is a bit ghetto and packed or save yourself some trouble on the weekend and park in the parking lot own by the preschool, but shared. As you know, there&#39;s no school on the weekends, so you are safe.",

"reviewcomment":"I went here to meet up for a business discussion with a friend/client. We ordered a ton of food because, even at my 130 pound frame, I am sure a fatty at heart. My friend wanted drinks(particularly the delicious strawberry lemonade) but our tab was topping out $40 already. The sweet cashier winked and gave us &#34;water cups&#34; to cut the bill by a few dollars. That made the biggest difference, and proved to me that they don&#39;t just care about money. We ended up buying more food with the money we saved, so hey, they won either way! Plus, we will be lifelong customers of this restaurant chain and location for as long as they are around. <br><br>I ordered the Santa Fe Crispy Chikin Sandwhich, which is probably the best thing on the menu, and it turned out perfectly. No burnt spots, no under-cooked spots, and it was perfectly decorated. I also ordered the harvest bowl, which seems more like a breakfast menu item but it was still really well prepared and delicious.<br><br>The atmosphere is very clean, the workers are all attentive and helpful, and they validate parking! 5 stars for you VG!",

Just discovered it off yelp but apparently they just celebrated their 6 year anniversary according to our server.<br><br>Ok so I wanted to take my girl to a nice place and this one had great reviews. We got the carrot and kale soup which was great.the crunchy tiger hidden dragon was so good I contemplated the idea that vegan sushi had a future in my palette. Coming from a tuna fisherman who&#39;s been eating sushi since six months old I never thought I&#39;d say that.. <br><br>The ramen revolution was so good I ordered a second one. Then we got the raspberry &#34;superfood&#34; cheesecake. Bomb! Never felt so good about eating desert. A $100 dollar dinner later and my girl is happier than can be. Pricey but worth it.",

My top two choices would be the Salmon Tacos and the Chicken Enchiladas. Both are amazing but you just can&#39;t go wrong with anything on this menu. The salads are amazing as well. They have plenty of side options to choose from too.The sauteed mushrooms are now officially my favorite. They also have a great Arnold Palmer with fresh mint added! Yum! <br><br>I hope this review helps you on deciding where to go to have a nice lunch if you&#39;re in the fabulous Weho area! :)",

"reviewcomment":"Speaking as a Santa Monica College student, I can say with pride that Shaka Shack Burgers has time and time again succeeded in solving my everyday lunch problem.<br><br>As a full-time student who essentially spends sunrise-to-sunset on campus, it is a given I get hungry--very hungry--throughout the day and evening. But because I cannot afford to stray far from our main campus, I, like many other students, am confined to limited options. (Mainly our school&#39;s cafeteria. And while it is a fair place to eat - it gets boring eating the same thing, in the same place every school day.) But one day I simply had enough. It was a rough day and I needed to get off campus to try something fresh. Thankfully, Shaka Shack Burgers was only a block away--and I decided to take a chance on something.<br><br>When I walked into this surf-themed burger joint, it looked like I had walked into a time machine and went back to the wild 60&#39;s--and in a great way. From purple walls with tiki adornments, to a tiny TV playing non-stop surf footage, to all the tastefully selected posters, to Hawaiian tablecloths--man, it had it all. It looked EXACTLY what I had always imagined Pulp Fiction&#39;s &#34;Big Kahuna Burger&#34; to look like. And speaking of burgers, SSB&#39;s have made some of the best I have ever tasted.<br><br>My very first meal there consisted of their Kobe Beef burger with truffle fries. And considering it was second day of classes - right after my first all-nighter of the semester - well, I cannot even begin to tell you how much better that made it. After finishing my food, I just sank into their golden, plastic-covered (and deceptively comfortable) sofa. The service thatMichael and Kathy provide is always tremendous, and honestly merits an additional review all it&#39;s own. Put succinctly: they rival, if not surpass, most sit down places in terms of service, despite the fact this is an inexpensive, very casual establishment,<br><br>With that said, all I can say is that I never wonder where to go when I need a great meal for cheap. Do yourself a favor and check it out!",

Our waitress is so pretty and nice and VERY helpful. We ordered so much meat and intestines lol. Everything is so fresh and excellent meat quality. In the end of our meal/after we pay they gave us each vanilla ice cream!!! For free!! They are very generous with their portions I love it! <br><br>Definitely coming back probably next month! Lol",

"reviewcomment":"I came here after eating at Pa Ord Noodle place next door. I am the type of person who is obsessed with beauty and health. So when I saw the word Detox I had to check it out. <br>   Going in, the employee behind the counter was very helpful and friendly. He explained all the juices and gave enough samples to allow me to know which juice I wanted to buy. I bought the detox elixir, sport 50/50 and the alkalizer tonic. <br>    I LOVE all of them. It all depends on preference and your palate when it comes down to the juices. I love how they&#39;re already juices and guaranteed to be fresh. I mean I don&#39;t have time to be waiting 30mins for juice. I will totally come here if I start a 3 day cleanse. Hopefully it can supplement a blueprint cleanse. Whenever I&#39;m around this area I will be back ^__^",

You can choose from 5 of their doughs, I choose flax whole grain, then you choose your sauce or sauces, veggies, roasted veggies and last but not least your meats. You can choose however many kinds of meats you want and then they take your name and put your personalized pizza in the oven. Takes about 6 minutes to get it and it tastes great! No matter how you personalize it, it comes out to about 8 bucks, pretty cheap if you ask me. Give this place a try and you won&#39;t be dissapointed!",

"reviewcomment":"Eating at Fork in the Road is a truly incredible experience. Four of us went early the night of the Academy Awards and expected to be there for an hour and a half, but ended up staying for 3 hours! The staff was warm and friendly. May Ling was our waitress; she  had a great personality and couldn&#39;t have been more helpful. She had a detailed knowledge of the menu and was a great guide for each of us. Drew, the chef, was remarkably accessible and open. His passion and creativity were on display for every dish he created. <br><br>For small plates, we had the green beans, tabouli with naan, ratatouille, and a broccoli with micro lettuces (which flowers twice a year). All were exceptional. For entrees we had capellini with cheese and tomatoes, chicken with parmesan fritters, beef brisket with root vegetables, and lamb osso bucco. Each dish was distinctive and visually inspired. For dessert we had 3 ice creams: lavendar mint, white chocolate, and a hot chocolate that was cold in the dish but had a spicy kick when it went down your throat. We also had a berry dish which was also delicious. <br><br>Eating at Fork in the Road was like a dream that we didn&#39;t want to wake up from.<br>We can&#39;t wait to return.",

"reviewcomment":"Oh, Medocino Farms. You&#39;re the only place (so far) that I don&#39;t feel guilty for buying a $10 sandwich to go. Yes, it is that good! <br><br>With all the raving reviews I&#39;ve read for months, I was quite skeptical about Mendocino Farms. Would it be worth the hype? It definitely was. <br><br>I&#39;ve tried a few of their sandwiches, and none of them disappointed. The flavor was there, and the portion was decent, considering that it&#39;s sandwiches they&#39;re selling. <br><br>I&#39;ve never eaten at this particular location; I&#39;d walk here during my lunch break once a while and get something to go. The lunch rush is a bit crazy - a bunch of people ordering and waiting for their food, and a bunch of people walking around/squirming to find a place to sit or stand, and a fair number of people surrounding the area asking for free samples of various salad-y foods. <br><br>Despite the popularity of Mendocino Farms, I&#39;ve always left happy with a delicious sandwich. <br><br>Their spicy lemongrass bahn mi came in ciabiatta bread, panini style. I&#39;m not great with choosing breads to go on sandwiches, so I leave it to them or go with the default. Although I thought it looked a bit small, it was the best &#34;bahn mi&#34; from a non-specialized bahn mi place. I couldn&#39;t get much of the spiciness of the lemon grass, but the tenderness of the meat and how well the flavors went together in that panini left me wanting more. Their other bahn mi was good too, but it was much messier. <br><br>Their farm sandwich/turkey sandwich was good too. They sure do an awesome job with combining ingredients. <br><br>They also have gluten free bread, which is $1.50 or $2.00 more. Unfortunately, you could tell it is gluten free bread, so I&#39;d recommend (if you&#39;re getting gluten free bread) getting a super flavorful sandwich on it. Not the turkey, but the Italian. YUM! <br><br>Their menu contains numerous amazing sandwiches, salads, and more. You can also customize your sandwiches, but I just leave it up to the experts. Usually when you walk in, someone takes your order and checks certain boxes on a piece of paper (what kind of bread, etc etc). Then you wait for your name to be called and then pay (or pay after you order). They have some salads/sides that you can sample while waiting, such as curry rice, etc. (they probably rotate these).",

I&#39;ve busted out in tears eating it, and I have a pretty high tolerance for spice. My pro tip is to order half and half (i.e., if you&#39;re getting 3 tacos, do two super hot and one regular spicy, then mix &#39;em all together). I&#39;m sure they wouldn&#39;t mind combining salsas but I&#39;ve yet to ask.<br><br>PS - They accept card but I would recommend bringing cash. I don&#39;t have a problem with $1.50 tacos, but adding another dollar to that just to pay with my card would be my only real gripe.<br><br>LOVE YOU GUS!!",

"reviewcomment":"Having been to pretty much all of the Russian stores in WeHo and SF Valley, the service from this one really tops the list. Service with a smile is something virtually unheard of most Russian establishments, yet I think I finally found one. No bitterness or pushiness at this place, instead the 2 ladies working there were honest, helpful and courteous.  Oh and for a Bonus - Open til 9PM daily. <br><br>PS, their Beef Tongue Salad FTW!",

"reviewcomment":"Amazing!  From the moment we walked in we were greeted by the owner who made all sorts of wonderful meal recommendations.  You can plainly see that this restaurant owner loves what he does and lives to make people happy.  He surprised us with an array of sliders of all different types of exotic meats from kangaroo to red deer to wagyu to camel.  The wagyu slider was my favorite along with the zucchini sticks.  The sauces were really delicious and made a great burger an excellent one.  I really liked the wasabi mayo and cranberry mayo the best!  <br><br>Mark, the owner, checked on us frequently and made sure we had a comfortable, enjoyable, perfect dining experience.  It is a rarity to experience that high level of attentiveness and customer service these days, especially in L.A.  <br><br>This restaurant was made for good, kind, friendly people to enjoy some delicious comfort food and engage (or not) in some pleasing conversation with whoever you&#39;re dining with and possibly the owner (he&#39;s a people person who will get you laughing out loud if you let him).   Entitled, pretentious folks need not frequent this establishment as you may be overwhelmed by the fact that respect, decency, and good old-fashioned manners are quite common (and encouraged) at Peas &amp; Carrots.<br><br>I&#39;m so excited to take my friends here!  Thank you, Mark, for your hospitality and comfort food.  You&#39;re a fabulous human being.",

If you don&#39;t mind taking a little drive to the rougher side of town for some taste bud tingling while dancing around a Mexican hat to show how grateful they are to the Mexican food gods- then WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR!!?? <br><br>The bf and I come here a lot during the summer because their ceviche is TO DIE FOR and oh so refreshing! We can&#39;t help but to stuff ourselves! I always get the ceviche and the bf gets the fish tacos. The fish tacos are really good BUT sometimes we get disappointed because they wont be as crispy as other days. I think they stack them in piles so they get a little soggy (but they still taste yummy). The line is always out the door-but it is worth the wait! (The wait is never even too long anyways because the staff is so efficient!) <br><br>Can&#39;t wait to make another trip to my happy place. :-)",

"reviewcomment":"My boss recommended this hidden gem to me and it was an awesome find!<br><br>This place is literally hidden in the middle of the fashion district in DTLA. I had to walk around a few times before I saw it hidden in a cul-de-sac. And once you find the place, it literally looks like a &#34;shack&#34; but you are warmly greeted by friendly smiles from the couple that runs the place and the lovely smell of food cooking in the kitchen.<br><br>SEATING:<br>This place is really, really small! There were only 2 tables inside. And there were another 1-2 tables outside (that are meant for a party of 1-2).<br><br>MENU:<br>They offered nigiri, sushi rolls, sashimi, teriyaki bowls, bento boxes, and salads. Their menu is posted inside. Everything was pretty cheap and reasonably priced!<br><br>FOOD: Special Nigiri $12 - YUMMY! It came with 4 pieces of salmon, 4 pieces of tuna, 4 pieces of eel, and I got another 2 pieces of mackerel.<br><br>The fish was pretty fish. Very tasty! Totally worth the price!<br><br>PARKING: <br>Sucks. You have to park at a meter which is $3/hour. There is also a lot closeby that was $5 or $8 all day. Or you can temporarily wait in the loading zone area, if you&#39;re willing to get your food to-go.<br><br>I would definitely come back here if I am in the area! :)",

The first few songs our group tried to sing didn&#39;t load correctly because we didn&#39;t understand the foreign symbols Korean remote. Once we figured it out though, we had a blast. Seriously, time went by TOO fast. <br><br>The luxury of having your own room is just the best thing ever. Watch your pride, shame and dignity flutter out the window because it&#39;s just you and your drunk friends!!<br><br>They only sell beer, which is a blessing in disguise because 1) they&#39;re cheap and 2) I didn&#39;t realize how drunk I was actually getting because I was sitting down and singing. It became apparent when I had to stand up to go home. <br><br>We stayed about 3 hours, drank countless beers and it ended up being about $160 with tip. Not too shabby. <br><br>Also, no outside food or beverages. However, I snuck in a beer in from Cafe Brass Monkey. When they asked to look inside my purse, I turned around and put the beer in my mane of long hair. They didn&#39;t notice. Thank goodness. <br><br>Will be back soon, xoxo Young Dong!",

"reviewcomment":"Pasadena isn&#39;t exactly a hotbed of Italian deliciousness, but there is one fantastic exception. In an unassuming little strip mall north of the 210 (or NoTwo, as we call it) is Roma Italian Market, home to the best sandwiches in town (and anywhere, ever).  Roma has a produce section with seasonal fresh fruits and veggies, a selection of Italian wines that I cannot tell you more about because I know nothing about wine, and a thousand different kinds of delightful little cookies that you could blow a whole paycheck on. They also carry a bunch of dried and fresh pastas, fancy canned and jarred things you need for Italian cooking (A pint of capers! Anchovies!), and the deli. <br><br>Most people go to Roma for the deli, with its impressive array of meat and cheese, and the adorable owner, Rosario. He&#39;s a tiny ancient man who will give you samples of everything while he makes your sandwich. Roma only has one sandwich. Supposing you were only interested in one day&#39;s lunch, he&#39;ll make you a modest portion. Modest portions, however, are for suckers. What Rosario does better than anyone is The Sandwich, made on an entire loaf of ciabatta, roughly 1 foot wide by 2.5 feet long, and cut into 8-10 servings. The massive loaf is cut in half and promptly covered in liberal splashes of olive oil. Then it&#39;s piled high with mortadella (which apparently was not allowed to be imported to the US until 2000). Next comes a layer of salami, of which there are many options. We always ask for spicy, which holds its own against the salt/fat awesomeness of the mortadella. Finally there&#39;s a layer of provolone to round out the beast. The bread is always fresh-baked and crusty and perfect for soaking up the olive oil.<br><br>tl;dr...Roma&#39;s has nice products, The Sandwich is alarmingly delicious, Rosario is wonderful.<br><br>If you&#39;re a glutton for punishment, you can see even more review at <a href='mailto:RestaurantResolutionLA@blogspot.com'>RestaurantResolutionLA@b…</a>",

"reviewcomment":"Best Chinese Food in Koreatown! Good Chinese food is hard to find West of the 5 but, Sea Dragon Chinese Restaurant is one of the better ones. That&#39;s why it deserves 5 stars. <br><br>They have lunch special hours and prices are great for the amount of food you get. Food comes with an egg soup and a small egg roll. Free hot tea. Don&#39;t worry what you order as everything is pretty good and you can&#39;t really go wrong. There is this one beef dish one of the lady workers recommended which was exceptionally good. If I figure out which dish it is, I&#39;ll update this review but, for now just ask for a beef dish recommendation from them.<br><br>The ladies who run the restaurant are so grandmotherly cute and very nice. They just make you smile just looking at them.",

"reviewcomment":"I&#39;ve been coming to this tiny little café for years, and almost always for the croissants, which are amazing.  Enormous, flaky, incredibly rich, just delicious.  There are five or six different kinds - plain, ham and cheese, chocolate, etc. - and I&#39;ve tried all of them except the spinach one, and they&#39;re all great.  <br><br>The coffee is also really good, and they do a ton of to-go business, but if you sit down for breakfast, they&#39;re very good about keeping your cup nice and warm with refills.  I&#39;ve only tried a couple of their breakfast options, one of which was the eggs/bacon/potato plate, but very large portions ensure you&#39;ll struggle to finish.  <br><br>They do a bakery business for sweets, and they have a lot of options in that regard, but I have yet to try any of it, this is my default location for breakfast.  Friendly staff, but very small space, so it&#39;s sometimes hard to get a table to sit down and eat. Highly recommended!",

"reviewcomment":"India&#39;s Restaurant may not be 5 star in any one specific category alone, but all put together, it deserves full marks in my book.<br><br>From the street, India&#39;s Restaurant does not seem much to look at, but once inside I was pleased to find a clean, spacious, and comfortably appointed restaurant that belied the exterior.  There is lot parking and if you&#39;re lucky, you&#39;ll nab one of the spots right away like I did.  On weekend nights, I can see parking becoming a bit of a premium.<br><br>The staff here is so friendly and helpful.  They may not be flashy or super talkative, but they speak through their kind and thoughtful service.  Our water glasses were refilled and we were served complimentary dessert.  Kudos to the last item in particular especially when I used the Yelp $20 for $10 deal (cannot be applied for buffet) to pay down my meal.  They could have easily protected their margins, but instead decided to treat their patrons the same regardless. <br><br>I was quite pleased with the food as well.  I can think of just a handful of places where I&#39;ve had better Indian food, but India&#39;s Restaurant is definitely one of the better Indian restaurants I&#39;ve tried in LA.  The food isn&#39;t flashy, but authentic and tasty.  The lamb vindaloo was excellent - lamb was tender and the sauce was delicious, although if you like things spicy, opt for the Spicy level as the Medium level felt tame to me.  The Dahl Makhnee was also excellent - lentils were perfectly cooked and awesome with the next dish we ordered.  The vegetable biryani is no joke.  I went with our server&#39;s recommendation to get the vegetable version and it did not disappoint.  A must get if you&#39;re ordering any curry.  The garlic naan is also quite good and should be ordered to accompany any meal here.<br><br>Without the deal, our dinner came out to $36 and change.  And we were stuffed and walked out with leftovers.  With the Yelp deal, it came out to $16 (so $26 total when you account for the $10 deal I paid for).  That&#39;s a steal for what we ate.  There&#39;s a 15% off discount offer too if you check in online.  When you take really good food, great service, and price it very reasonably, you deserve 5 stars in my book.  I will definitely be hitting up India&#39;s Restaurant again.  It looks like I finally found my go-to-Indian restaurant in LA.",

Definitely yummy.<br><br>I can&#39;t wait to come here again to try other menu items.  Also I would say this is a great place for vegetarians as there were a lot of meatless options.",

"reviewcomment":"I&#39;m seriously warning you, do not, I repeat, DO NOT go with a group! Tapas restaurants are the new and in lately, but I tend to be disappointed at the meager portions. Just charge me more and give me something satisfying! Us six girls potentially had the saddest yet the most scrumptious meal because their portions were so tiny, yet their dishes so delicious. [See photo of tiny popcorn bacons below and imagine it being shared by 6 girls]. It also did not help that the dishes all came out one by one...<br><br>Moving onto the food, which was *to die for*!<br><br>1. Popcorn bacon - creative dish, but we basically paid $8 for salty tater tots the size of a ketchup dish. Not sure why everyone else on Yelp is raving abt it.<br>2. Brussels sprout hash - delish, but what kind of establishment dOesn&#39;t have good brussels sprouts? But I really want to give Black Hogg credit for their creativity. The chef added over easy eggs to this dish to give it a twist.<br>3. Pork belly tacos - my eyes were the size of saucers after that delicious first bite. But imagine 6 ppl sharing 4 tacos lolol. #sad <br>4. Roast mushroom brioche box - the best dish of the night along w the pork belly tacos! Mushrooms on brick toast? Yes pls.<br>5. 53rd and 6th lamb and rice - nice try, but this tastes nothing like the 53rd and 6th chicken and rice in NYC. It was very... cilantro-y...<br>6. Jerk chicken &amp; coconut rice - what a pair made in heaven, and the chicken was so juicy!<br>7. Five leches bread pudding - pecans, salty vanilla ice cream.. it was gone in seconds.<br><br>Trendy, yummy, and reservations are a must. Go with a significant other, or 2 friends max, and you&#39;ll have an amazing time!",

I take so long to order but that&#39;s a good thing, because there&#39;s too much good stuff that I can&#39;t make up my mind :( <br><br> But today, I found out that they now have Girl Scout Thin mint cookies that you can add into your ice cream! I don&#39;t need to visit baskin Robbins or cold stone anymore. I&#39;m done. This is THE place for ice cream.",

"reviewcomment":"* 1 Michelin Star*<br><br>When I found out about the special $85 DineLA menu, I was praying that CUT was going to be on there. Low and behold, my prayers were answered! <br><br>Parking:<br>We might be dining fancy, but our group of 3 didn&#39;t want to dish out an additional $14 or so for Valet! That&#39;s just ridiculous. If you drive around enough, you&#39;ll find metered parking.<br><br>Location:<br>The place is located inside the Beverly Hills Wilshire. We had some trouble locating the place at first. When you walk through the hotel doors, there wasn&#39;t any signs leading you into the right direction. Eventually, we walked down a hallway and found ourselves at CUT! Talk about FANCY. A lot of beautiful cars accompanied with a lot of beautiful crowd. <br><br>Restaurant:<br>I checked in for our group a little early just to give them a heads up that we were here. We then were invited to walk across the hall to their bar and start out with cocktails. Man, some of the best concoctions we&#39;ve ever had! Appropriately priced at around $20, but that&#39;s a lot of time and love going into those drinks! When it came time for our reservation, I was approached by the hostess who then offered to carry all 3 of our drinks to the table. It was nice of them to easily transfer the check to our table too.<br><br>Service:<br>Service was good but not amazing. They were busy, but having to flag down a waitress/waiter more than once was a bit too much I think. They also forgot to give us more bread when asked numerous times.<br><br>Food:<br>DineLA: <br>1st course: Scallop ceviche was amazing! There was a decent amount in the bowl, but I definitely had to slow myself down to really savor it all. <br><br>2nd course: Oxtail Consume very tasty and savory. My only issue with it was that it was a bit cooler than I thought it&#39;d be. <br><br>3rd course: Black Sea Bass. Cooked perfectly! The skin was so good. Came out hot and crispy! I really wanted more of this course. The sauces that accompanied it were good as well. <br><br>4th course:| Dry aged NY sirloin. This course was very special for me since it was the FIRST time I ordered a steak RARE! I mean, we&#39;re at CUT so I knew I could trust them. The meat was life changing! I don&#39;t think I can go back to medium rare anymore. Well, at least when I&#39;m dining at a fancy steakhouse. The meat was perfect inside and out. I was cutting small pieces on purpose to savor this course! Creamed spinach that came with the dish was very good too. Not watery or heavy. The potatoes were good as well, but just potatoes. <br><br>5th course:  Irish whiskey chocolate cake w Caramel ice cream! I&#39;m not one for desserts, but this was really good too. I wish there was more of that caramel ice cream though. It was FANTASTIC! The cake was very rich with caramel drizzled on the outside and inside of the cake.<br><br>Overall:<br>I&#39;d def come back and dine here again. I really want to try their famous Wagyu steak! I would suggest making a late reservation if you don&#39;t want the hassle of paying for valet and worrying about the meter. I believe after 8pm or so, meter parking is FREE! Go here if you want amazing steak! Bravo, Wolfgang!",

Let&#39;s just say there was only 5 of us :)<br><br>Nonetheless the coffee continues to keep it standards and I just love it! Flavors are a there and never over powering whether it&#39;s the food or coffee.<br><br>The last visit was to stop in and pick up their ice brew.. I mean it was 84 degrees on Saturday!!

We regularly plan &#34;food tours&#34; in the 5 mile radius (a shimmering, delicious, golden pocket of mexican food) surrounding La Mascota to take full advantage of the drive. <br><br>That being said, they have the BEST TAMALES in LA. i sound like I&#39;m exaggerating but I&#39;m not. My 60 year old Japanese (he grew up in east LA) dad even agrees - and he doesn&#39;t even really like tamales... Just try a red pork tamale. all dozens are $18. We get 2 or 3 at a time and stow them in the freezer. Oo and while you&#39;re there try some cookies or flan - huge variety of freshly baked goods.",

"reviewcomment":"I was half expecting a long juicy bratwurst in a tiny, dense bun (like the street vendors serve in good old Europe) but these are cut up in bite sized pieces, seasoned to your choice level of spice, topped with curry sauce and served with a couple of pieces of classic German bread. You get the all the good tastes of the curry wurst experience without the mess of the juices falling down your face and all over your hands-it was kind of perfect,  really. Add the crunchy, salty fritten and you got yourself a hefty snack. Don&#39;t be shy with the mayo - yes, mayonnaise - because as weird as it may seem putting it on your fritten, it actually cuts the salt and suddenly you can&#39;t stop eating it. Plus,  that&#39;s how they do it in good old Europe. <br><br>Back to the wursts, We tried beef and pork,  both were good. Doubt any of the options are bad. And definitely affordable.",

"reviewcomment":"Little Beast brought a smile to my face all night. Everything from convenient parking (park at Cindy&#39;s across the street), to the very inviting and lovely patio (which I highly recommend sitting on) the food didn&#39;t let up. <br><br>I started w a bottle of wine I brought ($18 corkage) I ordered the burrata and prosuitto which was phenomenal with the perfectly cooking broccolini and extra Crispy topping was a nice touch. For my main I had the special lamb rago which was killer. Nice size portion and the flavor was spot on. Pasta was cooking perfect. My gf had the scallops which again was perfect and something I could have had as my main and been happy, luckily I got to try both :). Now on the the stars of dessert. We had the fallen apple pastry and the off do menu bread pudding, both woth vanilla gelato. WOW! Some of the best dessert I&#39;ve ever had and would come back here just for that, but again the result of the meal will get me back here anyways. <br><br>If you&#39;re local, no excuse GO. We drove out from Venice (took over 1.5 hours on a Friday night) and if you ask me I would do it again. <br><br>Walked over to the black boar for some cocktails after. <br><br>Great night!",

"reviewcomment":"One of the more memorable meals I&#39;ve had recently.<br><br>Rolled in here on a Saturday night around 8 pm without reservations.  Was seated immediately.  The restaurant is classy but not pretentious.  Cozy setting, decorated well with cute little giraffes perched above on the ledges.  A big glass window with a view of the street.<br><br>They started us with some soft tasty bread, and I dabbled myself with a glass of crisp white wine.  Ordered the sauteed wild pacific shrimp salad.  SO AMAZING.  Some of the best shrimp I&#39;ve ever had.  They were gigantic and meaty, when I bit into them they exploded with flavor.  They were grilled and had that slight charred flavor with some citric to it.  Tons of texture, had to actually chew them to digest cuz they were so big.  Came with some arugula, shaved fennel, white beans, raisins, and olive lemon vinaigrette.  A spectacular salad.  My girl got the angus filet and she practically orgasmed eating it.  I sampled it and it was indeed tender and delicious.  Some nice potato gratin with it.<br><br>We finished with a sticky toffee pudding that blew our minds.  Came with some vanilla ice cream.  Don&#39;t even know what to say about this, it was just great.  With two glasses of wine and all that it was a very reasonable tab.  Service was excellent all night, and the atmosphere was warm.  Food was spectacular, I will certainly be returning to JiRaffe.",

"reviewcomment":"Easily the best açai bowl in LA. I know many people come here for the juices (I recommend the C-splash and the Phyto-Calcium), but it&#39;s really all about The Chronic Bowl here. They use a generous amount of fresh fruit and the acai smoothie base is never too thick. <br><br>The earlier you get here in the mornings, the better. Limited area to sit and usually fairly crowded after 10. Expect to wait 10-15 minutes if you&#39;re getting an acai bowl. <br>This is the kind of place that people come post-work out (or probably just posers wearing their work out clothes). Hipster melrose crowd as per usual.<br><br>I can&#39;t recommend liquid juice bar enough, get a punch card you will definitely be coming back!!",

"reviewcomment":"I live in San Diego. I did a roadtrip to LA with my GF to eat. I found this place on Yelp and went out of our way to go to downtown LA at 10pm in the evening. We parked about 4 blocks away and walked passed many homeless people, even 2 guys that were sharing a tent, to get here and try a burger. The game plan was for us to share a burger as we had dinner earlier in the evening. Also to share some cheesey tots as they look amazing in the photos. Unfortunately, we stuck to this plan and I only had half a Black Sheep burger. This burger was amazing and cemented the fact that LA has such an elevated food scene compared to SD. The cheesey tots were good but unmemorable because of the spotlight of this damn tasty burger.<br><br>So, is this place worth a 2 hour drive, a half mile walk past some dangerous street residents? Yes. Yes it is. My only complaint was that the burger was too small, but even if it was a 2 pound burger, I&#39;d probably still have the same complaint. But seriously, the burger was on the small side.<br><br>Black Sheep, I will be seeing you soon!",

I&#39;m happy to report that their small restaurant at the Echo Park Lake boathouse is a perfect adaptation of what makes the original restaurant so darn good.<br><br>I ordered the Breakfast Burrito, which had squash instead of the original restaurant&#39;s cactus, and my lady-friend got the egg sandwich. Both excellent. We both ordered large cups of Iced Intelligentsia Coffee, which were as good as always. The little boathouse menu also features &#34;Brioche French Toast Bites,&#34; a perfect picnicy adaptation of the restaurant&#39;s most famous menu item for just $5... but they were, alas, sold out. We instead ordered the toast with homemade jam to share, which was quite good as well... but man I wanted those French Toast Bites.<br><br>Located right on the water, we spread out a blanket on an unused dock, spread out our food, played a board game and listened to music in the unseasonably beautiful and warm day. Pretty perfect. Square One nails it again!",

"reviewcomment":"Speaking as a Santa Monica College student, I can say with pride that Shaka Shack Burgers has time and time again succeeded in solving my everyday lunch problem.<br><br>As a full-time student who essentially spends sunrise-to-sunset on campus, it is a given I get hungry--very hungry--throughout the day and evening. But because I cannot afford to stray far from our main campus, I, like many other students, am confined to limited options. (Mainly our school&#39;s cafeteria. And while it is a fair place to eat - it gets boring eating the same thing, in the same place every school day.) But one day I simply had enough. It was a rough day and I needed to get off campus to try something fresh. Thankfully, Shaka Shack Burgers was only a block away--and I decided to take a chance on something.<br><br>When I walked into this surf-themed burger joint, it looked like I had walked into a time machine and went back to the wild 60&#39;s--and in a great way. From purple walls with tiki adornments, to a tiny TV playing non-stop surf footage, to all the tastefully selected posters, to Hawaiian tablecloths--man, it had it all. It looked EXACTLY what I had always imagined Pulp Fiction&#39;s &#34;Big Kahuna Burger&#34; to look like. And speaking of burgers, SSB&#39;s have made some of the best I have ever tasted.<br><br>My very first meal there consisted of their Kobe Beef burger with truffle fries. And considering it was second day of classes - right after my first all-nighter of the semester - well, I cannot even begin to tell you how much better that made it. After finishing my food, I just sank into their golden, plastic-covered (and deceptively comfortable) sofa. The service thatMichael and Kathy provide is always tremendous, and honestly merits an additional review all it&#39;s own. Put succinctly: they rival, if not surpass, most sit down places in terms of service, despite the fact this is an inexpensive, very casual establishment,<br><br>With that said, all I can say is that I never wonder where to go when I need a great meal for cheap. Do yourself a favor and check it out!",

We were served by what seemed to be the owner or manager named Steve, whom was very accommodating and genuinely just wanted to make sure that we were happy with our food.<br><br>The people that took over this place really did wonders because I went here before the ownership changed and it wasn&#39;t as good. Anyways, great food! Will be frequenting this location whenever I need my Mexican fix!",

Damn you, West Hollywood and your horrific parking rules!!! <br><br>Anyhow, the two chefs at Gorge are super talented and quite friendly.  Most items are made in house (not the cheese and not the bread) and the freshness really comes through.  We have very much enjoyed the Cassoulet, the Chicken Liver Pate, and the Saucisson; I didn&#39;t love the Pig Ear Tartine, but it was very well made.  Be sure to leave room for the St. Honore dessert! Too good.<br><br>Can&#39;t wait to visit again.  =)",

"reviewcomment":"Freshly made Omusubi<br><br>Sunny Blue is a small shop on Main St and is super closed to Santa Monica Farmer&#39;s Market. It is a small little place and it can be missed very easily besides that there is a good line out the door some time. My favorite is the miso beef and spicy salmon (although, there has been once or twice that the seasoning was a bit salty for me). I love standing in line and watch them make the rice balls and then wrap it around a thin crispy seaweed sheet. The workers are super friendly and nice as well. I do wish that there are more room in the shop to sit.  There are only 3 seats at the little bar and one tiny table to sit at. The beach is very close by so togo is a great option and bring it down to the beach to enjoy. I usually am tempted to get at least a couple but I can only really finish two if I&#39;m hungry. Overall, it is a great place to snack on omusubi or have a full on lunch. I have not found another place that make fresh omusubi. Favorite snacks :)",

So I&#39;ll give this place 5 stars! <br><br>This may not be your usual cheap AYCE KBBQ in L.A (which usually range from $10-$20/person) and it may be pricey but it&#39;s definitely worth it!! The beef is so good and tender. You can definitely tell it&#39;s fresh and high quality meat. We got the Park&#39;s Galbi and the Seasoned pork belly. Both just melts in your mouth! The park&#39;s Galbi which is a seasoned Galbi, was just so good! It had so much flavor and very tender. The seasoned pork belly is very tasty and juicy. They have a great costumer service! Our server was very attentive and polite. Also, I think they&#39;re only doing valet parking (for $2)  so make sure to have some cash/change when you come. Can&#39;t wait to go back and try the other meat. Definitely recommend everyone to try!",

"reviewcomment":"Like my tip says, I&#39;ve died and gone to caviar heaven!  This is how I imagine heaven would be, caviar on everything I eat!!! Just so happens, the decor is white and fresh.  I came here on a Sunday afternoon with my sister for a little decadence.  They had a Sunday brunch menu but we decided to go with dishes on the regular lunch menu.  The cuisine here was right up our alley!  We opted to order EVERYTHING with caviar.  I mean why not splurge a little, right?!<br><br>We started off with the Petit Petrossian, it came with a 12 gram jar of Petrossian caviar, crème fraîche, and the most fluffiest buckwheat blinis.  At first when I heard buckwheat, I thought to myself, grainy and stiff.  Boy, was I wrong!  The blinis were light and fluffy and accompanied the crème fraîche and caviar perfectly.  We could have eaten 5 dozen of them! <br><br>Our 2nd course was the Caviar salad. It consisted of butter lettuce, shaved egg, shallots, chives, parsley, lemon, dill, crème fraîche and of course dollops of caviar strategically placed all over the salad tower. Not only was it pleasing to the eyes but it was even more pleasing to my palette!!  I never thought caviar on a salad could work so well together!  <br><br>The 3rd course, caviar flatbread and 4th course, Napoléon Tartare came out at the same time and that&#39;s how I like to enjoy my food.  I want everything brought out at the same time so I can have a variety of everything! Let me start by saying the flatbread was like pizza on crack!  It was warm and crispy and went so well with crème fraîche, chives, red onion, capers, chopped eggs and of course more caviar.  I mean, who woulda thunk it?!?! Then I sunk my teeth into the Napoléon tartare, the prime flat iron steak was tender and fresh. The saltiness from the caviar complimented the tartar perfectly. I don&#39;t think beef tartar will ever be the same for me without caviar.<br><br>Then came the pièce de résistance, the panna cotta.  I must say panna cotta is my all-time favorite dessert.  I always look for it on menus but not very many restaurants serve them now a days. The waitress brought out the panna cotta and you can see specks of vanilla beans in it. She then, proceeds to open the little jar of caviar and pours it over the panna cotta.  There were little pearls of espresso mimicking caviar in the jar.  The espresso caviar gave the panna cotta more depth and the slight bitterness balanced out the sweetness.  The panna cotta was a perfect end to a deliciously decadent meal.<br><br>So if you&#39;re a caviar connoisseur or if you&#39;re like me and just love caviar then you have to try Petrossian.  It&#39;s a little pricier if you add caviar to all your dishes but it&#39;s worth it, if you LOVE caviar. #ilovecaviar",

"reviewcomment":"Okay okay, this spot has finally won me over. I&#39;ve been coming here for my morning pick me ups, study breaks, and just when I need a jolt to the system. I&#39;m addicted..I&#39;ve tried a whole bunch of other drinks, including these two faves:<br><br>&#34;Cold and dirty&#34; chai latte: Chai with espresso, though honestly I prefer it hot--making it just dirty ;) You can taste the chai a lot better when it&#39;s heated, and the coffee&#39;s silky, seductive taste really shines through. Iced is good too, but hot really takes the cake.<br><br>Vienna latte: Another fave of mine. Sliiiiight hint of honey and just a touch of cinnamon. I usually make my coffees this way (except I douse it in cinnamon), and it&#39;s a light drink that really makes you appreciate the quality of their espresso.<br><br>Seriously, once you come here, Starbucks and Coffee Bean will never be the same ever again. The drinks are really made to enhance and highlight the quality of the espresso (I swear I get more of a caffeine high with 2 shots here than anywhere else), not mask or cover the flavor with excess sugar and syrups.<br><br>The baristas are also great and actually take pride in their work; not only do the baristas help me out and offer great suggestions, but I had a barista make a drink not to his own liking, show my friend the result, and offered to remake with some suggestions (using almond instead of soy). How sweet! <br><br>I&#39;m still not huge on having to study on a teensy counter if I need to use an outlet, but I can&#39;t deny the amazing coffee nor can I emphasize how intelligent and amazing the baristas are. Seriously...trust their judgement and you really can&#39;t go wrong.<br><br>Coffee has now become my drug...THANK  YOU, DE CAFE BARISTAS!",

"reviewcomment":"My bf and his friend kept talking about this particular taco truck which they came back for twice in a day. My bf is Hispanic, so I&#39;ve been begging him to take me to a legit taco truck for ages but he never did, instead opting for some sit-down food instead. And he knows his tacos and burritos! On some random hungover afternoon, we decided to go with his friend. <br><br>What the hell, this was my first time to ever try a &#34;roach coach&#34; and I was slightly skeptical about it. I wondered if I was going to get some sort of food poisoning or whatever - the moment I got there, there were these kids taking photos under the &#34;C&#34; health grade while eating the tacos. But my friend assured me that hipsters line up in this place so it&#39;s pretty much got safety approval.<br><br>Asada Burrito = bomb! Wow, I think we got like 6 tacos and 2 burritos and everything cost less than $20. The burrito was so rich with flavor, and it wasn&#39;t insanely overwhelming at all like most places are. I&#39;d love to try the lengua next.<br><br>Also, the variety of customers... Within 5 minutes I saw possibly 6 different types of stereotypes come and order from the truck. Can&#39;t say tacos and burritos from a &#34;roach coach&#34; are for certain types of people... this truck is for everyone. <br><br>If taco trucks are THIS good, I&#39;m never going to paying more than $5 for a taco/burrito meal!",

Since you don&#39;t have to cook your own meat here you can walk away smelling BBQ free :). Eat here, it&#39;s rad. <br><br>Bring cash for valet! Street Parkin is ridic!",

I seriously have not stopped talking about my visit last week, a huge shout out to the chef for the amazing pizza crust. <br>I went with a large group, and we all left so stuffed and impressed the server was amazingly sweet and very attentive. (I can&#39;t remember her name but she had a broken wrist). In addition to the food itself, we were impressed by the drinks. The cocktails were flavorful and unique, I can&#39;t say enough about them. <br>Amazing and will totally be returning",

"reviewcomment":"Came here on a Friday night for dinner and ended up having a blast. We came with a party of eight and we honestly ordered half off the menu. <br><br>We ordered: a Gigantic Bavarian Pretzel (a MUST! Everyone loved the mustard it came with, but it was equally delicious plain), Calamari (perfect ratio of calamari to breading,  Bread and Potato Dumplings (I have to give the bread dumplings the edge here), Wurstplate (pretty big portion, definitely something to share with the table) roasted pork shank for 2 (makes a good appetizer for a large party. The skin was crispy and not too salty, reminded me a bit of roasted duck for some reason). I ordered the Chicken Vesuvio for my entree, it&#39;s chicken breast in a garlic/white wine sauce and comes with potatoes, spinach, red cabbage, and a few brussel sprouts and slices of carrots. <br><br>Dessert: fresh baked cookies (the meringue and truffle were SO good), I also got the sorbet sampler. It came with sour cream sorbet, which I was hesitant to eat, but it was surprisingly yummy. Highly recommended. <br><br>The vibe here is casual, friendly, and the food is delicious. Plus, it got a thumbs up from my German friend. The chef came out to talk to our table, made some recommendations, and then went to the front to sing a few songs with the guy playing keyboard/accordion.  It was so cute I found myself swaying along (and I swear I was sober). Come here with the friends you feel comfortable to stuff your face around, you&#39;ll want to eat without judgment when you&#39;re shoveling that yummy food down, trust me. <br><br>Note: This restaurant has valet--it&#39;s located in a small alley between the restaurant and the business next to it. You&#39;ll see a small sign with &#34;STOP&#34; symbol on it, that&#39;s for the valet.",

"reviewcomment":"Given the current state of affairs in Jamaica in regards to the rights of homosexuals, and the high level of stigma in Jamaican culture towards gays and lesbians, an educated gay social worker would naturally be mindful in an environment where four seemingly recent Jamaican transplants to LA are speaking in thick patois. Despite my internal nervousness, which was based on my own countertransference, service here is quaint and I believe the men take pride in the food they serve. The environment is seedy to those who might not have grown up in the hood, but for me, this was home. My bf, on the other hand, was a bit nervous.<br><br>I wanted jerk chicken, and the bf wanted oxtail. I also wanted patties. OMG patties. I also craved a bottle of Ting. I wanted it all to go.<br><br>I got everything I wanted. As the food came out, a gentleman opened the containers and showed us the presentation of what I can only describe as the most obscene food porn. It looked so amazing that I immediately felt like I should be slut shamed. When we got home and opened our boxes, the magic continued. Let me tell you: The food is phenomenal.<br><br>You can taste the scotch bonnet peppers in the jerk chicken sauce, and the chicken was smoked beautifully. The vegetables served on the side were also smoky and well seasoned - - also cooked perfectly. The rice was fragrant with coconut, and each element of the plate just complemented the others. I also tried my bf&#39;s oxtail, and it fell off the bone. The gravy was made perfectly... I seriously can&#39;t stop raving about how amazing our dinner was.<br><br>Their beef patties, btw, are exquisite.<br><br>Someone in this restaurant takes exceptional pride in preparation and presentation, and I HIGHLY recommend this restaurant to anyone that appreciates such craftsmanship. <br><br>I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve had better Caribbean food. I can&#39;t wait to go back and bring my friend from NYC that has been stuck out here for two years without the magic of the Caribbean. I&#39;ll be a good friend by reminding her to bring a change of panties.",

I&#39;ve been to at least 15 different Thai restaurants, and this one is something special. I came with 3 other people and we ordered: <br><br>#1 (hoy kha) medium spicy: their medium is definitely more like extra spicy. But it&#39;s not the burn your tongue off so you can&#39;t taste anything else spicy.. The broth was extremely delicious ! <br><br>#2 (Boat noodles) mild: perfect amount of kick. Delicious broth, noodles were perfect (we got egg noodles for all of our noodle dishes) <br><br>Duck noodle soup: best I&#39;ve ever had. Most duck noodle soups are too sweet for my taste, but this one was perfect ! <br><br>Crispy pork with Chinese broccoli: pretty good ! <br><br>We also got some kind of sausage appetizer that comes with cabbage  to wrap it in, and fresh garlic, ginger, and some kind of spicy pepper. Very flavorful and good to eat as a side ! <br><br>The Thai tea was delicious as well (of course) <br><br>One other thing I love about this place is that you can order a small sized bowl of noodles for only 3.95 versus a large bowl. This is a great option if you&#39;re not super hungry or if you want to order more than one thing so you can have a variety!",

I thought was ok.  <br><br>Like all taco trucks, the food is generally hard to judge by from the outside.  But one thing for sure, when you see that juicy chunk of pork butt on the burner right outside, you can begin to imagine how youre going to sink your teeth into a bite that plays over and over again until this alone can bring your cravings to a satisfaction.  The dude thats carving the pork must be totally feeling it because he is doing an awesome job making sure each taco is nicely packed with evenly cut meat.  If by chance you had 3 you&#39;ll come back for 6.<br><br>There are just too many good tacos in LA.  I hope that this place will be one of the longstanding ones.",

The place faces Wilshire across from the school and not next to the Crab Cooker where all the people are.<br><br>Now about the food. When I went in there were only 2 customers there but I can see that they have a printer off to the side of the cash register and I can see web orders being printed. I should do that next time so I don&#39;t have to wait for them to cook it. I decided to go with the half &amp; half (provolone &amp; wiz) just to get a taste. I loved both. The whiz was obviously messier and more cheesy. Since it was my cheat meal I also went for the cupcakes. They were good but very very very very sweet. Did I mention very? Most of the items are under $10 but I added the cupcakes so the total with tax was about $13.<br><br>Will definitely go back for more. It is 0.6 miles from my house (per Google Maps) so next time I will walk there. Parking was a bit of a pain in the you know Friday night. I think it is because of the Crab Cooker.",

"reviewcomment":"AMAZZZZZING food with AMAZZZZZZZING service. I brought my parents here for my dads birthday dinner. My dad and I being big Mediterranean food lovers. He said this was one of the best he&#39;s had. Their meats are sooo juicy, tender and full of flavor. <br><br>We shared family style 2 entrees, beef soltani kabob and the chicken soltani kabob. These are good if you want  variety since each soltani comes with 2 different skewers. Also shared between 3, the hummus, yogurt with moussier and shirazi (this is not printed on the menu). <br><br>2 entrees 3 sides perfect for 3 people with leftovers or feeds 4 people comfortably. <br><br>I LOVE the service here as well. The waiters are very sweet and very accommodating.You never have to ask for things twice and they know what you want before you utter the words out of your mouth!",

"reviewcomment":"Scoutmob deal got me 50% off. I think this will be my new favorite spot!!<br><br>I got the meal deal with half a salami sandwich and half a cobb salad. The type of salami they used wasn&#39;t quite what I was expecting but it was still good. I loved the cobb salad and it was a great portion. The mango smoothie I got was just ice, oj, and mango juice but I really can&#39;t complain since it only cost me $1.50! <br><br>What i find amazing about this place isn&#39;t just  the fact that they donate the proceeds to charity but rather than it&#39;s a &#34;teach a man to fish&#34; place. The workers at The Village Kitchen were homeless women who are learning job skills through working there.",

"reviewcomment":"Love this place.  Good food at a really great price.  Mostly sandwiches, breakfast, and Mexican food, but check out their daily specials where they&#39;ll throw in a few curveballs (chicken curry with rice, spaghetti, etc.).  Custom orders are no problem either.  Highlights from the menu include the chicken pesto sandwich, breakfast burrito, and the torta.  My only complaint is that they don&#39;t have fries.  I&#39;m almost tempted to buy them a fryer to rectify this issue.<br><br>The people who own and run this place are warm, kind people.  Help out a small business!",
