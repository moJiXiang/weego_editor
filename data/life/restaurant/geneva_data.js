"reviewcomment":"This is definitely one of the best burgers in town ! You can feel the ingredients are fresh and everything is very well made! The service is also good. It&#39;s hard to get a spot and I prefer the other address by the university UNIMAIL over to this one in Eaux-Vives. However, the other address is not recommended for big groups unless reserving in advance. The Inglewood in Eaux-Vives is bigger and more family kind of place. The one in Pont D&#39;arve is more student and young professionals spot. Burgers are the same and amazing. I love trying the burger of the month, they are usually GREAT! Desserts are surprisingly good too!<br>AHHH there&#39;s a VEGGIE option too!",

"reviewcomment":"My favorite restaurant of all time! The entrecote is cooked perfectly and the combination of the secret green sauce and thin cut fries is to die for! Its pricey at 42 Francs, then again maybe not...this is Geneva after all. The desserts are all very good as well! I go here during Geneva Motor Show press days and at 7pm (time it opens for dinner) there is usually a line of 25 people or more that cant wait to get into this awesome place. The atmosphere is very non-Geneva and feels more like a restaurant in Paris. The staff isnt unfriendly, they are busy and on their feet alllll night long! <br><br>A must if you are ever in Geneva!!!!!",

"reviewcomment":"This is definitely the sweetheart place for the people in Geneva! It&#39;s a place that it&#39;s the same since more than a hundred years ago! It&#39;s NOT AT ALL fancy and you might find it weird at first, but the views are amazing and there are things to do in summer and winter. Summer there is usually live music at every sunrise and hot drinks are free until 6h30am, and believe me, the sunrises are AMAZING THERE and it&#39;s usually full! On winter there is the famous fondue and sauna/hamman that everyone loves.  Food there is GREAT, the prices are one of the best of Geneva for what you get meaning HIGH QUALITY FOOD AND INGREDIENTS. They only work with local products and their menu changes according to the season, plus they have a local certificate that assures that you eat well balanced at every meal there (okay, except fondue I guess haha). It&#39;s a place I love having lunch. If you are visiting Geneva, you MUST make a stop there. I&#39;m not a big fan of their fondue, I rather prefer eating other things there, but if you wanna go for fondue please make a reservation. For the day they don&#39;t take reservations and you don&#39;t need it. They also have a great Christmas lunch that is part of my tradition now. They accept CASH ONLY. To enter in Bains-des-Pâquis during summer you gotta pay CHF 2, but it&#39;s fair as they provide a lot of infrastructure for people to swim, etc. There&#39;s free internet from the city of Geneva that works there. Their only down side is that they close early.",

"reviewcomment":"I came here for dinner my first day in Geneva.  Since prices for food everywhere around here hurt the wallet, I opted for a mixed salad with a single portion of raclette.    Still overpriced, but slightly less pricy than the 25 franc/per person fondue for two. <br><br>The salad was good and has a simple thin tangy dressing with carrot, tomato, cucumber and lettuce.  The raclette was even better...a small plate of thick melted cheese served with small pickled onions, cornichons and a big basket of hot fingerling potatoes.  An unusual combination, but delicious nonetheless.<br><br>My husband had a smoked duck salad with bits of orange and gruyere.  The duck was sparse but he still enjoyed it.  But 21 francs?  Eek.  Apparently I&#39;m still not over the price shock here.  <br><br>Anyway, service was great, very nice.  Our server spoke decent English too, so that was great.  He seated us in the front area of the restaurant where they seemed to seat all English speakers.  <br><br>Another note, if you&#39;re looking for wine by the glass, ask for their wine list, because it&#39;s tucked away towards the back of the book.  I had a nice glass of a Johanneisburg white that wasn&#39;t too pricey.  All in all I&#39;d say I&#39;d come back because I do still want to try their fondue!",

I actually couldn&#39;t believe I hadn&#39;t updated my review to 5 stars awhile ago.  I have never had a wrong note with you.  I just can&#39;t believe I didn&#39;t know about your set menu lunch deals!  I always enjoyed the 19 CHF plat du jour of the day, but I didn&#39;t know you also had a lunch set menu for those with a larger appetite.   For only 35CHF you provided me with a delicious appetiser, main dish, and dessert.  My stomach was happily full for the remainder of the day.  <br><br>TIP: Other people also love Esquisse at lunch, so definitely be sure to make a reservation in advance.  They have a little outdoor seating area on nice days that you can enjoy.",

"reviewcomment":"Had lunch here last Thurs curtesy of a BDO, Squeezyjet discounted price and a need for lunch.<br><br> An easy enough walk from the centre of town (look for the free bus tickets to anywhere in Geneva just before end of airside at the airport (routes 5,10). Walk along the lakeside and you get to the entrance to public Parc des Eaux Vives with the &#39;Chateaux&#39; visible from the main gate, walk up the right hand path rto the entrance at rear.<br><br> Go upstairs to the main dining room, very grand without being overly ornate, with good spacing between tables, all overlooking the garden &amp; lake. The Matre d&#39; and Somellier greeted us and sat us at table. A selection of very pretty amuse bouche were brought immediately while we got to grips with the wine list &amp; menu.<br><br> Both were adequately(!!) expensive (Michelin 2*) with perhaps some overpricing on the wines as some had a very fierce mark-up, though there were no duds and some very well chosen wines are available. Local wines are also represented, both the Geneva area and Switzerland.<br><br> After a little debate, and since it had been a 4:30 am awakening, we all decided to go for the Chef&#39;s surprise menu, Sfr 175 where upon we were asked if there was anything we did not like so they could manage the choices, which indeed were all to be a surprise even to the Maitre d&#39;.<br><br> Two wines by the glass were on offer, and we chose the Inneskillin 1998 Chardonnay, which had a lovely fresh nose but considerable complex ageing on the palate. An old Canadian wine! I asked the Somellier to recommend a local wine to follow, and he chose an unusual wine, Grand Cour 2007 Kerner u Savignon from the Geneva region. This was rather good, the unusual grape selection working well in the glass providing a really refreshing drop that had a full flavour throught the length of the palate without perhaps adding up to a grand wine. Sfr28 &amp; 110. as only 2 of us were drinking we did not get much further into the wine list.<br><br> We were presented with: -<br>Brittany blue coast Lobster, avocado, tapioca ;<br>Bigouden Scampi on watermelon, black rice cucumber, baby squid w. saffron ;<br>John Dory de petits bateaux zucchinni condiment olives stuffed baby squid ;<br>Simmental Beef grilled &#39;noix&#39; of entrecote, Bearnaise foam in a crust shallots &amp; Balsamic;<br><br> A really good selection of cheeses chosen individually from the trolly, all in super condition;<br><br> 3 different puds, one each, of Ravioles of Cherry, Raspberries w. Jivara chocolste &amp; sorbet &#39;lollipop&#39;, Apricots &amp; peaches w. chocolate tofu verbena chantilly;<br><br> Petite Fours<br><br> All the dishes were visually stunning as well as superbly flavoured, and dotted with the odd drops of balsamic on olive oil and tracks cross the plate - we tried to joke with the Maitre d&#39; that they had just come fresh from the LHC but rather failed to get the joke across.<br><br> We then asked for a dessert wine, and the Somelier suggested Munchberg 2004 Riesling 2004 Vend. Tardives which we pursuaded him to sell by the glass rather than the bottle. Very Alsace, Very Munchberg, very nice indeed.<br><br> At this stage we decided to leave the bleeding wallets (Sfr 740 for 3) and go to a watch museum. But of course this was closed (a bank holiday in Geneva it transpired, though people we talked to found it was a surprise to them too!).<br><br> So we ambled off and snoozed around the old town till it was time to go home without spending anything more than the Sfr 3 each to get to the airport on the bus. Not that I want something as big as a WW1 tank on my wrist anyway.<br><br> An excellent place that lives up to its prospect.",

"reviewcomment":"Ok now that&#39;s a real five stars and here goes the story. I went there twice, first time since it had great reviews and I was on my own on a business trip to Geneva. It feels kind of weird when eat in a restaurant on your own for the first time by the way... And secondly, the next day with my manager.<br><br>I arrived here in the evening and I was the first here (it was about 19h45 if I&#39;m not mistaken). The waiter asked me if I was looking for something to which I answered &#34;Well, this restaurant&#34;.  Despite the fact that I felt completely out of place due to my casual attire instead of the &#34;Formal&#34; that would be expected in such place, I was most welcome. They told me that it would be preferable to sit outside because a group of 20 people or so was coming. No problem, of course.<br><br>I took a random table close to the wall and I was given a small pesto ramekin along with bread. Then I ordered a &#34;Sea bass and lime tartare, Mediterranean pisté of courgettes&#34; (32, - CHF) along with a glass of wine (9, - CHF). In order for me to wait they gave another appetizer which, if I&#39;m not mistaken was a courgette cream with fromage blanc (same size as the pesto). The wine was a red wine from Geneva (Pinot Noir), pretty good.<br><br>Then the group of people arrived and they took an adjacent table first (that wasn&#39;t planned like that it seems). So the waiter asked me to move, I gladly obliged but they told me not to move my dishes myself (bad student habits, you know...). So I moved to another table very close and I quite felt out of place as in the group of people everyone was well dressed... Well, but anyway, I had no negative comment from them just a &#34;Bon appétit&#34; and a strange look at the candies (spoiler, see below). <br><br>Then the main course arrived, bass tartare, along with a fresh salad. That might not be that much, but to me that&#39;s more than enough. Both the salad and the tartare were excellent. They asked me if I wanted another glass of wine after I emptied the first one, but I declined (well, I&#39;m not an alcoholic, or I&#39;d like to think I&#39;m not at least). However they gave me another one for free because I was requested to move.<br><br>I moved on to the &#34;coffee&#34; question as I finished my main course, I don&#39;t drink coffee so I took a black tea instead. Then they brought a shitload of candies (see picture), one waiter which talked to me for some time since I was alone made about candies luring young ladies (I must say there was a very good looking one amongst the people). Regardless, they also offered me a limoncello. The table felt slightly awkward with tea, candies, wine and limoncello, but, what can I say ? It&#39;s free.<br><br>As I said, the situation was maybe because I was alone, there was this group of people, I talked to the server and all, that&#39;s why I got all this stuff (not the candies, that&#39;s standard). I finally asked for the bill, and it was only 42, - CHF... I left 8 CHF as tip (the least I could do). <br><br>As a side note, a vagrant come by and was gently asked to go somewhere else (I didn&#39;t exactly looked at the event, but, that&#39;s better than other restaurant I&#39;ve seen so far).<br><br>I returned the next day with my manager. This time adequately dressed and I got the classic observation &#34;Ah, now that&#39;s better&#34;... Right, this time I took the dish of the day (24, - CHF) which was a Greek salad with prawn. Simply amazing to me. I tried their white wine as well though I forgot which one (I believe I tried something local too). Really nice as well. This time I tried a dessert &#34;Speculoos mousse&#34; for 9, - CHF. Pretty tasty but heavy however. I noticed that people taking coffee had jars of candies as I had had the evening before. Can&#39;t tell about the price of the bill this time, my manager paid it.<br><br>Beside that the decoration is classy and the terrace, despite located close to the road, is really nice too. I tried both, the terrace in the evening and the interior during midday since the weather wasn&#39;t really clement. The location is also very convenient since it&#39;s close to a lot of bank, however not close to the rise or lake, unfortunately...<br><br>The bottom line ? Top-notch for business or small events IMHO. Go for it.",

"reviewcomment":"I&#39;ve seen numerous mentions of the authenticity of Sam-Lor (the Thai word for bicycle), as close to a &#34;hole in the wall&#34; restaurant as one gets in generally-posh Geneva.   Using my measure of authenticity (read: the best places I have been in Thai enclaves in the U.S. where I am also a distinct ethnic minority among the patrons), this place rates an &#34;A+&#34;.  <br><br>It was also clear from the demeanor of the restaurant staff that they wanted you to feel as happy and peaceful as possible, notwithstanding their continually frenetic shuffling from table to table balancing dishes and drinks.  There&#39;s no question that the gentleness and warmth of my server added greatly to my enjoyment of the experience.<br><br>I played it safe by ordering two of my regular favorites:  Panang Chicken and Yum Woon Sen (glass noodle salad with prawn).  In each case, Sam-Lor look the taste experience to a whole new level.  The familiar ingredients burst with deep and redolent flavor, but I am convinced that it was the cooks&#39; tossing in more than a few subtle, undefinable sprinkles of magic that made it all come together so perfectly.  Looking around the restaurant, I can safely say that most everyone was living their own version of my story.  <br><br>It is worth noting the rugged, marginally unsavory vibe in the surrounding Paquis neighborhood.  Though it&#39;s bustling with tourists and crawling with foodies looking for a fix in one of the area&#39;s well-regarded ethnic hot-spots, I wouldn&#39;t feel comfortable with the idea of my girlfriend venturing there unaccompanied after dark.",

They have a beautiful Thai garden/terrace that I meant to visit over the summer but never found the time (small streams, rock gardens, covered bungalow style tables..). Inside the restaurant you will not be disappointed either, as the decor is traditional but not too cheesy. They also have traditional Thai dancers and music that adds to the charm.<br><br>The food is very good and not too expensive (25-40fr for mains if I remember right). I had the mixed tempura plate for starter that was great and we shared an assortment of curries which was also delicious... The dessert selection is pretty classic and uninspiring in my opinion - of course including the classic fried banana.<br><br>Important note: Cash only - no credit/debit cards accepted",

Please be aware if you want fries with your mussels you gotta pay separately and you must order it, unlike other restaurants where fries are always a side dish for mussels. I like going there when I feel like needing comfort food in a comfortable place.<br>Their terrace both in summer and also in winter (they have heaters) is lovely and cozy, I usually prefer staying on the terrace as it&#39;s less busy than inside and tables aren&#39;t so close to each other.",

Once the tough choice of food is out of the way, you can then move on to chosing what to have from the ever changing menu. It&#39;s great, not once I have been has the menu been the same. Small, well priced for the quality... there is nothing to fault with this place.<br><br>The food takes a while to prep, but thats is because it is all fresh ingredients and cooked in a &#39;home cooked style&#39;. the service is always with a smile and the atmosphere is very french/swiss french.

"reviewcomment":"I totally love this bar! It&#39;s a perfect place to meet friends and have a nice conversation. Service is always good even though I already heard people complaining, but guess I was always lucky and had great waitresses serving my table. The price is also very good for Geneva and they have food as well which is great if you are at a bar and hungry, portions aren&#39;t big but price is also small, food and tapas are tasty and I usually go there hungry on purpose. It&#39;s highly recommended to reserve if you want to go from Thursday to Sunday, it can be crowded after 20hrs. But in the afternoon it&#39;s quite calm and like a cafe style. They also have a comfortable couch area.",

"reviewcomment":"My review is for the afternoon tea that is served at Windows.  During the week the tea is from 3-6pm, and on weekends starting at noon.  Be sure to book in advance as this place can get busy.  <br><br>The atmosphere at Windows is perfection. The floor to ceiling windows over looking the Jet D&#39;eau automatically bring a brightness and romance to the spot, even on an overcast day.  The interior is cosy and inviting.<br><br>The afternoon tea is 43 CHF per person, and includes your choice of tea, five finger sandwiches, scones w/ double Gruyere creme and heated homemade jam, and a variety of bite sized scrumptious sweets.  This is definitely not a light meal, thankfully I did not have any lunch beforehand, and I didn&#39;t eat much for dinner that evening.  I was stuffed.  You could easily share the one tea between two people.  It is served on a beautiful multi tiered silver tray.  The tea menu is quite large, and there are many interesting selections to choose from.   <br><br>The tea was amazing, and the food was scrumptious.  The scones come out fresh from the oven.  They were the best scones I have had!  I would come back just for a pot of tea and their menu option of a plate of 3 scones served with the creme and  jam.  They were by far the highlight of the entire selection.<br><br>The service was OK.  However, our waitress at the end had ended her shift, and we never seemed to get anyone else after that, so it took a bit to flag someone down at the end.  <br><br>I am glad that I had dressed nicely, as everyone in the restaurant was wearing business suits.  I would have definitely felt out of place in jeans and a t-shirt.",

"reviewcomment":"I cannot thank Cat K enough for being the first to review this place, otherwise I would never have known about it. I have been searching for authentic Greek food around Vaud for awhile now, and so happy to finally have found something!  And not just something that is OK, this is the best Gyro I have had outside of Greece.  I was even more excited to see that next door, owned by the same people, is a fancier sit down Greek restaurant serving some main Greek dishes.  I have quickly bookmarked that to try next.  Souvlaki Fan is a simple self service cafe, and they also deliver.  You enter and you order your food, sit down and it is brought to you, and then you clean up your own space.  They have pork, fish, veggie, chicken, or lamb Souvlaki.  Most of the meat options come in traditional, fondue, or spicy style.  They also have larger dinner plate options, salads, pasta, or crepes.  Definitely something for everyone.  I ordered the lamb Souvlaki and was EXTREMELY excited to see it is served the authentic Greek way with the fries inside the pita.  Well done.  I was also excited to see they have Nescafe Frappe on the menu, and it was perfect.  While I was eating I closed my eyes and with the Greek music playing, and the owners speaking in Greek, I could slightly imagine myself back in Greece.  The service was very friendly, they even gave a bit of meat to my puppy that was with me.  I was even able to practise my rusty Greek with them!!!  <br><br>Tip: They have a fidelity card on the back of their menu&#39;s, after your 10th Souvlaki you get the 11th one free.",

The main course was then cod cooked on a leak bed, with braised endives, and a pumpkin puree.<br><br>The gran finale was a bomb. A surprising half sphere of chocolate, which dissolved after pouring warm chocolate sauce on top of it.

It has all the typical genevois items on the menu however, I must say the rosti is the best I have ever tasted. ...potatoes shredded ever so finely and perfectly, fried up in butter to a crispy perfect brown edge, mixed with onion, creme and topped with cheese, ham and egg. It was the best hands down. I enjoyed every last bite. The atmosphere was cozy, casual and not too noisy. The waitress spoke English as well, and the beer was tasty.

"reviewcomment":"Pauly&#39;s is located in a fantastic historical building that was previously occupied by a cafe that I visited once (good food - but too pricey for lunch).  I had been sad to hear the old place had closed as I really loved the ambiance of the space and had meant to go back to eat there.  After reading John G&#39;s review I didn&#39;t realise that Pauly&#39;s was in the same space - huge bonus!  This place has only been open since September, and they are still working things out. For example, the menu is ever changing, and they are in the process of obtaining a credit card machine - so be sure to bring cash in the short term.  The owners were extremely friendly, and spoke English!  They even had a good Swiss wine selection - reds from Dardagny - cool!  <br><br>My friend and I ordered different beef burgers.  They come medium rare- no pink (unless you ask differently).  Salad and fries are included in the price. The burgers come either junior or large size.  They rave about their milkshakes, but if you are from the US don&#39;t get too excited, these are Swiss style milkshakes which typically are warm and taste like milk with some flavouring.  However, this was the best Swiss style milkshake I have had.  It is actually cold and was well flavoured. My friend from France agreed with me that this was the typical European style milkshake, but that it was very tasty.<br><br>I found that overall my experience here was comparable to Inglewood.  The salad was better here, the fries equivalent, and the burger tasty. However, the bun is better at Inglewood.  Prices about the same as well.  There is more seating for larger groups here than at Inglewood, and they also have steaks and mixed drinks.  I also loved that they have a  foos ball table and free wifi.  <br><br>I took some pics of the current menu as the website doesn&#39;t have it.  You can even order to take away if you need to. <br><br>Warning: the website requires quicktime and is a bit overwhelming - as if pac man and mario took speed.",

"reviewcomment":"This is the second time I have eaten lunch at La Plancha.  The first time was during the summer when the weather was warm, and they offered a nice outdoor seating area under a canopy.  This time, was my first time inside.  Inside, the restaurant area is small, and has a modern, trendy vibe.  The menu&#39;s are an interesting mix of coat hanger meets glass.  The food both times was good, but didn&#39;t pass the price to quality test that I have in Switzerland.  It&#39;s a given, eating out in Switzerland is pricier than most are used to, but, is the food worthy of the price?  This place didn&#39;t pass that test.  The first time I was here, I saw everyone ordering the burger.  It looked amazing, but I couldn&#39;t bring myself to pay over 30 francs for a burger.  This time, I gave in, and had high hopes, since the presentation of the food on the plate is fantastic.  But, I am not paying for food art, in the end, our taste buds and stomachs have the final vote.  So what was the final word from the senses?<br><br>Smell - Yummy<br><br>Eyes -  Patiently watched everyone else get their beautifully presented plates of food, and waited for a bit too long to finally see the delicious cheesy burger delivered to them.<br><br>Taste-  Disappointed after all the build up, but the meat was good, and the fries had looked crunchy, but were a tad to soggy.<br><br>Ears - noise level OK at first, but in the midst of the meal they turned on some annoying loud dance club music, which did not encourage my friends and I to stay for an espresso that we had been thinking about ordering.<br><br>Touch - Didn&#39;t like the feel of passing 37 CHF away to the server for only 1 burger and a bottle of coke light.",

"reviewcomment":"I went there three times though my stay in Geneva, but I tried the &#34;real&#34; restaurant only once at midday for a leaving do. So I&#39;ll start my review with that part.<br><br>I was there with a group of colleague on a Wednesday midday and we had a reservation for eight people, which led us to be seated quite quickly. The menu was a simple sheet of paper (quite strange; but it might change quite often ?).<br><br>Most of us order a tartare (I did not take an additional photo since someone already did a cool one). The price was fairly acceptable to me 17, - CHF. I&#39;m accustomed to Zurich Standards and once again my point of view might be slightly biased. Other people took some sort of quiche for a slightly lower price and were given a mixed salad as a starter.<br><br>We did not wait that long to be served, and the tartare was definitely big enough. It is served with french fries and small piece of white bread. Everything was tasty, couldn&#39;t finish the french fries (I&#39;m not a fan of those anyway, even when they are good).<br>Being a business day we stuck water and shared the bottle among the bills. <br><br>That was my review of the interior on midday (and a rainy one at that), onward to the second option you can have during sunny days : there is an open air bar/restaurant where you can get DYI burgers (midday and evening). You basically order your burger at the counter and you tell the chef the cooking time you desire for the steak, he then gives you the buds and you can fit whatever you want in the burger which include classics like salad, tomato, onion, but also some nifty sauces. You also get some tortilla chips with that. Burger (if I&#39;m not mistaken) cost 14,5 CHF and you can get a beer for around 7,0 CHF as stated by another Yelper, still really reasonable to me.<br><br>They can&#39;t, however give you a bill stating you have given any tip or just that you took a meal. Thus, making it possibly more difficult to get refunded by you expense team (should you have to).<br><br>Quite a good place to go, worth a try !",

And they apperently want to keep this a bit, as they neither have a telephone number nor a website.<br><br> They do not offer high-class serivce, but a warm and comfortable atmosphere. And the food is just fantastic! For an incredibly good price. Additionally all their incredients are always superfresh as they apparently own a vietnamese supermarket on the other side of the street..<br><br> Go there, see for yourself and enjoy.",

The place is lovely and tables are incredibly small, some people could be annoyed by that but for me it increases it charm and you are almost by the table of the neighbor, I guess it&#39;s part of the experience. The staff is very friendly and helpful. It&#39;s not an intimate place but it can definitely be romantic and it&#39;s lovely during winter time with a cozy feeling.",

For me the prices here are decent (Swiss-wise) but then you can&#39;t expect something incredible out of chain restaurant, can you ?<br><br>That being they have a large range of Sushi and I believe each box of sushi will cost you a little less than 30 CHF (well, to take out, which I did the two times I was there). And if you go there for lunch you will get two small side dishes with it (you can choose from small salad and miso soup). The place itself is small but I believe you can sit there if really want to. Furniture are OK, more into a modern design.<br><br>The thing that kind of bothered me is the fact that some food origin is China. Maybe I should not bother too much with that but I just like to go local whenever I can (yeah, OK, Swiss ginger may not be very common). Worth a shot if you want some quick food sushi, still better than most fast food.",

"reviewcomment":"I would highly, highly recommend this restaurant to any one in Geneva looking for an authentic fondue experience.  Many restaurants in Geneva are tourist joints -- and the fondue at those places, in general, is made from a lesser quality cheese. Here, it is a rich, delicious, creamy fondue -- served with a huge bowl of cornichon and dried beef, and gorgeously crusty bread for dipping. The house white was a crisp and refreshing counterpoint to the fondue -- and the best dessert -- a pear sorbet drizzled with liqueur. <br><br>It was delicious and the service was very attentive. The location could be a little better -- if you sit outside you face the street and a park, but all in all, I couldn&#39;t recommend this place more!!!",

"reviewcomment":"A wonderful place and sight for sore eyes (or bellies) seeking some pure, simple but healthy and local food in Geneva, Switzerland. Don&#39;t know why it is so hard, but other than falafel places, which really don&#39;t quite fit the bill,. this can be hard to find. While one can find wonderful but generally somewhat heavy French or Swiss cuisine, fondue etc., and some good but often expensive though not great Italian food, and a few passable Thai and Indian restaurants, despite multiple visits over years it has been difficult to find farm to table type healthy food that is pure, simple and reasonably priced. And that is a shame given the wonderful quality of Swiss agriculture and the proximity of farms to cities.<br><br>Well, Les mangeurs comes through. A small selection of fresh simple home cooked farm to table food, nice bread and soup, local wines, nice desserts and all very reasonably priced. Also a small selection of lovely groceries, like mushroom pasta from France. Delightful co-owners who do it all. One catch, mostly a lunch place, though open till 8 PM. I had a lovely vegetarian soup, bread and green salad that were just what was needed. The place is simple, unassuming with just a few tables, but honest, healthy, delicious and a welcome find!

"reviewcomment":"This place was so good, when I saw that it did not have it&#39;s own proper Yelp page, I took it upon myself to make one. Let me preface that this action had absolutely  nothing to do with the fact one of the waiters always showered me in compliments on my visits, telling it was like sunshine each time I stepped in the restaurant. Not at all related to my severe Geneva withdraws. And it definitely has nothing to do with the extra stamps he gave on my little stamp card. Nope, not one bit. That being said anyone who has spent a day in Geneva or any other Swiss city for that matter knows how ridiculously expensive everything is. My dinners at the Cite Universite consisted of pasta with copious amounts of wine to numb the hunger pains. So one day after class at the Uni Mail campus, I decided to some exploring. Coming from Glendale I was so craving the Middle Eastern food I had at home. I had heard that kebobs here was like the Mexican food of So.Cal. This meaning it was relatively inexpensive. So it was decided that I wouldn&#39;t waste my time looking at the menu&#39;s of the fancy smancy   bistros that dominate Geneva and look for a kebob place. I found Ephese pretty fast at it was quite close to campus. I sat down and a lovely older lady took my order, being ever patient of my awful, broken French. I ordered the sandwich du poulet avec l&#39;eau, s&#39;il vous plait.  When my food came I was a starvin marvin and gulfed it down in no time. It was delicious. Time has erased most of my memory of what in there but I recall chunks of onion, lettuce, and shawarma style chicken. The red and white sauce on the side, so you can douse it to your liking. This was not an option at other kebob stands, and many of my study abroad peers found their kebobs much to spicy to eat. When I was done the older lady brought me a Turkish dessert... baklava I believe as well as the check. My delicious meal, my drink, and dessert all came up to a whopping $10 francs. I spent almost that (sometimes more)for one drink at the Fetes! I knew I came back the next week and it was then when I met my admirer. He was a young blonde guy and when he saw me struggling in  French, he asked if spoke Portuguese or Spanish. When i told he Spanish he talked to me in an Espanol that rivaled my own. He was very nice and attentive and very interested in my life as a study abroad student and just my life in general. When I came back the next time he remembered me and gave me extra stamps on my card. I didn&#39;t have the heart to tell I wouldn&#39;t be staying long enough to get to the free sandwich though...",

You get a sandwich for average CHF8 and this is a reasonable price in Geneva for a very good sandwich and almost same price as of a sandwich of McDonalds in Geneva (just the sandwich, because the whole menu in McDonalds is around CHF13). But Edwards have an excellent quality for its price. It&#39;s good when you are really hungry and wish a good sandwich. Their &#34;campagne&#34; bread is delicious and I particularly love the Ham &amp; Cheese sandwich. They warm it up and it&#39;s crunch outside and moist with a lot of taste inside. They have 4 addresses in town and all of them you can sit and have a proper lunch. Even if it&#39;s always full, it&#39;s not super loud and people come and go quickly so you always have a table. They don&#39;t take a reservation, it&#39;s like a local fast food chain. They also close early, like 17h30 on Saturdays and 18hrs on weekdays. Closed on Sundays (like many places in Geneva).",

It was our first time here so I cant judge the whole menu based on what my wife and I ordered this time. The penne my wife ordered tasted good and had a &#34;home made&#34; feel. I cant say I enjoyed the tagliata with truffle oil that much. The dish failed to tickle my taste buds despite having truffle oil.

"reviewcomment":"We went there last Tuesday night for dinner and the place was full - and very lively. The American couple on the table next to us told the chef it was their second consecutive night as the food had been so good the night before - some recommendation. I had a good chat with the chef Maurice who does the rounds after service and he clearly has a passion for what he does and for selecting the best local produce. The service is attentive (if a little overworked) with the sous-chef serving the guests straight from the kitchen. My main course was superb - veal with a type of lentil stew - the flavours were excellent and it made a change from steak frites which remains the speciality of the house. Its a nice place with a history too - photographs on the wall show it much the same in 1945. With quality and service this good its easy to see why you&#39;d need to reserve - even mid week in the credit crunch.",

Its reallz what Geneva is missing, actually Europe in general. No one seems to want to do great varieties of salads and this place is my new favorite place to eat. Its near the Uni Mall area of town near Plainpalais...you must go!!!",

You get a sandwich for average CHF8 and this is a reasonable price in Geneva for a very good sandwich and almost same price as of a sandwich of McDonalds in Geneva (just the sandwich, because the whole menu in McDonalds is around CHF13). But Edwards have an excellent quality for its price. It&#39;s good when you are really hungry and wish a good sandwich. Their &#34;campagne&#34; bread is delicious and I particularly love the Ham &amp; Cheese sandwich. They warm it up and it&#39;s crunch outside and moist with a lot of taste inside. They have 4 addresses in town and all of them you can sit and have a proper lunch. Even if it&#39;s always full, it&#39;s not super loud and people come and go quickly so you always have a table. They don&#39;t take a reservation, it&#39;s like a local fast food chain. They also close early, like 17h30 on Saturdays and 18hrs on weekdays. Closed on Sundays (like many places in Geneva).",

"reviewcomment":"We went there last Tuesday night for dinner and the place was full - and very lively. The American couple on the table next to us told the chef it was their second consecutive night as the food had been so good the night before - some recommendation. I had a good chat with the chef Maurice who does the rounds after service and he clearly has a passion for what he does and for selecting the best local produce. The service is attentive (if a little overworked) with the sous-chef serving the guests straight from the kitchen. My main course was superb - veal with a type of lentil stew - the flavours were excellent and it made a change from steak frites which remains the speciality of the house. Its a nice place with a history too - photographs on the wall show it much the same in 1945. With quality and service this good its easy to see why you&#39;d need to reserve - even mid week in the credit crunch.",

They deserved a 2, but the food was good so I gave an overall three.  I ordered the perch which is a local favorite, fresh from the lake - a plate full of little perch filets in a butter sauce with a side of vegetables and fries, both fresh and delicious.

There is also the possibility to make own crepe: You order crepe with ingredients you want! This is a cool option! Fresh carrot orange juice was tasty too. Their coffee is strong and good. Restaurant interior decoration is nice. I like much daylight getting inside and there are some tables for sitting outside too. Service is very friendly and price corresponds to high quality food but is still below Geneva average! It&#39;s to mention restaurant is crowded over lunchtime and it may be difficult to get a good seat!<br><br>ps: I avoid eating sushi and sashimi not only in Globus but in every restaurant in Europe! It apparently becomes very difficult to get fresh fish! Well! I&#39;d eat sushi and sashimi in Japan because fish has been always fresh!",

"reviewcomment":"Quaint little brunch place just outside of Parc la Grange, this place is Euro-rustic.  The brunch buffet is laid out on the small counter in front of a kitchen no bigger than the one you have at your home.  Two chefs scramble to prepare the spread of quiches, scrambled eggs, salads, and desserts from scratch using a four-burner stove and an single oven two-level oven.  The bowl of broken egg shells sitting by the stove, the pile of dirty dishes waiting for their turn in the dish washer, and the heap of potato peels littering the counter and spilling on to the floor are all on public display, and you know you&#39;re getting a home-cooked meal. <br><br>Nothing is super fancy, and everything is wonderfully homey. The bread station is strewn with a haphazard selection of jams and spreads, but don&#39;t waste your time there.  The quiches are very good and uncomplicated, and made with fresh ingredients.  I particularly liked their ground beef quiche, which tasted a lot like a lasagna.  The salads were fresh and simple, the cheese was plentiful, and the desserts (a brownie pie and apple cobbler) were warm and definitely made from scratch. <br><br>I am generally of the mind that if I saw my food being prepared in most restaurants, I would probably have less of an appetite as I would realize that even the most fanciful of meals are made fairly mechanically and thoughtlessly.  But here, there was something refreshing about two women who were willing to let you watch the hectic process of trying to feed a restaurant full of people on an all-you-can-eat menu. <br><br>As a package, the restaurant itself would be five stars.  But there were some lags where they ran out of food and were unable to replenish fast enough.  This regularly left a group of people awkwardly mulling around the narrow counter.  This is understandable, except that they seemed to want to bring out all the food at once, so even when one quiche was done, it sat behind the counter while the other two baked in the single oven.  This made for an attractive presentation when a new spread was laid out, but considering that the presentation was demolished within minutes, they should probably just opt for efficiency. <br><br>A great deal in Geneva standards at CHF22, although drinks are separate. They do make a mean cappuccino, though.",

I find it very fresh but maybe a little bit too pricey for what it is, but it&#39;s worth it once in a while. I find the vegetables that goes with fish and meat a little bit too plain and without much taste. But I definitely go there when I&#39;m not wishing for a big meal and willing for something fresh. The queue can be long and sometimes it takes quite a bit as you order on the counter.

"reviewcomment":"This is a really good Thai restaurant and although it is in the city centre, quite near the Globus department store, it&#39;s not a super-touristy restaurant.  I&#39;ve been here maybe 3 times in the past few years, partly because it&#39;s one of the few restaurants that I can find from my hotel without too much difficulty.  <br><br>I find it quite pricey, but that&#39;s probably because I&#39;m comparing to London prices.  I was introduced to Thai by a local colleague, so I&#39;m pretty sure it&#39;s a good restaurant! The food is very good - I still remember the duck dish that I had the first time I visited.  Mm, yummy! It&#39;s still on the menu (I believe there&#39;s only one main duck dish, so you can&#39;t go wrong).  Last time I visited, I had the chef&#39;s special noodles, which were really tasty (if a little spicy!).  <br><br>The atmosphere is good and the staff are really friendly.  There is English on the menu, which is a bonus.  Worth a visit if you are stuck for somewhere to eat, and don&#39;t fancy anymore fondues or steaks!",

And do not order the beignets for an appetizer. The pictures on the menu are misleading and it came out extremely tiny and rock hard.They also have 2 for 1 drinks on Thursdays for ladies night and Thai buffet all you can eat on Wednesdays. The atmosphere is cozy and intimate. They are well staffed for a small venue and service is attentive and quick.",

"reviewcomment":"An original place with a very original chef. Although you might come here for the friendly, although admittedly a bit crazy chef, your main reason will undoubtedly be for the delicious Italian food which is served in generous portions. <br><br>The atmosphere is a little on the &#39;rustic&#39; side, as it is a self-service where you order and pay for your food at the counter and wait until the chef announces your order number (often in a very original manner over his karaoke system). Due to its cheap prices and its location, close to the university and the Swiss &#34;Romande&#34; tv/radio tower, it&#39;s usually quite busy at lunch and the wait to hear the sweet sound of the chef calling out your number will seem very long, so be warned! However, when the food arrives, the impatience and frustration quickly dissipates as you dig in!<br><br>Please be aware the restaurant does not stay open late in the evening and closes around 20h. <br><br>Take away and Italian products are also available.",

"reviewcomment":"I have been walking by this cute little cafe specialising in Syrian specialities for a couple of months now.  I finally had the opportunity to have a delightful lunch here today with a friend.  I could see this place quickly becoming a five star favourite after additional visits.  They have done a good job of taking a very small space feel inviting and warm.  Their menu changes each day with whatever is freshly made up for the lunch rush.  <br><br>The main plat du jour included a small salad, soup, and meze selection (four different sauces to dip your pita bread in).  The hummus was one of my favourites that I have had in Switzerland so far. All of this for only about 23 CHF.  I highly recommend the mint hot tea made from fresh mint tea leaves. For 10 CHF we shared a small plate of homemade Syrian pastries.  All of which were amazing and full of yummy pistachios.  I loved that they were not too sweet or gooey.  <br><br>The owner was very friendly and spoke perfect English. The service was also amazing and quick.  I will definitely be going back here to try out their Syrian coffee special and other specialities.<br>  <br>The hours are a bit weird so be careful.  They are open Monday - Wednesday 11:30- 15:00.  On Thursday and Friday, they are open 11:30-15:00 and also from 19:00-22:00.  They are closed Saturday and Sunday.  There is no website, but you can reach the owner by email at <a href='mailto:rachaperret@me.com'>rachaperret@me.com</a>.  <br><br>Remember don&#39;t blink or you might pass this gem by.",

"reviewcomment":"Oh no!! <br><br>I thought the website would have a menu, and didn&#39;t bother writing down what we had! To the best of my recollection, I had an Isadora, one lunchmate had a Filomena, and my other lunchmate had another sandwich that I believe started with an &#34;I.&#34;  Oops. <br><br>The restaurant is located in the swanky part of town, on the second floor (first I guess, if you&#39;re European) of the Confederation Centre.  The storefront is unassuming and small, but quaint and elegant; a consistent theme throughout the entire restaurant.  The place settings were inviting, the decor was cozy and thoughtful.  We started with coffee, which came with what I thought was a big piece of chocolate on the coaster.  It sat on my coaster for some time before I decided to take a look, and good thing I didn&#39;t keep it there too long, as it turned out to be ice cream encased in chocolate! It had grown soft sitting next to my hot coffee, and while it wasn&#39;t particularly amazing, it was a creative touch amongst the many, many places you can get good coffee in Geneva.  We were off to a good start. <br><br>I had the Isadora, as it was apparently the sandwich that Lunchmate 1 had been raving to Lunchmate 2 about for a week.  The thin slices of cured beef were enveloped in a perfectly toasted bun, with a light tartare sauce.  The texture of the bread was amazing--it was just the perfect level of thinness and crispiness to give you a soft bite of bread that wouldn&#39;t implode into your sandwich when you bit into it.  My meat stayed in tact. My tartare didn&#39;t spew out of my sandwich. I was able to maintain a semblance of elegance, something that doesn&#39;t happen very often when I&#39;m eating.  There was just the right amount of meat, and the sandwich itself was a perfect portion size. Both of my lunchmates were also very happy with their sandwiches (although Lunchmate 1 said that the Isadora was better than the Filomena).  We left satisfied, neither hungry nor stuffed. <br><br>The prices seem to range between CHF15-CHF25 for the sandwiches, with other options for plats or tartines.  As usual, the price itself is more than I would like to pay for a small sandwich, but the taste and atmosphere of the restaurant was worth it, at least in Geneva $$ terms.<br><br>Lunchmate 1 said that she had been dreaming of the sandwich since she had it last week.  I hope my Isadora doesn&#39;t come to haunt me in my dreams, as it IS good enough for me to make the trek again, and I simply don&#39;t think I can afford to give into CHF17 sandwich cravings on a regular basis.",

"reviewcomment":"We&#39;ve been to this restaurant now twice, and the second time it was a lot better than the first one, so that&#39;s a good sign. First time we were there I had a large salad, which wasn&#39;t that impressive (I guess it&#39;s not a good thing to order a salad as a main dish in a French style bistro), yesterday I had the steak tartar though and that was good. My fiance had steak in pepper/whiskey sauce which was excellent, and we had the escargots as an appetizers, also good. Thus, if you are looking for a French style bisto, not too expensive (main dishes are between 25 and 35 CHF), and a good wine list, this is quite a good place. It was packed on a Saturday night, with lots of young people. The place is not very stylish but cozy, and in a student part of town. There are a few other restaurants in that neighborhood as well as a few bars (it&#39;s close to plain palais). What we didn&#39;t like was that it was very loud, and also the bathrooms are not that nice (clean but very small/basic).",

"reviewcomment":"One of our favorite Indian restaurants in Geneva. It is located in Paqui, so a bit more of the &#39; adventurous&#39; part of Geneva, but you can have really good global food in the neighborhood from different cultures. We have visited Gandhi cafe with colleagues and family, and an Indian colleague mentioned that it was the best Indian food he had in Switzerland, so that speaks highly for it -- he was trying out different Indian restaurants almost every second day here, having enough of Swiss cheese dishes.... We really enjoy ordering a diverse group of main dishes and sharing, especially good are the palak paneer and the lamb dishes. I was a bit surprised to notice beef dishes on the menu and haven&#39;t tried them, but could be good too. For drink, the draft beer is good price/value. I never focus that much on Indian desserts so cannot comment that well. If you can, sit outside, as it&#39;s fun to observe the buzz on the street, and to enjoy a warm Geneva evening. With regards to price, we usually end up paying between 30 to 40 CHF per person, for food and drink all included, and we do order quite a lot, so it&#39;s well-priced also. I&#34;ve had better Indian food in the US, so cannot give it the highest rating, but again, it&#39;s worth trying out.",

"reviewcomment":"An original place with a very original chef. Although you might come here for the friendly, although admittedly a bit crazy chef, your main reason will undoubtedly be for the delicious Italian food which is served in generous portions. <br><br>The atmosphere is a little on the &#39;rustic&#39; side, as it is a self-service where you order and pay for your food at the counter and wait until the chef announces your order number (often in a very original manner over his karaoke system). Due to its cheap prices and its location, close to the university and the Swiss &#34;Romande&#34; tv/radio tower, it&#39;s usually quite busy at lunch and the wait to hear the sweet sound of the chef calling out your number will seem very long, so be warned! However, when the food arrives, the impatience and frustration quickly dissipates as you dig in!<br><br>Please be aware the restaurant does not stay open late in the evening and closes around 20h. <br><br>Take away and Italian products are also available.",

"reviewcomment":"I have been walking by this cute little cafe specialising in Syrian specialities for a couple of months now.  I finally had the opportunity to have a delightful lunch here today with a friend.  I could see this place quickly becoming a five star favourite after additional visits.  They have done a good job of taking a very small space feel inviting and warm.  Their menu changes each day with whatever is freshly made up for the lunch rush.  <br><br>The main plat du jour included a small salad, soup, and meze selection (four different sauces to dip your pita bread in).  The hummus was one of my favourites that I have had in Switzerland so far. All of this for only about 23 CHF.  I highly recommend the mint hot tea made from fresh mint tea leaves. For 10 CHF we shared a small plate of homemade Syrian pastries.  All of which were amazing and full of yummy pistachios.  I loved that they were not too sweet or gooey.  <br><br>The owner was very friendly and spoke perfect English. The service was also amazing and quick.  I will definitely be going back here to try out their Syrian coffee special and other specialities.<br>  <br>The hours are a bit weird so be careful.  They are open Monday - Wednesday 11:30- 15:00.  On Thursday and Friday, they are open 11:30-15:00 and also from 19:00-22:00.  They are closed Saturday and Sunday.  There is no website, but you can reach the owner by email at <a href='mailto:rachaperret@me.com'>rachaperret@me.com</a>.  <br><br>Remember don&#39;t blink or you might pass this gem by.",

I have eaten the following and find them to perfection as I am comparing the flavors with those of other places....this is by far the best. Palak Paneer, Lamb Curry, Fish Curry, Chicken Curry - all are to die for seriously. The heat and coolness together is perfect. The fish is tres spicy which I loved.

I would recommend anybody going to this italian restaurant.<br><br>Atmosphere 4/5: Since it was quiet sunny and warm, we sat outside on the large patio they have. Unfortunately, the place wasn&#39;t crowded at all for Lunch mainly because it is the holidays now and most of the people aren&#39;t working. The place was nevertheless really warm and spacious.<br><br>Food 4.5/5: I wasn&#39;t disapointed at all by the food. I had a Carpaccio served with a heart of Mozzarella on top. Everything was fresh and tasty. They apparently also have great pizzas.<br><br>Service 5/5: The service was great but my sister knew the owners so my judgement might be a little bit biased. We had a great service nevertheless and all the staff was GREAT. No doubt they will accomadate any customers with the most professional service. <br><br>A great restaurant to have lunch at and a good variety of food. Try the Limoncello as the desserts liquor.",

"reviewcomment":"I hadn&#39;t been faced with living in Switzerland for any length of time in thirty (yes, that&#39;s 3 0) years since I was going to school in Neuchâtel. And you&#39;d think some things might have changed in that period of time, right? Wrong. Not here. Not even in Geneve where I&#39;ll be hanging out for awhile. Honestly I had forgotten that everything&#39;s closed on Sunday. Grocery stores, cafés, etc.. I was beginning to think I&#39;d have to eat frozen pizza from the mini-mart at the gas station but I happened to notice that a restaurant that was closed when I&#39;d passed by earlier was now open.<br><br>And that would be Le Nouveau Lido Chez Ana. It&#39;s just a nice medium sized local hangout. Lot&#39;s of people were there watching football (not the American kind). It has a bar but families were eating there too. And the food! Excellent! I had the Veal Cordon Bleu. It came with an extremely fresh mixed green salad that included some shredded carrot, tomato, a little onion and a little corn. They bring the vinegar and oil to your table. And the bread? I had forgotten just how good a Swiss baguette tasted. But the Veal was amazing, truly. perfectly prepared. The ham, the cheese, the breading! All of it was spot-on. It was accompanied with perfectly sautéed vegetables (some type of squash, carrot and peppers) and of course the requisite pomme frites. I&#39;m very serious about pomme frites or French fries. Whichever you prefer. These were good but if they&#39;d been a little crispier we&#39;d be in serious five star territory (see, I told you I was serious). And to top everything off they were even nice to someone who&#39;s French is even worse than his Japanese.<br><br>I will definitely be back. Probably this week even.",

Located adjacent to the United Nations complex it&#39;s somewhat off the beaten path unless you have transportation. <br>The hotel also has an outdoor heated Olympic pool for the few days when the weather permits its usage.<br><br>The rooms on the other hand are a bit snug but manageable for the short-term visitor. Like most hotel rooms in Geneva it&#39;s decorated in a modern style and is very aesthetically pleasing. What&#39;s not so pleasing is the bathroom. While small and efficient, it lacks a few basics - like room to put ones things (i.e. shaving kit).<br><br>Overall, a great hotel if you have business at the U.N.  and don;t mind paying the high price.",

The food is well prepared and the service is second to none. A great place to take a first date, a second date or a wedding anniversary. <br><br>The stake tartar is a personal favourite, but I have heard many possative things about the Stake in Cafe du Paris sauce, &amp; and the Fillet of Perch which is caught that very day from the lake!<br><br>If you still have room by the end of the main meal then be sure to try their tiramisu... it&#39;s out of this world!",

The crust is thin and they are light on the sauce while heavy on the salt, so if you don&#39;t really like salty thin crust, I&#39;d try somewhere else. However, I&#39;ve always enjoyed every pizza I&#39;ve gotten from there. Much better than paying an arm and leg for Doninios!<br><br>My personal favorite is the Quattro Stagioni :)",

"reviewcomment":"This is another lunch time favorite. Especially on a cold blustery day, and I feel like having some warm comfort food. This place is a take away Italian sandwich shop. They also offer Italian products to purchase.  It is not just sandwiches though, they also have delicious salads, focaccia, panini, piadine, arancini, soupes, lasagnes, raviolis, and yes - the baguette sandwich.  My favorites are the grilled Italian sandwiches (panini, focaccia, etc) and salads.  The baguette sandwiches are a little to heavy on the bread side, and the baguette bread is a bit tough to chew for me here.  I have always wanted to try the home made lasagna, or ravioli, but haven&#39;t had a chance to yet.  The prices for lunch are also reasonable for the quality and volume of food you receive in return.  This place typically has a line, and it is TINY!!  It is usually busy at lunch time with local business persons.  The owners are Italian and very nice.  They also offer a loyalty punch card - so many lunches and you get the 10th / 9th free.  They also do delivery if  you have an office order with a minimum of 60 chf.  Just a tip, if you ask for vinegar and oil on your salad, be sure to ask for just a little bit, as they pour it on otherwise!!!",

"reviewcomment":"We&#39;ve been to this restaurant now twice, and the second time it was a lot better than the first one, so that&#39;s a good sign. First time we were there I had a large salad, which wasn&#39;t that impressive (I guess it&#39;s not a good thing to order a salad as a main dish in a French style bistro), yesterday I had the steak tartar though and that was good. My fiance had steak in pepper/whiskey sauce which was excellent, and we had the escargots as an appetizers, also good. Thus, if you are looking for a French style bisto, not too expensive (main dishes are between 25 and 35 CHF), and a good wine list, this is quite a good place. It was packed on a Saturday night, with lots of young people. The place is not very stylish but cozy, and in a student part of town. There are a few other restaurants in that neighborhood as well as a few bars (it&#39;s close to plain palais). What we didn&#39;t like was that it was very loud, and also the bathrooms are not that nice (clean but very small/basic).",

"reviewcomment":"One of our favorite Indian restaurants in Geneva. It is located in Paqui, so a bit more of the &#39; adventurous&#39; part of Geneva, but you can have really good global food in the neighborhood from different cultures. We have visited Gandhi cafe with colleagues and family, and an Indian colleague mentioned that it was the best Indian food he had in Switzerland, so that speaks highly for it -- he was trying out different Indian restaurants almost every second day here, having enough of Swiss cheese dishes.... We really enjoy ordering a diverse group of main dishes and sharing, especially good are the palak paneer and the lamb dishes. I was a bit surprised to notice beef dishes on the menu and haven&#39;t tried them, but could be good too. For drink, the draft beer is good price/value. I never focus that much on Indian desserts so cannot comment that well. If you can, sit outside, as it&#39;s fun to observe the buzz on the street, and to enjoy a warm Geneva evening. With regards to price, we usually end up paying between 30 to 40 CHF per person, for food and drink all included, and we do order quite a lot, so it&#39;s well-priced also. I&#34;ve had better Indian food in the US, so cannot give it the highest rating, but again, it&#39;s worth trying out.",

"reviewcomment":"I hadn&#39;t been faced with living in Switzerland for any length of time in thirty (yes, that&#39;s 3 0) years since I was going to school in Neuchâtel. And you&#39;d think some things might have changed in that period of time, right? Wrong. Not here. Not even in Geneve where I&#39;ll be hanging out for awhile. Honestly I had forgotten that everything&#39;s closed on Sunday. Grocery stores, cafés, etc.. I was beginning to think I&#39;d have to eat frozen pizza from the mini-mart at the gas station but I happened to notice that a restaurant that was closed when I&#39;d passed by earlier was now open.<br><br>And that would be Le Nouveau Lido Chez Ana. It&#39;s just a nice medium sized local hangout. Lot&#39;s of people were there watching football (not the American kind). It has a bar but families were eating there too. And the food! Excellent! I had the Veal Cordon Bleu. It came with an extremely fresh mixed green salad that included some shredded carrot, tomato, a little onion and a little corn. They bring the vinegar and oil to your table. And the bread? I had forgotten just how good a Swiss baguette tasted. But the Veal was amazing, truly. perfectly prepared. The ham, the cheese, the breading! All of it was spot-on. It was accompanied with perfectly sautéed vegetables (some type of squash, carrot and peppers) and of course the requisite pomme frites. I&#39;m very serious about pomme frites or French fries. Whichever you prefer. These were good but if they&#39;d been a little crispier we&#39;d be in serious five star territory (see, I told you I was serious). And to top everything off they were even nice to someone who&#39;s French is even worse than his Japanese.<br><br>I will definitely be back. Probably this week even.",

I had actually stopped by for coffee a few days ago while waiting for a friend, and having seen the display of scrumptious-looking sandwiches, was more determined than ever to try one. <br><br>Yesterday was the day, as our crew had to grab a quick bite to eat before heading to a flamenco demonstration (!! but that&#39;s a story for another day).  We got there around 6:30pm.  If there is any menu item in any restaurant that has chorizo, I am going to order it--It was also an extremely cold evening and I wanted something warm, so it took all of 10 seconds for me to choose the chicken and chorizo sandwich. <br><br>The sandwich was a good size, and the baguette was very good, if not just a tad bit chewy from sitting most of the day. With the chicken, chorizo, cheese, and sauce, it actually tasted a lot like a baguette pizza (in fact, I think the warm sandwiches are actually called baguette pizzas or pizza baguettes??). What I really appreciated was the peppers, which gave the sandwiches a formidable kick. <br><br>As good as the sandwich was, my mind kept wandering to how much better it would be if the sandwiches were fresh--they definitely did have a reheated left-over feel to them at that hour, and I imagine they would be amazing straight out of the oven.",

The location of the restaurant is amazing (right in the old town) and you can sit outside and really enjoy the atmosphere on a nice summer night. Nonetheless, the food was not good -- the meat was not done as we had ordered it, and the portions were not sized adequately, plus the fries were tasteless.

It&#39;s an Indian restaurant that also makes all their pizzas on site, in front of your eyes.<br><br>The same Indian man seated us, waited on us, and prepared my pizza. He was in his mid 20s, he was attentive but not over bearing. He spoke English fairly well, better than most others we encountered in Geneva.<br><br>I ordered the Vesuvio pizza and my parents ordered the Chicken Curry and Lamb Masala. We also ordered 2 Noor Biryanis (Chicken) to go for my brother. Food was pretty delicious. Everything was freshly prepared and the sauces were original. My pizza was thin crust and baked perfectly.<br><br>What sent this place up to four stars was the atmosphere. Music that was present but not so loud that one can&#39;t enjoy a conversation. The lighting was dim enough to be flattering but not so that one feels like they are in a nightclub. Tables and floor were black, sleek, modern and clean. Perfect spot for a business lunch or dinner, or for an important date.<br><br>The only thing that surprised us was the bill. It came to well over 150 CHF. But this was our first day in Switzerland and we hadn&#39;t yet learned that this was a fairly average price for a meal of this quality in a decent atmosphere.",

The menu is not very diverse and is limited.  This appears to be a place people go if they are offering an interesting Plat Du Jour or Set Menu of the day as that is what it seemed everyone was getting.  For the price of the food, it was OK.  It wasn&#39;t bad, but wasn&#39;t great.  It wasn&#39;t like I walked away planning my next visit.",

"reviewcomment":"Hello Yelpers,<br>I had dinner last night at this new Italian restaurant which opened less than 3 weeks ago. The restaurant is included in the &#34;Assiette Genevoise&#34; scheme which, for those of you who are not familiar with the concept, allows people who purchased their member cards to have a free meal at different places in Geneva - it&#39;s a great way to discover new places. Hence me going to Giardino Italiano last night.<br><br>The restaurant is situated in the middle of &#34;Les Grottes&#34; neighbourhood which is a very laid back and suburb like part of the city, behind the train station. The terrace was very cosy and packed. The inside area (which is pretty big) looks modern. The waiters were as nice as it gets and offered us appetisers, which usually puts me in a good mood!! The wine was also really good.<br><br>I ordered the Miss Italia pizza... and damn what a whole lot of a lady that one was... It pretty much had everything on it, rucola, smoked ham, parmesan, mozza di buffala, as well as truffle oil. It was good but it took a lot out of me to actually finish it, and I&#39;m a big eater... My friends ordered deserts which I didn&#39;t find incredible to be honest: the tiramisu was ok and one bite of the pana cotta was enough for me.<br><br>The rest of the menu looked pretty common for what looks like an upscale Italian restaurant in Geneva, you have a good choice of pasta, meat and fish dishes. Pizzas are regular ones. Prices are a little higher than at more traditional Italian restaurants but nothing too excessive (yet this comes from someone who comes from Geneva).<br><br>Overall I would give this restaurant 3 stars and a half, the atmosphere was good and I&#39;ll be happy to go back. Don&#39;t know if I can call myself a fan though...<br><br>Hope this helps. Until then, happy yelping!!<br><br>Alex",

"reviewcomment":"This mini cafe is underneath the California fitness gym. I am not sure if the little cafe is owned by the gym or not.  There is no where to eat at this place, it take away only here. You enter via a sliding glass door, and then a second glass door.  It is such a tiny spot, with a little glass case displaying their yummy looking lentil and quinoa salads (which I still need to try!), and a tiny kitchen area behind were they make all their own fresh bread, etc.  The sandwiches a bit pricey, on the smallish side, but good.  Today, I finally stopped in for their legume (vegetable) soup.  It was exactly what I was looking for. It was vegetable soup like my grandma used to make it. Fresh cut up veggies in a nice simmering broth.  An ongoing winter special is the daily soup for 10 CHF with a baked veggie pie (tomato or spinach (epinards)).  Plus, surprising, I wasn&#39;t expecting a slice of yummy cheese and a piece of their homemade wheat baguette.  A healthy lunch for a great price!   They also have a window that is open out to the street during the winter.  I think you can actually order from outside on the street when it is nice.  They have some really yummy looking muffins that have been calling my name to try some morning when I am in a hurry and have missed breakfast.",

It was about 35 CHF per person but the amount of shrimp the brought was insane. I have a huge pile to take home....They are not shrimp either but jumbo prawns cooked to perfection in herbs and garlic. They serve them on one of those little hot plates so they never get cold, along with some french fries. The fries were eh, a bit to oily for me, but the prawns were fantastic. If you are a shrimp and garlic lover, you need to eat here. The menu is in both French and English which was nice. Its on Rue de Berne, intersecting with Rue de Zurich in the Paquis area of Geneva.",

"reviewcomment":"This restaurant recently opened and it&#39;s motto is &#34;petit resto entre amis&#34;.  You walk inside and the atmosphere is unique with solid undertones of dark pink.  Thankfully we came early, because even though this place is newer, the word has gotten out, and almost all the tables at noon had been reserved.  There is outdoor seating available as well for a nice sunny day.  If I had written this review within two hours of eating, I would have easily given it four stars. However, when your stomach starts to think it is an Olympic gold metal gymnast soon after eating, you wonder. If I am courageous I will adventure there again, because the taste of the food was very good and the service was friendly, but something just didn&#39;t settle right.  There is no carte (menu) at lunch.  It is whatever the plat du jour is for the day at a nice price of 18 chf.  They highly recommended the quiche which is what my friend and I both took, her with soup, and mine with salad.  Everything reminded me as if it had just been made from my grandma&#39;s kitchen.  The food was fresh and tasty.  One of the best quiches I have had in awhile.  The salad was fantastic, and my friend raved about her soup.  We were already talking about coming again.  It could have just been a bad day for the stomach, which is why I will try again sometime.  So four stars overall, but dinged a star for the after effects.",

"reviewcomment":"As the cafe across the street was packed, we meandered into this place to see if we could get a seat for 3. We were lucky enough to be able to sit in the back with two other guys. We ordered a couple of teas and a hot chocolate. The mint tea had actual mint leaves. The hot chocolate was delicious even though it was a prepackaged container of powder. You add it to the milk. I bet it&#39;s the milk that makes it delicious. It was very eclectic in terms of groups of people. They also served quiches and perhaps other things. Only thing I didn&#39;t like were the people sitting next to us. As my boyfriend and his friend were trying to speak in English for my sake, the guys next to us were laughing and sure that it was because of that. When we had left, they were outside and clearly mocking us by saying &#34;Have a good night.&#34; <br><br>Besides that bad encounter, it was homey and not that loud. Definitely a good place to meet up for coffee or other beverages.",

"reviewcomment":"This is one of the few places where I can walk to from my office so I am thankful that I can get a decent meal here since my cafeteria has the worst food in all of Europe.  Sala has a nice indoor and outdoor atmosphere and the wait staff are very nice. They speak English as well so if you are not a French speaker you are OK here.  I even called to reserve a table and spoke French and either they A. were being nice and answered me back in my own language or B. thought my American accent French was so bad they decided to speak in English.  Anyway, I have tried a few things here, Pad Thai which is quite tasty and my favorite is the chicken green curry. Always perfect amount of heat and flavor. A nice quiet place for lunch or dinner.",

"reviewcomment":"The interior is absolutely splendid but the atmosphere is a little cold even for a Japanese restaurant! I found the sushi good but a little small, the main dishes are delicious and the Japanese ceramics you eat off are to die for. Pricey but still acceptable by Geneva standards - as with many of the Japanese restaurants in Geneva, the food may be authentic but the service is European and doesn&#39;t even come close to what the Japanese can do to make you feel special.",

"reviewcomment":"This place is definitively quite something! It&#39;s really two places in one. There is two different part, that almost look like two separate places but with the same staff.<br><br>One is a tea room where people come to smoke &#34;Sheesha&#34; and it seem to be the more popular part of the place.<br><br>Specialized in Moroccan cuisine, the restaurant part is less crowded (at least on the Wednesday night when I was there). I had being dying for a good &#34;tajine&#34;  for a few days and that&#39;s what win me to this place initially. The chicken &#34;tajine&#34; with &#34;citron confit&#34; (preserved lemon) was actually quite good... but 32 swiss francs (which is the same as US at this time) for a tajine is quite steep. Now Geneva is quite an expensive city but still... adding a cheese brick as appetizer, a glass of Moroccan wine and a mint tea did bring the bill for a single person to 63 swiss franc! Now the surprise, they do not accept any kind of card. I didn&#39;t swiss franc and they proposed to accept euro but only at a 1.1 exchange rate (a ripoff). Ended up having to go to an ATM to get swiss francs that I didn&#39;t need otherwise.<br><br>The server was nice but she needed to split her time between the two parts of the place so it was quite slow.<br><br>If you are in Geneva and really must need to eat a tajine then it is a good place... but you have to really want it!",

"reviewcomment":"On my way home, I found myself suffering from a crippling craving for Asian food.  My first choice of Korean food was nowhere to be seen, and in any case I didn&#39;t want to sit in a restaurant by myself and eat.  So I shuffled into Kamotaka Sushis, conveniently located along my walk home. <br><br>The website is in English. They deliver, for not-so-crazy prices. The owner is friendly and speaks English. He was very proud that they prepare all of their food in the store, and that the chef was Japanese.  The food was more expensive than I would have liked to pay, but you have to get used to that at some point here.  In fact, I must be learning the ways of the Swiss, as 17.50CHF for 6 pieces of pre-packaged tuna nigiri seemed almost reasonable.  I must not be all the way there yet, as I opted for the mixed chirashi specialty dish, a small bowl of sushi rice topped with pieces of tuna, salmon, octopus, eel, and shrimp for 11.50CHF. <br><br>Despite the abundant-sounding description, there were maybe one or two small pieces of each topping on a disproportionately large bed of rice. Now, &#34;chirashi&#34; in Japanese means &#34;scattered,&#34; and in Korea, we use the term to refer to the advertisement leaflets that people pass out on the street, that are lucky to make it to a trash can before getting chucked on the ground.  The sashimi pieces looked a lot like left-over end-pieces from proper nigiri, and it was difficult to even see which piece was which fish. The rice was hard and too vinegary, and came off in chunks on my fork.  It was impossible to use chopsticks as the brick of rice wouldn&#39;t separate, and I had to sprinkle with soy sauce to aid my fork in splitting the portions of rice. The toppings were, at least to the extent that I could actually taste the tiny pieces, actually pretty good.  <br><br>Does this place even deserve three stars? Perhaps it was because I was famished, or perhaps it was because I had been living off of canned foods and sandwiches for weeks. But despite the sad presentation, the dish as a whole didn&#39;t come out too badly.  After all, it is predominantly a take-out place, it&#39;s not too expensive, and  it was only one hour before closing time.  And perhaps as misguided as it was, the owner&#39;s pride in his restaurant kind of won me over. <br><br>I would go back to try the nigiri if I have a chance earlier in the day, when the rice is probably fresher.",
