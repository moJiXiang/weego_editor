"reviewcomment":"This place is AMAZEBALLS!  I can&#39;t even hype it up because no matter how good I say this place is once you try it you&#39;ll be saying the same thing. Went to Hawaii with my family and tried this place out. This place has got to be the best udon ever. They make their own udon noodles and their broth is just perfect. You have several selections you can choose from (even ones without broth) but I ordered the kake udon and I loved it. <br><br>The place is a bit crowded esp around 7 or 8 but the line does go by rather fast. The set up is like an assembly line. You choose which udon you&#39;d like. What toppings you wabt. And then choose which sides you&#39;d like to have. I got kake udon with shrimp tempura. <br><br>The only bad thing bout this place is the seating. I wish it was bigger or if they could maximize the seating arrangement. Its a bit hard to find seats esp if you&#39;re going with a group during their peak hours.<br><br>We had to eat this place twice while we were in Hawaii. Perfect on any night",

"reviewcomment":"3.5 stars! Overall, this is a good restaurant to eat by Waikiki beach. A bit of a touristy restaurant but it has a good food, friendly service, and relaxing atmosphere. If you&#39;re sitting outside you can enjoy the weather, live band playing, and people dancing and drinking outside. <br><br>Food:<br>A good tip to save money is simply attacking the salad bar that&#39;s included in your entree as your appetizer and dessert. All those pasta salad, couscous, bread, and broccoli are there for your delight. And for dessert, just grab a bunch of fruits like the pineapples and grapes. <br>As for the entrees, I enjoyed my prime rib but I&#39;d go for the fish dish next time because my friends seemed to have enjoyed that more. Consider the prime rib as a safe man dish, go for the ahi tuna and such but don&#39;t order the lobster. The lobsters are supposedly a rip off/imported. Eat more fish and shrimps.<br><br>The service here was nice and friendly. Our waitress read our mind easily when we were going for the salad as appetizer and dessert (I suppose everyone does this). She made good suggestions to my friends and never left my glass of water empty (It can get hot sitting outside).<br><br>This was a good restaurant but it wasn&#39;t my favorite. Eating at Duke&#39;s Malibu may have taken away my experience at Duke&#39;s. The fact that it&#39;s a beach-front restaurant was very nice and the ambiance is more lively in Waikiki than Malibu.",

"reviewcomment":"This place was quite a drive out to the other side of the island but my husband and I had a rental so we figure upon the recommendation of his supervisor who frequently stays on there island, we would stop by and eat as the locals do (or at least those smart enough to discover this gem)<br><br>Now I&#39;m not a huge shrimp fan but who can resist garlic on anything, right?<br><br>So after waiting in line for about 5min, we each decided to get a half order which comes with 6 huge shrimp, rice and a drink (if you use your check in offer) and added a macaroni salad. The shrimp tasted really garlicky, I only wish they had removed the shells and de-vained them for the price you pay. If you wanted the flavor you really had to suck on the shell or it would get removed once you took it off. <br><br>It&#39;s definitely, worth the drive to this part of the island as you get beautiful views while driving of mountains and oceans the entire way there. There are also several other food vendors there so we were able to try a few by sticking to half or smaller portions.",

"reviewcomment":"One of my food missions on my visit to Hawaii was to find great macadamia nut pancakes.  Luckily, we had local connections who took us out to fulfill our food cravings.  <br><br>They told me Boots &amp; Kimo&#39;s is da kin&#39; place for mac nut pancakes and they did not steer me wrong.  They serve banana pancakes with the most awesome mac nut sauce I have ever had - bar none!   These plate size and fluffy pancakes with mac sweet (but not rich) sauce will make you shun butter and syrup forever.  I wish I had some right now! <br><br>The short stack will feed one hungry person.  If you share as a couple, you&#39;ll need to order something else.  Unfortunately, this is where B&amp;K&#39;s comes up a bit short.  The other dishes on the menu are just not up to that pancake standard.  <br><br>I had the Portuguese sausage omelet, which was very pedestrian. Nothing else on the menu seems to justify the wait for a seat, as the place is quite small and wait times can be loooong. <br><br>A few previous Yelpers showed up at 7:30 a.m. and I suppose that&#39;s the only way to avoid the very real crowds. We showed up about 11 a.m. and had to wait an hour.  No way is a very average omelet worth an hour&#39;s wait.   <br><br>If you go for the pancakes and go early, you can&#39;t go wrong. <br><br>WARNING - they close at the lunch hour !!",

"reviewcomment":"I am not surprised that Obama chooses to dine here every year. This place perfected everything from service to the food. I came here with my boyfriend and his family to celebrate his and his brother&#39;s birthdays, and so we thought Alan Wong&#39;s would be a fitting place to do a double birthday celebration dinner.<br><br>We were greeted warmly as we entered, and then shown to our table. The restaurant has a very classy ambiance, but still has the friendly Hawaiian attitude that was refreshing. Alan Wong&#39;s cuisine is considered to be a combination of Hawaiian and Asian Fusion, and I was amazed at the level of creativity and flavors of the dishes.<br><br>We started with several appetizers: <br><br>-&#34;Da Bag&#34; (steamed clams with kalua pig, and shiitake mushrooms in a foil bag).<br>Tasty and came out piping hot. The kalua pig was tender, the clams were a bit small but still delicious.<br><br>-Chopped Ahi Sashimi &amp; Avocado Salsa Stack, Stacked on Crispy Won Ton, Spicy Aioli and Wasabi Soy.<br>Delicious!<br><br>-Richard Ha&#39;s Whole Tomato Salad, Li Hing Mui Ume Vinaigrette.<br>My favorite appetizer. It&#39;s basically a sliced tomato surrounded by the most amazing sauce. Very savory and refreshing at the same time.<br><br>We were also served bread with a unique spicy aioli sauce throughout our meal that was a bit addicting. I had to limit myself to just 3 pieces of bread because the sauce was too good!<br><br>For entrees, we ordered:<br><br>-Ginger Crusted Onaga, Long-Tail Red Snapper (with miso sesame vinaigrette, hamakua mushroom &amp; corn)<br>The fish was flavorful, and the vinaigrette was lightly creamy which complemented well. <br><br>-Pan Steamed Opakapaka, Short-Tail Pink Snapper (with shrimp pork hash, truffle nage, gingered vegetables, tapioca pearls)<br><br>-Twice Cooked Short Rib, Soy Braised &amp; Grilled &#34;Kalbi&#34; Style (with gingered shrimp, kochu jang sauce)<br>The meat literally fell apart and was very flavorful. <br><br>For dessert, all 5 of us shared the &#34;The Coconut&#34;, which is a haupia sorbet in a chocolate shell, with tropical fruits and lilikoi sauce. The sorbet complemented very well with the berries and tropical fruits. I loved it! The birthday boys also each received a complimentary chocolate dessert, which was a nice gesture.<br><br>The service itself was exceptional. Our drinks were filled at appropriate times, and each of the servers took the time to explain each dish that was being served. We felt very taken care of throughout the night, and we had a very good experience. I highly recommend Alan Wong&#39;s as an excellent date night option, or for those who want to celebrate for a special occasion.",

"reviewcomment":"Hands-down the best (restaurant-bought) authentic Hawaiian meal on Oahu that I&#39;ve experienced.  In particular, the Laulau at Ono Hawaiian Foods is better than any laulau you can buy (not including the kind from a family sale or auntie&#39;s home-made recipe).  <br>To be clear, this isnt for everyone.  If you dont eat slow-cooked pork that melts in your mouth, you&#39;ll not enjoy half the joy of laulau.<br>That said, I&#39;ve been coming here since the 1980&#39;s, and have cherished memories of my Grandma &amp; Grandpa enjoying the luau plate.  Little has changed since the days I brought the grandparents - though they&#39;ve both passed on since. (I&#39;m convinced that if they&#39;re eating anything they want up in Heaven, the laulau from Ono&#39;s is a regular item on the heavenly menu.)<br>As a foodie &amp; prvate tour provider, I&#39;ve brought tons of adventure-seeking, traditionalist food fans here, and they always love it too.<br>Mahalo to the family for keeping it the same, and remaining one of the few kama&#39;aina locales committed to the thing your customers love.  Keep the skyscrapers in Kaka&#39;ako &amp; Waikiki, and keep Ono&#39;s on Kapahulu doing the same thing you do!<br>BTW, Anthony Bourdain did a segment on this place on his travel foodshow a few years ago, and he LOVED it. ;)<br>IF YOU GO:  expect parking to be a challenge, expect a line (not terribly bad usually), expect a small dining room with some 11-15 tables, expect nothing fancy at all, expect the tab to run about $15-23/pp depending on what you get, and be nice to the staff and they&#39;ll treat you like family.  And tip appropriately.",

The food is authentic and the portions are large enough for 2 people to share. I wish I still lived in Hawaii because I would definitely frequent this lil thai gem.<br><br>There are a couple free parking spots across the street (behind the bus stop). Make sure you park in the stalls spraypainted Kaew&#39;s.. otherwise it&#39;s street parking.",

"reviewcomment":"This place is AMAZEBALLS!  I can&#39;t even hype it up because no matter how good I say this place is once you try it you&#39;ll be saying the same thing. Went to Hawaii with my family and tried this place out. This place has got to be the best udon ever. They make their own udon noodles and their broth is just perfect. You have several selections you can choose from (even ones without broth) but I ordered the kake udon and I loved it. <br><br>The place is a bit crowded esp around 7 or 8 but the line does go by rather fast. The set up is like an assembly line. You choose which udon you&#39;d like. What toppings you wabt. And then choose which sides you&#39;d like to have. I got kake udon with shrimp tempura. <br><br>The only bad thing bout this place is the seating. I wish it was bigger or if they could maximize the seating arrangement. Its a bit hard to find seats esp if you&#39;re going with a group during their peak hours.<br><br>We had to eat this place twice while we were in Hawaii. Perfect on any night",

"reviewcomment":"3.5 stars! Overall, this is a good restaurant to eat by Waikiki beach. A bit of a touristy restaurant but it has a good food, friendly service, and relaxing atmosphere. If you&#39;re sitting outside you can enjoy the weather, live band playing, and people dancing and drinking outside. <br><br>Food:<br>A good tip to save money is simply attacking the salad bar that&#39;s included in your entree as your appetizer and dessert. All those pasta salad, couscous, bread, and broccoli are there for your delight. And for dessert, just grab a bunch of fruits like the pineapples and grapes. <br>As for the entrees, I enjoyed my prime rib but I&#39;d go for the fish dish next time because my friends seemed to have enjoyed that more. Consider the prime rib as a safe man dish, go for the ahi tuna and such but don&#39;t order the lobster. The lobsters are supposedly a rip off/imported. Eat more fish and shrimps.<br><br>The service here was nice and friendly. Our waitress read our mind easily when we were going for the salad as appetizer and dessert (I suppose everyone does this). She made good suggestions to my friends and never left my glass of water empty (It can get hot sitting outside).<br><br>This was a good restaurant but it wasn&#39;t my favorite. Eating at Duke&#39;s Malibu may have taken away my experience at Duke&#39;s. The fact that it&#39;s a beach-front restaurant was very nice and the ambiance is more lively in Waikiki than Malibu.",

"reviewcomment":"This place was quite a drive out to the other side of the island but my husband and I had a rental so we figure upon the recommendation of his supervisor who frequently stays on there island, we would stop by and eat as the locals do (or at least those smart enough to discover this gem)<br><br>Now I&#39;m not a huge shrimp fan but who can resist garlic on anything, right?<br><br>So after waiting in line for about 5min, we each decided to get a half order which comes with 6 huge shrimp, rice and a drink (if you use your check in offer) and added a macaroni salad. The shrimp tasted really garlicky, I only wish they had removed the shells and de-vained them for the price you pay. If you wanted the flavor you really had to suck on the shell or it would get removed once you took it off. <br><br>It&#39;s definitely, worth the drive to this part of the island as you get beautiful views while driving of mountains and oceans the entire way there. There are also several other food vendors there so we were able to try a few by sticking to half or smaller portions.",

"reviewcomment":"One of my food missions on my visit to Hawaii was to find great macadamia nut pancakes.  Luckily, we had local connections who took us out to fulfill our food cravings.  <br><br>They told me Boots &amp; Kimo&#39;s is da kin&#39; place for mac nut pancakes and they did not steer me wrong.  They serve banana pancakes with the most awesome mac nut sauce I have ever had - bar none!   These plate size and fluffy pancakes with mac sweet (but not rich) sauce will make you shun butter and syrup forever.  I wish I had some right now! <br><br>The short stack will feed one hungry person.  If you share as a couple, you&#39;ll need to order something else.  Unfortunately, this is where B&amp;K&#39;s comes up a bit short.  The other dishes on the menu are just not up to that pancake standard.  <br><br>I had the Portuguese sausage omelet, which was very pedestrian. Nothing else on the menu seems to justify the wait for a seat, as the place is quite small and wait times can be loooong. <br><br>A few previous Yelpers showed up at 7:30 a.m. and I suppose that&#39;s the only way to avoid the very real crowds. We showed up about 11 a.m. and had to wait an hour.  No way is a very average omelet worth an hour&#39;s wait.   <br><br>If you go for the pancakes and go early, you can&#39;t go wrong. <br><br>WARNING - they close at the lunch hour !!",

"reviewcomment":"I am not surprised that Obama chooses to dine here every year. This place perfected everything from service to the food. I came here with my boyfriend and his family to celebrate his and his brother&#39;s birthdays, and so we thought Alan Wong&#39;s would be a fitting place to do a double birthday celebration dinner.<br><br>We were greeted warmly as we entered, and then shown to our table. The restaurant has a very classy ambiance, but still has the friendly Hawaiian attitude that was refreshing. Alan Wong&#39;s cuisine is considered to be a combination of Hawaiian and Asian Fusion, and I was amazed at the level of creativity and flavors of the dishes.<br><br>We started with several appetizers: <br><br>-&#34;Da Bag&#34; (steamed clams with kalua pig, and shiitake mushrooms in a foil bag).<br>Tasty and came out piping hot. The kalua pig was tender, the clams were a bit small but still delicious.<br><br>-Chopped Ahi Sashimi &amp; Avocado Salsa Stack, Stacked on Crispy Won Ton, Spicy Aioli and Wasabi Soy.<br>Delicious!<br><br>-Richard Ha&#39;s Whole Tomato Salad, Li Hing Mui Ume Vinaigrette.<br>My favorite appetizer. It&#39;s basically a sliced tomato surrounded by the most amazing sauce. Very savory and refreshing at the same time.<br><br>We were also served bread with a unique spicy aioli sauce throughout our meal that was a bit addicting. I had to limit myself to just 3 pieces of bread because the sauce was too good!<br><br>For entrees, we ordered:<br><br>-Ginger Crusted Onaga, Long-Tail Red Snapper (with miso sesame vinaigrette, hamakua mushroom &amp; corn)<br>The fish was flavorful, and the vinaigrette was lightly creamy which complemented well. <br><br>-Pan Steamed Opakapaka, Short-Tail Pink Snapper (with shrimp pork hash, truffle nage, gingered vegetables, tapioca pearls)<br><br>-Twice Cooked Short Rib, Soy Braised &amp; Grilled &#34;Kalbi&#34; Style (with gingered shrimp, kochu jang sauce)<br>The meat literally fell apart and was very flavorful. <br><br>For dessert, all 5 of us shared the &#34;The Coconut&#34;, which is a haupia sorbet in a chocolate shell, with tropical fruits and lilikoi sauce. The sorbet complemented very well with the berries and tropical fruits. I loved it! The birthday boys also each received a complimentary chocolate dessert, which was a nice gesture.<br><br>The service itself was exceptional. Our drinks were filled at appropriate times, and each of the servers took the time to explain each dish that was being served. We felt very taken care of throughout the night, and we had a very good experience. I highly recommend Alan Wong&#39;s as an excellent date night option, or for those who want to celebrate for a special occasion.",

"reviewcomment":"Hands-down the best (restaurant-bought) authentic Hawaiian meal on Oahu that I&#39;ve experienced.  In particular, the Laulau at Ono Hawaiian Foods is better than any laulau you can buy (not including the kind from a family sale or auntie&#39;s home-made recipe).  <br>To be clear, this isnt for everyone.  If you dont eat slow-cooked pork that melts in your mouth, you&#39;ll not enjoy half the joy of laulau.<br>That said, I&#39;ve been coming here since the 1980&#39;s, and have cherished memories of my Grandma &amp; Grandpa enjoying the luau plate.  Little has changed since the days I brought the grandparents - though they&#39;ve both passed on since. (I&#39;m convinced that if they&#39;re eating anything they want up in Heaven, the laulau from Ono&#39;s is a regular item on the heavenly menu.)<br>As a foodie &amp; prvate tour provider, I&#39;ve brought tons of adventure-seeking, traditionalist food fans here, and they always love it too.<br>Mahalo to the family for keeping it the same, and remaining one of the few kama&#39;aina locales committed to the thing your customers love.  Keep the skyscrapers in Kaka&#39;ako &amp; Waikiki, and keep Ono&#39;s on Kapahulu doing the same thing you do!<br>BTW, Anthony Bourdain did a segment on this place on his travel foodshow a few years ago, and he LOVED it. ;)<br>IF YOU GO:  expect parking to be a challenge, expect a line (not terribly bad usually), expect a small dining room with some 11-15 tables, expect nothing fancy at all, expect the tab to run about $15-23/pp depending on what you get, and be nice to the staff and they&#39;ll treat you like family.  And tip appropriately.",

Ordered a thai ice tea, pad see ew, and the mango sticky rice dessert. Everything was delicious and the service was very friendly. The food is authentic and the portions are large enough for 2 people to share. I wish I still lived in Hawaii because I would definitely frequent this lil thai gem.<br><br>There are a couple free parking spots across the street (behind the bus stop). Make sure you park in the stalls spraypainted Kaew&#39;s.. otherwise it&#39;s street parking.",

"reviewcomment":"This place is AMAZEBALLS!  I can&#39;t even hype it up because no matter how good I say this place is once you try it you&#39;ll be saying the same thing. Went to Hawaii with my family and tried this place out. This place has got to be the best udon ever. They make their own udon noodles and their broth is just perfect. You have several selections you can choose from (even ones without broth) but I ordered the kake udon and I loved it. <br><br>The place is a bit crowded esp around 7 or 8 but the line does go by rather fast. The set up is like an assembly line. You choose which udon you&#39;d like. What toppings you wabt. And then choose which sides you&#39;d like to have. I got kake udon with shrimp tempura. <br><br>The only bad thing bout this place is the seating. I wish it was bigger or if they could maximize the seating arrangement. Its a bit hard to find seats esp if you&#39;re going with a group during their peak hours.<br><br>We had to eat this place twice while we were in Hawaii. Perfect on any night",

"reviewcomment":"This place was quite a drive out to the other side of the island but my husband and I had a rental so we figure upon the recommendation of his supervisor who frequently stays on there island, we would stop by and eat as the locals do (or at least those smart enough to discover this gem)<br><br>Now I&#39;m not a huge shrimp fan but who can resist garlic on anything, right?<br><br>So after waiting in line for about 5min, we each decided to get a half order which comes with 6 huge shrimp, rice and a drink (if you use your check in offer) and added a macaroni salad. The shrimp tasted really garlicky, I only wish they had removed the shells and de-vained them for the price you pay. If you wanted the flavor you really had to suck on the shell or it would get removed once you took it off. <br><br>It&#39;s definitely, worth the drive to this part of the island as you get beautiful views while driving of mountains and oceans the entire way there. There are also several other food vendors there so we were able to try a few by sticking to half or smaller portions.",

"reviewcomment":"One of my food missions on my visit to Hawaii was to find great macadamia nut pancakes.  Luckily, we had local connections who took us out to fulfill our food cravings.  <br><br>They told me Boots &amp; Kimo&#39;s is da kin&#39; place for mac nut pancakes and they did not steer me wrong.  They serve banana pancakes with the most awesome mac nut sauce I have ever had - bar none!   These plate size and fluffy pancakes with mac sweet (but not rich) sauce will make you shun butter and syrup forever.  I wish I had some right now! <br><br>The short stack will feed one hungry person.  If you share as a couple, you&#39;ll need to order something else.  Unfortunately, this is where B&amp;K&#39;s comes up a bit short.  The other dishes on the menu are just not up to that pancake standard.  <br><br>I had the Portuguese sausage omelet, which was very pedestrian. Nothing else on the menu seems to justify the wait for a seat, as the place is quite small and wait times can be loooong. <br><br>A few previous Yelpers showed up at 7:30 a.m. and I suppose that&#39;s the only way to avoid the very real crowds. We showed up about 11 a.m. and had to wait an hour.  No way is a very average omelet worth an hour&#39;s wait.   <br><br>If you go for the pancakes and go early, you can&#39;t go wrong. <br><br>WARNING - they close at the lunch hour !!",

"reviewcomment":"I am not surprised that Obama chooses to dine here every year. This place perfected everything from service to the food. I came here with my boyfriend and his family to celebrate his and his brother&#39;s birthdays, and so we thought Alan Wong&#39;s would be a fitting place to do a double birthday celebration dinner.<br><br>We were greeted warmly as we entered, and then shown to our table. The restaurant has a very classy ambiance, but still has the friendly Hawaiian attitude that was refreshing. Alan Wong&#39;s cuisine is considered to be a combination of Hawaiian and Asian Fusion, and I was amazed at the level of creativity and flavors of the dishes.<br><br>We started with several appetizers: <br><br>-&#34;Da Bag&#34; (steamed clams with kalua pig, and shiitake mushrooms in a foil bag).<br>Tasty and came out piping hot. The kalua pig was tender, the clams were a bit small but still delicious.<br><br>-Chopped Ahi Sashimi &amp; Avocado Salsa Stack, Stacked on Crispy Won Ton, Spicy Aioli and Wasabi Soy.<br>Delicious!<br><br>-Richard Ha&#39;s Whole Tomato Salad, Li Hing Mui Ume Vinaigrette.<br>My favorite appetizer. It&#39;s basically a sliced tomato surrounded by the most amazing sauce. Very savory and refreshing at the same time.<br><br>We were also served bread with a unique spicy aioli sauce throughout our meal that was a bit addicting. I had to limit myself to just 3 pieces of bread because the sauce was too good!<br><br>For entrees, we ordered:<br><br>-Ginger Crusted Onaga, Long-Tail Red Snapper (with miso sesame vinaigrette, hamakua mushroom &amp; corn)<br>The fish was flavorful, and the vinaigrette was lightly creamy which complemented well. <br><br>-Pan Steamed Opakapaka, Short-Tail Pink Snapper (with shrimp pork hash, truffle nage, gingered vegetables, tapioca pearls)<br><br>-Twice Cooked Short Rib, Soy Braised &amp; Grilled &#34;Kalbi&#34; Style (with gingered shrimp, kochu jang sauce)<br>The meat literally fell apart and was very flavorful. <br><br>For dessert, all 5 of us shared the &#34;The Coconut&#34;, which is a haupia sorbet in a chocolate shell, with tropical fruits and lilikoi sauce. The sorbet complemented very well with the berries and tropical fruits. I loved it! The birthday boys also each received a complimentary chocolate dessert, which was a nice gesture.<br><br>The service itself was exceptional. Our drinks were filled at appropriate times, and each of the servers took the time to explain each dish that was being served. We felt very taken care of throughout the night, and we had a very good experience. I highly recommend Alan Wong&#39;s as an excellent date night option, or for those who want to celebrate for a special occasion.",

"reviewcomment":"Hands-down the best (restaurant-bought) authentic Hawaiian meal on Oahu that I&#39;ve experienced.  In particular, the Laulau at Ono Hawaiian Foods is better than any laulau you can buy (not including the kind from a family sale or auntie&#39;s home-made recipe).  <br>To be clear, this isnt for everyone.  If you dont eat slow-cooked pork that melts in your mouth, you&#39;ll not enjoy half the joy of laulau.<br>That said, I&#39;ve been coming here since the 1980&#39;s, and have cherished memories of my Grandma &amp; Grandpa enjoying the luau plate.  Little has changed since the days I brought the grandparents - though they&#39;ve both passed on since. (I&#39;m convinced that if they&#39;re eating anything they want up in Heaven, the laulau from Ono&#39;s is a regular item on the heavenly menu.)<br>As a foodie &amp; prvate tour provider, I&#39;ve brought tons of adventure-seeking, traditionalist food fans here, and they always love it too.<br>Mahalo to the family for keeping it the same, and remaining one of the few kama&#39;aina locales committed to the thing your customers love.  Keep the skyscrapers in Kaka&#39;ako &amp; Waikiki, and keep Ono&#39;s on Kapahulu doing the same thing you do!<br>BTW, Anthony Bourdain did a segment on this place on his travel foodshow a few years ago, and he LOVED it. ;)<br>IF YOU GO:  expect parking to be a challenge, expect a line (not terribly bad usually), expect a small dining room with some 11-15 tables, expect nothing fancy at all, expect the tab to run about $15-23/pp depending on what you get, and be nice to the staff and they&#39;ll treat you like family.  And tip appropriately.",

Ordered a thai ice tea, pad see ew, and the mango sticky rice dessert. Everything was delicious and the service was very friendly. The food is authentic and the portions are large enough for 2 people to share. I wish I still lived in Hawaii because I would definitely frequent this lil thai gem.<br><br>There are a couple free parking spots across the street (behind the bus stop). Make sure you park in the stalls spraypainted Kaew&#39;s.. otherwise it&#39;s street parking.",

"reviewcomment":"This place is AMAZEBALLS!  I can&#39;t even hype it up because no matter how good I say this place is once you try it you&#39;ll be saying the same thing. Went to Hawaii with my family and tried this place out. This place has got to be the best udon ever. They make their own udon noodles and their broth is just perfect. You have several selections you can choose from (even ones without broth) but I ordered the kake udon and I loved it. <br><br>The place is a bit crowded esp around 7 or 8 but the line does go by rather fast. The set up is like an assembly line. You choose which udon you&#39;d like. What toppings you wabt. And then choose which sides you&#39;d like to have. I got kake udon with shrimp tempura. <br><br>The only bad thing bout this place is the seating. I wish it was bigger or if they could maximize the seating arrangement. Its a bit hard to find seats esp if you&#39;re going with a group during their peak hours.<br><br>We had to eat this place twice while we were in Hawaii. Perfect on any night",

"reviewcomment":"3.5 stars! Overall, this is a good restaurant to eat by Waikiki beach. A bit of a touristy restaurant but it has a good food, friendly service, and relaxing atmosphere. If you&#39;re sitting outside you can enjoy the weather, live band playing, and people dancing and drinking outside. <br><br>Food:<br>A good tip to save money is simply attacking the salad bar that&#39;s included in your entree as your appetizer and dessert. All those pasta salad, couscous, bread, and broccoli are there for your delight. And for dessert, just grab a bunch of fruits like the pineapples and grapes. <br>As for the entrees, I enjoyed my prime rib but I&#39;d go for the fish dish next time because my friends seemed to have enjoyed that more. Consider the prime rib as a safe man dish, go for the ahi tuna and such but don&#39;t order the lobster. The lobsters are supposedly a rip off/imported. Eat more fish and shrimps.<br><br>The service here was nice and friendly. Our waitress read our mind easily when we were going for the salad as appetizer and dessert (I suppose everyone does this). She made good suggestions to my friends and never left my glass of water empty (It can get hot sitting outside).<br><br>This was a good restaurant but it wasn&#39;t my favorite. Eating at Duke&#39;s Malibu may have taken away my experience at Duke&#39;s. The fact that it&#39;s a beach-front restaurant was very nice and the ambiance is more lively in Waikiki than Malibu.",

"reviewcomment":"This place was quite a drive out to the other side of the island but my husband and I had a rental so we figure upon the recommendation of his supervisor who frequently stays on there island, we would stop by and eat as the locals do (or at least those smart enough to discover this gem)<br><br>Now I&#39;m not a huge shrimp fan but who can resist garlic on anything, right?<br><br>So after waiting in line for about 5min, we each decided to get a half order which comes with 6 huge shrimp, rice and a drink (if you use your check in offer) and added a macaroni salad. The shrimp tasted really garlicky, I only wish they had removed the shells and de-vained them for the price you pay. If you wanted the flavor you really had to suck on the shell or it would get removed once you took it off. <br><br>It&#39;s definitely, worth the drive to this part of the island as you get beautiful views while driving of mountains and oceans the entire way there. There are also several other food vendors there so we were able to try a few by sticking to half or smaller portions.",

"reviewcomment":"One of my food missions on my visit to Hawaii was to find great macadamia nut pancakes.  Luckily, we had local connections who took us out to fulfill our food cravings.  <br><br>They told me Boots &amp; Kimo&#39;s is da kin&#39; place for mac nut pancakes and they did not steer me wrong.  They serve banana pancakes with the most awesome mac nut sauce I have ever had - bar none!   These plate size and fluffy pancakes with mac sweet (but not rich) sauce will make you shun butter and syrup forever.  I wish I had some right now! <br><br>The short stack will feed one hungry person.  If you share as a couple, you&#39;ll need to order something else.  Unfortunately, this is where B&amp;K&#39;s comes up a bit short.  The other dishes on the menu are just not up to that pancake standard.  <br><br>I had the Portuguese sausage omelet, which was very pedestrian. Nothing else on the menu seems to justify the wait for a seat, as the place is quite small and wait times can be loooong. <br><br>A few previous Yelpers showed up at 7:30 a.m. and I suppose that&#39;s the only way to avoid the very real crowds. We showed up about 11 a.m. and had to wait an hour.  No way is a very average omelet worth an hour&#39;s wait.   <br><br>If you go for the pancakes and go early, you can&#39;t go wrong. <br><br>WARNING - they close at the lunch hour !!",

"reviewcomment":"I am not surprised that Obama chooses to dine here every year. This place perfected everything from service to the food. I came here with my boyfriend and his family to celebrate his and his brother&#39;s birthdays, and so we thought Alan Wong&#39;s would be a fitting place to do a double birthday celebration dinner.<br><br>We were greeted warmly as we entered, and then shown to our table. The restaurant has a very classy ambiance, but still has the friendly Hawaiian attitude that was refreshing. Alan Wong&#39;s cuisine is considered to be a combination of Hawaiian and Asian Fusion, and I was amazed at the level of creativity and flavors of the dishes.<br><br>We started with several appetizers: <br><br>-&#34;Da Bag&#34; (steamed clams with kalua pig, and shiitake mushrooms in a foil bag).<br>Tasty and came out piping hot. The kalua pig was tender, the clams were a bit small but still delicious.<br><br>-Chopped Ahi Sashimi &amp; Avocado Salsa Stack, Stacked on Crispy Won Ton, Spicy Aioli and Wasabi Soy.<br>Delicious!<br><br>-Richard Ha&#39;s Whole Tomato Salad, Li Hing Mui Ume Vinaigrette.<br>My favorite appetizer. It&#39;s basically a sliced tomato surrounded by the most amazing sauce. Very savory and refreshing at the same time.<br><br>We were also served bread with a unique spicy aioli sauce throughout our meal that was a bit addicting. I had to limit myself to just 3 pieces of bread because the sauce was too good!<br><br>For entrees, we ordered:<br><br>-Ginger Crusted Onaga, Long-Tail Red Snapper (with miso sesame vinaigrette, hamakua mushroom &amp; corn)<br>The fish was flavorful, and the vinaigrette was lightly creamy which complemented well. <br><br>-Pan Steamed Opakapaka, Short-Tail Pink Snapper (with shrimp pork hash, truffle nage, gingered vegetables, tapioca pearls)<br><br>-Twice Cooked Short Rib, Soy Braised &amp; Grilled &#34;Kalbi&#34; Style (with gingered shrimp, kochu jang sauce)<br>The meat literally fell apart and was very flavorful. <br><br>For dessert, all 5 of us shared the &#34;The Coconut&#34;, which is a haupia sorbet in a chocolate shell, with tropical fruits and lilikoi sauce. The sorbet complemented very well with the berries and tropical fruits. I loved it! The birthday boys also each received a complimentary chocolate dessert, which was a nice gesture.<br><br>The service itself was exceptional. Our drinks were filled at appropriate times, and each of the servers took the time to explain each dish that was being served. We felt very taken care of throughout the night, and we had a very good experience. I highly recommend Alan Wong&#39;s as an excellent date night option, or for those who want to celebrate for a special occasion.",

"reviewcomment":"Hands-down the best (restaurant-bought) authentic Hawaiian meal on Oahu that I&#39;ve experienced.  In particular, the Laulau at Ono Hawaiian Foods is better than any laulau you can buy (not including the kind from a family sale or auntie&#39;s home-made recipe).  <br>To be clear, this isnt for everyone.  If you dont eat slow-cooked pork that melts in your mouth, you&#39;ll not enjoy half the joy of laulau.<br>That said, I&#39;ve been coming here since the 1980&#39;s, and have cherished memories of my Grandma &amp; Grandpa enjoying the luau plate.  Little has changed since the days I brought the grandparents - though they&#39;ve both passed on since. (I&#39;m convinced that if they&#39;re eating anything they want up in Heaven, the laulau from Ono&#39;s is a regular item on the heavenly menu.)<br>As a foodie &amp; prvate tour provider, I&#39;ve brought tons of adventure-seeking, traditionalist food fans here, and they always love it too.<br>Mahalo to the family for keeping it the same, and remaining one of the few kama&#39;aina locales committed to the thing your customers love.  Keep the skyscrapers in Kaka&#39;ako &amp; Waikiki, and keep Ono&#39;s on Kapahulu doing the same thing you do!<br>BTW, Anthony Bourdain did a segment on this place on his travel foodshow a few years ago, and he LOVED it. ;)<br>IF YOU GO:  expect parking to be a challenge, expect a line (not terribly bad usually), expect a small dining room with some 11-15 tables, expect nothing fancy at all, expect the tab to run about $15-23/pp depending on what you get, and be nice to the staff and they&#39;ll treat you like family.  And tip appropriately.",

"reviewcomment":"3.5 stars! Overall, this is a good restaurant to eat by Waikiki beach. A bit of a touristy restaurant but it has a good food, friendly service, and relaxing atmosphere. If you&#39;re sitting outside you can enjoy the weather, live band playing, and people dancing and drinking outside. <br><br>Food:<br>A good tip to save money is simply attacking the salad bar that&#39;s included in your entree as your appetizer and dessert. All those pasta salad, couscous, bread, and broccoli are there for your delight. And for dessert, just grab a bunch of fruits like the pineapples and grapes. <br>As for the entrees, I enjoyed my prime rib but I&#39;d go for the fish dish next time because my friends seemed to have enjoyed that more. Consider the prime rib as a safe man dish, go for the ahi tuna and such but don&#39;t order the lobster. The lobsters are supposedly a rip off/imported. Eat more fish and shrimps.<br><br>The service here was nice and friendly. Our waitress read our mind easily when we were going for the salad as appetizer and dessert (I suppose everyone does this). She made good suggestions to my friends and never left my glass of water empty (It can get hot sitting outside).<br><br>This was a good restaurant but it wasn&#39;t my favorite. Eating at Duke&#39;s Malibu may have taken away my experience at Duke&#39;s. The fact that it&#39;s a beach-front restaurant was very nice and the ambiance is more lively in Waikiki than Malibu.",

"reviewcomment":"This place was quite a drive out to the other side of the island but my husband and I had a rental so we figure upon the recommendation of his supervisor who frequently stays on there island, we would stop by and eat as the locals do (or at least those smart enough to discover this gem)<br><br>Now I&#39;m not a huge shrimp fan but who can resist garlic on anything, right?<br><br>So after waiting in line for about 5min, we each decided to get a half order which comes with 6 huge shrimp, rice and a drink (if you use your check in offer) and added a macaroni salad. The shrimp tasted really garlicky, I only wish they had removed the shells and de-vained them for the price you pay. If you wanted the flavor you really had to suck on the shell or it would get removed once you took it off. <br><br>It&#39;s definitely, worth the drive to this part of the island as you get beautiful views while driving of mountains and oceans the entire way there. There are also several other food vendors there so we were able to try a few by sticking to half or smaller portions.",

"reviewcomment":"One of my food missions on my visit to Hawaii was to find great macadamia nut pancakes.  Luckily, we had local connections who took us out to fulfill our food cravings.  <br><br>They told me Boots &amp; Kimo&#39;s is da kin&#39; place for mac nut pancakes and they did not steer me wrong.  They serve banana pancakes with the most awesome mac nut sauce I have ever had - bar none!   These plate size and fluffy pancakes with mac sweet (but not rich) sauce will make you shun butter and syrup forever.  I wish I had some right now! <br><br>The short stack will feed one hungry person.  If you share as a couple, you&#39;ll need to order something else.  Unfortunately, this is where B&amp;K&#39;s comes up a bit short.  The other dishes on the menu are just not up to that pancake standard.  <br><br>I had the Portuguese sausage omelet, which was very pedestrian. Nothing else on the menu seems to justify the wait for a seat, as the place is quite small and wait times can be loooong. <br><br>A few previous Yelpers showed up at 7:30 a.m. and I suppose that&#39;s the only way to avoid the very real crowds. We showed up about 11 a.m. and had to wait an hour.  No way is a very average omelet worth an hour&#39;s wait.   <br><br>If you go for the pancakes and go early, you can&#39;t go wrong. <br><br>WARNING - they close at the lunch hour !!",

Went to Hawaii with my family and tried this place out. This place has got to be the best udon ever. They make their own udon noodles and their broth is just perfect. You have several selections you can choose from (even ones without broth) but I ordered the kake udon and I loved it. <br><br>The place is a bit crowded esp around 7 or 8 but the line does go by rather fast. The set up is like an assembly line. You choose which udon you&#39;d like. What toppings you wabt. And then choose which sides you&#39;d like to have. I got kake udon with shrimp tempura. <br><br>The only bad thing bout this place is the seating. I wish it was bigger or if they could maximize the seating arrangement. Its a bit hard to find seats esp if you&#39;re going with a group during their peak hours.<br><br>We had to eat this place twice while we were in Hawaii. Perfect on any night",

"reviewcomment":"I am not surprised that Obama chooses to dine here every year. This place perfected everything from service to the food. I came here with my boyfriend and his family to celebrate his and his brother&#39;s birthdays, and so we thought Alan Wong&#39;s would be a fitting place to do a double birthday celebration dinner.<br><br>We were greeted warmly as we entered, and then shown to our table. The restaurant has a very classy ambiance, but still has the friendly Hawaiian attitude that was refreshing. Alan Wong&#39;s cuisine is considered to be a combination of Hawaiian and Asian Fusion, and I was amazed at the level of creativity and flavors of the dishes.<br><br>We started with several appetizers: <br><br>-&#34;Da Bag&#34; (steamed clams with kalua pig, and shiitake mushrooms in a foil bag).<br>Tasty and came out piping hot. The kalua pig was tender, the clams were a bit small but still delicious.<br><br>-Chopped Ahi Sashimi &amp; Avocado Salsa Stack, Stacked on Crispy Won Ton, Spicy Aioli and Wasabi Soy.<br>Delicious!<br><br>-Richard Ha&#39;s Whole Tomato Salad, Li Hing Mui Ume Vinaigrette.<br>My favorite appetizer. It&#39;s basically a sliced tomato surrounded by the most amazing sauce. Very savory and refreshing at the same time.<br><br>We were also served bread with a unique spicy aioli sauce throughout our meal that was a bit addicting. I had to limit myself to just 3 pieces of bread because the sauce was too good!<br><br>For entrees, we ordered:<br><br>-Ginger Crusted Onaga, Long-Tail Red Snapper (with miso sesame vinaigrette, hamakua mushroom &amp; corn)<br>The fish was flavorful, and the vinaigrette was lightly creamy which complemented well. <br><br>-Pan Steamed Opakapaka, Short-Tail Pink Snapper (with shrimp pork hash, truffle nage, gingered vegetables, tapioca pearls)<br><br>-Twice Cooked Short Rib, Soy Braised &amp; Grilled &#34;Kalbi&#34; Style (with gingered shrimp, kochu jang sauce)<br>The meat literally fell apart and was very flavorful. <br><br>For dessert, all 5 of us shared the &#34;The Coconut&#34;, which is a haupia sorbet in a chocolate shell, with tropical fruits and lilikoi sauce. The sorbet complemented very well with the berries and tropical fruits. I loved it! The birthday boys also each received a complimentary chocolate dessert, which was a nice gesture.<br><br>The service itself was exceptional. Our drinks were filled at appropriate times, and each of the servers took the time to explain each dish that was being served. We felt very taken care of throughout the night, and we had a very good experience. I highly recommend Alan Wong&#39;s as an excellent date night option, or for those who want to celebrate for a special occasion.",

"reviewcomment":"Hands-down the best (restaurant-bought) authentic Hawaiian meal on Oahu that I&#39;ve experienced.  In particular, the Laulau at Ono Hawaiian Foods is better than any laulau you can buy (not including the kind from a family sale or auntie&#39;s home-made recipe).  <br>To be clear, this isnt for everyone.  If you dont eat slow-cooked pork that melts in your mouth, you&#39;ll not enjoy half the joy of laulau.<br>That said, I&#39;ve been coming here since the 1980&#39;s, and have cherished memories of my Grandma &amp; Grandpa enjoying the luau plate.  Little has changed since the days I brought the grandparents - though they&#39;ve both passed on since. (I&#39;m convinced that if they&#39;re eating anything they want up in Heaven, the laulau from Ono&#39;s is a regular item on the heavenly menu.)<br>As a foodie &amp; prvate tour provider, I&#39;ve brought tons of adventure-seeking, traditionalist food fans here, and they always love it too.<br>Mahalo to the family for keeping it the same, and remaining one of the few kama&#39;aina locales committed to the thing your customers love.  Keep the skyscrapers in Kaka&#39;ako &amp; Waikiki, and keep Ono&#39;s on Kapahulu doing the same thing you do!<br>BTW, Anthony Bourdain did a segment on this place on his travel foodshow a few years ago, and he LOVED it. ;)<br>IF YOU GO:  expect parking to be a challenge, expect a line (not terribly bad usually), expect a small dining room with some 11-15 tables, expect nothing fancy at all, expect the tab to run about $15-23/pp depending on what you get, and be nice to the staff and they&#39;ll treat you like family.  And tip appropriately.",

"reviewcomment":"3.5 stars! Overall, this is a good restaurant to eat by Waikiki beach. A bit of a touristy restaurant but it has a good food, friendly service, and relaxing atmosphere. If you&#39;re sitting outside you can enjoy the weather, live band playing, and people dancing and drinking outside. <br><br>Food:<br>A good tip to save money is simply attacking the salad bar that&#39;s included in your entree as your appetizer and dessert. All those pasta salad, couscous, bread, and broccoli are there for your delight. And for dessert, just grab a bunch of fruits like the pineapples and grapes. <br>As for the entrees, I enjoyed my prime rib but I&#39;d go for the fish dish next time because my friends seemed to have enjoyed that more. Consider the prime rib as a safe man dish, go for the ahi tuna and such but don&#39;t order the lobster. The lobsters are supposedly a rip off/imported. Eat more fish and shrimps.<br><br>The service here was nice and friendly. Our waitress read our mind easily when we were going for the salad as appetizer and dessert (I suppose everyone does this). She made good suggestions to my friends and never left my glass of water empty (It can get hot sitting outside).<br><br>This was a good restaurant but it wasn&#39;t my favorite. Eating at Duke&#39;s Malibu may have taken away my experience at Duke&#39;s. The fact that it&#39;s a beach-front restaurant was very nice and the ambiance is more lively in Waikiki than Malibu.",

"reviewcomment":"This place was quite a drive out to the other side of the island but my husband and I had a rental so we figure upon the recommendation of his supervisor who frequently stays on there island, we would stop by and eat as the locals do (or at least those smart enough to discover this gem)<br><br>Now I&#39;m not a huge shrimp fan but who can resist garlic on anything, right?<br><br>So after waiting in line for about 5min, we each decided to get a half order which comes with 6 huge shrimp, rice and a drink (if you use your check in offer) and added a macaroni salad. The shrimp tasted really garlicky, I only wish they had removed the shells and de-vained them for the price you pay. If you wanted the flavor you really had to suck on the shell or it would get removed once you took it off. <br><br>It&#39;s definitely, worth the drive to this part of the island as you get beautiful views while driving of mountains and oceans the entire way there. There are also several other food vendors there so we were able to try a few by sticking to half or smaller portions.",

You have several selections you can choose from (even ones without broth) but I ordered the kake udon and I loved it. <br><br>The place is a bit crowded esp around 7 or 8 but the line does go by rather fast. The set up is like an assembly line. You choose which udon you&#39;d like. What toppings you wabt. And then choose which sides you&#39;d like to have. I got kake udon with shrimp tempura. <br><br>The only bad thing bout this place is the seating. I wish it was bigger or if they could maximize the seating arrangement. Its a bit hard to find seats esp if you&#39;re going with a group during their peak hours.<br><br>We had to eat this place twice while we were in Hawaii. Perfect on any night",

(I&#39;m convinced that if they&#39;re eating anything they want up in Heaven, the laulau from Ono&#39;s is a regular item on the heavenly menu.)<br>As a foodie &amp; prvate tour provider, I&#39;ve brought tons of adventure-seeking, traditionalist food fans here, and they always love it too.<br>Mahalo to the family for keeping it the same, and remaining one of the few kama&#39;aina locales committed to the thing your customers love.  Keep the skyscrapers in Kaka&#39;ako &amp; Waikiki, and keep Ono&#39;s on Kapahulu doing the same thing you do!<br>BTW, Anthony Bourdain did a segment on this place on his travel foodshow a few years ago, and he LOVED it. ;)<br>IF YOU GO:  expect parking to be a challenge, expect a line (not terribly bad usually), expect a small dining room with some 11-15 tables, expect nothing fancy at all, expect the tab to run about $15-23/pp depending on what you get, and be nice to the staff and they&#39;ll treat you like family.  And tip appropriately.",

"reviewcomment":"I am not surprised that Obama chooses to dine here every year. This place perfected everything from service to the food. I came here with my boyfriend and his family to celebrate his and his brother&#39;s birthdays, and so we thought Alan Wong&#39;s would be a fitting place to do a double birthday celebration dinner.<br><br>We were greeted warmly as we entered, and then shown to our table. The restaurant has a very classy ambiance, but still has the friendly Hawaiian attitude that was refreshing. Alan Wong&#39;s cuisine is considered to be a combination of Hawaiian and Asian Fusion, and I was amazed at the level of creativity and flavors of the dishes.<br><br>We started with several appetizers: <br><br>-&#34;Da Bag&#34; (steamed clams with kalua pig, and shiitake mushrooms in a foil bag).<br>Tasty and came out piping hot. The kalua pig was tender, the clams were a bit small but still delicious.<br><br>-Chopped Ahi Sashimi &amp; Avocado Salsa Stack, Stacked on Crispy Won Ton, Spicy Aioli and Wasabi Soy.<br>Delicious!<br><br>-Richard Ha&#39;s Whole Tomato Salad, Li Hing Mui Ume Vinaigrette.<br>My favorite appetizer. It&#39;s basically a sliced tomato surrounded by the most amazing sauce. Very savory and refreshing at the same time.<br><br>We were also served bread with a unique spicy aioli sauce throughout our meal that was a bit addicting. I had to limit myself to just 3 pieces of bread because the sauce was too good!<br><br>For entrees, we ordered:<br><br>-Ginger Crusted Onaga, Long-Tail Red Snapper (with miso sesame vinaigrette, hamakua mushroom &amp; corn)<br>The fish was flavorful, and the vinaigrette was lightly creamy which complemented well. <br><br>-Pan Steamed Opakapaka, Short-Tail Pink Snapper (with shrimp pork hash, truffle nage, gingered vegetables, tapioca pearls)<br><br>-Twice Cooked Short Rib, Soy Braised &amp; Grilled &#34;Kalbi&#34; Style (with gingered shrimp, kochu jang sauce)<br>The meat literally fell apart and was very flavorful. <br><br>For dessert, all 5 of us shared the &#34;The Coconut&#34;, which is a haupia sorbet in a chocolate shell, with tropical fruits and lilikoi sauce. The sorbet complemented very well with the berries and tropical fruits. I loved it! The birthday boys also each received a complimentary chocolate dessert, which was a nice gesture.<br><br>The service itself was exceptional. Our drinks were filled at appropriate times, and each of the servers took the time to explain each dish that was being served. We felt very taken care of throughout the night, and we had a very good experience. I highly recommend Alan Wong&#39;s as an excellent date night option, or for those who want to celebrate for a special occasion.",

Went to Hawaii with my family and tried this place out. This place has got to be the best udon ever. They make their own udon noodles and their broth is just perfect. You have several selections you can choose from (even ones without broth) but I ordered the kake udon and I loved it. <br><br>The place is a bit crowded esp around 7 or 8 but the line does go by rather fast. The set up is like an assembly line. You choose which udon you&#39;d like. What toppings you wabt. And then choose which sides you&#39;d like to have. I got kake udon with shrimp tempura. <br><br>The only bad thing bout this place is the seating. I wish it was bigger or if they could maximize the seating arrangement. Its a bit hard to find seats esp if you&#39;re going with a group during their peak hours.<br><br>We had to eat this place twice while we were in Hawaii. Perfect on any night",

The shrimp tasted really garlicky, I only wish they had removed the shells and de-vained them for the price you pay. If you wanted the flavor you really had to suck on the shell or it would get removed once you took it off. <br><br>It&#39;s definitely, worth the drive to this part of the island as you get beautiful views while driving of mountains and oceans the entire way there.

"reviewcomment":"One of my food missions on my visit to Hawaii was to find great macadamia nut pancakes.  Luckily, we had local connections who took us out to fulfill our food cravings.  <br><br>They told me Boots &amp; Kimo&#39;s is da kin&#39; place for mac nut pancakes and they did not steer me wrong.  They serve banana pancakes with the most awesome mac nut sauce I have ever had - bar none!   These plate size and fluffy pancakes with mac sweet (but not rich) sauce will make you shun butter and syrup forever.  I wish I had some right now! <br><br>The short stack will feed one hungry person.  If you share as a couple, you&#39;ll need to order something else.  Unfortunately, this is where B&amp;K&#39;s comes up a bit short.  The other dishes on the menu are just not up to that pancake standard.  <br><br>I had the Portuguese sausage omelet, which was very pedestrian. Nothing else on the menu seems to justify the wait for a seat, as the place is quite small and wait times can be loooong. <br><br>A few previous Yelpers showed up at 7:30 a.m. and I suppose that&#39;s the only way to avoid the very real crowds. We showed up about 11 a.m. and had to wait an hour.  No way is a very average omelet worth an hour&#39;s wait.   <br><br>If you go for the pancakes and go early, you can&#39;t go wrong. <br><br>WARNING - they close at the lunch hour !!",

The sorbet complemented very well with the berries and tropical fruits. I loved it! The birthday boys also each received a complimentary chocolate dessert, which was a nice gesture.<br><br>The service itself was exceptional. Our drinks were filled at appropriate times, and each of the servers took the time to explain each dish that was being served. We felt very taken care of throughout the night, and we had a very good experience. I highly recommend Alan Wong&#39;s as an excellent date night option, or for those who want to celebrate for a special occasion.",
