"reviewcomment":"An English meal so good on American Thanksgiving that I didn&#39;t even miss home.<br><br>Food: Started with a nice (yet awkwardly sweet) amuse bouche of foie gras foam (very mild) and squid ink on a biscuit. Next we had scallop ceviche with seaweed oil and frozen horseradish. Surprisingly, the cold was a good touch. Cornish turbot was cooked perfectly and plated beautifully. The roast quail with fennel was delectable. For dessert, the sommelier recommended a nice red with the cheese plate we specially assembled. To top it all off, the jelly doughnuts were exquisite.<br><br>Service: The first whiff of the devotion this place had to fine dining is that they didn&#39;t give us coat check tickets - just remembered whose coat belonged to whom. Class. The servers were friendly, talkative, and not uppity at all. <br><br>Ambience: Elegant yet welcoming decor. Dressy and upscale.<br><br>Bottom Line: When searching for an unbeatable meal in central London, look no further than the Ledbury.",

The foie gras was silky and smooth, the beef with bone marrow was incredible and all of the dishes were so beautiful to look at. We were hoping that this restaurant really was as good as the hype and we were not disappointed.",

"reviewcomment":"My boyfriend&#39;s incredibly thoughtful family purchased my boyfriend and I a voucher for what can be described as an incredible evening. Our experience at Petrus can be summed up in one word...Perfection!<br><br>The 100% French staff really looks after you. We definitely felt special. Expect to commit a lot of time to dinning. We were at Petrus for at least 3 hours.<br><br>The portion sizes are ideal. Initially, we thought we would go home hungry....6 courses later....we could barely move. My boyfriend ordered the pheasant. I would suggest you do the same, as he is still talking about it. The chocolate sphere is an absolute must. The dessert presentation can only be described as &#34;magic&#34;. Once you have dessert at Petrus, you will understand. Save room for the fantastic tea and chocolates.<br><br>The décor was a bit modern for my taste, but the food and the dining experience more than makes up for it.<br><br>I would consider Gordon Ramsay&#39;s Petrus a London must!",

"reviewcomment":"Had the opportunity to come here for Valentine&#39;s Day. It is by far one of the best restaurants in the world. Things to take note of is that this restaurant and it&#39;s staff/chefs are extremely well trained. The design of the restaurant is simple and elegant, allowing for the service and food to shine.<br><br>- The service staff is phenomenal. They are attentive, courteous, and very knowledgeable. They seem to make it a priority to anticipate your needs. It is almost as if they can read your mind. Their timing and delivery of service is impeccable.<br><br>- The cooks/chefs have food put together and delivered in appropriate time. Every dish was always spot-on, well plated, eye catching, and of course delicious beyond words. Every item we received from the menu had obviously been very well thought out. Flavors worked/melded in a way that accented the ingredients used to develop a symphony of deliciousness. Though I enjoyed every dish, the one item that would consistently bring me back to the UK and this restaurant would definitely be their ravioli of lobster, langoustine and salmon in a light bisque with lemongrass and chervil velouté. That is bar none, one of the most wonderful things I have ever had. I was literally licking that plate clean. <br><br>In my experience with all the restaurants that I have visited in the world, this is by far one of the front runners and very deserving of it&#39;s Michelin stars. The service is a dream and the food is so wonderful that I doubt even the magic of a unicorn and skilled fingers of Santa&#39;s elves could possibly make any better. Bravo Mr. Ramsay, bravo.",

I&#39;ve been remiss in not posting my very positive review of Viajante earlier and Nuno Mendes has now left the restaurant!<br><br>Despite its Michelin starred status, the staff are very relaxed and it&#39;s nice to see so many tattoos, piercings and individual hairstyles.

"reviewcomment":"What a great dining experience! The food and services are both top notch. My friend and I went for the 7 course tasting menu. We started with chestnut and juniper gnocchi with chestnut and truffle veloute. It was very tasty and I can just take a whole bowl of the veloute sauce as a soup course. Next we have a pan-friend fillet of cod. For main, we had two types of lamb, slow cooked neck of lamb and nice piece of loin. I have to say the portion was quite generous. Another thing that is worth mentioning is the bread. The whole time when we were enjoying the differences courses, we were given several choices of tasty warm bread. My friend and I liked the bread so much, we totally ODed on it. So by the time we finished the main, we were ready to call it quit. However, we still have some more exciting surprises coming our way. <br><br>I love the cheese course. The two types of cheese were great, but the killer was how the crackers were presented to us. The restaurant cracker holders custom made from olive tree. So this course was like a cool piece of art work presented on our table. Then for dessert, we had white chocolate tart what was more like a slice of creme brulee. Then there was petits fours, basically 4 little bites of chocolates and sweets. We thought we were done and our lovely waiter brought on several cute donut balls and some best tasting caneles. <br><br>Be prepared to spend a solid 3 hours there to enjoy your meal. And expect great food and exceptional services. Highly recommend it.",

"reviewcomment":"This restaurant was truly outstanding, one of the best dining experiences of my life. Our reservation was a bit on the early side (6:30 on a Saturday night). When we arrived, we were the only table in the resaturant. Usually I hate that, but this time was different.<br><br>We sat down, the head chef came over and greeted us, and asked us if we would like to do the &#34;carte blanche&#34; chef&#39;s choice tasting menu. We opted for this, and he asked us several questions about our likes and dislikes. He then personally made wine recommendations based on what he was going to bring out. When we ordered more wine halfway through the meal, he came out again and guided us on wine selections based on the remaining dishes. It was awesome!<br><br>As each subsequent dish came out, I thought it was the best one yet, only to be further amazed. We had oysters, scallops, venison, pasta, canapes, crab, and a host of others I&#39;m now forgetting. Every bite was perfection.<br><br>This chef and restaurant have a big future. I implore you - GO THERE!!!",

"reviewcomment":"My boyfriend and I ate here purely because of the Yelp rating and proximity to our hotel. The restaurant was under construction in the front so it was hard to see the name at night, but once we entered I really loved the atmosphere / decor and quickly forgot about the exterior.<br><br>We ordered the lemon rice, prawn masala, mango curry, malabar paratha, and pachadi. We also received some complimentary appetizers. Everything was absolutely delicious. My least favorite would probably be the prawn masala (I heard they were well-known for their seafood but this is probably for a different dish), but everything else was very flavorful and filling. I typically eat bread with my yogurt and the malabar paratha/pachadi mix was great - the pineapple and pomegranate mix balanced out the yogurt, which paired very well with our spicy dishes. I was skeptical about lemon rice (I was considering ordering the Tomato rice) but I&#39;m glad I went with it; the lemon rice and mango curry went very well together.<br><br>Throughout our meal, we had several different waiters serving us and asking about our experience, which was a bit confusing but I suppose better this than having no service at all :)<br><br>While ordering, I indicated that we only wanted the small prawn masala dish but we got charged for the large. I noted this to (one of) our server who immediately apologized and adjusted our bill. The manager (?) also apologized on our way out while holding the door open for us. I really appreciated this act of customer service.<br><br>Overall, I had a lovely time and would recommend this restaurant.",

"reviewcomment":"Simply Awesome! Go here and feast!<br><br>Located in the Fulham residental area, this unassuming pub can easily fool the eye. Looking like many of the pubs around, this is one of the few pubs to hold a Michelin Star. Came here on a Sunday, so appropriately so, a Sunday roast is required. They had 2 on the menu, one as part of the specials (Venison) and the standard one (Beef). Each of the roast are recommended for 2 people and with 4 in our group, we had to get both. Here&#39;s the rundown:<br><br>Starters:<br>Bread<br>Eat the Soda Bread. It&#39;s that damn good.<br><br>Butternut squash soup with squid and garlic<br>This was amazing. It came in a small shot glass-like cups and was savory and succulent. Only wished there was more as it was a great instrument to cut through all the meats.<br><br>Harwood Arms Scotch Eggs<br>Not on the menu during our visit, but we ordered it and you should too. I haven&#39;t had scotch eggs before so I couldn&#39;t compare against anything, but this was also quite good. Slicing through the egg allowed for the gooey beautiful yolk to ooze onto the outer meat layer. <br><br>Roasts:<br>Beef<br>Beautiful pink center with an outer ring. Along with the beef&#39;s own jus, it was melt in your mouth goodness. <br><br>Venison<br>This was wrapped in bacon to keep the venison nice and moist. It also added a salty-sweetness to the game meat. Having the soup along with the venison was a great interplay to cut through the meat.<br><br>Along with the huge pieces of meat come several accompaniments. All very good in their own as well.<br><br>Accompaniments: <br>Crispy Garlic Potatoes<br>Nice potatoes that served a nice textural difference. Not only that, they were darn good with the garlic essence and spices.<br><br>Cheese Cauliflower<br>A very flavorful and another addition to the cutting through the richness of the meat.<br><br>Mushrooms &amp; Beets<br>Two separate sides, but both roasted and just simply good.<br><br>This was a lot of food and I&#39;m still missing several sides. You&#39;ll need to come extra hungry in order to be even close to finishing this behemoth of a meal. With that said, all the food was excellent and I would recommend everything above and anything else you can fit in your stomach. Absolutely amazing.",

"reviewcomment":"First things first, I was here last year and had the rabbit, which is now ruined for me. Because after you&#39;ve eaten at The Square, whatever type of meat/seafood you ate there will forever make you a snob. That&#39;s right, I can not eat rabbit anywhere else now, because they rocked my world.<br><br>The restaurant atmosphere is sophisticated and very formal. There&#39;s a dress code in place, and eating was a little stiff. This isn&#39;t the type of place that would welcome walk-ins. <br><br>The starter bread was delicious, as they come around with a selection for you to chose. The appetizers were delightful and beautifully arranged, and light enough that you wouldn&#39;t worry about filling up fast.<br><br>Then you have your main course. This place is michelin rated for a reason. The balance of flavors was wonderful, they give you just enough to satisfy, but not enough to gorge yourself on.<br><br>And then the dessert was a light touching after. Perfectly balanced. <br><br>Go, dress up, eat, and enjoy. You don&#39;t eat a meal like this every day, it&#39;s something to be savored and really a pleasure to have dined here.<br><br>Also, even though I&#39;m not big on wine. The list was superb.",

"reviewcomment":"Launceston Place is probably the best budget up scale dinning experience I&#39;ve ever had in London. Which is the reason why I visit it at least once when ever in London. <br><br>Price-wise I think this is the place to beat in terms of quality and creativity among the one star Michelin places in London.  One might find the lunch set menu somewhat limited but for the price asked I&#39;ll still believe it offers a great variety. Considering the fact you are spoiled with Amuse-bouche in between your set lunch courses it is plenty of food and variety one might desire especially if one prefers the lunch to be a somewhat lighter meal of the day. <br>Still for those who prefer a bigger variety LP offers a market menu that is utterly satisfying and still a good bang for the buck. This intricate menu is where I for instance found my favourite starter of all time; The Cornish Mackerel. <br><br>The attentive, but never in your face, staff offer great service and friendly accommodation that together with the food and the cool ambiance of the restaurant makes me believe this is a place hungry and striving for another Michelin star. And I for one think they should and deserve to get it.",

"reviewcomment":"It&#39;s Monday. I got wasted at the Arc De Triomphe all day yesterday. Won a bit of money. What better way to nurse my hangover and squander my winnings than treating me and the missus to Chiswick&#39;s finest? (Hedone-ists wincing)<br>12.30 booking, only one other table occupied, the Maitre d&#39; gave us our pick of the tables. Loving that. Bench seat. In the corner. Sorted. By 1pm the restaurant was three quarters full so that made it extra nice. <br>Comfy surroundings. Smart but not formal. Friendly greetings. Again, not formal but certainly not overly casual. Just right.<br>Menu. Modern French. Full of deliciousness. To start I had Char-grilled skate with mussels, sag aloo, yoghurt, tamarind and mango. The missus had Crisp red mullet with pine nuts, moscatel grape vinaigrette, parmesan and chervil. My skate wing was perfect. Perfectly trimmed, perfectly cooked, perfectly spiced potato and spinach. One of those dishes you eat slowly so as to keep it in the world for as long as possible before the duodenum gets going on it. Red Mullet is not my favourite but this was also lovely. The fat alcohol soaked raisins really made it.<br>Wiped the plate clean with rosemary bread and walnut bread which worked a treat. The walnut bread had a hint of sweetness which really helped. The rosemary bread bitter and with a perfect crust. Both moist and fresh.<br>Mains. Hard choice but I went for the Braised rabbit leg &#34;saltimbocca&#34; with potato gnocchi, cavolo nero, mushroom purée and sage. The missus ummed and aahed about being adventurous before deciding on the old favourite, salmon. Baked organic salmon with salmon mousseline, salmon and dill chowder to be precise. <br>I was presented with three rounds of beautifully cooked rabbit, each on their own bed of mushroom puree. I think the puree might have been made with parsnip, not sure, but there was a strong woodland mushroom flavour which really went well with the rabbit. The sauce was an unctuous reduction. If there was anything to be critical about it might be that for me the reduction was a little too thick and glossy. I&#39;d prefer it to have been slightly less cloying but the taste was great. Well seasoned too.  Missus didn&#39;t want to taste it. She used the excuse that it was wrapped in parma ham but its really because she doesn&#39;t like eating fluffy bunny. Gambolling spring lamb is still fine, mind. I don&#39;t remember the cavolo nero but I bet it was well nice. <br>The missus&#39;s salmon screamed spring. Shame it&#39;s autumn. The dill chowder seemed to me to be a veloute made with dill. Not sure there were any chowder spices there. And the salmon bits surrounding the main piece didn&#39;t add much. Except more delicious salmon which I suppose is nothing to moan about. I didn&#39;t notice a mousseline, but maybe she quaffed it all. The peas added a pleasing taste and colour and despite my negativity to parts of the dish, the whole was lovely. Most importantly the salmon fillet was bursting with flavour and cooked to perfection. Too shy to order yet more bread but not shy enough to refrain from using the finger, both plates were duly cleaned and ready for the next diner before they left our table.<br>A glass of Spanish white for me to dampen down the DTs and a glass of Gavi for the missus washed it all down well. Pudding on a Mon? A bridge too far even though they looked superb and would only have added £4 to the menu.<br>Left the place feeling that we had had a really special meal and paid £65 for the privilege. Top top meal and excellent value.<br>We&#39;re lucky to have such a restaurant round these parts. You&#39;d imagine having to go a lot further into town to get that sort of consistent quality. Yes there are a lot of posh West London folk in there, and it&#39;s a slightly older vibe but if you can get over that this place is a gem. I went in like a dishevelled tramp and nobody batted an eyelid. Here&#39;s to spur of the moment hangover cures and La Trompette.",

I see a little fusion in the dishes but it makes it even better.

The service was top notch and the guests all look really good and mostly local...<br>If you&#39;ve been to Hakkasan in NYC I would say that the one is London is so much better...  <br>dim sum &amp; sea bass = must try",

"reviewcomment":"Galvin at Windows, featuring head chef Joo Won, is a gorgeous Michelin-starred restaurant overlooking Hyde Park in the London Hilton at Park Lane. The staff is knowledgeable, friendly, and even playful for such a usually serious atmosphere. One of our servers was a bit overbearing, but she lightened up by the end.<br><br>We were lucky enough to get a reservation right by the windows! I wish we came during a greener season, but the view was still beautiful.<br><br>We had their set lunch menu with a starter, main course, and dessert. Fortunately, there were 5 of us, so we had a great family-style tasting of each dish.<br><br>One of the starters, seared scallop with caviar had a rich, buttery foam and could have passed for an entree. It was so great. The smoked haddock fritters, Moroccan couscous &amp; lemon yogurt were my second favorite starter.<br><br>My risotto was a bit too rich/creamy for my taste, but a side of their seasoned carrots and lightly dressed salad really evened things out.<br><br>I highly recommend this place -- the set menu is delicious and does not require you to put out a lot of money for what you get. Yum! They even gave us postcards to send to our friends/family, and sent them off for us!",

"reviewcomment":"A big thank you to my friend Hilary who treated me to a slap up pre-birthday dinner here at Apsleys. Knowing that I&#39;m a bit of a foodie, she was pleased and I was impressed that she came up with a Michelin starred restaurant, which wasn&#39;t on my radar<br><br>The brainchild of Heinz Beck, who runs the 3 Michelin starred La Pergola in Rome, Apsleys is based in the Lanesborough Hotel. Obviously a classy establishment, the Lanesborough has a home away from home feel in the lobby with tables replacing the check in counter and china vases everywhere<br><br>The dining room is stunning and Venetian inspired with a high glass roof, 3 huge chandeliers and plush seating. The Italian waiting staff were however very friendly and Hilary and I appreciated the professionally casual and non-overbearing feel to the service<br><br>A generous tray of different breads was served with an extra virgin olive oil and sea salt to dip them in. Our favourite was the poppy seed bread. Onto the tasting menu<br><br>1. Amuse bouche<br>We heard it as quail egg but was in fact a quail leg, which was served as a lollipop and fried in thin batter. Served hot, it was a great single bite to start the meal on the right note<br><br>2. Tuna &amp; veal<br>Wow!! Our favourite dish of the evening. Seared loin of  tuna with veal jelly containing sharp accents within it and tuna snow. What may have seemed initially like strange bedfellows were perfect companions. Clean flavours<br><br>3. Scallops, liquorice, smoked potatoes puree, fennel and pink grapefruit<br>The scallop was big and juicy with a perfect sear on the outside but the accompaniments were a little too similar for me. Would have appreciated maybe another flavour like citrus in there or perhaps a different texture<br><br>4. Fagottelli carbonara<br>One of Chef Beck&#39;s signature dishes, the fagottelli are llittle pillows of thin pasta encasing a molten mix of carbonara flavours. Wonderfully intense flavours and the word pillow is apt as they&#39;re so light<br><br>5. Wild seabass in fine herbs crust with sweet red pepper and &#34;S.Marzano&#34;<br>The star of this dish was in fact the sweet red pepper and S.Marzano tomato sauce - you could almost taste the sunshine stored up in those vegetables<br><br>6. Wild mushroom infusion with balsamic roasted goose foie gras<br>OK, with me and foie gras, you can&#39;t really go wrong, except for serving me too little foie gras! They didn&#39;t make that mistake here with a large slab of seared foie gras in a broth of fresh wild mushrooms.<br><br>7. Organic &#34;Rhug&#34; saddle of lamb with Mediterranean flavours<br>Nice tender sous vide lamb was the star of the plate<br><br>8. Milk chocolate, coconut and pineapple sorbets<br>An OK dessert, most of which was repeated on a special happy birthday plate from the kitchen<br><br>We had some nice petit fours to finish off the meal. A good start to the birthday celebration season",

The white bread of the barbecue pork bun was soft and light. <br>Even though the prices are exorbitant because you can pay 1/4 of the price for the same quality in China, in London this will the best it gets for quality dim-sum along with a great atmosphere.",

"reviewcomment":"We made it back to Zafferano a few months ago and were fortunate to be there while they had a black truffle menu.  The tagliolini truffle was out of this world.  Buttery, creamy, amazing with the flavor and texture contrast of the black truffle.  And they did not spare any truffle.  The Carpaccio I had as an appetizer was good but the meat was too thick for my taste.  I prefer a thinner carpaccio but again the flavor was great and there was a ton of black truffle on the plate so I could hardly complain about that!<br><br>We had a 2007 brunello with dinner that was very nice and opened up after about 30 minutes",

"reviewcomment":"Some highly rated restaurants can be a disappointment.  Hibiscus, which boasts two Michelin stars, is most definitely not one of them.  On a recent visit, 3 friends of mine and I had a quite superb meal. <br><br>Located in a small central London side street off Regent Street, south of Oxford Street and Hanover Square, Hibiscus is one of those restaurants that might be easy to overlook.  Its exterior is unprepossessing.  Indeed, the building looks more like a suite of offices from the outside than a high quality French restaurant.  The interior is small.  There is a reception desk and a very small seating area just inside the door.  Beyond that is the dining room, which again is not large.  It is, however, intimate, cosy and welcoming.  <br><br>The food is stunningly good.  My friends and I opted for the six-course Tasting Menu.  Part of the fun of having that is that there are no details on the menu of what you are about to eat. It&#39;s all a real surprise (although the waiters do make discreet enquiries beforehand about allergies and particular dislikes, presumably to ensure that any unnecessary disappointments are avoided).  Everything we ate was wonderful.  I would single out a pea veloute flavoured with curry and buttermilk (a sort of refined pea soup); a chicken dish with liquorice and banana flavours; and a caramelised light chocolate tart with a lemon sorbet.  We had a very good, and a reasonably-priced, red wine that was recommended by the sommelier.  It was deliciously smooth.  The post dinner coffee was accompanied by mouthwatering chocolate and assorted petits fours.  All in all, it was a superb meal.  Not surprisingly, such excellent fare does not come cheaply. The bill was £130 per person!  But it was well worth it.  The service was excellent.  <br><br>Hibiscus is one of the best restaurants I have ever been to.  It&#39;s undoubtedly worth a visit for that special occasion or when you just feel like spoiling yourself.",

"reviewcomment":"I&#39;ve always thought Angela Hartnett a bit of a miserable old sour puss when I&#39;ve seen her on telly.<br>But after our visit to Murano I see her in a new light.<br>Generous hostess, some lovely quirks and no little style. And a bit of a forward thinker maybe too. The sour puss has had a total gok makeover in my mind.<br>From the outside it&#39;s pretty unspectacular, nestled in an ugly unkempt building. Not what you&#39;d maybe hope for from a Mayfair joint.<br>But once inside that all changes. The place has a feeling of space though it&#39;s not big. Low lights, lush furnishings, big tables. Lovely. I don&#39;t know how to describe the decor. It&#39;s part old, part stylish, part quirky. It&#39;s different for sure and it makes you feel like sinking into your comfy chair for the night.<br>The greeting is warm and friendly but remains professional and smart at all times. You feel like you&#39;re on a night out.<br>The menu is a dream. It&#39;s split into bits. Starters, mains, more substantial mains and puddings. But the thing is, and get this, you can choose what you want from any bit and what size you want it to be. It almost blew my mind. <br>I read the menu and said to the missus that I could have all the first three things on there. And she told me &#39;well have them then!&#39; Joy. That&#39;s exactly what I did.<br>Three courses. A scallop cervice. Followed by an octupus salad. Followed by Quail with iberico ham. All fantastic. beautifully delivered and served. full of flavour. Perfect. And this after we devoured a plate of moist tender charcuterie with great sourdough. This was on the house. <br>In fact it was too much food, but we weren&#39;t complaining.<br>The missus had some lamb and goats cheese cream which was also divine. I can&#39;t remember what else. But it was all divine. And served by people only too happy to natter to two slightly drunk fools.<br>The sommelier was ever so helpful and recommended a great bottle of wine. We didn&#39;t really want to leave if truth be told. a beautiful night.<br>I noticed there&#39;s some sort of big table at the back. Is it a chef&#39;s table? That would be fun. The place was buzzing too, full up throughout our time there, but always maintained a sense of calm too. A perfect balance.<br>The bill wasn&#39;t cheap. But it was worth every penny and if you&#39;re out on a treat like we were, I can&#39;t recommend highly enough.<br>And the great thing is, because of the ingenious way the menu is devised you can do it far more reasonably than we did. <br>Two courses £50.00<br>Three Courses £65.00<br>Four Courses £75.00<br>Five Courses £85.00<br>Good old Angela. She&#39;s no sour puss. She can&#39;t be if she&#39;s in charge of a great place like this.",

Im convinced he must be talking about the wrong place, as this is NOT a place where you can wander in drunk and NOTHING on the menu is that cheap.<br><br>My boyfriend brought me here for some sort of deal or special he found. The experience left us both flabbergasted. Everything was perfect. The staff and service, albeit a bit pretentious, was impeccable. The presentation and food were stunning, and the wine was to die for. Easily out best meal in London--and yes, one of us has been to a Gordon Ramsey restaurant.<br><br>We were supposed to get a 3 course selection, but it turned into a generous 7 or 8 course tasting menu--and the portions for the 3 courses we ordered were larger than expected. We started with a selection of fresh breads and butters--and I melted over the foie gras butter--and the prestarter (something with potato and anchovy) then starter (he had quail with some sort of ice thing, I had fantastic clams and mussels). I enjoyed my entree of Fish of the Day, but we both liked his entree--a selection of fried stuffed pork with chorizo--better. Then came a pre-dessert of red berries with a small sponge cake, then dessert (I had a powerful chocolate cigar with a coffee ice thing, he had passionfruit creme), and finally perfect chocolate truffles to finish it off.<br><br>Overall, simply perfection.",

"reviewcomment":"The best Japanese restaurant I have ever been to in my entire life!<br>Tucked away in this inconspicuous non-dodgy little alley off of extravagant<br>Bond Street, is this beautiful James-Bond-esque feel of a restaurant.  <br>If there was an award given out for restaurant main entrance doors, this would get first first place in my book. Very exclusive, very small (portions and seating), very expensive, and very intimate! I have come here about four times in total, and each time for a special occasion. The service is unparalleled to that of any other. Each plate looks like an art piece and tastes like nothing you&#39;ve ever had before. The flavors are fresh from Japan with some tastes of the authentic old and sublime new. They even import their drinking water from Japan! Just don&#39;t come here on an empty stomach because you wont leave feeling full or you&#39;ll end up breaking the bank trying to!",

I never spend this much on food normally, but it was a friend&#39;s birthday and I wanted to eat at a 3 Michelin star restaurant, so I went for it!<br><br>The ambience was nice, the service excellent....ok, now let&#39;s talk about what really matters: the food!<br><br>Course 1: Chestunt veloute with bacon and snails. THE BEST DANG SOUP I HAVE EVER HAD. Period.<br><br>Course 2: Fish of some sort? Can&#39;t remember exactly, but I know it had chestnuts and israeli artichokes. <br><br>Course 3: Yule log.<br><br>Washed down with 2 glasses of superb wine. The meal also came with bread, cheese puffs of some sort, butter, chive sour cream, macaroons, petit fours, and caramels.<br><br>Pro Tip: Don&#39;t make the mistake of thinking the champagne can be substituted for a glass of wine. We did, and it cost us a pretty penny.",

I ordered 6-course, but it came with additional 6 snacks and 1 dessert. So it was 6 snacks + 6 courses + 1 dessert. The taste was amazing and creative. Highly recommended!!!! <br><br>The menu was wrapped by an very old version of Charles Dickens&#39;s Oliver Twist. Waiters and chef were 101% nice and friendly. They would explain every dish to you and answer your questions. It is close to London Bridge tube station and 5 minutes walking from the Tower Bridge. <br><br>Happy food travel!",

"reviewcomment":"OK, after some debate this gets 5 stars. If I was comparing with the other Michelin starred places I&#39;ve been this would get a 4 but in comparison restaurants in general in London the experience easily deserves a 5.<br><br>I think you should go to this restaurant - it felt suitable for many occasions (Sunday dinner with the girlfriend, losing your Michelin virginity, work celebration, etc.) so you have no excuse. <br><br>The 2 biggest positives for me were the main course and the price. We went for dinner on a Sunday and had 3 courses for 30 quid - in terms of value I would challenge someone to find a decent restaurant in the city for this much, let alone one with a star. This on it&#39;s own probably warrants a visit.<br><br>The poussin was the star of my meal. I&#39;m a big fan of having things served different ways, and the 3 pieces of poussin on my plate were delicious, as was the sauteed spatzle which seems to be very popular at the moment. My girlfriend&#39;s lamb was equally impressive and any diner would be happy with both.<br><br>The starter and desserts for me were ok, but not as memorable (I had to refresh my memory from the menu). The crab raviolo (I like their attention to grammatical detail), and the cannele were very good intricate cooking, but I just didn&#39;t find them to be up there with the all round quality of the main course.",

"reviewcomment":"I think I got a pretty good seat with a view of most people in the dining room. And it&#39;s a big room too. So looking at these people and listening to their conversations were my entertainment for this evening. Oh and the 9 course meal too was awesome.<br><br>After all, eating by myself does suck a majority of the time, but you can make a game out of it, like listening to other people talk or gawking at that nice and pretty Asian hostess lady with the British accent or just smelling those nice unpasteurized cheeses nearby.<br><br>This place can be nice and intimate, but it does get loud too. But they separate you far enough so you can enjoy your dinner with your company, or in my case, just by myself. <br><br>The chairs that you sit on will probably make you fall asleep. And with all that food in your system, it will only exacerbate the situation. The expresso helps out a bit. But you&#39;re here to relax and splurge a little bit. So go for the tasting menu. Go for the 9 course Signature meal, and maybe sit up straight so the chair doesn&#39;t get ya.<br><br>So yah, they do deserve their Michelin star rating for 2012. Remember, your paying in £, so I recommend saving a penny or two and then go all out...ahhh yeah!!<br><br>Oh, by the way, if you need your foie gras fix, then get it here. One of the best I&#39;ve had so far. Nice, chilled and fatty. You can definitely taste that duck being force fed with the best ingredients ever.<br><br>Michelin 2 stars in 2012",

"reviewcomment":"Lima was recommended to me by two friends. I heard that since it got a Michelin Star, it has been quite hard to get a booking. I tried several times and finally got one on a week night. <br><br>I was quite excited to try it and I have to say I was impressed. The restaurant itself is quite relaxed and understated which I really like. The services are warm and personal. I guess the South American attitude prevails here. <br><br>The restaurant serves updated Peruvian food. Don&#39;t expect to find Lomo Saltado or Anticucho. However, Ceviche you can feast on and it is done right here. My friend and I ordered sea bream ceviche which was perfectly &#34;cooked&#34; in lime juice: fresh, firm and flavorful. We also had the octopus and quinoa with purple olive sauce. The plating of this dish was beautiful and the purple olive was a taste I experienced for the first time. We got the raw tuna with purple potatoes as well. It was delicious and purple potatoes were something you don&#39;t get to eat everyday. For main course, we shared a suckling pig and Amazon fish. The pork dish was nice, but the Amazon fish was totally amazing! According to our waiter, the fish was native to the Amazon and was freshly shipped in. The preparation of the dish was also quite unusual. The fish was cooked in Seaweed butter which gave it a slight sweet taste. And besides other seasonings, the surprising element was cocoa. I guess this has the similar effect as the Mole sauce, but I have only seen Mole sauce used with heavier meat like beef. Cooking delicate fish in cocoa takes guts. I guess that is why the restaurant has that Michelin star, they experiment and push the boundary. The fish dish definitely the highlight of the meal and I couldn&#39;t have enough of it. We were full by the time we fished our main course, so we will have to come back to try the desserts another time.",

On this occasion I went to attend an event which was part of the Spitalfields Winter Music Festival -- it combined a three course meal with Medieval and Victorian Christmas carols sung in-between the courses by a small live choir (around 5 or 6 people).  Needless to say the venue is perfect for a Christmas event.<br><br>I&#39;d ordered a vegetarian meal in advance (no meat but fish ok) and was well pleased with the offering of poached pear starter and filet of John Dory main.<br>I&#39;m waiting for another reason to return, perhaps next time I&#39;ll check out their prix fixe weekend lunch.",
