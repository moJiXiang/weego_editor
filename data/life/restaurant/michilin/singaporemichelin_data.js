"reviewcomment":"Beautiful restaurant located in the historical district near Chinatown. We were visiting Singapore but had my uncle book a table for me in advance. The olive tree in front of the building reminded me of South of France, the restaurant was minimalist and tastefully designed more like what I expected of a restaurant this caliber versus Iggy&#39;s. <br><br>When we checked in we were sent upstairs, we were seated in this narrow hallway with a bunch of tables it was quite crowded considering the experience we hope to have. We were seated next to this couple the lady looked like she just woke up in shorts and Tshirt. The man armed with a giant camera clicking away at the dishes, and they kept asking for extra things. The server explained the concept quickly and they started bringing in dish upon dish. Our sommelier was very knowledgeable I narrowed a few choices and he provided more information each one. We opted for a cailbourdin pouilly-fume triptyque for the courses. <br><br>Each course was beautifully presented, designed and taste-wise most of the courses were light and subtle. The various elements and textures were very intriguing. There was a course of charcoal - a fried fritter that looked like one of the charcoal pieces in the dish it was very tasty. My favorite dish was Chef Andre&#39;s signature it was a foie gras &#34;chawanmushi&#34; and a black Perigord truffle coulis - absolutely amazing dish! <br><br>Overall I wish the service was a bit slower it felt rushed. Also the tables were too close to each other, I was distracted from my meal because people on the left and right of us talked loudly and frequently. <br><br>Our server he was very nice he took us on a tour per our request we saw the kitchen and we met with Chef Andre.",

"reviewcomment":"I love Tim Ho Wan. Great tim sum at affordable prices! Like everything in life that is awesome, there&#39;s gotta be a catch and at Tim Ho Wan it&#39;s the queue. Sadly, one of the things I hate most in life is waiting. Such a waste of time when we have such fleeting lives! I think of all the unproductive hours people waste in queues and it makes me want to cry!!! I do my best to avoid them... But I really do want those Baked Bun with BBQ Pork!!! They taste like perfect little bo lo baos - a pillowy soft bread with a crunchy and sugary top crust which looks like a biscuit. So I go either super early (before they open) or super late (just before they close). This means having an early lunch or late dinner (9pm) but that&#39;s a sacrifice I am willing to make. <br><br>You know it&#39;s not dim sum until there&#39;s Har Gao, Siew Mai and Chee Cheong Fun (Prawn) on the table! These are a few of my favorite items for dim sum. They do it well but I wouldn&#39;t say they are lightyears ahead of their competitors here. These are pretty standard simple dishes to make and most decent dim sum places make these well too! <br><br>Service-wise, I am thoroughly impressed with the lighting speed of their servers and chefs. It&#39;s scary how efficient Chinese people are (especially those working in Chinese restaurants). The only other place I&#39;ve witness such efficiency is at Ding Tai Fung. I am convinced the bottleneck is not in the kitchen or with the service... it&#39;s simply that customers cannot chew and swallow their food fast enough! Hence, the lines. Sadly, if only humans had wider esophagus and didn&#39;t feel the need to make small talk over meals. Just kidding!",

"reviewcomment":"If you fancy something different from the usual Chinese dishes you get at those Chinese restaurants, Bosses is the place you may want to give a try. The restaurant is furnished in black, and possibly had its name inspired by the mafia in Hong Kong, commonly known as Hak Se Wui (literally translates to Black Society). You will not only find Cantonese items on the menu, you will also find some Shanghainese food items. In particular, the dim sum items are hot favorites as what is served at Bosses is probably more exquisite than what you commonly get outside. I highly recommend you to try the signature flowy custard buns, as well as the seafood congee (forgot the exact name of the dish). The ingredients used are fresh, and definitely very very tasty!<br><br>What&#39;s more, it&#39;s got a pretty nice and relaxed atmosphere, contrary to its name. The staff are nice and attentive too, which gives the overall experience an A! The only downside is the cost. The things are slightly pricey, so be prepared to pay a little more.<br><br>Worth it or not? Well, you can be the boss.",

Loved the high tea!! <br><br>My mom came to town from nyc and I took her to gardens by the bay so we stopped by here for champagne and high tea. Surprisingly reasonably priced for everything you get. I got 2 glasses of champagne, a flower tea, and the small bites from 1 order of the high tea menu, all of which was more than adequate for my mother and I. <br><br>I believe the bill came out to $80. Considering booze is expensive and Pollen is normally an expensive restaurant, I didn&#39;t think that was too pricey for 2 people with booze included. Definitely worth a try for the high tea menu!",

"reviewcomment":"Words like &#34;overrated&#34;, &#34;not worth a visit&#34; roll off the tongues of Tim Ho Wan&#39;s naysayers. Sure, you can cavil at its operations --long waiting time; service standards which at times can be sublime for a casual eatery-- but one thing you cannot deny: most of its dim sum dishes are laudable. Three other outlets have sprung up in just one year following the launch of the flagship at Plaza Singapura in April 2013. What was believed to be initial hype surrounding the then nascent outlet has yet to peter out. Snaking queues are still a common sight on a weekday morning and the establishment experiences an endless flurry of activity from day to night.<br><br>Surely the establishment is getting its dim sum right. The following dishes make me a willing repeat customer. <br><br>The Baked Bun with BBQ Pork ($4.50) is simply sui generis. The exterior is a sweet, crumbly dome. Pry into it and wisps of steam will billow --a positive sign. How hot a dim sum dish is when it is served is a litmus test: cold dim sum will never measure up.  What then ensues is the outflow of luxurious pork filling. Sweet but not cloying, the meat is diced into petite cubes.<br><br>I have been to Tim Ho Wan several times now and it is just so fun watching my friends take their first bites of the mother of all buns. A glint enters their eyes and excitement sweeps their faces... that is usually followed by coos and nods of approval. For all dim sum aficionados, this is the one dish you have to savour.  <br><br>One caveat: this bun has ruined all other char siew buns for me and it will do the same to you. Once, I feted it to my tutee; week after week he would not stop raving about it. No longer do I deign to put in my mouth that starchy, out-of-the-box version they serve at coffeeshops.<br><br>Read: <a href='/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Faldenboon.com%2Fbon-vivant-on-the-lamb%2F2014%2F3%2F2%2Ftimhowan&amp;s=56b506fe22630c13b041a07f11af5401e0d536480452c421496ee30bbc0f2bc7' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>aldenboon.com/bon-vivant…</a>",

"reviewcomment":"3.5*, closer to 4*<br><br>My mom really loved Tao&#39;s and went there for dinner quite often, so my sister and I decided to bring her to Dozo&#39;s for her birthday dinner since we heard it&#39;s by the same group.<br><br>Service was great, attentive (like Tao&#39;s), although the servers were forgetful: they forgot my mom&#39;s lavender tea, put the wrong number of candles on the cake, and to return my lighter. Still, they were things I could overlook since they had put us in a good mood.<br><br>7 courses. Food-wise, it was just okay overall. The starter was good. I did enjoy the sashimi came next as well, which was very fresh. The Tempura Battered Soft Shell Crab after looked really nice, but taste-wise... it tasted like extra oily fish keropok? It was the dish I enjoyed least. Japanese Miso Soup was passable, had occasional tiny bits of salmon inside (slightly smaller than half a cm each). I probably would not have gotten miso soup if my mom didn&#39;t insist I try it so I could compare it to the one she makes! I had the Kurubuta (did they mis-spell?) pork for the main, pork was nice, the &#34;jam(?)&#34; on top was way too thick, I had to scrape a lot of it off. It was nice though. Desert was the Freshly Baked Warm Chocolate, it was like a normal lava cake. Drink was the mocktail, it was okay, similar feeling to the ones at Tao&#39;s, but smaller portion. As I had given feedback at Tao&#39;s before, tasted a bit like the syrup you get with candied fruit. Oh yeah. I also liked the fried soba sticks at the start!<br><br>Presentation was also nice, although (okay, I&#39;m nitpicking), one of my plates was chipped. Nice ambiance as well, it&#39;s nice for small birthdays or dates. One gripe is that I think it&#39;s time they changed some of the chairs - they&#39;re so well sat on that you can feel the woodwork since the cushion is all compressed already.<br><br>Overall, I&#39;d say it was an average meal, maybe 3* because I didn&#39;t feel like it was worth the price in terms of quality. Quantities were just right. However, I may have simply ordered the wrong dishes, because my sister enjoyed her meal. My mom found it okay as well (but my mom is pickier than I am). However, bumping it up a but because I did like the staff!<br><br>And I think I may go back, depending on what&#39;s on the menu in future. The stuff they have is pretty interesting, so it&#39;s fun to see whether it&#39;s a hit or miss.",

"reviewcomment":"I have always wanted to try the burgers at &amp;Made but since my usual lunch time is at 11am, it is a bit hard to make it a spur of the moment lunch spot. Well, maybe I could as it was usually fairly empty whenever I walked past it. <br><br>With Restaurant Week offer of $25++ for a 3 course lunch set, I just had to make it there. <br><br>The only choice you get to make is the flavor of the mini sundae (caramello, chocolate or berry). The other dishes are standard - small garden salad and the B burger. <br><br>I must admit I was prepared for a lousy or mediocre food experience based on the reviews I have read. People I spoke to generally felt it was ok to not bad and a tad overpriced.<br><br>And since this was restaurant week, I would not be surprised if the food did not wow me. Thankfully our experience was pretty alright. <br><br>Service: <br>Generally good. Water was topped up frequently without being asked, though we did have to ask them to fill our water glasses first. The pacing of the courses was spot on, without long waits or being bunched together. The wait staff was also able to offer suggestion when we were stumped on the dessert. <br><br>Food:<br>The garden salad was really like eating leaves or how I imagine leaves would taste like. The dressing was very light, almost non-existent. But since I never like heavy dressing or wet salad, this suit me perfectly fine. I could taste more of the cracked pepper and a slight hint of zesty lemon. <br><br>The B burger was really good. It did not look impressive or exciting but the taste was there. The sesame buns were nicely toasted and pillowy soft. The beef patty was a bit pinkish on the inside (I was a bit disconcerted when they never asked for our preference) and charred nicely on the outside. It was well packed and did not disintegrate when I slice through the patty though you could see the minced meat. It was a bit juicy and the beefy taste shone through. Maybe I am used to eating with little salt or something, but I thought the beef patty was good enough  on its own without added condiments. The caramelized onions and comte cheese (too little of it!) plus the bbq relish went well with the meat. <br><br>The fries! We changed one order of regular fries to truffle fries for $6 and it was fantastic. Crispy shoe string fries coated with truffle smell and taste. I was not sure if it was truffle oil or salt but at least you could taste it, unlike some other establishments. Even the regular fries were equally good. I actually polished off the entire basket of fries and I hardly did that. <br><br>The mini sundae was the letdown. Or maybe it was my order of chocolate sundae. I felt like I was having plain vanilla ice cream as the chocolatey bits were at the bottom and there was a &#34;cinnamon-y&#34; crumbles base which just did not go together. The berry flavor was much better. The tart sweetness of the berry compote with vanilla ice cream was refreshing and the cornflakes on top added a nice crunch to it. <br><br>I would definitely go back again whenever I have a burger craving in future.",

Luckily I was able to get a table on Friday when I called on Monday. <br><br>The view is definitely a WOW factor for this restaurant when you stepped into the place. <br><br>Tried the set lunch (no other ala carte options). Did not disappoint. Although, I&#39;m so mesmerized by the view that I can&#39;t remember what I ate.

"reviewcomment":"I&#39;m admittedly a little surprised to discover that L&#39;Atelier hasn&#39;t been reviewed, but I&#39;m always happy to rack up a &#39;First to Review&#39; achievement!<br><br>I went on a Friday evening, and the restaurant (meaning here, not the place across the hall that&#39;s named Joël Robuchon Restaurant) was pretty packed. I&#39;d never have expected it to matter, but it definitely did because the wait times for food weren&#39;t quite up to standard. We were generally well attended to, wait staff were on hand if you needed assistance, but this is the more &#39;casual&#39; dining outlet, and it showed. I had to pick up a dropped napkin myself (bit of a pain when perched on bar seats), but nothing else of note.<br><br>It took... at least fifteen or twenty minutes before our amuse-bouche were served. It might have been longer or slightly less, I admittedly wasn&#39;t keeping track. The fact that we all stopped at one moment and commented that food was taking a while though was significant. There was also a noticeable gap between the amuse-bouche and the first course, though the pacing got better once we began eating the courses proper. We were given an excellent bread basket while waiting, but we were conscious not to over indulge.<br><br>The amuse-bouche was excellent. Fois gras custard with red Porto wine and parmesan foam, this was rich, creamy, sweet, savoury, light, all at the same time. The flavours from the three different components came together beautifully, and for me, this was actually the best thing I ate all evening. The second course of Light carrot mousse topped with sea urchin and jellied consomme was also delicious (and the second best thing I had). The urchin was (as expected) very fresh, and though I found the croutons in the mousse a little overpowering in terms of flavour, it was definitely an enjoyable dish. <br><br>Things generally went downhill from there. Not downhill &#34;bad&#34;, but definitely not amazing, memorable, or eye-opening. Which one would hope for, dining at a restaurant that bears the name of the chef with the most Michelin stars in the world. <br><br>Next were &#34;Scallops cooked on the plancha with green apple and Jerusalem artichoke&#34;. This is a slightly misleading name, because it&#39;s one scallop (and personally I was always taught to say Scallop if you&#39;re just going to say one when writing a menu). It was cooked well enough, but the I&#39;ve had better scallop dishes. Indeed, that was the unfortunate recurrent theme through the evening. &#34;Good, but I&#39;ve had better.&#34;<br><br>I&#39;ll run through the dishes just to be thorough. After Le Saint Jacques, we had the Steamed Lobster ragout, mushrooms, and snow peas server in bisque. The bisque was... good, but (again) I&#39;ve had better. The snow peas were an absolute revelation though! Crunchy, sweet, and juicy, they were bursts of bright flavour in the robust bisque. <br><br>My companion loved Le Foie Gras which was served next. I found the concept of the dish a bit... lacking. Seared duck foie gras with quince apples, it&#39;s served as a tranche of foie gras, a cooked quince apple wedge, and a little apple puree. Not much in way of saucing, which I suppose is a fair decision, though I would have preferred some way of binding the plate&#39;s different elements together. <br><br>This was followed by the Dover sole cooked on the bone, pistachio oil. I know it says &#39;cooked on the bone&#39;, but neither I nor my dining companions were actually prepared for the amount of bones we had to pick through. It was tasty... but forgettable. <br><br>For my main I chose the Quail caramelised with foie gras and truffled mashed potatoes. Truffled mash potatoes? Joël Robuchon mashed potatoes specifically? AMAZING. They also served a side of the signature mashed potatoes (technically more a potato puree) as a side. I finished it ALL, in addition to the thigh of the guinea fowl one of my companions couldn&#39;t finish. The quail was delicately cooked and well marinated, the foie gras stuffed into the breast was a nice touch that prevented the meat from even flirting with the word &#39;dry&#39;. <br><br>Dessert was first a French take on our local favourie, the Red Rubies dessert, replete with water chestnut pearls, and elevated with a coconut granite (overall: interesting but unspectacular), and followed by a Creamy araguani chocolate with cacao sorbet and oreo cookie. This was delicious. The cacao sherbet was a perfect balance to everything else. Bitter and chocolatey more than sweet, this wasn&#39;t in the slightest way cloying. I actually ate another companion&#39;s share because he was too full to proceed. <br><br>After the meal, what impressed me the most was that I wasn&#39;t overly full. Everything had been perfectly portioned so that after finishing the menu I wasn&#39;t uncomfortably bloated or painfully full. I was full, and sated. I wasn&#39;t &#39;disappointed&#39; with the standard either. Food was generally of a high standard, and fairly reasonably priced. 9 courses ( not including the amuse bouche of course, but counting both desserts) was a fair $260. Pricey, but good value I feel.",

"reviewcomment":"I was shocked to see this place almost empty on a Saturday night despite the quality of food &amp; service. It&#39;s probably still a treasure waiting to be discovered. Rochester Mall, I suspect, is pretty much empty during weekends save for Sunday&#39;s church goers (a famous mega church, new creation is located nearby). Rochester is situated near offices and education institutes, both of which are deserted on weekends which explains the emptiness of the place despite having a renowned chef. Executive Chef Kenny Yeo has a vast experience helming renowned restaurants in Singapore and Taipei including a 3-star Michelin hotel in France. His food speaks for itself :) &amp; because there weren&#39;t many other guests that night the chef personally attended to our table. He made it a point to explain each of the dishes as they were served and conscientiously asked for feedback on his creations. <br><br>The Food<br> 1. scallops - Love <br><br>2. lobster bisque  - Ok.

"reviewcomment":"For pictures and full reviews, visit my blog!<br><br>I&#39;m always wary of fusion food because many restaurants in Singapore don&#39;t do them well. Luckily for us, there&#39;s LP+Tetsu, starring Michelin-starred Laurent Peugeot (of Le Charlemagne) and Tetsuya Yoshida (of Tetsu), to provide us with their modern twist on French-Japanese food.<br><br>Fine dining it is supposed to be, as evident from their no shorts and slippers policy (they should be banned everywhere other than in coffee shops) but the modern environment felt pretty relaxed. The friendly staff were attentive and accommodating to my photography needs and the plates were subsequently placed under the light after they noticed me shifting things around to get a better shot. Brownie points +1.<br><br>We did the 6 course Simply LP+Tetsu menu ($98) and the 7 course Wander and Savour menu ($138). What i love about LP+Tetsu is that they really honor what fusion cuisine is about. Each dish was carefully crafted, bearing in mind the different flavors and how they could complement each other to bring out the best taste and sensations. This is present in every dish that we tried and i was thoroughly impressed with the level of detail. Here are some dishes from the night.<br><br>Love the french breads with a touch of nori in the olive oil, served with matcha salt on the side. We were told to compare the flavor of the Duck Foie Gras Hydromel (Honey Wine) Tube when eaten with the lollipop of grilled almond and then with the biscotti slice. I was surprised at the different pairing as they enhanced different dimensions of the foie gras.<br><br>Duck Foie Gras in Shabu Shabu Style- Cassis Pearl, Jelly Translucent and Emulsion Cassis. Salty briny broth with popping candies that reminded me of Jaan, even the bowl it was served in. <br><br>My favorite dish of the night, the Saint Jacques- a confit scallop with assorted mushrooms. Maitake, shimeji, black trompette, eringi were used and accompanied with truffle Vinaigrette and snow. The snow was amazing with marshmallow-like texture that disintegrated like clouds in the mouth. <br><br>Bamboo clams seem to be the favorite shell fish these days or maybe i&#39;ve just been having too much of them. This slow cooked version with sake and white wine miso sat well with this palate. <br><br>We weren&#39;t too impressed with their meat dishes. From Simply, the Roasted Lamb Loin rolled in Juniper Berries powder was a mix of blandness in flavors and then the overpowering herby taste of the berries. The Milk Veal Tenderloin was also quite meh. I thought the stuffed Momotaru Tomato with green tea emulsion served on top fared better than the meat.<br><br>For both dishes, the use of shallots and onion jam also took the attention away from the meat, try as i might not to eat them. Made the mistake of a little taste and i couldn&#39;t taste the meat properly after. <br><br>The cheeses had all my attention. I loved the Epoisses de Bourgogne, a supposedly strong cheese (which was quite alright for me) from Burgundy that was mixed with raisins, wrapped in a pastry skin and deep fried. The presentation resembled the Japanese fried tofu but had a creamier and crispier texture. Another perfect sweet and savory dish. <br><br>The &#34;Croque Monsieur&#34; uses Cheese Saint Marcelin with Mascarpone. There&#39;s light pungent and bitter taste at the start which gives way to a sweet ending but i guess the taste kinda grows on you after a while (only if you love cheese). The dehydrated pear was delish however. <br><br>Had way too many desserts. There was the palate cleanser which was a ume sorbet, followed by a matcha crumble on mangosteen ice cream and then our 2 desserts. Snow at Mont Blanc in orange jelly, Jasmine petals, Meringue Snow Kinako. I think snow anything is awesome. Give me snow in my food from now on!<br><br>So do i like LP+Tetsu? Absolutely. The food is fun and well designed and prepared. Some hits and misses but generally good. Satisfaction level was on the whole about the same as Jaan minus the view and atmosphere. If there&#39;s one fusion restaurant that you should go to in Singapore, LP+Tetsu is it.",

"reviewcomment":"Admittedly Ichiban Sushi is the budget option for its upmarket sibling Ichiban Boshi and it shows just that in the menu, which is close to what you get at Sakae Sushi, another budget sushi chain. Knowing that Tokyo has the highest number of Michelin-rated restaurants and that gourmet Japanese food is an art form on its own, it&#39;s hard to say that what you get here matches the true quality of Japanese dining.<br><br>Having said that, the corporation behind Ichiban Sushi has a good understanding of Japanese cuisine, with other ventures such as the afore-mentioned Ichiban Boshi, along with Kuriya and Kuishin-Bo. And they are not afraid to market Ichiban Sushi as an affordable and casual option to their more refined restaurants. Japanese people might find the food here terrible and nowhere near good enough to what they are used to having back home but for the less fussy diner with, dare I say, a less discerning palate, might find the food passable.<br><br>Along with sushi and sashimi, you will find bento sets, ramen or udon and other cooked food items on the menu. Those seeking Japanese food of higher quality should not come here. There&#39;s more than a fair share of great Japanese restaurants in Singapore, albeit at a higher cost.",
