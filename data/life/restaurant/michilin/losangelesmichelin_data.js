If you are even a little excited, make a reservation. <br>Bring 2 bottles of your own Sake or wine; no corkage fee.<br>Bring quarters for the parking meters. $1 per hour until 8 PM. The sign says 1 hour max but I was there 1.5 hours; I just had to put more quarters in after 1 hour. <br>Free parking after 8.<br>It appears to be one seating for dinner at 7 PM weekdays. <br>Don&#39;t know about weekends.",

"reviewcomment":"Like so many LA gems in hiding, Asanebo is in a strip mall. Cars are double, triple, and quadruple parked in a tiny lot manned by frantic valets. The inside is deceptively humble, too, with neutral lighting, blonde wood everywhere, and cheap curtains separating off one or two VIP tables. Overall, the place looks like it might be called &#34;Frank&#39;s Sushi Joint.&#34;<br><br>Read the menu, though, and you&#39;ll be tipped off as to Asanebo&#39;s specialness. Exotic and luxurious items are everywhere, including black truffle and Wagyu beef, which belong more on a fork than in chopsticks. Asanebo offers three Omakases: an A, B, and C. The A, we were told, is without sushi; the B with sushi; and the C &#34;most fancy.&#34; (I&#39;m also told you can sit at the sushi bar and do piece after piece, traditional Omakase-style.)<br><br>Well, obviously, we went with the C. Put the kids to bed, because what follows is pornographic: Miso soup with wonton, served in a small conch shell, *literally on fire.* A fried mini squid, that you eat whole, eyeballs and all. Wagyu beef and the Japanese version of pureed parsnip. All served on tiny, delicate plates, and arranged as if by a bonsai artist. And finally five pieces of the butteriest sushi I&#39;ve ever had in my life. Oh, and chocolate cake worthy of any MIchelin star restaurant, Japanese or not. If these descriptions sound vague, it&#39;s because I could fine none of these dishes online to help me remember them, which means the meal must change on the regular, and be good for a repeat visit.<br><br>LA continues to surprise me with what&#39;s behind the Ikea curtains.",

"reviewcomment":"2 Michelin stars at its finest in LA!<br><br>I finally had the occasion to come to the beautiful Melisse that I have booked marked FOREVER!<br><br>It was a birthday and we decided to go big and go for the 10 course prix fixe option. But, we decided not to do the wine pairing which I&#39;m glad we didn&#39;t, bc it would have been too much for the night!<br><br>Pulling up to the restaurant in the corner of a street in Santa Monica, the restaurant itself is very small and quaint. Almost undetectable. I really liked how they kept it down to Earth and minimal and not pretentious at all. <br><br>The waitstaff was INCREDIBLE! It was more of a team effort than a single waiter serving you the entire night. They explained the course thoroughly, even chatted with us throughout the night, and did an excellent job of making the even that much more better...<br><br>Now on to the food... Oh so good! The 10 course menu was exquisite! Each dish was presented beautiful and all the combinations of different ingredients just worked perfectly! It seems small but by the time you get to the 6-7th course, it&#39;ll fill you up! My favorite of the night was the truffle agnolotti and the crispy Chilean bass. Watching them shave those truffles onto my agnolotti, now that&#39;s what I call food PORN!! The crispy Chilean bass had the scales crisped onto the skin. It was like eating crunchy chicken skin on a fish! So good!<br><br>By the end of the night, I was tired, stuffed, and content. It was such an experience here at Melisse and I can&#39;t wait to come back and relive it all over again!",

"reviewcomment":"I bought a set of Michelin tires at Costco for my 05 Honda Accord Hybrid and I found myself wondering if the 705 dollar price tag was worth it. It was big time. First I wanted the quiet ride, why drive a quiet car with loud tires, I wanted the smooth quiet sounding ride and thats what I got but the big thing was the warranty. The guy who put the tires on told me about it so I went online and filled it out thinking I would never use it. I ran over a &#34;tie-down&#34; strap and the 05 Accord does not come with a spare (yes it&#39;s true) and the tire sealant bottle was three years expired. Â <br>With just 3000 miles on the tires I rolled to a hissing stop on the 127 freeway outside Baker CA leaving Death Valley. Michelin offers 150 miles free towing and Auto Club only the first 7 miles. I called Michelin, an operator had me taken care of with a tow truck out in an hour. I saved 265 bucks because I was about 25 miles out of Baker. No hassle, when the tow truck driver had me sign, I paid nothing. Never thought I would need the warranty or use it. I am very grateful to Michelin, what a warranty!",
