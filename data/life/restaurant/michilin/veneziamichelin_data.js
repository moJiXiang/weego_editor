"reviewcomment":"I have dined her twice.  The first time was lunch in 2007.  It left a mark upon me as quite possibly the best meal I have ever eaten.  When I made plans for my 40th birthday, I decided that I wanted to enjoy it at Alle Testiere.  I had the absolute best evening of my life.  Very memorable food, very memorable experience.  I just booked another trip to Venezia, and have just made a reservation to enjoy it again in a few weeks.  <br><br>Search it out.  Book ahead of time, and enjoy!",

"reviewcomment":"It&#39;s every difficult to find a good service restaurant here in Venice, until today. We got an older gentleman who greeted us like we&#39;re family. He recommended the fish lasagna and squid ink pasta. Both of which is so delicious. <br><br>Our table also ordered fried fish/calamari mix, ravioli and sardines Sao (sardines in lemon juice and onions). If you love exotic flavors, this is a must try. <br><br>The reason why I gave this place 5 stars is because #1 great service. #2 great food. #3 great wine (try the house red wine) it has subtle sweet notes. <br><br>This restaurant really made me not hate my trip to Venice because of the first restaurant &#34;LA Gondola&#34; who ripped us off by adding a lot of service charges, water and wine chages that was told to us would be included. The charges was about 30€ more than what we were suppose to get charged. We complained and the guy who hustled us into the restaurant gave a BS explaination. All I can say is shame on them. <br><br>Enough of that bad restaurant, my recommendation for Trattoria Rivetta would be the Sardines, cuttlefish ink pasta, fish lasagna, house red wine, and the tiramisu.",

"reviewcomment":"Easily the best food we had in Venice.<br><br>Right along the Grand Canal in the Hotel Metropole, Met Restaurant couldn&#39;t be easier to find.  Atmosphere is so so stiff, stuffy, formal.  Be sure to pack your monocle.  That&#39;s pretty much my only complaint about the restaurant.<br><br>Water list.  I was ill prepared to make this kind of critical decision.  Minerals, pH, origin, what will they mean?  We selected, water arrived.  It tasted like quality water.  Good...Good...just as we intended.<br><br>They offer a couple different tasting menus, one of which they tell you nothing about, and you may not take pictures.  I forget the specifics, but I remember every course being at minimum good, my wife loving even the pigeon, and a hickory aroma explosion as the servers swirled the lids from an arriving dish.  <br><br>Our wine was good but not as amazing as others we had throughout our trip.  Some of that is the luck of the draw though.<br><br>Creative presentation, wonderful food.  Two Michelin stars is about right.  Not the pacesetter, but still 6th Yelp Star worthy.",

"reviewcomment":"We have visited Venice several times and love the entire city and its many fine restaurants.  (Yes there are.)  This year, we were married and wanted to spend the holidays in our favorite city.  For New Years, we decided to do something special and chose Ristorante Quadri.  <br><br>For New Years&#39; Eve, there was a fixed menu, ten courses +, with truly amazing wine pairings with the various courses (Franciacorta brut;  Champagne Perrier Jouet; Baron de &#34;L&#34;; Solaia  2001 Antinori; Tokaij 5  Dizsnoko; Dom Perignon 2004 Moet &amp; Chandon.) We were requested to dress formally, so I dressed in my tuxedo.  There was only one sitting--all night.  When we arrived, the Piazza San Marco was beginning to fill with revelers.  The city had set up a bandstand at the opposite end of the Piazza from the Basillica.  The bands were just getting started when we arrived.  The scene was tumultuous and the gathering crowds were ready to celebrate a wild night.  <br><br>This beautiful, historic restaurant is on the second floor above Cafe Quadri and has tall windows with extensive views of the Piazza.  The restaurant is two separate rooms with extraordinarily high ceilings and well-spaced tables.   The rooms are decorated in an authentic Venetian style: warm, red upholstered walls and Murano glass chandeliers.  It is dark, elegant and intimately romantic.  The atmosphere was Old World and intensely Venetian.  <br><br>We kept the menu, which does not adequately describe how fantastic and beautiful the various courses were, but this is what we had:   <br>Dentex carpaccio with curry sauce, pomegranate reduction, and mixed greens; Scampi crudo with hot lentil sauce; Fried red shrimp and scallops with sunflower seed puree and spicy sauce; Smoked mezzi paccheri with spider crab, lobster, caviar, and herb sauce; Pumpkin and parsley consumme; Hare risotto with foie gras sauce; Beef cheek braised in Amarone with polenta dumplings; upside-down cappuccino, gold bigne with zabajone, extra virgin olive oil panettone, carmelized fruit, and nougat. And cafe. (I&#39;m not sure anyone was having the cafe, since they were pouring the Dom at the time, and the Fireworks show out in the lagoon was welcoming the new year and was pleasantly visible from the restaurant windows.<br><br>At the end of the dinner, the chef and staff emerged from the kitchen in their tall, white hats and were given a standing ovation by the customers.  A magical night all around.",

"reviewcomment":"A friend of mine who owns a very well respected Italian restaurant in Newport RI suggested that we dine at Osteria Da Fiore when we visited Venice.  I researched the spot and found that it had a very good reputation and that reservations.  <br><br>Our meal started with a very good appetizer of fish and shrimp.  Our second course was a pasta dish with mushrooms that was excellent and our main was a out of this world shell fish risotto.  Perfectly done.<br><br>The service was excellent.  Our server would appear at the exact right moment and seem to be one step a head of us.<br><br>What was interesting is that a couple of days after we ate here in the weekend Travel section of the NY Times the writer told a story of how hard it was for him to make the trip to Osteria Da Fiore, a trains and planes type of scenario, but when he was done it was worth every bit of the trouble he went through.<br><br>I agree it was worth the trip and I am looking forward to going back.",

"reviewcomment":"First, a little tidbit of helpful information on Italian dining establishments:  A ristorante is more of a formal restaurant for lunch or dinner where entrees must be ordered by the patrons.  If you are looking for a more casual environment or just a light meal or some appetizers with a glass of wine you should dine at a trattoria, osteria, or enoteca instead.  Most dining establishments are clearly labeled ristorante, trattoria, osteria, or enoteca.<br><br>Le Bistrot de Venise is a ristorante and enoteca, the two areas being pretty clearly delineated.  Being not especially hungry at the time, opted to dine in the elegant enoteca area.  Ordered a bottle of the house red wine and salumi plates which consisted of salami, prosciutto, three different kinds of cheeses, walnuts and honey and was also accompanied by a bread basket filled with bread, focaccia, and bread sticks.  The cured meats and cheeses were excellent, some of the best salami and prosciutto I&#39;ve had in recent memory.  All paired with the wine, it was a nice slice of la dolce vita.  Service was exceptional and on par with top fine dining establishments in the U.S.<br><br>Great location and easy to find from Piazza San Marco, elegant atmosphere, and excellent service and food, I only hope that I will be able to return to Venice again soon so that I can spend more time here and dine properly at the ristorante.<br><br>Le Bistrot de Venise also comes recommended by the Michelin Guide.",

"reviewcomment":"I had a wonderful birthday lunch here that was yet another memorable meal. <br><br>This place is very hard to find so allow yourself some extra time to get here. The restaurant is designed like the interior of a small beautiful yacht. Lots of curving woodwork and padded surfaces. The staff, in white jackets, is extremely professional. When I asked the waiter to recommend a great white wine for lunch, I ended up with a fabulous wine that wasn&#39;t more than $40.00 a bottle. When I looked at the wine list after the waiter had suggested it and saw the price I asked if that was the best that he could suggest. He said yes, it would be great and it was. I really love it when the waiters don&#39;t try to oversell you. <br><br>This is the top Michelin rated restaurant in Venice and I would say it is one of the top three that we ate in while in Venice. The one thing that all three restaurants had in common was seafood fresher than anything I have ever had before. Of course everything I had, outside of desert, was seafood and it all was not only good but interesting and intriguing. Even my 10 year old son liked all of the seafood.<br><br>This Restaurant is a wonderful little hidden gem.",

The #1 vaporetto stops right near the entrance, but it&#39;s easy to miss.<br><br>The bar area is very small and the tables are cramped and crowded. In my opinion, it&#39;s a huge tourist trap, although when we were there, there were actually a lot of locals as well.<br><br>I read all of the reviews mentioning how expensive everything is, but was still shocked by the menu. Trust me, it&#39;s insanely expensive. I had a Bellini and my friend a bloody Mary, and our bill was $38,50€!! I thought about ordering beef carpaccio, but the &#34;small&#34; was $46€. But hey, they give you complimentary olives when you order a drink!<br><br>I am giving them 3 stars because I knew what to expect and the service as good. Also, the Bellini was actually pretty delicious.<br><br>Will I be back? Not unless Hemingway returns from the dead!",
