"reviewcomment":"Very trendy, very &#34;in&#34;  some like it, some find it too pretentious and over-priced. It has a Michelin star and 18 Gault Millau points, placing it at the top of Zurich&#39;s culinary landscape. We were surprised by the youthful, relaxed service we received.<br><br> There is only one menu on offer. Seven (it&#39;s actually more like thirteen!) courses cost you CHF 220.-. All courses were very modern, showing incredible precision and perfect preparation of all ingredients.<br><br> The desserts were very good. You&#39;ve got to ask for more desserts, since their menu only has one dessert. If you ask, then the menu suddenly has three desserts. Chef de cuisine Marcus Lindner isn&#39;t just a culinary artists, but a lover of good desserts. He bombards you with friandises after the meal, including home-made macarons (filled with a Felchlin Grand Cru ganache, yummy!), marshmallows, chestnut gugelhopf, vanilla caramels and much more.<br><br> The real genius of his cuisine is that you&#39;re not feeling like an over-stuffed Christmas turkey after eating more than twelve courses. After having your senses pleasurably overwhelmed for four hours or more due to Marcus Lindner overload, the money seems well spent.<br><br> For a detailed German photo report, please visit:<br><a href='/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fdessertblog.ch%2F2010%2F11%2Frestaurant-mesa-in-zuerich%2F&amp;s=45bfb4ef07282129f178e1de1c9e2051deaf3d8b63340c0b25fe0b18cb7344bd' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>dessertblog.ch/2010/11/r…</a>",

"reviewcomment":"I love this place. My first experience at Bei Babette was for a brunch and I will never forget that day! For one single reason, their Cappuccino! It was heaven! Never before I&#39;ve enjoyed a cappuccino like that. Still till now, I didn&#39;t find any other places in Zurich who was close to this perfection.<br><br>Aside the fantastic Cappuccino, at Bei Babette, you can taste really nice sweet crepes, Galette, good bread and various breakfast combinations. The atmosphere is also quite interesting. It feels very frenchy, I guess it&#39;s normal since it&#39;s considered to be a french restaurant :-) It&#39;s also possible to seat outside when the weather allows it. Price wise it&#39;s a bit pricey and the service varies from very good to average, I guess it depends on the mood of the staff.  <br><br>The street where Bei Babette is located is really nice if you can appreciate architecture! There are beautiful old buildings which were quite well maintained and or renovated. Bei Babette can be easily accessed with Tram 2 or 3 via tram stop Lochergut. <br><br>Normally I would give Bei Babette 4 stars but just because of their Cappuccino, I&#39;m rating them with 5 stars!",

"reviewcomment":"The Chez Fritz is one of the best restaurants around the Zürisee (lake of Zurich).<br><br> It is opposite of the Lindt &amp; Sprüngli Chocolate Factory in Kilchberg. So ideally located and with a magnificent view of the lake.<br><br> I think, the Chez Fritz has the same owner than the Seerose, but I think at the Chez Fritz it&#39;s more sophisticated place and not as show-offy as the Seerose.<br><br> It has a fine, but still cosy ambience inside. And a large terrace with a outside bar. During the summer, you can hang out it the lounge area and watch people and enjoy the drinks.<br><br> The food is excellent: the food is fresh, Mediterranean, modern and yummy-ly prepared. The chef has officially 15 points in the Guide Michelin (according to the official website from Chez Fritz).<br><br> Wine comes mainly from Europe, with focus on France and Italy.",

"reviewcomment":"I love this place! The restaurant is one of those gourmet establishments where they provide small little &#39;&#39;tasters&#39;&#39; before each course, each dish is thought out n terms of combination of flavour and ingredients as well as being artfully arranged and an extensive wine list.<br>It was the second time we have been here and once again the experience was wonderful.<br><br>The menu is somewhat limited and you can choose from 4 courses to 8 courses (which is basically everything on the menu). The waiting staff was friend, spoke English with me and very accommodating. Let me explain the ways!<br>We sat down and promptly someone brought over a lightly warmed hand towel to refresh our hands and be clean. We ordered two glasses of champagne and these were brought over in good time with our water. We were given some time to enjoy our drink and chat a bit before they brought over a little set of amuse bouche which tasted divine!<br>Then came the menu and I picked 4 courses; the lobster, the veal liver which was served with a slice of the veal tongue too (delicious btw!) as starters and the guinea fowl as main. The guinea fowl was really tender and tasted almost like a fake chicken?! The texture was very spongey but tasteful, with some chorizo. I&#39;m not such a fan of poultry therefore I would have chosen the Black Cod on the menu, except I didn&#39;t realise there was Black Cod on there since the german menu said otherwise.<br><br>Just before the main course, they had brought out a jelly like substance which was made of elderflowers, peppermint and something else along the lines of Hugo, the drink. Its purpose was to refresh our palette and ready for the man course.<br>It tasted so good and reminded me of a jelly sweet from Hong Kong that I had for another one! And the lady serving was so nice to comply!<br><br>Before the dessert, there was another amuse bouche served on a plate of rocks and a large oyster shell - it was a frozen apple sort of candy, bite sized but sharp in flavour and helped t cleanse the palette for the dessert!<br>I chose a dark chocolate flakes with vanilla ice cream served with beetroot slices and sauce. Not a fan of beetroot but it went so well with the dark chocolate!<br><br>The coffee was served with real milk and not these terrible packaged creamers that the Swiss are so fond of in restaurants......<br><br>It was an expensive meal and not one to do everyday but well worth it as a once-in-a-while treat for yourself and loved ones. Gourmet dining is exactly about how different flavours are compatible with each other and what combination brings out the best on the palette. Each dish in the restaurant was so well thought out and brought together, it was an awesome experience.",

"reviewcomment":"The prices are okay for Zurich&#39;s standards. If you like high-class restaurants like the Rigiblick, Dolder or Mesa, be sure to check out this little gem offering the purest, simplest Michelin-starred dining in all of Zurich. Tobias Buholzer is a very good cook. His plates are relatively simple, but everything is thought through and perfectly executed. The foie gras terrine was wonderful and the main course (luma pork) was the best main course I&#39;ve ever had, so big and tasty! I&#39;m especially glad to have rediscovered the restaurant, because Chef Buholzer&#39;s kitchen offers very good desserts. Here you can enjoy a huge selection of friandises, the kind of selection you&#39;d otherwise only find in ultra-expensive restaurants like the Dolder or Mesa. Very friendly, attentive service led by his wife Sabrina. Be sure to try the chocolate fondant cake made from luxurious Felchlin couverture from Bolivia. And bring enough time to truly savour every bite.
