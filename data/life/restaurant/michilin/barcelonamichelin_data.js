"reviewcomment":"This is hard, I don&#39;t know where to start. This was without a doubt one of our top 3 meals ever. That said, you need to be a certain kind of foodie to truly enjoy it. I can understand why there is a review that said things were too sweet. I was SHOCKED at how sweet things could be and still be savory. Cinc Sentis to me is a play on the senses, and it was delightful. Well, now that I&#39;ve started let me go on...<br><br>First the atmosphere and service were exceptional. This was team service and everyone we interacted with was lovely and equally as important really into the food and wine. What I loved was the pride they took in the pairings and the special finds they feature. They also go into the &#34;why&#34; the chef made a certain choice, which includes the heritage of the dish. Meaning... &#34;This dish is our take on [name] Catalan dish,&#34; which also included an explanation of that dish and their take.<br><br>Now, here, I have to mention that though I have had a large number of high quality modernist meals, they generally fall flat for me -- more form than function, and I dig function in my food and bev.<br><br>This was without a doubt, the best modernist meal I have had. Each dish was carefully constructed, and there was only one that didn&#39;t make me think differently about the ingredients or the original dish. (If I did know the original dish.) While it was hard to choose, I think my favorite was the main which was 3 version of squab... in 3 dishes, all creatively plated. Near to that was the langostinos and pork belly, which they paired with sea urchin foam and black garlic. Loved it and I don&#39;t like sea urchin typically. If I had to choose a third dish, it would likely be the 5 (or was it 6) tapas that we started with. Oh, forgot to mention this was the gastronomic tasting menu that is only offered for lunch. Yep, 3+ hours starting at 1:30p.<br><br>I have to agree with the surprise that this restaurant only has one Michelin star. Just a week ago in Nice we ate at a (also wonderful) 2-star restaurant and this was better... by just a schmidge. Really we loved both, but if I had to choose a winner, I&#39;d have to go with Cinc Sentis for originality that works.<br><br>So if you aren&#39;t really into food, or aren&#39;t in the mood to sit back and appreciate the artistry, this isn&#39;t for you. But if you are, wow, just wow. And then a few hours later, you will smile again and say, wow.",

"reviewcomment":"Though I&#39;m not of theMonte Carlo/Burj Al Arab set, I have eaten at a few Michelin-starred establishments in my time. Lasarte produced the finest exhibition of food and service I&#39;ve had the pleasure of experiencing.  <br><br>We made it a point to book well in advance in anticipation of our European vacation. We arrived as the restaurant opened its doors at 8:30 pm (remember, this is Barcelona). A family that arrived at the same time was turned away due to inappropriate attire -- Dad was wearing shorts. Don&#39;t worry, he went next door and purchased loud yellow trousers. They were eventually admitted for dinner. <br><br>The ambiance oozed elegance and the place settings were twinkly, but  somehow it still seemed understated. Our waitstaff, consummate professionals all, provided impeccable service with moderately-accented English. My companion and I had the tasting menu and I (in the spirit of splurging) I had the wine pairings. <br><br>I think the zenith of the evening came when the lids were lifted from the serving vehicles of the smoked oysters in perfect synchrony. The aromatic smoke that issued forth was swooningly good. The oyster dish featured a gelatinized ball  containing concentrated oyster essence. You have to see it/taste it to believe it. <br><br>The other courses were invariably refined, creative and downright tasty. There were five flavors of butter for the bread for Pete&#39;s sake! Five! The floral salad and pigeon were the highest of the many highlights.  The wine pairings seemed dead on, though as I&#39;d essentially lost my mind over the food, I couldn&#39;t fairly evaluate the libations.<br><br>Of course we paid a king&#39;s ransom, but this was one extravagance I will never regret. Thank you Martin Berasategui and team!!<br><br>Aside: If you are visiting Barcelona and have more than one day, go hiking in Montserrat. It&#39;s neato and has natural air conditioning.",

"reviewcomment":"4.5 stars<br><br>Super excited about my first OVERSEAS review. Would love to make yelp abroad a resource, allows for travelers even more options to really look for the great places to eat.<br><br>Went here 9/2011 for a trip of the northern part of Spain. Alkimia has been well talked about amongst the chowhound community and we&#39;re so glad we made it here.<br><br>Atmosphere: 1-michelin star, fine dining.  Modern and mostly subdued.  Go for the pre-fixe dinner, well worth the price.<br><br>Service: this is where they lost 0.5 stars. the service was hurried. the staff didn&#39;t spend too much time on explaining the food perhaps due to a language barrier.  so at first glance you would assume the food is just not as good due to its lackluster service, but WRONG. the food was just the opposite.<br><br>Food:  Very modern, flavors all spot on.  We ate at many fine dining establishments on this trip and I felt this place was one of the few that didn&#39;t have a few dishes that were overally salted.  All the classic catalan ingredients (all very fine) and done in a modern, clean way. <br>Favorites: Squid in it&#39;s own ink/ginger - very rich but oh so wonderful.  Oyster/beef cheek - similar texture but obviously different tasting profiles. Tomatoes/sea beans/fish - quite acidic, but all went well perfectly together. <br><br>Overall, very different than the cuisine we would encounter in the states.  Spanish fine dining concentrates so much on the freshness of the ingredient and are experts at preparing seafood.  Can&#39;t say enough how lovely this dining experience was for us (minus so-so service).<br><br>In the Cinc Sentis vs Alkimia debate - they are both sublety different so I would say must try both, but if I only had room for one, I would pick Alkimia.",

"reviewcomment":"This Barceloneta establishment is a well deserved Michelin starred restaurant.  <br><br>We arrived for lunch right before/on the dot of Can Majo opening and chose to sit out on the patio to enjoy the sea breeze and the warm weather.  Our hostess was very freindly and let us chose the table we wanted that was closest to the beach.  And within minutes, our server was there to give us our drinks and discuss the menu with us. But we had no questions, because we were there for their renowned paella.<br><br>Our table of 4 ordered the seafood paella. I would highly recommend that if anyone at your table is ordering a paella, you order the same one.  This ensures that it come out on one pan and your table isn&#39;t crowded.  The paella is among the best that I have every experienced. The seafood is perfectly cooked and distributed among the arroz y lo es mas que nada.<br><br>Another great part about Can Majo, besides its proximity to the beach, is that it is very, very affordable for a starred restaurant.  If you are looking for a quick, first class lunch in Barceloneta, you needn&#39;t look any further than Can Majo.",

"reviewcomment":"Determined to work our way through the Michelin-starred Catalan restaurants in Barcelona, this was a most wonderful stop on our list.  Right next door to our hotel, it was so convenient to stumble back (quietly) afterwards after so much excellent wine.  The meal was first-rate, service was as tremendous as could be given that most of the restaurant was taken up with an enormous private party, which they made up for with complementary wine (always welcome) and seating us above in our own semi-private alcove, complete with a little library of old books to entertain ourselves.<br><br>We left feeling like we experienced a real bit of Barcelona, and some of the best and thoughtful food we&#39;d eaten to date.  Love, love, love.",

"reviewcomment":"I count myself fortunate I stumbled onto this place earlier tonight. Chef Jordi Cruz has an outstanding pedigree with his 4 Michelin stars. Let&#39;s forget I know this less this shades my review.<br><br>Ten&#39;s menu caught my eye. It hung off the awning leaning into the pedestrian path&#39;s center. It highlighted the 15 tapas menu items in 3 languages including English. I quickly scanned looking for something interesting and I found it, but would my friends want to try this restaurant? They did.<br><br>After checking with management, we sat ourselves outside. As our server was receiving our drink orders, he sung Chef Jordi&#39;s praises. For myself, I ordered the foie gras dish with sichuan pepper ice cream (intriguing) and the slow cooked egg dish. I also shared some bread, fried potatoes, and black rice.<br><br>Onto the dishes. Mine were very attractive dishes, quite well presented. I even added pictures to the Yelp photo section. Overall, the foie gras dish was quite sweet. The crunchy topping alleviated some of the sweetness. I was hoping the sichuan pepper ice cream might lend slight heat, but even that was blatantly sweet. What sat between each foie gras piece was lost in the shuffle.<br><br>The second presented dish was the slow cooked egg. It sounded really good and again, presented well. However, I was told that to properly eat it, one must swirl it around thoroughly and apply it atop the tomato toast. My gorgeous dish became a seething eggy mass. It tasted nice, the egg overwhelmed everything else. The iberian ham, sobrassada paprika sausage, mature gouda - all lost.<br><br>Where does this leave Ten&#39;s? Merely satisfactory. I appreciate Chef Jordi Cruz&#39;s presentation skills and willingness to pair disparate items. However, I am underwhelmed when a dish doesn&#39;t elevate any one flavor or masks too many pieces. <br><br>Also, the service was confusing at times. Our waiter was quite thorough, but sometimes too quick with his suggestions. Customer(s) and waiter must work harder to overcome both language difficulties (he spoke acceptable English, though quick and Catalan tinted) and a challenging menu.",

"reviewcomment":"This is a 2 Star Michelin Restaurant in the Mandarin oriental Hotel.  I emailed to make a reservation for two people.   I have traveled to Europe extensively and have been to many Michelin starred restaurants.  This restaurant wanted a deposit of Euro125 per person to secure a table.  I was shocked that the deposit went &#34;non -refundable&#34; 24 hours before the actual dinner event.  <br><br>WOW....your business is so weak that you can&#39;t just take the reservation of a hotel guest.  The food might be great ....but at this point why would I care?  There are MANY other nice restaurants in Barcelona.   Lot&#39;s of luck trying to lock patrons into a non-refundable deposit.  I won&#39;t be one of those clients!!!",
