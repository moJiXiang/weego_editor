"reviewcomment":"What a great way to end a perfect holiday trip to the Eternal City. My husband and I dined here December 29, 2013. <br><br>La Terrazza dell&#39;Eden is located on the top floor of Hotel Eden, part of the Dorchester Collection.  It is located two blocks off of the Via Veneto and very easy to find on foot or by taxi.  The restaurant is expertly overseen by Executive Chef Fabio Ciervo, and earned a Michelin star in November 2012.<br><br>The restaurant offers a panoramic view of the city, which is best seen at sunset...needless to say we did not get to enjoy that as it gets dark at 4.30p in Rome in December and our dinner reservation was the earliest seating: 7:30p.  I imagine during the summer months the view is out of this world, because simply viewing the city illuminated in the evening was a treat.<br><br>The service was top of the line - attentive, courteous, helpful, and friendly.  Perhaps our lovely server could have been found to be too talkative to some, but I appreciated his light conversation.<br><br>I was impressed by the wine selection and the sommelier helped us pick a bottle that would accompany our dinner perfectly (tough as we were starting with lobster and ending with lamb - that&#39;s an easy fix: champagne with lobster!).  We did not do the tasting menu as it required the both of us to participate and some of the dishes would not work with my husband&#39;s food allergies.  We shared an antipasta (smoked lobster), a primi (I don&#39;t remember, but I know it was good) and a secondi (lamb shoulder - perfection) and couldn&#39;t have been happier.  What we ate was irrelevant - it all looked fantastic. Again, I must emphasize how great the service was.<br><br>Jackets are required.  And I love that.  I think that enforcing a dress code for a lovely restaurant adds to the evening: &#34;feeling&#34; dressed up is fun and seeing other lovely diners is enjoyable.  <br><br>Terrazza dell&#39;Eden is a *must-do*.",

"reviewcomment":"We were greeted in by the doorman at the Hassler Hotel, who gladly took our shopping bags and lead us to the lift.  When we arrived at the restaurant, we were greeted by the hostess, who took our bags and the matre&#39;d who gladly took our coats.  The restaurant was nice, but the view was breath taking!    We were sat at the best table in the house, right along the window over-looking all of Rome!  <br><br>The menu was quite extensive and everything sounded delicious.  We opted for the tasting menu.  Each course was a delight, the flavours melded beautifully!  We drank and ate for hours, the pace between course  was perfect.   The service was impeccable, attentive, but not overbearing.   It was definitely a great way to finish our tour of Rome.    I would highly recommend this restaurant for the full experience when in Rome!",

"reviewcomment":"This was the best restaurant experience of our ten days in Rome.  Why they don&#39;t have a star or two from Michelin I don&#39;t understand.<br><br>They do have two Yelp reviews - both five stars.  Now they have three, all five stars.  Thank you Yelp.  Without those reviews we would not have gone.<br><br>The setting is fabulous, both naturally and with the way they&#39;ve decorated it.  The restaurant is a large high ceiling room in back of their wine shop.  It&#39;s classic Roman, but new and fresh and spacious.  Solid wood tables, beautiful stained glass windows up high, and an impressive modern stained glass ceiling.<br><br>Our service was excellent, but that disappeared behind the awesome meal we had.  We started with zucchini flowers, stuffed with ricotta cheese, and baked.  Served on a bed of sun dried tomatoes.  This makes my list of top ten appetizers I&#39;ve ever tasted.  <br><br>We then shared an order of mezze maniche, a large pasta that was the freshest pasta I had in Rome.<br><br>My main course was scabbard, a very tasty fish I&#39;d not had before.  The long filets of the fish, cooked with Parmesan cheese, were served on a thick piece of eggplant, with cooked cherry tomatoes and olives as a side dish.  As with the zucchini flowers dish, this was a masterful combination, with all the flavors balancing one another, in this case all strong flavors.  It was wonderfully tasty.  I liked having the tomatoes and olives combination on the side, so on each bite I could decide how much of which items I wanted to combine each time.<br><br>Accompanying the meal we started with an excellent mecita, the had another great Abruzzo white wine.<br><br>This, to me, is a destination restaurant.  The entire meal was a culinary experience.  When they get their Michelin star, we will be able to say &#34;we knew them when...&#34;",

"reviewcomment":"This my favorite restaurant in the world. Very expensive, but worth it. The service is impeccable. The view is amazing--looking out over St Peter&#39;s and Rome. The maitre&#39;d, Simone, is outstanding. <br><br>The chef, Heinz Beck, is a true culinary genius. If you stay through the end of the evening he usually spends time chatting with the guests and is happy to answer questions about the food and it&#39;s preparation. Or, ask him about his brother working in the auto parts business. Heinz is one of the most accessible of the star chefs. <br><br> The nine course gourmet tasting menu is sublime. The wine pairings are perfect. Mateo the sommelier is a genius at pairing wine with La Pergola&#39;s cuisine. The extra charge for wine pairing with the tasting menu is quite reasonable (but in line with everything else being so expensive. It&#39;s not cheap but a good value at these prices. Usually around 120 Euros for nine glasses.) <br><br>The Grand Dessert is terrific.  Have you ever joked that you&#39;d like a bite of everything?  That is the experience you get with the Grand Dessert!<br><br>After dinner, have drinks on the patio and enjoy the stupendous view. Or, have a cigar and single malt or other fine liquor in the splendid cigar room.",

The list is heavily weighted towards Italian gems but truly stick to the  Lazio DOC for the best pairings.  Wines selected all sub €150.<br><br>Small 28 seat dining room.  Strict no mobiles, no photos policy to ensure the privacy of their guest.  (still wondering how some people took pictures of the food).  Privacy is so important that they lock the door to the restaurant.  You need to be shown out.  English menu&#39;s.<br><br>English spoken.  Advanced booking a month in advance required.  All things considered, a great investment in pleasure at just shy of €850 inclusive of service for three.<br><br>The clown is no joke giving us a glance at just how creative and elevated Roman cuisine can be.",

"reviewcomment":"I came here on my last night in Rome and it was amazing. As a disclaimer, this isn&#39;t your traditional Italian restaurant. I was looking to try something more modern and Glass Hostaria didn&#39;t disappoint. It is sort of like Italian food with some French influence in preparation, and portion sizes/presentation similar to any fine dining restaurant. However, they did a great job bringing out the flavors in Italian food and highlighting the freshness of the ingredients.<br><br>I had the 7 course tasting menu (smaller of the two) and it was divine. Started with an amuse bouche consisting of a fresh clam in either lettuce or pea sauce. They did a great job bringing out the flavor and freshness of the vegetable. I especially enjoyed the beef tartare, which was cooked just perfectly. It was uniquely Italian given the liberal use of really high quality olive oil in the flavoring. Also had a delicious amatriciana ravioli - tasty traditional flavors but not so big a portion that you can&#39;t eat the rest of your meal.<br><br>The service was friendly and attentive and I got by perfectly with English. If you&#39;re visiting Rome and looking to try something new, check this place out. The neighborhood of Trastevere is also a delightful place to walk around after dinner.",

Ergo, there is no need to waste time on platitudes.  <br><br>However, here is what stood out:  The wine list was detailed and thought through, and was not your typical trophy wine list with insane prices.  Yes, of course, your typical Petrus and  first growth wines were there.  I was more impressed with the rare, small producers at really good prices.  Also, the tea (from herbs cut in front of you at the table) was EPIC.  Worth the visit just for the tea service.  The restaurant is excellent and is also amazing value for being what it is (and where it is).",
