"reviewcomment":"My dude took me here for our first (first of many I hope ) Valentines Day.. <br>The food is outstanding. My childhood friends mom does fondue every xmas eve so thats always something that I have to look forward to once a year. I love fondue ! Popular to the misconceived notion , its not just cheese. You do have a cheese pot but there are other pots with olive oil for steak and poultry and seafood.. and then for dessert to... <br><br>The service here is immaculate. It was really beautiful to I think its at a hotel this place. Its funny because when I got out of my car I was walking around a little confused which direction the front door was located at, and suddenly I realized it was really quiet and the building was beautiful and made out of brick and there were flowers, and a limo..and I go deja vue that I was in a past life on an episode of the bachelor.. my boo ( I dont know what to call him ,we arent official yet because I am weird but thats another story haha)  walked up and saw the confusion on my face and I told him &#34; I feel like I am on the Bachelor, where is my Rose &#34; hahah but yah we went inside and it is almost cave like in there, each table has a hot pot.. the food is really good, we had a pre fix menu for Valentines day. I also tried one of their Mojitos . <br><br>I would def return here. I know it was a little pricey ( I didnt look at the bill! ) but I would def come back here , our server was incredible, I cant remember her name but she was sweet and attentive. I will def come back here !! :) great place for a date. .",

"reviewcomment":"I had been entering the lottery for a party of 2 for months and months and months, so when I received word there would be a dinner the weekend our friends were coming to visit, I said, &#34;What the hey!&#34; and entered us for 4.  <br><br>The attention to detail that Lazy Bear expounds is unbelievable. Every plate, every bite is flawless. I have quite the laundry list of allergies and, while back in the kitchen -- which by the way they totally encourage you to go to and give you gelato if you do! -- I heard Chef David start to recite them by heart and make sure those ingredients were kept off my plate. <br><br>While the food (and the price) is nothing short of upscale, the experience is as relaxing and carefree as can be. BYOB (or wine in our case) and they&#39;ll even chill it for you if you&#39;d like. There is no pressure to dress up, the wonderful people running this joint are very gregarious and approachable, and everyone around you is making yummy sounds and having a good time, so you can too!<br><br>Our friends were at a loss for words afterwards, except to record every morsel they ate and muse over the incredible bread and butter. And all my fiancé had to say was, &#34;Enter us into the lottery from now until forever.&#34;",

"reviewcomment":"Saison has really matured into a truly outstanding restaurant. I went to the original location and enjoyed it, so I was very pleasantly surprised with the decor and overall ambience in the new location. I mean, I think they totally nailed the feeling of casual elegance. <br><br>I went with two other people and we got the larger tasting menu, one person got the wine pairing, a bottle of wine and we also added a winter truffle course. The total cost plus tip ended up being $880 per person, but the price would have been ~50% cheaper if we didn&#39;t get alcohol or add the truffle supplement.<br><br>The food was outstanding. I have eaten at many of the best restaurants in the world, and this meal was definitely in my Top 5 of all-time. Other favorites include Alinea, French Laundry and Benu. The execution was amazing and words cannot possibly do Saison justice.",

"reviewcomment":"My husband and I recently dined at Benu for my birthday, and we were very impressed with the restaurant. Usually, fusion restaurants try too hard to &#34;transform&#34; Asian cuisine. However, Corey Lee did an excellent job of maintaining the taste, texture, and essence of each dish by only making slight variations.<br><br>Our favorite courses included: <br>-Beggar&#39;s purse of treasures from the oak: This small bite was packed with flavor.  It contained pureed black truffle, Parmesan cheese, Iberico ham, and a soft-boiled egg.  The beggar&#39;s purse was excellent and very unique.<br><br>-Lobster coral xiao long bao: My husband really liked the addition of lobster coral to the classic xiao long bao. It added richness and depth to the typically pork-filled dumpling.<br><br>-Salt and pepper squid: A squid ink cracker topped with diced squid, sliced serrano pepper, green onions, and dollops of cream. This small cracker was full of umami and one of my favorite bites!<br><br>-&#34;Shark&#39;s fin soup&#34; with crab, egg white, and Jinhua ham: One of the signature dishes from Benu, which features faux &#34;shark fin,&#34; made from hydrocolloid gel, in a broth of double chicken stock and ham. The soup was served piping hot, and the flavor of the broth was very good. If I were blindfolded, you could have fooled me into thinking it was real shark&#39;s fin!<br><br>-Beef rib steak with hearts of palm, wood ear mushroom, and burnet: The meat was cooked perfectly. The steak was juicy, tender, and went great with the hearts of palm. My husband easily could have eaten 5 more slices :D<br><br>-Sesame white cake with salted plum: When we first saw this course on the menu, neither of us thought we would like it. However, it turned out to be really really good. The subtle sesame flavor complemented the fluffy white cake and butter cream frosting. The frosting was some of the best butter cream frosting I have had--it was light, slightly sweet, and not too rich. I preferred the cake by itself, but there was a salted plum sauce that you could drizzle on top.<br><br>-Burnt white chocolate cake with chocolate crust: This was a complimentary dessert served for my birthday, and although it didn&#39;t look like much, it was absolutely delicious! We compared it to the TKO from Bouchon but even better. <br><br>One observation we had was although the staff was always professional and attentive, we didn&#39;t find any of the servers to be very warm. For example, the only time they wished me a Happy Birthday was when they served the complimentary dessert, and it was very brief. A few times, when my husband or I gave compliments about a particular dish we had just finished, the servers did not seem particularly interested in what we had to say (they gave a generic, &#34;Thank you&#34; and took the dishes away). This is one area where Benu could improve, given they are a Michelin 2-star restaurant.<br><br>Overall, however, we found our dinner to be a carefully planned and well-executed meal. Lee is no doubt a talented artist and chef, and I would highly recommend dining at Benu!",

"reviewcomment":"After wanting to try this place for more than a year, I finally got the chance last night.  A few tips: go with at least three other friends so you can try as many dishes as possible, line up (starts at the door and wraps to the window so you can watch the chefs preparing the food) around 3:30-4pm on weekends if you don&#39;t have a reservation (55% of the tables are for walk-ins) and there&#39;s no sign on the door or building!  If you&#39;re within the first group of 20 or so, you&#39;ll get a seat, otherwise, they&#39;ll give you a time so you can walk around and not have to wait in line.<br><br>Our favorites:<br><br>Homemade potato chips with roe and creme fraiche: only complaint is it only comes with around 6 chips!<br><br>Hamachi on a crispy nori chip: We ordered two of these... so good.  Tastes like hamachi poke.<br><br>Duck liver mousse with almond biscuits: so rich and tasty.  Be sure to ask for extra biscuits at no charge.  You&#39;ll need them for the extra mousse.<br><br>Mendocino sea urchin, ginger-scallion pancake with soy-lime sauce: a little like a Korean seafood pancake with a fresh urchin on top.<br><br>Tofu custard with bacon: better as a dessert<br><br>Quinoa porridge with wild mushrooms and ginger: like Chinese rice porridge, but with tons more flavor. <br><br>Guinea hen dumpling: Steamed dumpling with lots of flavor.  Love the mushroomy broth.<br><br>Braised Pork Belly: excellent sauce, perfectly cooked skin<br><br>Good, but just above average:<br><br>CA state bird with provisions: their specialty.  It&#39;s a fried quail with a lemony, leeky sauce on the bottom.  Pricey and less meat than two chicken wings.<br><br>Garlic Bread with Burrata: like a Chinese fried donut at the dim sum restaurants, but with a glop of cheese.<br><br>Grilled beef &amp; broccoli with umeboshi and bonito<br><br>Guava tres leches: tres leches with a side of guava jelly and whipped cream.<br><br>Oysters with chili oil, sesame seeds: $2 each.  It was good, but I might be spoiled with the Hog Wash at Hog Islabd Oyster Depot.<br><br>Skip:<br><br>Grilled beef broccoli with umeboshi and bonito: Good, but a little tough and pricey for 8 cuts of steak.   Might want to order the bone marrow instead.<br><br>Pork spare ribs: a little burnt, average flavor<br><br>Corkage is $25 for a 750ml bottle, $50 for a 1.5L bottle.",

"reviewcomment":"Absolutely spectacular. Special occasion? Romantic outing? Glutton at heart? You should treat yourself to an amazing dinner.<br><br>The dining room is not that big. From the outside it looks like it&#39;s part of an housing complex, yet once you get into the main room it&#39;s reminiscent of a retrofitted wine cellar (look at the beams on the ceiling). It felt like there were maybe a dozen or so tables.<br><br>The menu is prix fixe only and you can choose between three course and five course. In our party the men opted for the five while the women did the four. If I were to do it again I&#39;d definitely do the four course. Five courses is just way too indulgent.<br><br>Food is great. Presentation and flavor are excellent. The Italian cuisine felt very Californian-inspired, with the seasonal produce and common favorites. Many dishes had nice spins on them. There wasn&#39;t one dish that I had a problem with. A standout to me was the sunchoke soup with seared brussels sprouts and sous vide egg.<br><br>Once you&#39;re done with your luxurious meal, you&#39;re not really done. You actually get to choose as many treats as you want from a dessert cart. This does not disappoint. It all looks so good. At this point I was just forcing myself to eat. So on top of the five course meal you also get an amuse bouche, bread, and dessert cart. Time to run a marathon.<br><br>Service is spot on. My only problem with service, and it&#39;s not really with service, is that the floors are really sensitive to movement. Whenever someone walks by you, you can hear it and feel it. It&#39;s a glaring oddity especially when everything else is done right. You might not notice it as much if you sit on the sides, but we had center stage.<br><br>____<br><br>Prepare your stomach for a flavor onslaught.",

"reviewcomment":"I want to write a review of this because I haven&#39;t been to a fancy-pants restaurant for a while, and this one was great. <br><br>The ambiance is very old-school, and even though I am now a grown woman of 30, I still felt conspicuously young and too flamboyantly dressed. But, whatever. It was a special occasion. The service was still great and warm and friendly. Bonus points for getting me an extra brioche bun when I asked.<br><br>The food was Japanese-French fusion, which sounds suspect, but was very well executed. I gather they have recently changed the menu to be more set and have fewer add-on options, which I think is a good call. Tempting but expensive add-ons always kind of harsh my mellow at super-fancy restaurants. Part of the pleasure of it is just sitting down and not having to make any decisions.<br><br>Our menu for the evening was:<br><br>-Some kind of forgettable amuse-bouche. Maybe involving some kind of gelatin texture? <br><br>-Black truffle tart with black truffle sauce. Excellent. Very mushroom-y, in a good way. Fabulous texture on the pastry crust. Not too heavy or overwhelmed by all of the truffle-ness.<br><br>-Cauliflower mousse with uni, Osetra caviar, scallop tartare, &#39;dashi&#39; geleé and cherry blossom smoke. This was probably my favorite thing. I am often skeptical of overly fussy molecular-gastronomy dishes like this that involve (literal) smoke and mirrors, but this was a winner. Excellent blend of novel textures and flavors that all came together beautifully.<br><br>-Lobster ravioli and mushroom with parsley puree. This was very good, and the lobster was better than most lobster I&#39;ve had on the west coast. And more great mushroom texture and flavor. It didn&#39;t wow me quite as much as the other dishes, but that&#39;s only in comparison to the other outstanding things we got.<br><br>-Then came the brioche and butter, which I liked so much I had them bring me another helping. Even though I knew there was so much more food coming. NO REGRETS.<br><br>-Wagyu beef two ways--braised with mashed potatoes and greens, and seared with a wasabi foam. OH MY GOD THIS WAS SO GOOD. <br><br>Another type of dish of which I am generally skeptical. I feel like there is so much highly-touted fancy beef at fancy restaurants that I have not been overly impressed by. A lot of the supposed wagyu and &#34;kobe&#34; beef I&#39;ve had has been pretty good, but didn&#39;t seem to justify the exorbitant prices. I also tend to think that any kind of steak at a super high-end restaurant is sort of a boring choice compared to the other kinds of concoctions that get put together. <br><br>This was a different story all together. This is definitely the best beef I have ever had. Yeah, I said it. I am sure of it. It was absurdly tender without being mushy, and the flavor was out of control good. Both presentations were excellent and really complemented each other, and the wasabi foam was great and not gimmicky like I feared. BEST. BEEF. EVER. For reals.<br><br>-Dessert--chocolate and white chocolate ganache in cocoa powder with chocolate ice cream, and then another course of tiny cookies on our way out the door. Dessert was honestly kind of disappointing. Like, of course it was good, but the other courses had me expecting something exceptional. That&#39;s okay, though. I feel like lots of bakeries and fancy restaurants do compelling sweets without delivering on all the savory dishes, so I will still take this place over most comparable restaurants any day.<br><br>Oh, slight ding for not really having any non-alcoholic beverages. I think they had coke and sprite. Come on, this is a fancy place! Have some nice juice or ginger beer or something. I guess they&#39;re focused on wine, not cocktails, and there isn&#39;t really a great substitute for wine. <br><br>Great spot, excited I got to eat here. Nice to be able to do once in a while for a very special occasion.",

"reviewcomment":"I&#39;ve been a long-time fan of Frances since it first opened.  Never got around to writing up a review because I didn&#39;t think I could do it justice!   I just had yet another awesome meal there so I&#39;m determined to record it.  <br><br>What I love about Frances is that everything is always delicious and creative, without feeling pretentious.  This also means that it&#39;s the kind of &#34;comfort food&#34; (I mean this in the best way possible) that you can go back to eat over and over again.  It&#39;s kind of like having your mom who happens to be a 2-3 Michelin star chef prepare awesome home-cooked food.  <br><br>This time I went with my sister and her husband, and we ended up sharing a few dishes.  As usual, I ordered the house wine, which is always really good, eminently drinkable, and you pay by the ounce!  How cool is that.   This particular one blends zinfandel with grenache and something else.  We really enjoyed it.  <br><br>Grilled beet salad - delicious, refreshing, with nice texture from the pistachio, and the burrata is so creamy <br><br>Smoked bacon beignets - the maple chive creme fraiche is delicious, and the smoky flavor of the beignets is fantastic<br><br>Duck liver mousse with grilled ciabatta - YUM.  So tasty, and in nice contrast with the vinegared cippolini onions, sea salt, and a garlic puree.  Probably our 2nd favorite dish.  <br><br>The squid ink linguine was the perfect al dente texture, with a really rich seafood taste from the cortez bottarga (tuna).  Probably our favorite dish. <br><br>Baby red russian kale salad - also delicious.  The roasted carrots were so sweet they tasted like sweet potato, and the pecorino smoothed out the slightly bitter taste of the kale.  The medjool date gave it a nice surprise in the mouth too. <br><br>Bavette steak - the black chanterelle mushrooms were super rich and flavorful, and the steak was perfectly cooked.  <br><br>Grilled chicories side - with toasted hazelnuts and cider vinaigrette - had this warm bitter taste to it.  I&#39;m not really that familiar with chicories but it was really good.  <br><br>In the end, I would literally rate every one of these an A, which is so unusual at most restaurants.  <br><br>We had a delicious meal, and I always love the vibe.  Our reservation was at 5:15 and it was hopping by 5:30.  For a restaurant to be open nearly 4 years (?) and to still be this popular, you know it&#39;s amazing!",

"reviewcomment":"Okay, people...this is the real deal when it comes to a romantic dinner on Valentine&#39;s Day. The folks at Quince were On. Top. Of. It. for VDay. These guys do not mess around.<br><br>The whole experience--from the personalized menu (they had my and my husband&#39;s names on the menu), to the top-notch drinks, to the mind-blowing food, all the way to the end where they called us a cab and handed us hot sipping chocolate on our way out the door--was PHENOMENAL. The attention to detail from start to finish was absolutely exquisite. I feel as if a Valentine&#39;s Day dinner at Quince is not for the couples just on a casual fling. This is for the seriously-in-it-for-the-long-term-&#39;til-death-do-­us-part kind of meal. I mean--would you really bring a casual date over to a restaurant that prints your names on the menu for Valentine&#39;s Day unless you&#39;re looking for something serious out of it? It&#39;s like that paper is practically a piece of document legally binding you to each other. <br><br>This place has definitely raised the bar in my book.",

My childhood friends mom does fondue every xmas eve so thats always something that I have to look forward to once a year. I love fondue ! Popular to the misconceived notion , its not just cheese. You do have a cheese pot but there are other pots with olive oil for steak and poultry and seafood.. and then for dessert to... <br><br>The service here is immaculate. It was really beautiful to I think its at a hotel this place. Its funny because when I got out of my car I was walking around a little confused which direction the front door was located at, and suddenly I realized it was really quiet and the building was beautiful and made out of brick and there were flowers, and a limo..and I go deja vue that I was in a past life on an episode of the bachelor.. my boo ( I dont know what to call him ,we arent official yet because I am weird but thats another story haha)  walked up and saw the confusion on my face and I told him &#34; I feel like I am on the Bachelor, where is my Rose &#34; hahah but yah we went inside and it is almost cave like in there, each table has a hot pot.. the food is really good, we had a pre fix menu for Valentines day. I also tried one of their Mojitos . <br><br>I would def return here. I know it was a little pricey ( I didnt look at the bill! ) but I would def come back here , our server was incredible, I cant remember her name but she was sweet and attentive.

"reviewcomment":"La Folie is amazing. It also made me extremely poor afterwards. <br>It is extremely limited in seating because it&#39;s a small, intimate restaurant and prepare to be there for a while, because each meal is about 2-3 hours long. <br><br>I&#39;ve been here twice already, and I think the part that really impressed me is how consistent this place is with the quality of food, the aesthetics of the food, and the technical skills involved. The chef behind this restaurant is a genius. <br><br>I think the part that gets me the most about La Folie is the experience of being able to create your own course meal. They have a list of items you can choose from, and you can create 3,4 or 5 courses ($85,95,105 respectively, I think). They also have a Chef&#39;s Special course menu (5 courses for $115), of which you can take one dish as part of your own course meal for a $10 supplement. It&#39;s a cool and interactive concept. <br><br>Warning: unless you are a 500 pound tyrannosaurus rex, you will most likely be unable to finish all 5 courses without feeling absolutely disgusting or wanting to throw up. So, even though the eye wanders and wants to try 5 different dishes, I would say, try to stay away from getting 5 courses. Trust me, I tried (with one of my guy friends) the 5 course meal the first time I visited and we both left feeling miserable. Our eyes are always bigger than our stomachs. And here&#39;s why. <br><br>After you&#39;ve order your course, they start you off with a few amuse bouche (small complimentary starting dishes courtesy of the chef). At my most recent visit, I was able to try monkfish liver mousse and a poached egg yolk with a type of soup inside. <br>-monkfish liver mousse: Monkfish liver for me is a hit or miss. That being said, I didn&#39;t really enjoy this monkfish liver mousse. It was too fishy, almost had a silver metal taste. Definitely not my favorite. <br>-Poached egg yolk soup: I had this the first and the second time I visited (with different soups inside) and I think the idea and the execution behind this is absolutely genius, stunning, and delicious. An extremely thin crisp potato chip tops this with a tiny toasted slice of bread on the side for you to mix the poached egg yolk and the soup together. <br><br>Then you start your series of courses. So far I&#39;ve tried: <br>-the tastings of passat roe: I liked the raw sashimi on the plate. the passat roe itself, not so much. But roe in general is not really something my taste buds enjoy, so that was just a mistake on my part ordering this dish. Otherwise, I think it could be a very fresh and clean dish for those who enjoy roe. <br>-corn and lobster soup: Absolutely delicious. it was just the right level of sweetness from the flavors of the corn, and small bits of lobster inside. The waiter brought the plate with the lobster in it, and the soup on the side and poured it in for me so it was just the right temperature. I know it was just soup, but seriously one of the best soups I had. I would order it again. <br>-lobster and mushroom risotto: delicious. the risotto is just rich enough to savor the mushrooms and the rice was on the creamy side, but the lobster pieces cut through the richness and creaminess just enough that I didn&#39;t feel overwhelmed after I finished the dish. <br>-Duck breast and confit: I like it. I don&#39;t LOVE it. the duck breast is cooked perfectly, but the duck confit on the side is just okay, and i didn&#39;t enjoy the smoked duck tongue. If I&#39;m going to pay $100+ for a meal, I would want a dish where I can eat the entire plate and the busboy in the  back doesn&#39;t even have to wash the dishes because i cleaned it off so well (well, i guess i&#39;m sort of exaggerating) <br>-bay scallop over squid ink spaghetti topped with uni: one of the best dishes I had so far. The spaghetti was perfectly al dente and actually tasted of squid ink. the bay scallop was the softest scallop I had tasted in my life. <br>-Butter poached lobster with parsnip ravioli: my boyfriend got this one, and he said it was really good. I tried a bite of the dish too and it was really good! the ravioli was really soft and not starchy, and of course, the lobster was absolutely divine. Even the crispy kale and salad on top was great. <br>-Roti of Quail and Squab: their signature dish. And there&#39;s a reason why. They take wild mushrooms, quail, and squab and wrap it all in this crispy potato wrap and cook it. It&#39;s an extreme use of technical skills and really really good. The meats are cooked perfectly, potato wrap perfectly crisp. This is definitely a must get. <br>-Baked Alaska: my favorite dessert at La Folie of all times. the one and only dish that actually got me through my 5 course meal without feeling completely miserable. It was that good. <br><br>Overall the food is worth only 4 stars, but I gave it that extra star because compared to other $$$$ restaurants in SF, it&#39;s cheaper and the price is worth every penny for its quality and consistency of the food.",

"reviewcomment":"I walk past Sons &amp; Daughters everyday and remember when it use to be Cafe Mozart. Sorry I shouldn&#39;t even mention the two in the same line since they just can&#39;t be compared. My fiance and I finally checked it out to celebrate our engagement. As soon as we sat down they offered us a glass of champagne for a toast, what a nice touch! <br><br>We had the tasting menu (that&#39;s your only choice) and split a wine pairing since we both had to work the next day. The food was some of the best I&#39;ve had, albeit the portions are tiny even for a tasting menu. The breads are really really fabulous here and help fill you up between the other courses, they&#39;re a must try. Service is great and I loved being able to see into the kitchen as the chefs prepare your food. <br><br>Can&#39;t wait to go back and try out a new seasonal menu to see what they&#39;ve come up with!",

"reviewcomment":"Came here for Brunch on a Sunday morning. My bf and I made a last minute decision, and he found reservations on Opentable that morning. Score! We got here around 10:30am, when it seemed like SF was still sleeping. The restaurant was very quiet, but it was pleasant. The interior of the restaurant screams fine dining, but the food prices are fair for the quality of food. I think this is a great place for brunch if you&#39;re tired of waiting in line (i.e. Plow, Mission Beach Cafe), and just want to relax on your day off!<br><br>We started off with the beignets -- I was expecting something crispy, kind of like the ones in NOLA. But, we actually got beignets that looked like donut holes! Except rolled in cinnamon sugar...man they were delicious. I also liked the dipping sauces included: the huckleberry preserves and creme anglais. This was a great starter!<br><br>I really wanted the burger my bf kept telling me about. We are always in search of the best burger in SF, and he claimed this was one of them. The burger was fantastic. It&#39;s composed of different types of meat, which made it softer than usual. The fries were very good too - the perfect medium thickness (not too skinny like McDonalds, not too thick). They were nice and soft. <br><br>My bf got the pastrami and grits, which he really loved. No regrets here!<br><br>The service is extremely personable. The Burmese waiter we had was always making jokes with us, as if we had dined there all the time (it was my first time). Everyone was just so friendly. I guess this is what you expect for a 1-Michelin star restaurant!<br><br>I can&#39;t wait to come here for dinner sometime. The hostess on our way out told us about &#34;Burgers and Burgundy&#34; on Sunday nights, where you eat the burger and a glass of Burgundy wine. The regular menu looks great too, although on the pricier side. I&#39;d like to come back whenever I have the chance (or credit).",

"reviewcomment":"This cuisine is difficult to classify ... Calling it Indian California fusion doesn&#39;t really do it justice. The menu is limited only in the sense that it is all tasting menus. As newbies we started with the signature Spice Route menu, nine very small gourmet portion size courses. All ranged from yummy to super yummy. Amazingly we felt full after finishing, proving you can get full if you eat enough gourmet size portions. Alcohol could double or triple the bill of $95 per person. But sparkling water was a reasonable $10 per bottle. <br><br>For repeat business there is a chef&#39;s surprise tasting menu. You don&#39;t know what you&#39;re getting in advance. But I would totally trust the chef for that after our first experience.",

"reviewcomment":"Actual rating 4.5.<br><br>I saw this on SF Eater as one of the picks of the Eater 38. As is with many of my foodie adventures I asked the No1DP to join me. This was the celebratory meal after going through 3 weeks of an intense module.<br><br>VENUE: Located in Outer Richmond, quite far from the touristy areas of SF. The fares for the taxi ride heading in and the Uber ride going out were actually quite comparable, $20-$25 each way. To head into this area you have to know what you&#39;re looking for.<br><br>The No1DP and I sat in the back of the restaurant, far away from the main activity. <br><br>SERVICE: Very good. Waiter was knowledgeable about the menu and the specific wine parings for each of our dishes.<br><br>While we didn&#39;t go for the tasting menu, we settled for a 3 course meal with drink pairings.<br><br>1ST COURSE<br>Lavender (orange blossom honey, gin): My drink. I remember that it was smooth for a gin-based drink and the citrus flavors blended in with the gin really well, so well that I could not taste the gin.<br>Fennel (dill, saffron, black pepper, vodka): No1DP&#39;s drink; he says it was an &#34;interesting choice&#34; for a vodka-based drink. I thought it was a bit too herbal to my liking.<br><br>The olives were some of the best I&#39;ve ever had; it was lightly salted and the raw almonds rounded out the dish by giving it a nice crunch. Reminded me quite a bit of edamame. <br><br>Their interpretation of lentil soup was good. Soup was poured out right in front of me. Lentils were soft and there was enough beans to soup that it didn&#39;t make me full right away.<br><br>2ND COURSE<br>The menu changes seasonally with the exception of the basteeya and lamb shank, which are always offered.<br><br>I knew about the basteeya as it is featured on this year&#39;s 7x7 list but I decided on going by the suggestion of the waiter and tried the lamb shank. This is one of the best entrees I&#39;ve had this year, as this is a perfect example of a dish with the right amount of flavor combinations. The lamb shank was not gamey and the meat just fell off the bone (like osso bucco), the barley and cream was rich and gave the meat a bit of salt, the arugula imparted a bit of bitterness and the pomegranate gave it a bit of sweet. Words cannot describe how perfect the flavors molded together when you tried everything. The wine pairing was good as the red wine was not too strong.<br><br>No1DP had the black cod with broccoli, mushrooms seasoned with black truffles. The fish was quite soft and the truffle/mushroom combination imparted quite a nice earthy feel. The fish was portioned so that every bite was a tease. He also enjoyed his accompanying white wine.<br><br>3RD COURSE<br>Although good, the dessert course was our least favorite course. <br><br>I got the semolina cake. The texture had good amounts of soft cake and crunchy topping. There was a slight orange taste in the cake and sesame in the toppings. The Madeira wine was excellent and had the right amount of sweet for an after-dinner drink.<br><br>No1DP got a chocolate mousse with lots of yogurt. The yogurt was a bit too sour and I couldn&#39;t taste the chocolate mousse. Texture was also a bit too weird for mousse. <br><br>Should I come back here I definitely would like to try more of their cocktails and finally get their basteeya.",

Talk about feeling super special!<br>-Seated extremely quick and our drink order was taken immediately.<br>-Complements to the chef because I really enjoyed the sea food and normally I stay as far away as possible!<br>-The serving staff were very professional and personable. Loved that they checked in on us and that my glass was never empty! <br>-The mixed beverages were amazing. I had a passion fruit or guava cocktail after dinner and it went so well with dessert!<br><br>Con&#39;s:<br>-I was not able to eat more as I was extremely satisfied. <br><br>Highlights of our menu:<br><br>Petrole sole- delicious seafood dish. I highly recommend trying it. It comes layered with 3  different delicacies. At the base is a tender filet of fish, then what I think is sea urchin, then caviar. It is served with a light sauce and mushroom accents on a bed of mashed potatoes.<br><br>Seared Filet Mignon with a lobster truffled mac &amp; cheese en brioche accented with a red wine, shallot, thyme bordelaise sauce. My main meal, I gave the lobster and the mac &amp; cheese to my guy as I was to, to, to full to finish anything else.<br><br>Coffee Rubbed Buffalo Steak, With Pickled Figs Caramelized leeks, espresso and fig red wine sauce, cornbread madeleine. My guy&#39;s main meal. I risked my fingers to get a little taste of this.<br><br>ALL OF THE DESSERTS- I mean it was my birthday! They were so good and the presentation was amazing.<br><br>Loved the experience here! Thank you to everyone that made my birthday an awesome one!!!",

"reviewcomment":"4.5* rounded up<br><br>Range is my go-to restaurant in San Francisco - solid food and nice ambiance (modern and minimal, yet cozy; fancy but not pretentious) though with tightly packed tables. It has become much easier to get a reservation since they lost their Michelin star but the quality has remained the same. Overall, the food is fairly simple and consistent - if you prefer complexly prepared dishes with a swirly melange of flavors, foam, etc you may find Range disappointing; I have a foodie friend who thinks it&#39;s over-rated for this exact reason. Desserts tend to be on the less to moderately sweet side. Good, friendly bartenders and a nice bar that is generally always full.",

My childhood friends mom does fondue every xmas eve so thats always something that I have to look forward to once a year. I love fondue ! Popular to the misconceived notion , its not just cheese. You do have a cheese pot but there are other pots with olive oil for steak and poultry and seafood.. and then for dessert to... <br><br>The service here is immaculate. It was really beautiful to I think its at a hotel this place. Its funny because when I got out of my car I was walking around a little confused which direction the front door was located at, and suddenly I realized it was really quiet and the building was beautiful and made out of brick and there were flowers, and a limo..and I go deja vue that I was in a past life on an episode of the bachelor.. my boo ( I dont know what to call him ,we arent official yet because I am weird but thats another story haha)  walked up and saw the confusion on my face and I told him &#34; I feel like I am on the Bachelor, where is my Rose &#34; hahah but yah we went inside and it is almost cave like in there, each table has a hot pot.. the food is really good, we had a pre fix menu for Valentines day. I also tried one of their Mojitos . <br><br>I would def return here. I know it was a little pricey ( I didnt look at the bill! ) but I would def come back here , our server was incredible, I cant remember her name but she was sweet and attentive. I will def come back here !! :) great place for a date. .",

"reviewcomment":"Solid American/Californian food. Great service. Definitely come here for DAT if you can, because then it&#39;s a great deal. Normally, it&#39;s pretty pricey, but food is worth it.<br><br>I got the beef dish, and I was afraid that the cut would be too dry. But our server reassured me that it would be tender, juicy, and flavorful. Which is what it ended up being. No complaints here from picky meat eater :)<br><br>Otherwise, the flavors were pretty awesome. Lots of accompaniments to enhance the meat itself. I really loved the onions and the chestnut puree. Beef was cooked perfectly of course. Lots of savoriness and umami.",

"reviewcomment":"First off, Cavallo Point is beautiful and the lodge is in a perfect location.  We had a delicious meal at Murray Circle.  I started off with their half dozen oysters, and their delicious bread.  We were served a refreshing amuse bouche, and then I had the sea scallops with duck liver mousse (perfect taste complement to the scallops) in a leek broth, which came off their prix fixe menu but can be ordered à la carte.   My friends ordered the maitake mushrooms appetizer, the filet mignon and black cod.  We didn&#39;t have room for dessert but enjoyed their brittle, chocolate and powdered hazelnut candy balls.  The wine list was interesting - it ranged from $65 bottles to $23,000+ (not kidding), with the average probably being more than $500.  But otherwise the food was well-priced given the quality of preparation and we were really happy with our meals.  <br><br>The only negative was that our service wasn&#39;t as polite as I&#39;d expect - e.g. my friend had some dietary restrictions and wanted to ask if a couple of the dishes could be made gluten-free, but the server showed his frustration and insisted on pointing out the dishes that were gluten-free even though she had no interest in several of them.",

"reviewcomment":"Dear Yelp Moderators:<br><br>do you read these reviews? If so you&#39;d know that this review was not about Aqua. In fact the only thing that it had to do with Aqua was that it took place there. Otherwise this was Eric Ripert&#39;s solo show there. Even the menu said Le Bernadin Tasting Menu! So please don&#39;t arbitrarily move this under Aqua&#39;s normal reviews. As with the &#34;Yelp Elite Events @Put Name of Place Here&#34;, this was a special night and should be for those that attended it. That being said I&#39;ve updated my Aqua Restaurant review accordingly.<br><br>Thanks <br>KQN<br><br>ps for those who&#39;ve read this before go about your business, nothing to see here :)<br>==================================================­==<br>Ever since seeing Eric Ripert &amp; Anthony Bourdain hit up the French Laundry in a Cooks Tour, then work a double shift on the line at Les Halles on no reservations, I&#39;d been meaning to try Le Bernadin. I had my chance about a year ago and sure enough it was every bit as good (if not better) than I expected to be. When it was announced that he was going to cook at Aqua (fitting that he would be good friends with Laurent Manrique who used to run another all seafood Michelin restaurant), I jumped at the chance to go. Four of us attended the one night only, Le Bernadin tasting menu to see what Chef Ripert would do with some west coast ingredients.<br><br>The menu and wine pairings as follows:<br><br>- Baked Kumamoto Oysters with Thyme, Sweet Garlic Butter<br>+ NV Bruno Paillard Premiere Cuvee Brut Reims<br><br>-Kampachi Tartare with Wasabi Tobiko and Ginger-Coriander Emulsion<br>+ Takasago Ginga Shizuku Junmai Daiginjo Sake &#34;Divine Droplets&#34;<br><br>- Rare Seared Yellowtail Hamachi marinated in Tandoori Spices with Pickled Cucumber and Mango Salad<br>+ 2007 Erben von Beulwitz Kabinett Riesling Kasler Nies&#39;chen Mosel<br><br>- Barely Cooked Slamon with Asparagus in a Wild Mushroom Pot Au Feu<br>+ 2005 Domaine Laroche Chablis 1er Cro Les Vaudevey<br><br>- Escolar Poached in Extra Virgin Olive Oil with Sea Beans, Potato Crisps, and Light Red Wine Bearnaise (Beurre Rouge)<br>+ 2005 Nuits-Saint-George Chanson Pere &amp; Fils<br><br>- Duo of Comte and Redwood Hill Farm Crottin<br>+ 2006 Jurancon Uroulat Charles Houres<br><br>Of course everything was excellent as expected. Like Le Bernadin, even with an excellent meal there are a few things that stand out as mind blowing.  The buttery texture of the salmon, the savory umami of the beurre rouge, the pairing of Sake with the Kampachi. I know it&#39;s disturbing but I think I could have had a mug of that beurre rouge and been pretty happy. It was that good.<br><br>In all fairness I can&#39;t compare it with Laurent Manrique&#39;s Aqua (he&#39;s not even there anymore at this point) because I&#39;d not tried it. The last time I was at Aqua Michael Mina was still the star there (which I do need to a do a nostalgia review of). It&#39;s unfortunate because how do we get Eric Ripert to return to SF? Hopefully Manrique will start a new place soon or better yet, he and Ripert will double up Wonder Twins style and setup  a new place together. Hey Eric, Laurent, are you hearing this?",

"reviewcomment":"Im sad work kept getting in the way of the previous editions that ran at Radius. Recently, they moved to Coi&#39;s space and even utilized some of the Coi regular staff that I recognized. It&#39;s cool to see the servers in their normal clothes and hear Dr. Dre bumping on the sound system. Very un Coi like. However, the food is still very un-Coi like, with Chefs Rich&amp;Rich putting out absolutely beautiful food. There was a bit of a wait at first but it was worth it. Will Bill Corbett as a guest (a mass ex Coi reunion!) on pastries we ended up with:<br><br>-Smoked Comte Corn Fritter, Shiso Salsa Verde<br>-Giant Clam, Apple, Celery, Passion Fruit <br>-Garlic Soup, Egg, Sourdough Stuffing, Wild Greens<br>-Plancharead, Roasted Cauliflower, Sprouts, Sorrel Soda <br>-Pork Pieces, Autumn Squash, Brussles Sprouts, Brown Butter  <br>-Apple, Buttermilk, Hazlenut. Pinenut Butterfinger <br>-Pumpkin bread to go.<br><br>Wow. All I can say is if you&#39;ve not hit this dinner yet, do yourself a favor and go. Everything was well balanced, creative and most important, delicious. Obviously with most of the same staff as Coi plus a few others, the service is also great. It&#39;s cool to be able to hit up the space in a more casual atmosphere but still be able to eat just as well with a friendlier price tag. Can&#39;t wait till the next one!",

"reviewcomment":"My friend wanted to eat somewhere nice for her bday, and we needed to find a place with a last minute reservation for 5 people. One Market Restaurant fit this criteria! I wasn&#39;t expecting much since this place has 3.5 stars on Yelp, and because most people said this is mostly a place for Business lunches. However, this place very much exceeded everyone&#39;s expectations!<br><br>To be honest, we were all very late for our reservation. It was originally for 6:45pm on a Friday night, and we didn&#39;t get there until 7:15pm. Traffic was awful downtown, just in case you&#39;ll be in that situation.  However, they were very accommodating and still sat us regardless. They weren&#39;t even irritated by it! Perhaps it happens often.<br><br>We ordered 4 appetizers. Everyone loved everything. The quality was very impressive. My favorites were the veal tartare and the Duck Frisee Salad. Yum....they were devoured in minutes! Small side note - even the comp bread was good. It came warm, and had the perfect chewiness.<br><br>I got the Red Snapper. The waiter said he liked this one a lot, so I wanted to try it. The fish was so amazing! The flavors were perfect. The snapper can be plain, but with the celery root risotto, and blood orange, it was full of flavor. It was saucy, but only as much to complement the dish. I would DEFINITELY recommend this fish. I couldn&#39;t believe how great it was.<br><br>I remember we got 2 desserts, but can&#39;t remember what they were. Guess I was too drunk by then. But, I do remember that they wrote &#34;Happy Birthday Frances&#34; on the plate in chocolate, which was super sweet. Usually places just say &#34;congratulations&#34; or &#34;happy birthday&#34; with no name. But adding the name made it more special! Thank you One Market!<br><br>For 4 appetizers, 5 entrees, 2 desserts, the price came out to 62/person. Not bad! I will definitely be back. I don&#39;t know why everyone gives this place an average score. It deserves way better than that!<br><br>The service was great. They were very patient with our medium sized group, and just left us alone to do our thing. They didn&#39;t rush us in ordering, didn&#39;t rush us with the bill. Perfect! Would return with a group again.",

"reviewcomment":"Would you believe   the best Happy Hour and the best looking bar in North Beach is in The Penthouse on Broadway and Montgomery.  With $2 import beer, well drinks and no cover Monday through Friday before 5pm (they open at 4pm), you really can&#39;t go wrong.  The scantily clad smoking Hotties strutting around doesn&#39;t hurt either.  The Penthouse has, without  a doubt, THE nicest bar/club in North Beach.  I&#39;ve been a customer of this location since back in the Boy&#39;s Toys days and it&#39;s never looked better than it does now.  <br><br>The decor is immaculate along with the staff from the 1st person you meet at the door to the last person you meet when you&#39;re leaving - everyone is a consummate professional.  Whenever my friends arrive, we feel like Royalty being welcomed home.  When we leave we&#39;re already planning on when we&#39;re coming back.    Women enjoy this place. It&#39;s such an amazingly nice and inviting atmosphere that my friend, his wife and all of her friends enjoy coming over for happy hour.  I have other friends who bring their girlfriends (it was their GF&#39;s idea) and everyone has a great time.  <br><br>The Penthouse hits the top mark by simultaneously being classy &#39;and&#39; comfortable whether you want to drink, eat dinner or just lounge (or a combination of all 3) but don&#39;t get me wrong.  If you want to enjoy more than just the happy hour drinks and the amazing food and ambiance, the Penthouse women are drop-dead gorgeous and Smokin&#39; Hot.  Whether you stay after happy hour or not, The Penthouse is the best place to get your night started and if you&#39;re lucky enough to chat with Jonny, Akio or any of the other managers, bartenders or staff that make this place amazing, you&#39;re probably going to end up staying.  You&#39;ll certainly choose to come back for more!",

"reviewcomment":"Great place for fancy schmancy dim sum!!<br><br>I thought the bill was going to be horrendous from previous reviews, but it really wasn&#39;t that bad.  Comparable in price to Yank Sing, but a much swankier, high end, hip and exclusive feel to it.  I think two of us ate for about $120, and that&#39;s a no holds barred meal, smorgasbord of food, also including seafood and drinks.  All the dishes were about $6-12 each, except the main lobster with spinach noodle, which ran about $28 but was weeellllllll worth it. YUM.<br><br>Each dish comes out artistically presented on a plate or in a bamboo steamer.  Each dish more delicious and beautiful than the last!!  The only unimpressive dish was the fried rice.  We ordered the chocolate orange dessert and were blown away not only by the taste, but the pop rocks added an outside-the-box texture and the presentation includes an interactive display of melting the outer shell of the chocolate ball right before your eyes and revealing the light and fluffy truffle innards.  Oh and it had edible gold flakes all over it too.  You basically feel like you are literally eating royalty.  <br><br>Great place to take a guest or a group if you really want to impress.  We came for lunch and it wasn&#39;t too busy, but I could totally see this place hopping on a Friday/Saturday night.  The bar is huge and looks like it could be a lot of fun for a group of people or for those looking for a good time ;) ;)",
