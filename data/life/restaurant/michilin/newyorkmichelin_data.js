"reviewcomment":"I wish I had finished this review earlier, cause now I have forgotten most of the details!<br><br>You need to make reservation way ahead of time to eat there, and they are not cheap. Not cheap is probably an understatement, they are hella expensive! But I&#39;d say it&#39;s absolutely worth it!<br><br>First impression wasn&#39;t too good. I forgot what time was our reservation, like late at night. Did I say that you need to make reservation way ahead of time, we tried. But first try was a failure, then we tried again the follow week, and I think we got two spots for like 10 at night or something. But anyway, we got their at like 9:45 and we were basically got kicked out because we were too early. It was cold, we were hungry and we got kicked out and told to come back when it&#39;s 10, 10 is 10, dang it, not 9:45!!<br><br>The place was nice, it&#39;s a stainless steel open kitchen where you sit there and watch food getting prepared right in front of you, in the kitchen, pretty cool and impressive.<br><br>Pictures were not allowed, so with my little brain I don&#39;t remember much details and what we ate. We had like 15 courses? something like that. All the sashimi and raw stuff were served first, then there&#39;s the main dishes, and there were like 4 or 5 dessert. All I got to say is they are absolutely amazing! Like how can people even come up with stuff like that? everything just match so well and it&#39;s like magic in your mouth. The absolutely worst part is everything is bite size! OMG, when that little thing was being served, it&#39;s like a piece of art, but it&#39;s so small but so good that you want MORE MORE MORE AND MORE!!<br><br>Anyhow, this review is probably not that helpful, but it&#39;s was my experience, an amazing experience. <br><br>Well, will I go back, I&#39;d love to, but at that price tag, I would try something else, maybe other Michelin restaurant when we go back to NYC again. Or if I won the lottery, I will definitely go again.",

"reviewcomment":"What&#39;d I do to be so lucky to have dinner here?? No thanks to me, my boyfriend was very diligent and managed to snag a reservation here for a Friday at 9 PM. Somehow, he made it seem easy, but others have bemoaned the reservation system and its difficulties. Just keep trying and checking back for cancellations and open seats!<br><br>Each dish was stellar in its own right. It certainly is an experience, and you&#39;ll leave feeling satisfied - not stuffed, and not hungry, but just right. I prefer tasting menus that allow you to try many different flavors and small dishes over having a choice of one entree and one appetizer. My favorites included the soup, which was great (I think it was pepper), the caviar and egg dish, which was amazing (trust me, there is nothing more gleefully pornographic than watching that yolk ooze out of the egg, on to the scattered caviar), and the main dish, which was duck. It blew my socks off (even though I wasn&#39;t wearing socks). Outstanding. There were a total of maybe 13 or 14 courses. We bought a bottle of white wine to accompany our meal. Sealed the deal.<br><br>I&#39;m uncomfortable having expensive dinners, but this is one meal that is worth it if you have the $$ to spare, especially for a nice occasion.",

"reviewcomment":"Molecular gastronomy is a sub discipline of food science that seeks to investigate the physical and chemical transformations of ingredients that occur while cooking.  Its programme includes three axes, as cooking was recognised to have three components, which are social, artistic and technical.<br><br>   After three years i could get a table at 5:30 PM, it was a miracle. Surprise is the big element here.  I don&#39;t want to ruin your experience so I won&#39;t tell you about the food. Don&#39;t read lots of reviews because surprise is half of the fun. Let&#39;s say its modern french with a New York twist.<br>This is  my new favourite restaurant, my favourite restaurant.  Did I write it twice?<br>One of the best dining I have ever had. From start to finish. <br><br>   The best dinner of my life. Eleven Madison Park will always hold a very special place in my heart. Congratulations.",

"reviewcomment":"This is review is for the lunch tasting menu<br><br>I had high expectations coming in and Bouley&#39;s luncheon tasting menu absolutely blew my mind. Yes, it did end up being $100 for lunch (including wine) but I wouldn&#39;t think twice before forking over another $100 to come back. Make sure you have a good 3 hrs to spend though!<br><br>Bouley is the perfect blend of sophistication, simplicity and beautiful flavors. If you&#39;re a fan a truffle, you&#39;re in for a treat since pretty much every dish is elevated with truffle. <br><br>Big Eye Tuna - prepared as a tuna tartare on foam. The tuna was fresh but I was more impressed by the foam. It had a beautiful texture and actually added to the dish instead of most places that just put foam on to make stuff seem more fancy-pants. <br><br>Forager&#39;s Treasure of Wild Mushroom VS. Porcini Flan - I had a hard time debating between these two options so I shared with a friend. These two are both amazing dishes and I still can&#39;t decide which one I like better. It just depends on your mood. The Flan is more rich with decadent flavors. The mushrooms had a wonderful earthy taste that you don&#39;t get in most mushrooms. They tasted like they were plucked fresh from a magical forest...both amazing dishes<br><br>Slow Braised Kobe Style Beef Cheeks - the beef just melts so no knife required. It also comes with a nice small side of mashed potatoes that was nice to dip the beef in<br><br>Dessert - I actually had to run to a meeting so I missed dessert <br><br>Wine - the Cote du Rhone was really reasonably priced, went well with the tasting menu, and most importantly, delicious--low tannins, nice acidity, great soft finish. <br><br>And they also have a super fun bread cart that they push around with about 20 different types of bread. I&#39;ve never seen such a crazy selection. <br><br>Overall, great, great value for lunch!",

"reviewcomment":"It was our 4th anniversary and we decided to go big. Started off the night in the lounge beneath atera, before our 9.30pm res. The drinks were on-point. I had some sort of bourbon concoction and it was terrific. <br><br>The main event: 18 courses. Wine Pairings. This is one of the best meals I&#39;ve had in my entire life. <br><br>It was long, but not boring. <br><br>I wish I could write more, but I was pretty buzzed and full by the end.

"reviewcomment":"The food here was amazing and didn&#39;t disappoint!  There were lots of spicy and interesting flavors which made for some memorable bites.  <br><br>We got the tasting menu and started with barbequed squid with Thai basil and peanuts (one of my favorite dishes) which was my favorite dish of the night.  <br><br>This was followed by the soup dumpling topped with seared foie gras which was also very good but I had issues with eating it.  Too big to pop in my mouth but when I bite into it hotness spills out burning my mouth!  <br><br>The entree dishes were Spanish mackerel with a Korean chili sauce (another favorite) and lamb with chickpeas, harissa, and black sesame.  The mackerel dish was amazing (almost tying with the barbequed squid) but the lamb dish was just pretty good.  Not as amazing as the other dishes.<br><br>Finally, my friends and I shared the three different desserts of poppy seed bread and butter pudding with meyer lemon curd, strawberry parfait with tofu, and pecan and Salted butterscotch beignets with bourbon milk ice.  All very yummy and I had no favorites among the three.  <br><br>All in all a great dining experience and will eagerly return the next time I&#39;m back in NY!",

"reviewcomment":"Three Michelin stars.  Four-star rating by the New York Times.  Simply put, Le Bernardin is the standard-bearer of the New York City fine dining scene.  Though the restaurant specializes in French cuisine, its theme is summed up perfectly by its executive chef and co-owner, Eric Ripert, who noted that at Le Bernardin, &#34;the fish is the star.&#34;  Indeed, what sets this establishment apart is its mastery of piscine preparation.  Rather than overwhelming fish with salt and flavor, which seems to be the norm nowadays, the chefs at Le Bernardin exquisitely draw out the natural flavor of the fish with more subtle tastes.  <br><br>I visited during lunch hours and sat in the Lounge, which features a very reasonable $45 three-course prix fixe menu in addition to the standard fare.  The sea scallops, which were thinly sliced and dressed with extra virgin olive oil, chives, and lemon, were phenomenal.  For my main course, I chose the merluza, a flaky cod-like fish (I had no idea what it was either until I looked it up before ordering) that was served with a parsnip purée with a perfectly understated dijon mustard sherry emulsion.  In keeping with the restaurant&#39;s French tradition, the saucing for the fish was applied at the table.  It was simply perfect.  The disassembled Mascarpone Mousse served as the perfect ending to the meal.    <br><br>As is expected of restaurants in this class, the service was impeccable.  Multiple waiters coordinated their movements to refill our drinks, replace utensils, and otherwise keep us satisfied.  A final thought: the impossibly wide array of selections in the bread basket might be irresistable (I would highly recommend the tomato fennel or the rosemary focaccia), but don&#39;t be an amateur and fill yourself up with bread!",

"reviewcomment":"Sushi Azabu has been on my &#34;to eat&#34; list for maybe one and a half years. I finally was able to pencil in some time, make the trek and come out to Tribeca for a nice Valentine&#39;s dinner with my honey pie. Best sushi I&#39;ve had since Sushi Yasuda which was a year ago.<br><br>ATMOSPHERE:<br>It&#39;s a little confusing as Azabu is combined with Greenwich Grill in terms of the ground floor being Greenwich grill and the basement being Sushi Azabu. They are both obviously owned by the same owner but if one did not know that, it could be hard to find as you go through Greenwich to get to Sushi Azabu. Sushi Azabu has wood veneer, very small space which makes for intimacy, however you can get sort of cozy with your neighbor. It is definitely for a party of 2 and I would not recommend coming with any larger. Date place for sure. We did not get to sit at the bar but that is the route I would recommend if you can get that seat. <br><br>SERVICE:<br>Very cordial and nice. You can&#39;t go wrong if you have a small space to service. <br><br>FOOD:<br>We were here for the Valentine&#39;s prefix but the Omakase is very good I hear. I&#39;d imagine the Valentine&#39;s is very similar to that. The sushi was so tender and literally melted in your mouth. Wow. Some of our favorites included the Uni appetizer and their black sesame dessert which was to die for. As for sushi/sashimi, I would recommend the shrimp, uni, fatty tuna and bbq eel. They were the most delicious, flavorful and I could not stop salivating to eat them as we saved them for last. The black sesame dessert was VERY good as well and I inhaled it like no tomorrow. <br><br>SUMMARY:<br>Want a nice date night in Tribeca and craving sushi? Then look no further. Perfect place to go and don&#39;t forget to get the shrimp/uni/fatty tuna and the black sesame dessert. Greenwich Grill up top looks like a great alternative if you can&#39;t get reservations and don&#39;t mind Japanese fusion. I&#39;m sure it&#39;s just as mind blowing.",

"reviewcomment":"Jungsik was one of the most impressive meals I&#39;ve had in a long time. Their flavors were complex, the dishes well composed, and the subtle Korean influence was a joy to experience. We got the tasting menu and added a full-size Pork Jowl and a full-size Jang Dok. I also asked that the mushroom course be substituted since I dislike mushrooms. The progression of the meal was very good and the dishes were consistently impressive.<br><br>The portion sizes here are actually quite large and I probably should have substituted dishes for the tasting menu instead of adding on extra dishes, but everything was so tasty I&#39;m glad I tried everything I could.<br><br>The raw scallop presentation is a great dish. Three scallops on top of uni sauce and fresh apples and cucumbers made a very strong start to the meal. The squid ink panko fried oysters were perfect. The crispy red snapper with cilantro (or parsley?) tom yum was spectacular. Instead of the mushrooms, they gave me a tasting portion of the wagyu beef and truffle bibimbap (with quinoa instead of rice). The pork jowl with sweet and sour broth was my favorite dish of the night.<br><br>From beginning to end, the meal exceeded my expectations. The tasting menu changes often, but I would say the scallops, the oysters, the crispy red snapper, and the pork jowl are must-eats. If they&#39;re not on your tasting menu, do a substitution to get them or just order them on the side. I don&#39;t think I have ever had a meal where every dish was as strong as it was at Jungsik. Each dish had flavor combinations I have never had before with great complexity and texture. The pork jowl was not on my tasting menu. I have no idea what I would have substituted on my tasting menu to get the pork jowl. That shows how strong the menu was. Why is Jungsik not 3 stars?",

"reviewcomment":"In New York for my anniversary and we hadn&#39;t planned on anything too fancy.. getting out of town was sufficient, or so we initially thought. I ask the concierge if he can find us anything and he looks at me like, its 3pm on a Saturday and you want reservations at a place you need to call in advance, and replies we can check. I had heard about Daniel and am a fan of the chef so we tried and sure enough there was a table available, knowing this isn&#39;t the norm we took it, after all it was meant to be. <br><br>We each ordered the Fixed price option and my wife had a glass of wine while I tried one of the non-alcohol specialty drinks, Palombaggia (or so it says on the bill). The wine paired great with the food my wife had ordered and I was in heaven with this drink.<br><br>The food was good, the atmosphere was elegant, the service was top notch and the experience was unforgettable.<br><br>I could not have asked for a more unforgettable experience for an unforgettable celebration. We were given a tour of the kitchen prior to picking up our jackets and walking out. <br><br>My wife wants it to become a routine.... I&#39;m now working overtime.",

"reviewcomment":"Once upon a time, there was a majestic city.<br>And a vast green park lay in a heart of it. Brightly decorated horse equipages carried fancy-dressed ladies and gentlemen along the road that encircled it. And on the other side of the road was a beautiful place called Marea.<br>...but this once upon a time is Now. and Here. <br><br>It&#39;s a classy place. The view of Central Park is wonderful. Servers are courteous. Table cloth are sharp, and table decorations are romantic.<br><br>Pre-fix menus are great since you can pretty much select everything. And while crudi did not impress me much (they were fresh, but rather ordinary), the main dish was outstanding. It was strozzapreti, with crab meat &amp; sea urchin. Pasta was handmade, perfectly cooked and flavors worked perfectly together.<br><br>Now, what I want to really rave about, are their drinks. Yes, they are pricey. But soooo well-crafted. I was celebrating after all, and being big fan of Remi, I had to get XO Sidecar, of course. It was nothing short of fantastic. <br><br>One last thing to finish great meal - mascarpone panna cotta. It was a masterpiece, served with granita on top, very refreshing and smooth at same time.<br><br>Yes, I will be coming back for the bar and desserts. Absolutely.",

"reviewcomment":"I LOVE LOVE LOVE this restaurant!!!<br><br>Came here with the man recently for my birthday dinner and I did the tasting menu with wine pairings, and he did the oysters and duck and helped with my wine ;-) .  The entire menu was great, but I have to say my favorite part was the amuse that came with the tasting menu, it had a beautifully dressed oyster, cauliflower panna cotta covered in a more than generous amount of caviar, and a brown egg - emptied and filled with mushrooms, egg, and truffles.  I was in love, and I wish I could eat in over and over again, or even better yet, if I could do all five courses of 3 bites of totally different but all equally delicious tidbits.  Either way though, I did truly enjoy each course!<br><br>The wine pairings were great! I&#39;m a big fan of French wine and other old world things, however their selection of mostly local wines were superb.  Each one was something to write home about.  The only one I wasn&#39;t crazy about was the Madeira paired with the mushroom soup.  Don&#39;t get me wrong, the pairing was on point, and I understand the need for a big rich wine to cut through the creaminess of the soup, but it was just a bit too early in the meal for me to break out something I&#39;d typically wait until after dinner to drink.  <br><br>Dessert was also incredible.  It was a quartet of different desserts, all citrus themed.  Honestly though, they had me as soon as they said blood orange.  If there was nothing else on the plate, I&#39;d still be perfectly content.  Oh yeah, and then they give you homemade granola for breakfast the next day.  How cute is that?!<br><br>The staff was knowledgeable and friendly.  Very professional and definitely added to the evening, making it more of an experience that just a great meal.  I can&#39;t wait to go back!",

Probably because only 2 tables were being served. The bread basket came with 2 amazing cream cheese dips. Im not a fan of bread but I already stuffed myself because of the cream cheese.<br><br>We had the 3-course meal for $29. So worth it. Had the lobster and poached egg appetizer. The lobster was so tender and not chewy at all. Then I had the veal cheeks for the entree.. It was AMAZING! The sauce did not overpower the dish and the meat was so tender. It was so good I had to eat ot very slow to savor each bite. Then we had the streusel, appleOh no.. Are you gonna be alright with your work load today? You have a busy day i hope you wont be staying extra late pancake-like dessert and soufflé. The streusel was so moist and creamy in the inside and nice crunch on the outside. All was superb!

"reviewcomment":"Without a doubt one of the top five best restaurants I have ever had the pleasure of dining at. This is my third trip here and it never gets tiring.<br>To begin I will discuss what I consider to be the most important aspect of any restaurant which is the food.<br>On this trip, we ordered the short board which came with three meats and three Artisianal cheeses. For meat, We went with the Serrano ham, the Breasola and the Rossette de Leon. All of which were served in generous portions. For the cheese we went with the Bucheron, the Taleggio and the parmigiano Reggiano. The boards are served with whole-grain mustard, fig compote, cornichons and aged balsamic vinegar with slices of a crusty French baguette. <br>For the main course I had the roasted Skate. This is the second time I ordered it as it is an ethereal dish. Served over celery root purée and crispy cauliflower in a hazelnut butter. By far the best fish I have eaten . <br>Paired with wines from a list that is full of great vino and great value. I recommend starting with a glass of the sparkling rose, then a glass of the barbera d&#39;asti, and for the main, go with the brunello di montalcino. <br>Make sure you leave room for creme brûlée for dessert. It pairs quite well with the white wine dessert flight. <br>If you visit one restaurant in Queens, make it Danny Brown, and make a reservation!",

"reviewcomment":"Gilt was amazing!!! We came here for our anniversary back in October 2012. It&#39;s a nice huge restaurant inside the Palace Hotel and you walk into the garden of the hotel and it&#39;s on the right hand side. It&#39;s beautiful. Nice tall ceilings and great service from the moment you walk in. They took our coats and seated us promptly since we had reservations. We came here for our anniversary. This is definitely a once in a lifetime experience! I mean our bill came out to maybe $500 for 2 people for the 7-course meal and alcohol! It&#39;s crazy and definitely the most we have paid for dinner. Also, he had arranged for them to set up a bouquet of flowers on the table and it looked amazing! :)<br><br>As for the food, we decided to go for the $150 7-course tasting menu. In comparison to the 5-course that is $120, and the 3-course meal for $89, it seemed like a better deal. Plus, it was a special occasion and our first time here so we decided to go all out. Our waiter was amazing and very attentive. In addition, there&#39;s a water guy, and a bread guy. It&#39;s so funny that they come around filling up our water so often and they come and ask us which kind of bread we want and you can choose as many options as you wanted. When I only asked for one, he&#39;s like which other ones would you like? I&#39;m like ohhhh...lol.<br><br>Anyways, for the entire night, it felt like the food just kept coming and coming and coming and I think it felt way more than a 7-course tasting menu. There were appetizers, entrees, and desserts. And we were wondering when it would end because it must be the longest dinner I have ever had, maybe 2-3 hours long...LOL! All the food and arrangements were very interesting and delicious. However, I can say that some of the food was a little bit too salty.<br><br>At the end of the night, they gave us a nice dessert plate written &#34;Happy Anniversary&#34; on it. Awesome! :)",

"reviewcomment":"It had been years since my previous visit to Public for its succulent and unusual Grilled Kangaroo On A Coriander Falafel.  I did not recall loving this zany starter, but I did remember loving a prawn entree, as well as the sexy atmosphere.  I recently had a colleague in from out of town and thought it would be a great place for her to really experience the Manhattan &#34;scene&#34;.<br><br>We were shockingly able to snag a same-day reservation and walked over from our neighboring office.  She was immediately in awe of the elegant decor and trendy crowd.  We were quickly taken to a cramped table, but managed to experience very helpful service during our uncomfortable stay.  We chose a white wine from their &#34;Unique Whites&#34; list that we had never even heard of - a 2010 Stadlmann &#34;Tagelsteiner&#34; Rotgipfler from out of Thermenregion, Austria.  Its accompanying description (&#34;red apple and green pear scented wine which also shows herbal spices and creamy texture&#34;) had been intriguing and spot-on.  <br><br>For starters, we enjoyed the a smooth and creamy Rabbit Rilette, which was served with buttery toast.  We also sampled the Marinated White Anchovies, which were delicious themselves, but the quinoa croquettes that they were served upon were pretty dry and crumbly.  For entrees, we loved our plates of Salmon and Venison.<br><br>After seeing the menu for and pictures of the Public brunch, I will definitely plan on heading there on a weekend afternoon next time.",

The yokitori chef made all dishes in front of us with great care and details. The service was great too, the waitress changes empty late very on time even though my friend and I were sitting in the corner.<br><br>I highly recommend chicken thin, chicken meatball and the shiitake mushroom.",

"reviewcomment":"I loved our whole experience there; therefore, a 5 stars.<br><br>I think we picked this place because it&#39;s a 1-star Michelin restaurant, and they didn&#39;t disappoint. The other plus is we could make reservation via <a href='/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fopentable.com&amp;s=897c359bd752b4f5407d5ea86453c82be2d1913c8d0b51b18d81fc58f52a6497' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>opentable.com</a>, I love using it.

Slowly the excitement was going away because after ~1.5 hours of driving (the fact that we were driving to Manhattan, plus crazy Veteran&#39;s Day traffic.  Apparently 1 hour wasn&#39;t even close to enough!) we were going to be late. I wasn&#39;t sure if we would lost our table because we were late, the fact that the restaurant is a michelin restaurant. Luckily, we didn&#39;t lose the table.<br><br>After we drove there, i needed to drive around for another 10 minutes looking for parking. By that point, my mood was almost gone.<br><br>The first step I stepped into the restaurant, we were welcomed by the staff and we were seated. The place was really peaceful and quite and really nice, it wasn&#39;t crowded at all, it was kind of a surprise and I was thinking it would be like other brunch places that&#39;s always crowed with a long line.<br><br>The food was amazing. I had the crab cake Benedict and the wife had the smoke salmon, they are all very good. I especially enjoyed mine as the crab cake was a very good size (huge), it was just the right portion. Don&#39;t have too much else to say about the food, it&#39;s simply good. The fact that the whole experience was good, I am giving it a 5-stars. <br><br>Definitely would go back again next time visiting.",

"reviewcomment":"I went yesterday for Restaurant Week and I was AMAZED by the whole package of this place. There&#39;s scaffolding outside, but a huge Tamarind sign will lead you in the right way. Once inside, you&#39;ll be treated to a contemporary decor, yet warm, not cold. We were lead upstairs and the waiter placed two bowls of fried spinach leaves in cilantro sauce for each of us. It was a great way to kick off the meal.<br><br>We ordered from the Restaurant Week Menu.<br><br>I got Crab Nazakat (Lump crab meat, mustard seeds, curry leaves, lemon zest, honey, coconut). It tasted like the ocean in the best possible way. It was savory from the baked, light crispy bread, yet refreshing from the lump crab meat and lemon. My friend got the Spinach &amp; Watermelon salad which looked amazing with fried Paneer on top.<br><br>Two choice of main entrees each. I got the Taar Korma and Nizami Machli Tikka. The salmon was THE BEST piece of cooked salmon I&#39;ve ever had. It was so flaky and moist with a very thin crust. The same cilantro sauce from earlier was the perfect compliment. The lamb was tender and moist as well, not dry or chewy. I used the naan to slop up every drop of the curry sauce and stopped just short of licking the plate.<br><br>My friend got the Potli Baingan and Methi Paneer. She&#39;s vegetarian.<br><br>The dessert was Mango Shrikand, which was like a mango yogurt cream and perfect way to finish the meal.<br><br>I absolutely LOVE this place. It was a bargain at $25 for lunch.",

"reviewcomment":"My bro mentioned this place one day, and of course, being a wine bloke, I had to check it out. Their wine selection is off the charts! Its 27 pages !!!! For an Indian restaurants, it was very surprising. As you may have known, Indian food is very difficult to pair with wine. But their Sommelier has done a fantastic job! Hats off to him !! Ambience is awesome! From decor, to the staff, and not to mention the food, is phenomenal across the board !! <br><br>Staff is very attentive. The head chef has lots of accolades under his belt. I met him, he seemed very down to earth and humble. He also, takes photos !! So, if you get star struck, and if he is around, just ask, and click !! Simple as that. <br><br>The bartender, is great! He made me his signature drink- Masala Margherita, which was fun to watch. Lots of theatrics, with lighting stuff on fire. Sorry, spoiler-alert!  He seemed very passionate, and took pride in making that drink. My date was amazed! She was like you have to do it again !!! Its definitely a sight to see. <br><br>If you love food, and dinning experience as much as I do, check this place out! Seriously, its quite an experience. <br><br>Yes. An epic review indeed!",

The decor is seriously sooo nice. In the words of another woman sitting next to me, it feels like we&#39;re sitting in a jewelry box. Except it&#39;s not all razzle dazzle rather bamboo-ish. Right away I was surprisingly pleased at the good service provided. <br><br>We ordered literally salmon on, in, under EVERYTHING. We requested three different types of salmon sashimi and it was just sooo tender, fresh and i swear it melted in my mouth. That should do it for the rest of the salmon we ordered as well. The tartar with the different types of fishes were yummy too with the sweet potato chips. <br><br>For dessert we had the Green tea sandwiches and Tiramisu which was also really yummy but I was so full I couldn&#39;t enjoy it as much as if I had the room for it. We were also rushing it because we had a play to attend to right after. Even with the amount of food we ordered we both thought it was actually priced fairly. <br><br>Would I come back here? Yes! and I would highly recommend this to anyone who loves Sashimi.",

"reviewcomment":"I&#39;d seen Aldea come up on the Restaurant Week menu several times, but they also offer the same lunch prix-fixe all year round. Without any timing constraints, reservations for lunch were easily made and I blocked off the afternoon on my work calendar. In a few days, I found myself outside of Aldea on a rainy weekday afternoon.<br><br>Aldea has a fairly paired down, tranquil ambiance that still manages to feel stylish and sleek. The decor plays on beige and blue tones and while the venue isn&#39;t particularly large, manages to appear more spacious than it actually is. There&#39;s an upstairs dining room, but we were seated on the first floor, which has a full view of the open kitchen. Our server was very prompt in handing us menus and making sure our water glasses were filled throughout the meal, which is always an appreciated gesture. The lunch menu is fairly standard: Three courses with a few options per course. It didn&#39;t take too long for us to make our selections and our orders were taken with ease.<br><br>We started off with the Pork and Duck Terrine, which is served with a side of mixed greens and a toasted and lightly buttered baguette half. Terrine isn&#39;t an impressive item to begin with; it&#39;s a conglomeration of mixed meat parts, usually the scraps that can&#39;t be sold or used otherwise, with a taste that bears resemblance to pâté. It is, nonetheless, a time-consuming dish and when done well, highlights some of the best aspects of French cooking. The ones we were served were solid versions; the components had been chopped and mixed thoroughly, leading to a smooth and consistent texture. I didn&#39;t quite get the addition of the muskat wine gelée as it bordered on extraneous, but it was a simple and clean appetizer to begin the meal.<br><br>For the entrée, I decided to go with the Free-Range Chicken. The chicken breast is a generous portion, the skin perfectly seared and gleaming. It&#39;s plated a top a portion of English peas, chopped asparagus stems, and slivers of chorizo. The chicken is a perfect example of how much simple food done well can do. The white meat is perfectly tender and moist, the skin adds just a touch of fattiness, and the protein is well-seasoned and flavorful. The vegetables have taken on the smokiness of the chorizo while cooking, and each crisp chew is complimented perfectly by the chicken.<br><br>The meal was wrapped up with dessert, which, for me, wound up being a Cinnamon Rice Pudding. This was the most beautiful presentation of rice pudding I have yet to see, as it was served in an upright bowl with a myriad of toppings - fresh raspberries, blueberries, pistachio dragées - and is finished off with a scoop of coconut-raspberry sorbet. The rice pudding is surprisingly smooth in consistency, veering on the lighter side for a dessert. The flavors of cinnamon and chocolate are subtly and evenly distributed and are complimented well by the tartness of the fruit and the slight crunch of the dragée. Despite the fact that rice pudding is one of the last desserts I would typically reached for, I was easily able to clean my bowl.<br><br>My only disappointment with the meal would have to lie in the fact that the influence of Portuguese cuisine was not as evident during lunch as I&#39;m sure it is during dinner service. However, for a three-course $25 meal, there is little else I can complain about; the technique, execution, and flavor in all the dishes we tried was spot on. After all, if these are any indication of the quality of their other plates, it&#39;s only a matter of time before you&#39;ll find me here for dinner.",

"reviewcomment":"Well, if you want to dine at Danji, you need to be patient and not claustrophobic.  Last night, I had difficulty with those requirements.  <br><br>The hostess is all over the place and tough to track down.  This wouldn&#39;t be so problematic if in order to speak with her you didn&#39;t have to stand in the tiny space between the wall and the bar to do so.  It&#39;s VERY tight and unpleasant.  We put our name down and were told to come back in 20-30 minutes.  We showed up in 30 and ended up having to wait another 20.  The standing really started to get to me but we were lucky enough to be seated at one of the free standing two tops at the back of the restaurant rather than sitting at a communal table; this helped to ameliorate much of my frustration.  <br><br>The service is good once you sit down.  Our waitress was fine with us staggering our order.  The food was good.  The tofu is great--I definitely could have devoured a few more plates of it. The scallion pancake was tasty, I probably would not go out of my way for it.  The honey wings and fried rice were both hot and tasty.  All in all, the portions are small but the food is comforting and goes great with a cocktail or an ice cold beer.  In some ways it&#39;s nice that they don&#39;t take reservations, as you can plan to eat there last minute but just be sure to have a more comfortable place to wait as you are counting down the minutes until you are seated.",

"reviewcomment":"If you look at my history of YELP reviews,  I rarely award 5 stars to a restaurant. There is usually always one aspect lacking wherein I have to deduct 1 star. However, my experience last night at Ai Fiori was spot on and perhaps I may have just been lucky to have ordered the right dishes - but hey, if they did it right for me I am perfectly happy to award a 5 star rating. <br><br>Here&#39;s my rundown-<br><br>AMBIANCE:<br>Modern, formal decor. I prefer old-school type restaurants and I was surprised that despite the modern art paintings lining the walls, there was still a warm vibe to the place. <br><br>SERVICE:<br>Our waiter was moderately flamboyant (that&#39;s a good thing). He was attentive throughout the night without being overbearing. I loved that he was knowledgeable about every dish I inquired about. I am the type of diner that will ask that question &#34;I can&#39;t decide between xxx and xxx, which do you recommend?&#34; Our waiter (I wish I had asked for his name) was able to give me a detailed description- so detailed I think he should be writing YELP reviews to entice foodies. <br><br>BREAD BASKET:<br>As always, the bread basket at any restaurant can make or break it for me so it gets a category on its own. Ai Fiori served 4 selections of bread - white, onion, multigrain and wheat. They also gave us BOTH butter and olive oil at the table which was perfect because I feel that it is usually one or the other. My boyfriend prefers olive oil whereas I&#39;m a butter fan =) - so we both got what we wanted without having to ask. Also, the waiters are super quick to offer you more bread the moment they see you&#39;ve finished the first - thumbs up for the attentiveness!<br><br>FOOD:<br>Overall, Ai Fiori wins HANDS DOWN for its seafood and pasta dishes. And I&#39;m not the only Yelper to note this. Also, I noticed that the dishes here (aside from the pastas) are all somewhat deconstructed when presented on the plate. I had to make sure I scooped up the different components in every bite to ensure I was getting the full flavor of the dish. <br><br>Amuse Bouche - a shot of apple parsley soup served with a crostini dashed with ricotta cheese. Great warm start for the cold weather. <br><br>My boyfriend and I decided to go with the 4 course pre-fixe for $94. For starters, he ordered the warm octopus and I had the cold lobster salad. Both were excellent choices. <br><br>For our pasta choices, my boyfriend chose the blue crab pasta and I went with the famous Trofie Nero. Both dishes were HEAVENLY. My Trofie Nero was creamy and the toasted breadcrumbs added a lovely crunchy to it. <br><br>Now I&#39;m going to echo another Yelper and say BEST BLUE CRAB PASTA EVERRRR!!! Because it truly was. It tasted like home made spaghetti elevated to a higher &#34;Top Chef&#34; level. It was comforting and had a spicy kick to it. Even at the end of my meal I secretly wanted to slurp up another bowl. <br><br>For mains, my boyfriend had the butter poached lobster and I chose the halibut (my favorite fish! =)). I loved my halibut dish - the fish was cooked perfectly through and crusted on the surface. There may have been several different components to the dish that enhanced the flavor of the fish - but to be honest, I could have eaten the halibut all on its own. <br><br>As for the butter poached lobster, that was just another glory on its own. I remember taking a bite of my boyfriend&#39;s dish and saying &#34;This is what they call BUTTER POACHED LOBSTER&#34;. <br><br>DESSERT: <br>We tried the Panna Cotta and Crema di Cioccolato. The Panna Cotta was heavier in texture than what i&#39;m used to, but still delicious. As for the Crema the Ciocoolato, this dish was just bursting with sweet and salty flavors all over the place. There was a salty foamed puffed on top of the sweet chocolate mousse cake and gelato. <br><br>To end of our meal, we received four petit fours consisting a grapefruit gummy, dark chocolate, mini cake bite and salted caramel chocolate. And although I do not care for biscotti, we received a small take-home gift of biscotti&#39;s with our check. Don&#39;t you just love when restaurants know how to throw in that extra special touch? =) <br><br>Perhaps the only minor downside is that portions are medium to small. I was concerned at first that I would end the meal feeling hungry, but I was surprisingly full. I think my boyfriend could have eaten a slice of pizza after the meal if he had to... but on the whole he was satisfied. <br><br>I would definitely return to try Ai Fiori&#39;s 7-course tasting menu.",

"reviewcomment":"Not bad. It&#39;s a little cramped by the window. I had a tough time getting in my seat. The couple next to us was sort of loud and kept making a fuss with the waiters. One time they had this empty bowl with sauce in it and they yelled at the waiter when he tried to take it away. Crazy. <br><br>Anyways... the service could be better. We had to wait like 3 minutes after we were seated to look at a menu even though I saw one waiter just standing around. I came here with restaurant week with my girlfriend but I&#39;ll come back again.<br><br>We ordered the crispy pig ears. Not a bad dish. Came with small apple slices. The pig ears came out a bit too dry.<br><br>As for our restaurant week menu choices, the pulpo was delicious. Perfectly cooked. Sort of seemed like they boiled it first before grilling them slightly to get that sick Maillard reaction. <br><br>Girlfriend got Tortilla with Romesco and Jamón Serrano, the Jamon was the usual but the tortilla was more like a layered potato cake. It was done very well.<br><br>House Made Chorizo with Asturian Fabada wasnt bad. I love fabada beans so I enjoyed this very much.<br><br>Mushroom Canelones with Sherry Bechamel was very creamy and nice. It didn&#39;t taste too heavily of mushrooms which was great but you still felt that warm earthy taste.<br><br>Spanish Flan with Arrope Syrup was pretty delicious. Some bubbles in the flan but nice and thick and perfectly sweet. <br><br>Chocolate Cake with Espresso Whipped Cream. Nice thick chocolate cake. Wasnt frozen either. <br><br>I would definitely come back for the non-restaurant week menu.",

"reviewcomment":"I came here for dinner with my sister, who was visiting from Chicago, and a mutual friend in the city. Our friend suggested it and it was by far one of the best meals I&#39;ve ever had in Manhattan!<br><br>The restaurant itself is quite beautiful. On the small side, but not cramped, especially by New York standards. The exterior was decorated with foliage and christmas lights when we were there. Inside, there was beautiful art on the walls that really added to the entire experience. It felt clean and sophisticated, maybe even slightly romantic, but not full of itself.<br><br>We ordered: the butter-poached lobster, mountain brook trout, and veal tongue. All of our entrees were absolutely fantastic, and the portions were the perfect size. Just enough to be filling. For dessert, we tried the Salzburger Nockerl and were blown away. It was like eating magical, sweet clouds! None of us had ever had this particular dessert before and we fell in love immediately.",

"reviewcomment":"I would have given this reastaurant 5 stars, but sometimes the servers were too busy serving larger tables (I was alone) and they did not get to me when I needed something.   Other than that, the food was terrrific.  I was staying on Broadway, between 47th and 48th Streets, and this is walking distance from anywhere in Times Square. <br><br>I consider myself an oyster expert, since I live in the Puget Sound area and eat them a lot, mostly raw.  The oysters here were from NY and were exceptionally fresh.  The Pecan Encrusted Snapper (I am pretty sure it was Snapper, don&#39;t remember for sure) was very moist and tasted excellent.  I also ordered a spinach dish, it is a side so it serves more than one person.  It was also excellent.   <br><br>I was greeted when I came in by the Maitre D&#39;, and she was extremely friendly.  She took my Seahawks jacket and hat (I was in NY for Super Bowl XLVIII), gave me a claim chip, and she seated me.  I have her card, I will edit this post with her name for those who want to know, but I loved her attentiveness throughout my stay in her restaurant. It was definitely appreciated, and delightfully unusual based on my many restaurant experiences in &#34;upper level&#34; restaurants such as this one.   <br><br>Most guests were well dressed.  The staff were also well dressed.  The decor was very nice, with linen table cloths. Yet, when I came in dressed in jeans and a collared fleece sweater and Seahawks jacket and hat  (I looked clean and neat), they had no problem seating me.  <br><br> The servers are mostly Latino, and most have a thick accent.  I  am slightly hearing impaired, and they were difficult to understand with the background noise of the restaurant.  This is about my only complaint, but it is minor, besides the issue I stated at the outset of this review about sometimes being overlooked by them during the evening.  For the most part, however, they were extremely attentive.  I did have to bring to their attention that I had asked for a drink refill, and it never came, but they charged me for it anyway.  But they quickly removed the charge.  The server swept my table with a crumber after my meal, and I like that. <br><br>If you are looking for excellent seafood, look no farther than this restaurant if you are staying in, or visiting, Manhattan/Times Square area.",

"reviewcomment":"Came here with my co-workers on a Thursday, it was moderately busy (Not packed but from the outside, it definitely looked like it a was popular restaurant).  <br><br>A couple members of our party were a little late so I headed to the bar with who already arrived and grabbed a couple drinks.  The service was great and the hostess would occasionally check on us to see if the rest of our party arrived. (Not in a nagging sort of fashion, was very nice and told us that she would hold the table till they arrived).  <br><br>Once the rest of our party arrived we were escorted quickly and the waitress was very attentive, and informative when it came to drink and food selection.  I highly recommend the cobia, chili lobster and pork porterhouse.  There were 4 of us and sharing the chili lobster was a great choice as a sharing platter. The veal was alright, needed more truffle (said it had black truffle oil but could barely taste the truffle).  <br><br>For dessert, go with the cheesecake or chocolate chip cookies.  The cookies come with a mason jar with milk.  Very &#34;homey&#34; touch to it. If you are picking any dessert wines I would go with the Takaji, Oremus 2008.  Very sweet and goes well with the cheesecake.  <br><br>Overall a good vibe to the restaurant and would definitely go again.",

"reviewcomment":"Hakkasan NYC flawlessly transcends Asian Cuisine to the westside.<br><br>Earlier today I spent my time celebrating my 22nd birthday with parents and my sis for brunch by causally ordering a round of drinks. My sis order the Blood &amp; Sand that consisted of smoked scotch and cherry brandy and my mom tried Hakkasan&#39;s very own signature-drink, the Hakka. This was the perfect opportunity to show off some sophistication so I ordered the obvious cliché by ordering a Manhattan. The service was impeccable Liggity-split. We ordered a bout of food. Starting off with the salt &amp; pepper squids, the dumplings, then next the crispy duck salad. After that I received a birthday treat with my name drizzled on the plate wishing me a happy one. It was probably my favorite birthday serenade I secretly wanted to happen (embracing grin not included. :). Not to mention the architecture teleports you to a palace of hospitality, toasty hand towels and all. A hidden gem at its finest! I found my new birthday ritual I&#39;ll always love. Thanks Hakkasan!",

"reviewcomment":"Very romantic and classy. I can see why this place has a Michelin star. <br><br>As soon as you walk in, everyone is very attentive. The hostess took my coat right away and one of her colleagues showed me to the bar while I waited for the rest of my party to arrive. The waiter addressed my dining companion by name [I guess he was notified via the reservation? Kudos to the restaurant!] <br><br>Foie Gras [$24]: I shared this with my dinner mate even though I&#39;m really opposed to sharing. The foie was so silky smooth and creamy. The radicchio, being crunchy, was a nice texture contrast. The saba was acidic so it cut through the fat nicely. I would have liked to eat this dish on my own. <br><br>Dentice [$32]; The red snapper was served skin on and it was incredible. The meat was flakey and well seasoned and the crispy skin just added to the amazeballs. The lamb sausage on the side was fantastic, caught me off guard by how spicy it was. The brussels sprouts and celery just rounded out the dish. It&#39;s definitely better to eat all the components of this dish together than separate. <br><br>Bombolini [$11] Ahhhhh. Four Tuscan doughnuts covered in sugar and filled with a type of dulce de leche cream. A-maz-ing. Again, another shared dish, but this definitely had to be shared unless I wanted diabetes. The bittersweet chocolate was a bit of an overkill but still incredible. <br><br>Interestingly enough, when I asked where the restroom was, I was physically walked there. Also, my gloves were placed in a paper bag so they wouldn&#39;t get lost in the coat check room. <br><br>A little stuffy and formal, but its the small details that makes this place great.",

"reviewcomment":"Aureole is one of the quiet classics; the Charlie Palmer flagship restaurant situated in the Bank of America Tower has been serving up refined and elegant plates for a quarter of a century. Their consistency has ensured them a Michelin star for the past string of years, not a small accomplishment given the ever-changing dining scene in NYC. The best opportunity I had to visit was on a Friday in between holidays; a nearly-empty office coupled with one of the brightest winter days was the perfect setting for a leisurely lunch.<br><br>Located only a few blocks from Times Square, the entrance to Aureole is almost impossible to miss. The floor-to-window ceilings allow passers-by to peer inside and if the first impression is not enough of an impact, a quick glance at the menu prices would immediately throw off any unsuspecting tourist. The best deal is for the weekday lunch, however, where a three course prix-fixe is only $36. Upon entering, I was immediately greeted by the smiling hostess and led over to our table in the dining room. The interior in Aureole is very modern, chic, and very much screams &#34;corporate&#34;; indeed, most of the diners inside looked to be employees who work from within the very same tower.<br><br>After we had taken a few bites of the complimentary bread, we began our meal with the Cod Brandade, an emulsion of cod and cauliflower that has a wonderfully creamy and fluffy texture that I can best liken to mashed potatoes. Ours was lightly drizzled with saffron vinaigrette, which added a lightly acidic aftertaste to each bite, and topped with a handful of croutons, which gave each forkful a hearty crunch to balance out the texture. Despite not being a big seafood fan, I can honestly say that I enjoyed this dish. The cod wasn&#39;t overwhelmingly fishy and the portion size was just right for an appetizer.<br><br>Our plates were quickly cleared and our entrees followed. Once again, we both ordered the same dish: Stout Braised Beef Brisket. It was gorgeously presented: a sizable portion of beef brisket was plated next to a colorful pile of root vegetables. The vegetables were satisfactory; they were indeed fresh, with a good crunch, and plenty of flavor. The star of the meal was clearly the brisket, however. Fall-off-the-fork tender, with plenty of both lean and fatty pockets of meat, it had clearly been braised for many hours. I wasn&#39;t amazed by the flavor, however, as it was fairly one-dimensional; the sauce need some other taste besides &#34;salty&#34;.<br><br>And, of course, dessert. Two options were available to us that day, so we ordered one of each to share. The cheesecake was a bit of a disappointment; it was too dense and seemingly hastily paired with drops of cherry-flavored syrup. The Frozen Lemon Mousse, on the other hand, was clearly the winner. Intricately plated, the mousse was surrounded by an orange tuile. I also loved the additional pieces of lightly charred grapefruit, orange, and nectarine. The citrus flavors were matched perfectly and the overall presentation made it an enjoyable dessert to share.<br><br>As a whole, I satisfied with my meal at Aureole. Though there are a few small nuances that could use a little alteration (at least, in my own personal opinion), the overall experience is sure to please any diner.",

"reviewcomment":"Insieme splits its menu between traditional Italian fare and modern takes on Italian, so you can stick to one side or go back and forth between the two.<br><br>We both had the tasting menu. The amuse-bouche was a shot glass of strawberry-tomato soup: a perfect, summery, refreshing concoction with a bit of a spicy kick like a gazpacho, but still incorporating great sweetness and tang from the strawberries. For a starter, we had the spring onion soup with caviar: subtle flavor from the spring onion that could have become overpowering. Next up was a delicious, light tuna dish and then onto smoked mackerel and scallop with beetroot jam: my hands-down favorite of the evening. Yes, I am biased towards beets, but it was a delicious pairing. 4-cheese stuffed pasta with a vegetable pesto, zucchini and beets was quite good, but the least remarkable dish of the evening. We finished it off with a lovely chocolatey dessert and some delicious dessert wine. <br><br>Service was excellent. They were attentive without being invasive. My espresso came up when I had ducked off to the restroom and they were dearly apologetic, offering to make me a fresh one because it had come out perhaps 30 seconds before I returned. :) They were helpful with our wine selections and made and adjustment to the tasting menu for me to accommodate my pescetarian diet.",

"reviewcomment":"The semi-dark hallway leading to the reception was not only the introduction to an airy two spacious rooms overlooking Columbus Circle, but also was the beginning to a delightful interaction with a very welcoming, friendly and informative staff.<br><br>The extra virgin olive oil mixed with a hint of chili flakes, freshly ground black pepper and herbs was the invite into a promising prix-fixe three-course lunch menu, especially after the first bite of dipped fluffy focaccia bread was enjoyed.  The taste of the delicious oil carried over to the Crescione; a hearty watercress and frisee salad that was topped with thinly sliced pears.  Although the long, chunky cut of the watercress, together with its dripping the excess of dressing that remained in the bottom of the deep oval plate, took away a bit of the crisp greens&#39; charm, the sprinkled pantaleo goat cheese on the top of the crisp salad was nothing but a brilliant addition.<br><br>The arrival of the secondi course declared out loud the sleek modern look the interior carried was to be vividly witnessed throughout the presentation of the main course.  A grilled Dorade fish it was.  The freshness of the buttery fish, along with its crispy skin, started to isolate me from yet a very busy restaurant.  It was one of the two stars on the stage.  The bed of sautéed chickpea and tomatoes, mixed with kale chips and oil, announced the cuisine had not yet departed from its traditional Italian roots.  The full essence of the plate was captured, delightfully.  <br><br>As the spectacle was about to let its curtain down, the second of the two stars arrived: the Tiramisu.  The scene had a glossy chocolate doom covering a heavenly cream of espresso and mascarpone on a thin layer of almost-dry sponge cake, neighbored with an almond gelato placed on a dust of chocolate crumbs.  The contemporary presentation was another metaphor of not judging the book from its cover as the taste of Italy&#39;s traditional dessert--which I could not have enough of--proofed its originality despite its deceiving, yet beautiful, look.  Absolutely whimsical.  Enough Said!<br><br>(This review took place in a lunch visit on February 17th, 2014).",

"reviewcomment":"Despite the Michelin star, it&#39;s still a treasure hunt to find good dishes (but there&#39;s treasure out there!)<br><br>Been here a few times for lunch already, and can&#39;t say I&#39;ve been disappointed. The flavors and spice of the dishes are on point. The most difficult part of the experience is choosing the right dishes!<br><br>When looking at the lunch specials menu, don&#39;t be led astray with Americanized choices (sesame chicken, beef with broccoli, etc). If you&#39;re feeling adventurous, ask for the full menu and your eyes will be opened. Some of my favorites include mapo tofu, fish and tofu in chili oil, and double cooked pork.<br><br>Another plus, lunch is less than $10, you get a soup with your entree, and it&#39;s lightning fast! If you&#39;re looking for some spice in your life, hop on over, sip your tea, and nom away!",

"reviewcomment":"I was excited to finally try the new Sriracha Melt because I&#39;m a gigantic fan of Sriracha. I have one bottle in the fridge and two reserve bottles tucked away in my kitchen at all times. <br>This place is usually very quick and gives you generous amounts of toppings. But today when I ate my &#34;Sriracha&#34; melt I tasted something else. The taste of BETRAYAL!!! The sauce was not Sriracha at all!!! It was Buffalo sauce!!! NOOOOO!!!<br>I was eating a foot long of LIES!!!!! They lost a star from this normal customer because of this bait and switch.",

"reviewcomment":"Fun little place on Greenwich St., near where I used to work. We used to drop by their all the time for their fantastic express lunch, which was an entree (salmon, tuna, steak salad, pizza, sandwich or burger) and a glass of pretty decent, if not somewhat watery, sangria - all for like $12 or something like that. My girlfriend despises the tuna, so I guess I&#39;d have to shy away from recommending that, but otherwise the menu is pretty decent for the price. Don&#39;t expect a Michelin quality meal, but you can&#39;t really go wrong for some good food and a drink in the middle of your workday.",
