The pastas are made fresh in house and ingredients are from fresh produce. <br><br>My wife and I had our honeymoon stop in Venice and it was the best choice we made to eat here. We had 5 pastas over 2 meals and all of them were satisfying. <br><br>I would highly recommend anyone going to Venice to try this place. It might be a little hard to find at first, but don&#39;t stop. Because once you find it and eat there, you&#39;ll realize it was all worth it.",

The mascarpone and salmon roe was particularly memorable, the anchovies were delicious.<br>I think if you are buying spirits, you may be better off in a supermarket. I am not sure how good the price was on the bottle of wine I bought, but they did put it in bubble wrap for travelling, handy. <br>As with many bacari, there is nowhere to sit, and the toilet is private. <br>You could, as previously suggested, get a bottle and perch on the canal outside.",

"reviewcomment":"Easily the best restaurant I went to in my 5 day stay in Venice. Although they do not take reservations, this place fills up quickly after 7pm. From the outside, it&#39;s dark and not all that obvious or easy to find. But not far from the Rialto Bridge on the San Polo side of the Grand Canal. I arrived here at 7pm after a full day of sightseeing and I as exhausted as I was, felt very lucky finding this great establishment.<br><br>After the first dish, a Venetian appetizer called &#34;Sardine in Saor&#34; (fried, pickled sardines), I asked the waiters if they were in fact really angels from heaven. I think I even asked myself, &#34;How can I not be in heaven? The food tastes too good.&#34;<br><br>When I told the waiter how good the Sardines Saor was, he honestly replied, &#34;I know.&#34; The staff here come off as reserved but you can tell that they are, in their unique manner, very friendly, sincere, on top of things caring for their customers as they serve very fresh, high quality dishes.  What I&#39;ve learned about cuisine in Italy, in  the best places to eat, the staff always come off as cold and even condescending...but, once you have one bite of what they serve, you realize that they hide their love and greatness in the culinary genius of what they serve you.<br><br>The service was always there when I needed it without being fake. It seemed as if they read my minds whenever I needed something without being invasive. The experience here was perfect in all senses: the taste, the service, the atmosphere (a lively bright atmosphere), the quality. <br><br>Favorite Dish: Without a doubt, the fish soup (zuppa di pesce) was so good, I was nearly in tears. I cannot describe the flavors. I&#39;ll try. It&#39;s a perfectly salted fish broth with onion base, light pepper, possibly an herb similar to tarragon (or even balsamic vinegar) to give the broth a lightly sweet flavoring to it; probably some olive oil in it too. The soup has clams, fresh fish, and get this: squid eggs. Those squid eggs were amazing delicious, with a soft jelly like texture that was amazing!<br><br>To get there, you have to avoid showy restaurants with very aggressive workers attempting to lure your in to outdoor restaurants with amazing views of the canal.  Avoid them as they are tourist traps.  There will be no one at this restaurant trying to lure you in.  Why?  Because they are busy making the best quality food in all of Venice and taking care of their customers who were smart enough to realize the brilliance of what they offer.",

"reviewcomment":"This was definitely our favorite Venice restaurant!<br><br>We were in Venice last week for a mini vacation, and we asked our concierge to make reservations at La Bitta.  Wow... it was amazing.  We were so impressed that we ended our first dinner with making reservations for a second night during our stay.  They have two seatings per night -- 7:00 and 9:00.  The 9:00 seating is perfect for people who want to linger, and I&#39;d definitely suggest reservations.  Our first visit was a weeknight, and the 7:00 seating had availability, but 9:00 was packed.  On Saturday, both seatings were totally full.<br><br>I have shellfish allergies, so Venice food can be a challenge for me.  La Bitta proudly states &#34;No Fish&#34; on their business cards -- it&#39;s a variety of meat dishes.  Our personal favorites were the beef carpaccio, the soup of the night, a lasagna special, beef filet wrapped in bacon and Ventian-style liver and onions.  Note that the menu changes nightly. <br><br>For Venice, the prices are really good -- we had a bottle of wine and each had two courses, dessert and coffee for approximately 120 Euros.  We could have gotten away cheaper, but we were splurging a bit.  They do not accept credit cards, so ensure that you have cash on you.<br><br>The woman who served us (and everyone else in the very small restaurant) was friendly, helpful, and made excellent wine recommendations based on the food we chose. <br><br>We are looking forward to going back!",

The staff was EXCELLENT when it came to checking on my husband and I, the food was great....and the major plus? The front of the restaurant is floor to ceiling window. Why is that cool? Well, right in front of the Hard Rock is a pick up point for the gondolas ....SOOO many gorgeously painted gondolas!  To wrap this up, the Hard Rock in Venice is awesome and you should check it out if you happen to be in the area :)",

And oh boy, was he right !<br>The setting, with dim lighting, wooden furniture, the mezzainine, and the central fireplace, were fantastic !<br>The service itself is very nice and attentionate, without being overwhelmingly present.<br><br>The food was amazing, too: I had the Gnocchi al ragu d&#39;anatra, which was very tasty, yet not too heavy. My colleague on the other hand had some spaghetti alle vongole, which was really well cooked, very tasty, and still very much al dente !!!<br><br>The first courses were so large, that we could barely taste those pizzas we had ordered as mains (remember, this is Italy...:o). <br>Still, we took them away and had them the next day. They were delicious as well (Cappricciosa and Tris di Funghi...).<br><br>I&#39;m looking forward to go back to Mestre, be it only for the food in La Corte !!!<br><br>Enjoy !!!",

They didn&#39;t ask if we wanted bread, just dropped it off very quickly. The waiter got my order wrong. I ordered a pizza but got a calzone. I was actually happy about the mistake, and he brought me extra marinara when I asked for no extra charge. The calzone was good, but just too big for me. The ricotta became overwhelming. My boyfriend ordered balsamic chicken and veggies. The chicken was a little bland, needed salt. The veggies were spectacular though. Overall it was good. Service was pretty fast.",

Yes, in some people&#39;s eyes I would have made a few wrong turns, but to me I was exploring without a map and the using the stars on a foggy night to guide my way. Walking into the world famous (maybe now notorious) Harry&#39;s, I was welcomed with a warm glow of the people and the lighting of the bar.  Walking in was like walking in the room with warm glow that James Cameron used when he did the movie the Titanic, except the fashion was not circa the time period and Harry&#39;s would have been 1930-40, resembling the brink of a depression. But I would say it was a wonderful experience. <br><br>The notorious part of Harry&#39;s would be their prices. Just shy of 20€ for the basics and it goes up from there. Going to Harry&#39;s isn&#39;t about drinking on a budget it about a level of service and experiencing a piece of history.  A place where Hemingway was once know to hangout in the Concordia room.  Other such as Charlie Chaplin and Orson Wells would also frequent. It is for some, a once in a lifetime experience so order a Bellini and drink it in.",

"reviewcomment":"First evening in Venice and our hotel had told us this is the restaurant we need to have dinner at.  It is not easy to find if your not familiar with Venice but one of the hotel staff actually walked us over to it from our hotel.  We stayed at AD Place and it was a short walk.  We did not have reservations and when we arrived Tiberio spoke with the manager George and he said &#34;let me offer you a glass of Prosecco if you don&#39;t mind waiting ten minutes for a table&#34;.<br><br>My husband said we will walk around no problem and come back.  George was so funny he spoke to my husband in Italian saying please come back.  He was so worried we would not come back.  We did come back and George had a server meet us at the door with a glass each of Prosecco, very nice touch.  The dining area had maybe twenty tables, nice decor.  I was so excited to be dining in a trattoria in Venice with beautiful Venetian decor and an amazing wine list was presented to me.<br><br>After analyzing the huge wine list I chose a Brunello di Motalcino it was 85 euros.  George poured it and I was very pleased with my choice.  He then spoke to my husband in Italian, I had NO idea what I was in for.  Next thing you know plates of food started to come out.  They put the spicy penne dish in front of me and a huge plate of fresh seafood in front of my husband. (see picture).  The spicy penne is a must, it was so flavorful and of course the penne is made fresh on premise.  I kept eating and eating it was so good. Also, very important I did request a side of extra sauce and wow loved it.  Not sweet which I dislike.  I still lust for their sauce.<br><br>I finally had to put down my fork because in Italy you have a gazillion courses of food.  George had told us we needed to try what they are known for a fish that is cooked in rock salt.  I apologize I think it was called Branzino?  Next thing you know George comes out with a table and this huge fish covered in rock salt. Oh geez, then the fun began.  It was quite a show, everyone in the restaurant was starring at George banging the salt off the fish.  Then he carefully de-boned it and put it on two plates.  It took him around eight minutes and after wards the entire restaurant started to clap. What a feast.<br><br>The fish was light and it melted in your mouth like butter .I was in lust eating every bite. One of the best tasting fish I have ever had. Now keep in mind our dinner lasted around three hours. Were in Venice, no rush, sit back and enjoy the excellent local food.  As we were enjoying our evening immensely, George came over to check on us and he spoke with a table seated behind me and what do ya know it was the owner and his wife and friends of our boutique hotel.  He was very thankful we were staying at his hotel and asked if we were happy.  What a perfect ending to the evening.<br><br>We were brought out an after dinner drink of grappa, nice touch. Seriously I needed to walk ten miles for all the food we consumed.  It was so worth it.<br>We had an amazing evening here and was so very thankful they told us about this place.  I could not even imagine a more perfect evening with such incredible food, wine and top notch service.<br><br>This is THE place to go in Venice, trust me you will not regret it and the prices are reasonable.  <br><br>GRAZIE, TI AMO, we will visit again.",

"reviewcomment":"This wine bar was recommended to us by a guy at the hotel and I was delighted he did. It is a bit tricky to find and you follow the signs and all of a sudden you are at a dead end and so on. Most people would turn back but the faithful keep going and I am glad we persisted and found the place. <br><br>The photos I have here will give you a good sense of the place. Three tables inside and four outside. We were two of six people there last night for a glass of wine and some nibbles before dinner (it is the Italian thing to do). <br><br>The selection of wine is amazing and the guy who owns the shop has great knowledge of his wines. His English is also ok and i just asked him to pick us the wines and he did an excellent job of that :-) We had a Rose and a GSM which were both excellent. They also have a ton of aperitif and champagnes and prosecco and he does make you a mixed drink if you don&#39;t like wine. Everything is in Italian so if you don&#39;t know much then I would tell the guy your taste and he would pick something for you. You also order at the counter as there is no table service.<br><br>We had a small cold meat and cheese plate which had the most amazing &#34;Porketta&#34; which is a roast ham and he has a good variety of cheese as well. Look for the cheese that is soaked in truffle oil ;-)) He also has Pata Negra and Genovese Ham plus some other meats. <br><br>Like most things in Venice it&#39;s not cheap but if you want to have a charming evening sipping wine and nibbling on cheese this is an excellent choice. Very few places I have ever been to have the charm and quality of this place. <br><br>Tip: we watched quite a lot of people come around, peek and turn back and leave. I think people were expecting a packed place or a place that serves dinner and this has neither and that&#39;s the charm of this wonderful wine bar where the locals also purchase wine to take home :-))",

My first visit was back in 1998 with my husband. <br><br>This most recent visit (October 2013) was with my husband and two friends. <br><br>Reservations are a must (which I had my hotel call to make our reservations) and when we arrived at 7:30pm, the place was full and our table had a &#39;reservations&#39; sign on it.<br><br>For an appetizer, we shared a large plate of Prosciutto crudo abbinato allo Stracchino e Carasauallo (Parma ham with soft fresh cheese on side and Special Bread). The special bread was just one piece, not enough to really share but the proscuitto was excellent. <br><br>I ordered one of the dinner specials, Mezzelune ai Porcini ed Olio Tartufato (ravioli with wild mushrooms and truffle oi)l. Oh my!!! Fabulous! Tony had the Ossobuco alla cacciatora (veal shank with mushrooms and polenta). Also excellent.<br><br>I didn&#39;t jot down what our friends ate but they liked their meal. We shared two liters of wine (9 euros each) and later I had a large glass of vin santo, or something similar to that. <br><br>Dinner for four for one appetizer, four entrees, wine, etc., came to 101 euros.<br><br>Service by Elton was great! He was quite the flirt too and very friendly. <br><br>The next time I&#39;m in Venice I&#39;ll return here.",

"reviewcomment":"We had one of our most enjoyable meals during our stay in Venice at the very lovely and welcoming L&#39;Anice Stellato. It&#39;s situated right by a quite canal with a pretty dining room and three tables out front. Despite being in a part of town that most tourists don&#39;t explore it&#39;s very popular so booking in advance will avoid disappointment. However, if you have been turned away worry not as Osteria Ai 40 Ladroni is only a couple of doors away and their food is also very reasonable and pretty tasty.<br>The menu here is well put together and has fewer dishes than most restaurants in Venice (a good sign in my opinion) but there is still plenty to make the mouth water. Choosing was proving difficult so we ordered some local wine while we tried to make our minds up  a great bottle of Monteforche which was dry but aromatic with a long finish. Great value for Venice at under 19EUR.<br>After a chat with our very friendly waitress who spoke excellent English we decided on a plate of 6 fish cicchetti to start with and left the choice to her  a very sensible decision as they were all excellent. These were not the usual cicchetti to found in the bars throughout Venice  a little more refined and with more complex flavourings. Stand outs were the classic sweet and sour sardines, the swordfish tandoori and the tuna. A great way to start a long lazy lunch.<br>For the main course I had a oven baked turbot which came with small roasted potatoes and sweet baby tomatoes. Expertly cooked with delicate flavours this was a really lovely plate of food. B had the bucatini con amatriciana with smoked tuna and marlin and declared herself to be well pleased with her pasta.<br>A short break was needed as we were keen to try a dessert. Sitting by the canal is very peaceful and it was a real pleasure to while away half an hour chatting and watching the locals on the water  no tourist Gondola tourist trips in this neck of the woods.<br>Having had a bit of a breather we decided to share the trio of zabaglione gelato which is a bit of a house speciality. Yet another good choice and in the heat of the afternoon it slipped down a treat.<br>This was a very fine meal and by Venitian standards something of a bargain. This is a restaurant I&#39;m already looking forward to eating in again when I next have the pleasure of a trip to Venice.",

"reviewcomment":"Definitely my favourite spot in all of Venice! I discovered Osteria da Baco several years ago on a cold, winter&#39;s day. As I was loafing around outside of the shops my wife and friends were exploring, I noticed a number of gonoliers disappear into Osteria da Baco for a quick coffee or a glass of wine. Well, if it&#39;s good enough for gondoliers, it&#39;s good enough for me. The atmosphere was brilliant and the coffee and wine were extremely reasonable. Franco, the owner, and his family were so friendly and made me most welcome. Since then, I have been back to Venice many, many times, summer and winter, often with friends. My last visit was October 2010. I always spend some time at Osteria da Baco, enjoying a carafe of local wine and tasing some of their stupendous, freshly made sandwiches and foccacia. A great, fresh lunch with a glass of wine in Venice for around 6 Euro! If you are anywhere near San Zaccharia, make the effort to walk up Calle della Rasse and visit this place. You will not be disappointed.<br><br> Alan Couser, Northern Ireland",

Intensely seasoned wrapped in panchetta and cooked until the centre had only just stopped bleeding but was still translucent - brave and difficult to get right but perfect for wild boar.<br><br> On the downside a reservation is pretty much essential . . . it doesn&#39;t matter how beautiful or well conncected you are - no reservation - join the queue for a table!",

"reviewcomment":"Yet another incredible seafood restaurant, one of my top three in Venice. <br><br>The restaurant is buried at the eastern end of Venice near the Arsenale. It is a very cute though formally rustic place. The chef is Venetian and his wife is Texan which makes things much more fun. I am always looking to push the envelope with food and this restaurant satisfied that urge while at the same time providing excellent &#34;normal&#34; food for my wife and son. <br><br>As I mentioned in my review of Ristorante Osteria DA Fiore, I have never had fish so fresh as at these restaurants. What made Al Cove so special was how the chef handled the fish. I had a raw appetizer assortment which included raw soft shell craw-fish, raw squid sliced into thin ribbons resembling pasta, and a few other truly interesting species of seafood I had not experienced before. All were delicious. My main course was a sort of Venetian reinterpretation of Pasta con Le Sade, the best I have had. My wife and son were not only impressed but truly satisfied with their meal.<br><br>Since my wife wants to live in Venice she had a great time talking with the wife of the chef about raising kids there, etc.",

"reviewcomment":"Surprisingly, perhaps, Venice isn&#39;t renowned as the easiest place in Italy to find great tasting food. If that&#39;s what you&#39;re after rather than tourist-geared fare, you need look no further...<br><br> This family-run restaurant is so friendly and welcoming, from the moment you walk in, no matter how busy (and it is extremely popular with the locals and visitors alike).<br><br> If you want a quick snack and a drink, simply stand at the bar and point and smile at whatever takes your fancy (perhaps even the waiter - just joking...) They will appreciate your effort and try to understand, however basic your Italian conversation.<br><br> The food is true to its origins and very regional. Prosecco is typically the bar drink (ombra) of choice to accompany your snacks (cicchetti). The salt cod is fabulous. If you&#39;re unsure of what else to try they will offer suggestions and tastes.<br><br> For something more substantial, don&#39;t hesitate to go for the Pasta e Fagioli (pasta and bean soup). This regional northern Italian fare is thick, warming, heartily delicious and ideal if you are exploring Venice out-of-season in the cold winter months. Even if you&#39;re pretty hungry, you&#39;ll probably be satisfied with that and the good local bread, perhaps followed by a light dessert. Don&#39;t miss the local speciality of sgroppino (lemon sorbet, vodka and prosecco) - squisito!",

We had to share a table with another couple, but so did everyone else in the restaurant. Straight away the owner said &#34;I know what you want, two glasses of white wine and two of our meatballs.&#34; Why, yes, that&#39;s EXACTLY what we wanted! And boy are those meatballs gooood. In fact, they alone should earn this place 5 stars. Deepfried, salty and mouthwatering, I deeply regret not ordering more (or not returning in our short time in Venice). My boyfriend and I agreed that they were definitely our favourite individual item of food in our whole Italian trip.<br><br>Mains wise I opted for spaghetti alle vongole, which was good, and I&#39;ve now forgotten what my boyfriend had. Needless to say we were both satisified. The price was reasonable for Venice, and the service was quick to begin with but slowed a little. But, it was busy and it was never bad.<br><br>If you&#39;re ever in Venice is worth searching this place out, if only for the meatballs. If you don&#39;t fancy a full meal just pop by for an ombra of wine and one of those delicious, delicious meatballs.",

Price is a little steep, sure, but walking in rain and wind in the middle of March will make one want to take shelter and comfort instead of saving two dollars on a glass of wine. <br><br>We dined with 4 total. Friendly server, speaking some english. Very busy place though, gets crowded for dinner.<br><br>Calzones are HUGE- downside... once you bite into the calzone, the air deflates the hope of a dish that was stuffed 4 inches high with fillings. Still very well baked, flaky crust. My girlfriend had an egg/ham/rocket/mozzarella one, and the egg was a nice flavor touch to the salty ham. <br><br>Pizzas were flavorful, large, and heavily topped with yummy creations, including a pizza that they forewarn you is extra spicy, which to me wasn&#39;t so bad. <br><br>Had the panna cotta with caramel for dessert, and that was wonderful... the caramel was more of a dulce de leche combination with the dish, but great.<br><br>Our friends had the berry crisp, which had an interesting and well-added crunch from ground up almonds, I believe, on the crust, which was amazing.<br><br>Worth finding amidst the mazes of Venice.",

"reviewcomment":"Wow.<br><br> This Venetian restaurant has local and Tuscan specialities. Our hotel advised us to book a table as it&#39;s popular and has seating for only about 40.<br><br> The meal we had at Cucina da Mario (<a href='/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.qype.co.uk%2Fplace%2F133809-Cucina-da-Mario-Venice&amp;s=96cabbac858f227fa0192329ed8b5a7ac0be6d1566da15adfec9dde116278b71' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>qype.co.uk/place/133809-…</a>) was like your Italian grandmother might make for you. In contrast, the meal here was the stereotypical image I had of what eating in an Italian restaurant would be like: informal, great attention from waiters, five courses (plus dolci!) of incredibly fresh, simple, delicious food, and more wine than I could hope to choose from.<br><br> The meal was delicious and filling enough that I wrote it all down. I had the meat menu, my missus had the fish menu:<br><br> 1st (me; wife) - assorted meats; raw fish selection with pomegranate<br>2nd - bruschetta; flour polenta with shrimp<br>3rd - carrot, potato and cheese soup; fish soup<br>4th - pasta carbonara; spinach and mushroom sphagetti<br>5th - lamb with beans and potato; swordfish with soufflé<br>dolci - chocolate tart; chocolate tart<br><br> I don&#39;t recall now what we paid, but I remember I&#39;ve never been more full or satisfied in my life. Top dining experience.<br><br> A very friendly atmosphere, nice buzz about the place. They&#39;ve got a small outdoor dining area, but it was streaming rain the night I was there.",

"reviewcomment":"We have visited Venice several times and love the entire city and its many fine restaurants.  (Yes there are.)  This year, we were married and wanted to spend the holidays in our favorite city.  For New Years, we decided to do something special and chose Ristorante Quadri.  <br><br>For New Years&#39; Eve, there was a fixed menu, ten courses +, with truly amazing wine pairings with the various courses (Franciacorta brut;  Champagne Perrier Jouet; Baron de &#34;L&#34;; Solaia  2001 Antinori; Tokaij 5  Dizsnoko; Dom Perignon 2004 Moet &amp; Chandon.) We were requested to dress formally, so I dressed in my tuxedo.  There was only one sitting--all night.  When we arrived, the Piazza San Marco was beginning to fill with revelers.  The city had set up a bandstand at the opposite end of the Piazza from the Basillica.  The bands were just getting started when we arrived.  The scene was tumultuous and the gathering crowds were ready to celebrate a wild night.  <br><br>This beautiful, historic restaurant is on the second floor above Cafe Quadri and has tall windows with extensive views of the Piazza.  The restaurant is two separate rooms with extraordinarily high ceilings and well-spaced tables.   The rooms are decorated in an authentic Venetian style: warm, red upholstered walls and Murano glass chandeliers.  It is dark, elegant and intimately romantic.  The atmosphere was Old World and intensely Venetian.  <br><br>We kept the menu, which does not adequately describe how fantastic and beautiful the various courses were, but this is what we had:   <br>Dentex carpaccio with curry sauce, pomegranate reduction, and mixed greens; Scampi crudo with hot lentil sauce; Fried red shrimp and scallops with sunflower seed puree and spicy sauce; Smoked mezzi paccheri with spider crab, lobster, caviar, and herb sauce; Pumpkin and parsley consumme; Hare risotto with foie gras sauce; Beef cheek braised in Amarone with polenta dumplings; upside-down cappuccino, gold bigne with zabajone, extra virgin olive oil panettone, carmelized fruit, and nougat. And cafe. (I&#39;m not sure anyone was having the cafe, since they were pouring the Dom at the time, and the Fireworks show out in the lagoon was welcoming the new year and was pleasantly visible from the restaurant windows.<br><br>At the end of the dinner, the chef and staff emerged from the kitchen in their tall, white hats and were given a standing ovation by the customers.  A magical night all around.",

On top of everything we got into Venice late at night and we asked Renatto for directions. He felt we would have difficulty finding it so he boated us right to the hotels front door.

And if you go for dinner I suggest you make a reservation.",

"reviewcomment":"First, a little tidbit of helpful information on Italian dining establishments:  A ristorante is more of a formal restaurant for lunch or dinner where entrees must be ordered by the patrons.  If you are looking for a more casual environment or just a light meal or some appetizers with a glass of wine you should dine at a trattoria, osteria, or enoteca instead.  Most dining establishments are clearly labeled ristorante, trattoria, osteria, or enoteca.<br><br>Le Bistrot de Venise is a ristorante and enoteca, the two areas being pretty clearly delineated.  Being not especially hungry at the time, opted to dine in the elegant enoteca area.  Ordered a bottle of the house red wine and salumi plates which consisted of salami, prosciutto, three different kinds of cheeses, walnuts and honey and was also accompanied by a bread basket filled with bread, focaccia, and bread sticks.  The cured meats and cheeses were excellent, some of the best salami and prosciutto I&#39;ve had in recent memory.  All paired with the wine, it was a nice slice of la dolce vita.  Service was exceptional and on par with top fine dining establishments in the U.S.<br><br>Great location and easy to find from Piazza San Marco, elegant atmosphere, and excellent service and food, I only hope that I will be able to return to Venice again soon so that I can spend more time here and dine properly at the ristorante.<br><br>Le Bistrot de Venise also comes recommended by the Michelin Guide.",

"reviewcomment":"This small and friendly restaurant is tucked away on a quiet canal behind the Campo Santo Maria Formosa. The menu is small with 3-4 pasta dishes and 4-5 main course offerings. However, they manage to pack a lot of variety into the choices. The restaurant is equally compact with only 16 seats. Fish is the specialty here and everything we tried with any connection to the sea was great.<br><br>We started with a fish antipasti packed with Venetian favorites like sardine in saor and cod with milk, and octopus. The seafood was fresh and the portion generous. Our primo was a pasta pesto with swordfish. The swordfish was smoked to perfection. The pesto was more subtly flavored than one finds elsewhere, although the basil and garlic did come through. The pasta was strozzapreti, which soaked up the sauce nicely so the dish did not have to drown in it to bring out the pesto flavor.<br><br>Our main course was a baked chicken breast with ham. While the cured ham was delicious, there was not much to the chicken. Plenty of butter and garlic in the sauce, but overall an unexciting dish.<br><br>The restaurant itself is a nice spot. The atmosphere is very casual and has a fun sense of humor. We were warmly welcomed and received very good service. A few locals came through for cicchetti while we were there. The 1 Euro service charge is less than most other Venetian restaurants. Note that they do not accept credit cards.<br><br>We had a nice evening and were glad we went.",

"reviewcomment":"The best thing I ate in Venice was a crostini at this little chicchetti bar.  We went &#39;bar hopping&#39; in this area for lunch and not only was it fun, but a fairly cheap way to try a variety of bites and I highly recommend the experience.  This was the best place though, very cozy inside and you can essentially point out what you want to eat, almost like a bakery.  My favorite was one with a white fish paste that was indescribably good.  So good that hubby let me get another one, though we were supposed to be trying a bunch of different things.  And all of the other crostini we got were great.  They were also making some special salads/small dishes upon requests of what I assume were regular patrons.  You stand and savor, there are a few places to set food down and a couple tables outside.<br><br>Now for the bar part.  Great wines at probably the cheapest prices we found in Venice or most of Italy.  So great that we went back for a predinner drink.  I don&#39;t do the same place twice when I&#39;m on a trip, but I couldn&#39;t resist.  And it&#39;s funny because they recognized us too :)<br><br>I can&#39;t believe this wasn&#39;t on Yelp - I tried to search but no success.  It&#39;s #2 on TripAdvisor though, and for very good reason.  Definitely check this place out!",

The rooms are decorated in the most opulent eighteenth century style, with brocade wall coverings and murano glass chandeliers, with ultra modern marble bathrooms, and yet it&#39;s very reasonably priced. The location can be a bit difficult to find when you first arrive in Venice, but makes up for this by the fact that it&#39;s set back from the main tourist trail yet still within a ten minute&#39;s walk from the Rialto bridge. Staff are very friendly and the breakfast is excellent. One of the rooms actually has its own private roof terrace, but others also have balconies and its wonderful to wake up in the morning and look out over pretty window boxes onto a real Venetian canal!",

"reviewcomment":"Cicchetti, wine, sandwichs. Original Venetian Tavern near Santi Giovanni e Paolo. Brilliant place. My son reminded me of al Ponte yesterday. One of my favorite places on the planet. An original Cannaregio tavern just walk out the door of the Church and go straight for a couple hundred feet. There always seems to be a great mood or vibe in this place. Custom is mostly Venetians with very few tourists (like me). Small plates, a glass or three of red wine is the order of the day here. no grand meals. Can&#39;t say enough good things about this place other than well it&#39;s just special. Would give it a sixth star. Click their website and see a short video.",

"reviewcomment":"One of the best meals I had when in Venice.<br>We asked our hotel concierge to help setup a reservation for us. We got one on the last day we were in Venice. <br>The place is pretty neat with a nice home feeling. Servers were helpful and spoke English which was a plus for my wife and I. <br>We started with the fried meatballs which were delicious. They come in singles, so you can order as much or as little as you want. We went for two so each of us could try it. <br>We then ordered three other dishes. <br>Squid Ink Pasta<br>Squid ink calamari<br>Some sort of liver and onions dish<br><br>Squid ink pasta was delicious! This was the first taste of real Italian pasta and it blows everyone out of the water in the US. There&#39;s no comparison. The pasta is a perfect al dente without any grainyness. Flavors were bold, but the pasta was cooked just perfectly. Makes me wish I had a plate of it in front of me right now.<br><br>The squid ink squid was kind of the same. The sauce is similar, but with calamari instead. Also good, but I enjoyed the pasta more.<br><br>Liver and onions were also really tasty. It is rich though so it can get a bit heavy.<br>Overall great dinner out and it wasn&#39;t too expensive in terms of eating out in Venice. I would totally come back here to eat if I was in Venice again.",

However it is well worth taking some time exploring the labyrinthine network of alleys and passages.<br><br> I can really recommend the Osteria Al Portego.<br><br> For one, the prices are very reasonable, especially in comparison to other venetian establishments. Secondly, the food is great - and third, the locals eat there!<br><br> The staff don&#39;t speak much english but they are still very helpful and with a bit of effort everyone can get themselves understood.<br><br> The restaurant itself is pretty small so you may have to share a table with someone else, but that just adds to the friendly atmosphere.<br><br> The food is great - although I would suggest trying to reserve the tiramisu early since it seems to be everyones favourite.<br><br> A word of warning - they don&#39;t take credit cards so it is worth checking the coffers before ordering.",

"reviewcomment":"We must have passed by this caffe a least ten times before finally deciding to dine here. Being that no Yelp reviews existed I was suspicious that it was merely a tourist trap and so I was determined to go wandering through the Venetian mazes to find the other restaurants that had been explored by other Yelpers! The one we were suppose to try today happened to be closed. :( So we ended up wandering over the Rialto Bridge and literally chose this cafe from a coin toss. <br><br>Of course my hubby had been eying the plates each time we walked pass but I insisted no Yelpers had dined here so it must not be any good. <br><br>Boy was I wrong!! <br><br>We started our lunch with the sautéed mussels. The broth was light with fresh chopped herbs, olive oil, and a white wine reduction. The mussels were fresh and meaty! <br><br>Then he order the Spaghetti al Fruitti de Mare and I ordered the Spaghetti alla Vongole Veraci al dente! OMG... Seriously, when we took our first bites, we both looked at each other and didn&#39;t even exchange a word! We devoured our plates! The pasta....was perfect! <br><br>Of course since we leave tomorrow...I had to order another plate ~ so we split the Spaghetti alla bolognese :) It was a bit on the saltier side but still quite delicious. <br><br>I didn&#39;t have enough room in my belly for desert but I would have to say without a doubt, we will be going back. <br><br>Our favorite dish (hence the 5 stars) was the Spaghetti Al Fruitti de Mare!<br><br>Ahhhhh... I just finished lunch and am already craving another serving! :)",

Overall very nice and the walk from St Mark&#39;s Square is through an upscale shopping neighborhood, so no tourist trap souvenir shops. The clientele seemed to be mainly Italian so that is a good sign for the food quality I think.",

"reviewcomment":"First day at Venice and after researching/Yelping legit nom places, we wanted to try two local restaurants. Unfortunately, both were closed since it was New Year&#39;s Day. I guess this is a sign that those two restaurants were legit :( We stopped at the Nobile Patisserie and the employees there tipped us that there was a good seafood place around so we followed their advice and went to Da Andrew/Benigolde/whatever the name of the restaurant is. <br><br>The restaurant is a bit off the main road, but still drew a large crowd. It was only 8 pm which was still considered early for dinner in Italy. The store looked simple from the outside but inside, was a cozy dim lighted tavern of Pinterest worthy decor. Artsy guitars lined the shelves and there were chandeliers made out of music sheets. There was even a live guitarist! I thought he was singing a song about the 626, but he was really singing about Route 66 in a thick Italian accent...lol The restaurants not big, probably could seat only 10-12 tables. When we stepped in, almost all the tables were full - most diners were old and Italian locals (GOOD SIGN !) and everyone seemed to know each other too. The waiter told us all tables were already booked (by this point, we were eager to nom here cause it seemed like a place for the fine to dine).  After some awkward period of us standing and not leaving, he crammed the 3 of us into a 2 person table. <br><br>The waiter that served us spoke good English and helped us suggest a couple of dishes but first, DAMN this place is $$$. But my friends and I were eager to splurge - I feel blessed to have found a group of friends who also think food takes priority over other basic needs. We ended up ordering the raw seafood platter and octupus salad for appetizers and then the half moon pasta and green cheese ravioli for entrees. Family style, duh. We wanted to get the squid ink pasta but they ran out :(<br><br>In the meantime, we were served a bread basket. The bread was actually mediocre - and the least yummy carb I had in Italy so far. There were mediocre breadsticks, some hard bread, and this sesame toast thing that tastes like any bread from an Asian bakery. We were also served a free glass of prosecco(sparkling white wine), which Venice specializes in. I&#39;m still new to the alcohol scene so to me, it tasted MEH. Haha would still choose a fruity cocktail/Bellini over it.<br><br>Within 30 min, all our food came. Our small table was crammed with food. The raw fish platter came with raw shrimp ( SO GOOD, like Japanese Ama ebi but less sweet), oysters ( ehh they were ok), some raw tuna pineapple ceviche (interesting), and smoked salmon( I usually don&#39;t like smoked salmon, but this was one was so good - pretty salty and tasted like prosciutto). The octopus salad was huge. It was probably two whole octopus cut up...I really enjoyed it but my friends didn&#39;t dig it so alone, I probably consumed a whole one. It tasted light, lemony, and very fresh. Like I said, the servings are very small. The two pasta dishes each had 4 pieces of pasta...#sadness. But, the half moon pasta was epic. It was stuffed with fresh seafood, the sauce was rich and so delicious, and the pasta itself was perfectly al dente. The green ravioli was filled with mozzarella cheese. It wasn&#39;t as good as the half moon pasta but the pasta was still perfectly chewy and cooked. <br><br>For dessert, we got the traditional Italian cake, Sicilian sweet cake. It tasted...nasty. I thought it was like eating mediocre cupcake frosting but it looked pretty lulz. We wanted to chill more in the restaurant after the meal but the waiters kicked us out since a lot of people were waiting for tables. This is a great place to take your lover because everyone ( besides the three of us) were a a couple...",

"reviewcomment":"Once I navigated the streets of Venice and arrived at Harry&#39;s the people with me were elated. Yes, in some people&#39;s eyes I would have made a few wrong turns, but to me I was exploring without a map and the using the stars on a foggy night to guide my way. Walking into the world famous (maybe now notorious) Harry&#39;s, I was welcomed with a warm glow of the people and the lighting of the bar.  Walking in was like walking in the room with warm glow that James Cameron used when he did the movie the Titanic, except the fashion was not circa the time period and Harry&#39;s would have been 1930-40, resembling the brink of a depression. But I would say it was a wonderful experience. <br><br>The notorious part of Harry&#39;s would be their prices. Just shy of 20€ for the basics and it goes up from there. Going to Harry&#39;s isn&#39;t about drinking on a budget it about a level of service and experiencing a piece of history.  A place where Hemingway was once know to hangout in the Concordia room.  Other such as Charlie Chaplin and Orson Wells would also frequent. It is for some, a once in a lifetime experience so order a Bellini and drink it in.",

"reviewcomment":"Came here on our first night in Venice after a recommendation from a local Venetian(states that the restaurant itself takes normal dishes and puts their own unique twist on them)-- the place itself is very small and it is recommended that you make a reservation(either the 7pm or 9pm seating). As it was the first night of our honeymoon, I appreciated the small size of the restaurant, as with the candlelight/cozy space it made for a romantic atmosphere. All of the staff were very friendly- we started with the beef carpaccio which was delicious and paired well with the arugula. We also started with the caprese-buffalo mozzarella with tomatoes and an avocado sauce- the mozzarella was so fresh, it was amazing and paired very well with the avocado sauce(I&#39;ve personally never paired mozzarella with avocado and definitely plan to in the future as it created a very unique flavor.) I had the veal tagliatelle- the pasta was so fresh and was quite good- not the best I&#39;ve ever had, but good enough. My husband went with the veal stuffed with ricotta and wrapped with bacon- it also was good, nothing out-of-this world but moist and flavorful. <br>For dessert- we had the tiramisu- which was the standout of the night- absolutely delicious and the dark chocolate cake infused with cherries which was so moist and flavorful. I would go there just for their homemade desserts because they were heavenly!!!",

"reviewcomment":"I had a wonderful birthday lunch here that was yet another memorable meal. <br><br>This place is very hard to find so allow yourself some extra time to get here. The restaurant is designed like the interior of a small beautiful yacht. Lots of curving woodwork and padded surfaces. The staff, in white jackets, is extremely professional. When I asked the waiter to recommend a great white wine for lunch, I ended up with a fabulous wine that wasn&#39;t more than $40.00 a bottle. When I looked at the wine list after the waiter had suggested it and saw the price I asked if that was the best that he could suggest. He said yes, it would be great and it was. I really love it when the waiters don&#39;t try to oversell you. <br><br>This is the top Michelin rated restaurant in Venice and I would say it is one of the top three that we ate in while in Venice. The one thing that all three restaurants had in common was seafood fresher than anything I have ever had before. Of course everything I had, outside of desert, was seafood and it all was not only good but interesting and intriguing. Even my 10 year old son liked all of the seafood.<br><br>This Restaurant is a wonderful little hidden gem.",

"reviewcomment":"Well, there isn&#39;t much to say that hasn&#39;t already been mentioned.<br><br>This is a&#34;famous&#34; bar just about right on the canal. The #1 vaporetto stops right near the entrance, but it&#39;s easy to miss.<br><br>The bar area is very small and the tables are cramped and crowded. In my opinion, it&#39;s a huge tourist trap, although when we were there, there were actually a lot of locals as well.<br><br>I read all of the reviews mentioning how expensive everything is, but was still shocked by the menu. Trust me, it&#39;s insanely expensive. I had a Bellini and my friend a bloody Mary, and our bill was $38,50€!! I thought about ordering beef carpaccio, but the &#34;small&#34; was $46€. But hey, they give you complimentary olives when you order a drink!<br><br>I am giving them 3 stars because I knew what to expect and the service as good. Also, the Bellini was actually pretty delicious.<br><br>Will I be back? Not unless Hemingway returns from the dead!",

For an entree, I had the spaghetti with clams and ate every bite. My husband really like the calamari. Our table of 3 shared the liter of house red which was fantastic for only 14 euro. <br><br>The only drawback was the swarm of flying ants which attacked our table and the ones next to us on the patio, but I guess that&#39;s the danger of dining al fresco.

How good is that ?<br><br>The place has loads of character and is located in a lane away from the crowds of the market and Rialto bridge. They have excellent daily specials and the prices are very reasonable.<br><br>The Spaghetti con Polpette which is a Venetian specialty is served here in a small portion as the first course and tastes divine. It has a good kick to it and the meat balls are amazingly tender and tasty. <br><br>Try the Zanetti for dessert which is two raisin biscuits served with a lemony liqueur to dip the biscuits in and tastes divine.<br><br>Coffee here is good and the service is excellent. I would happily come back here anytime and not hard to see why it is popular with locals who stand around the bar and sip aperitif or wine and eat small plates of food. <br><br>A great place for lunch or dinner in Venice.",

Both times we were able to get tables that overlooked the street for people watching. They do have outside patio seating as well, but the weather was cool in late December.  <br><br>When seated, we quickly received our complementary Bellini&#39;s.  A tasty little drink.  Bread was delivered and we were given time to review the menu. <br><br>One of our visits occurred on New Year&#39;s Eve and the menu was slightly different and typical with all restaurants, the pricing was increased double or triple. <br><br>Both times our meals were great and our selection varied by times.  <br><br>If you ask for a large beer, be prepared. It is large - see attached picture.  <br><br>We had wine and dessert both times as well and enjoyed both. <br><br>It&#39;s located in a corner of San Marco Square and has a great deal of foot traffic. I highly recommend this location during your visit.  Let me know your thoughts. <br><br>Also, free wifi!",

"reviewcomment":"I went here not once, but twice. This was the only place in Italy that hit both price + quality at the best intersection possible.  Pizzerie Ae Oche is a delicious pizza/pasta restaurant located not too far from the touristy areas of Venice. It&#39;s on the south end of the &#34;main&#34; island, closest to Giudecca island.  <br><br>The menu here is quite extensive - and it reminds me more of a health conscious place than a restaurant in Italy. Everything is clearly marked for vegetarian/vegan (note: rocket is a salad green, not a fish), and the pizzas come in a wide variety of toppings and styles. Everything is locally sourced where available, as well. You can have one made to order, but there are a lot of options for meat and/or veg and/or horsemeat eater (lol) as needed, plus the choice between cheese+tomato for base, tomato for base, or cheese only for base (white pizza).  Crusts are awesome, as are the topping options. This is one place where the pizzas are wood fired, extremely fresh, delicious and not too oily. Tourist trap pizza places tend to be slathered in oil in comparison. <br><br>What matters most is that they are all good, and large. If this is your first foray into pizza in Italy do note that what they consider an individual pizza is basically a family pizza in the us - and likewise that the pasta options are considered more like an appetizer and not as an entree. <br><br>In addition to normal pizza, they also serve dessert pizzas, great pesto pasta (appetizer as noted), and giant awesome calzones. It should be noted that the calzone is considered a personal order but is also sized like a family pizza.  However, what meal can be complete without wine? especially in a foreign country. Do not be deceived here vs house wine in the us, as even the house wine options taste great.<br><br>so we have: budget friendly + great food, all in one package. This is absolutely a &#34;must eat&#34; location in Venice.",

"reviewcomment":"This is an excellent local fish restaurant. During one of our lunches here we were the only tourists in the room. There was a large table of local business men or club members or just friends having a celebratory lunch. The waiters were bringing out platters of different kinds of seafood and pouring wine wile the men were talking and singing. It was great. They started talking with us and asking us to taste different things.<br>Not only was everything we ordered great it wasn&#39;t the typical seafood you find in Venice.<br>The atmosphere is also very nice, like being in a warm cozy home although with air conditioning for the summer. <br>Prices were reasonable and the service was excellent.",

O_o<br><br>It was our last night in Italy, after dinner I was packing up and realized I left my $600 camera there! I ran back, the restaurant was closed! But luckily our waiter was still there eating a late night dinner, smiled, and handed me my camera bag! I was sorry I had no cash on me to give him an extra tip :(<br><br>The only memorable restaurant in Venice...I&#39;ll have to try the pizza next time! :D<br><br>(BTW: The movie reference is &#34;Goodfellas&#34; The manager/owner reminded me of Pauli or Tutti, and our waiter reminded me of young Henry.)",

"reviewcomment":"What a little gem this place is. It can be difficult to find this place so plan your route ahead of time. Of course, most places in Venice are hard to find. This great little restaurant is ran by the owners. The wife is the only waitress and the husband is the chef. They were such wonderful hosts and they both chatted and thanked us on our way out.<br><br>This place specializes in seafood and it was all very fresh and cooked beautifully. I really enjoyed the flavor of the cuttlefish cooked in it&#39;s own ink. The only time I&#39;ve ever enjoyed an ink sauce was with this dish. We had several dishes and we were all very full. The highlight of the evening though was after our first and second courses. The homemade tiramisu (family recipe) was outstanding. The best I&#39;ve ever had. The best part of our meal though was the homemade creamy limoncello they make. We ordered a round after the meal and enjoyed it so much they offered us another on the house. We even asked if we could buy a bottle but unfortunately it needs to be freshly made.<br><br>Please check this place out and make reservations beforehand. This place is perfect for a romantic meal in Venice.",

All of the food was fresh and delicious.  The service by the waiter and management was outstanding and unfortunately we didn&#39;t have room for dessert but enjoyed complimentary limoncello. <br><br>I would definitely recommend Al Fontego for dinner and suggest dinning Al Fresco on the delightful patio.",

Jesus Christ Henry, I can&#39;t have that in this joint!&#34;<br>Henry H. &#39;I remember feeling bad for the guy, but then I remember the feeling maybe Tutti was right...I knew Pauli didn&#39;t want anyone dying in the building&#39;<br>Tutti C.: &#34;You&#39;re a real jerk Henry! You wasted 8 f**king aprons on this guy, I don&#39;t what the hell is wrong with you, I gotta toughen this kid up!&#34;<br>**************************************************­***********************************************<br><br>90% of you tourists will dismiss this cheap looking joint and eat at some fancy schmancy tourist-packed restaurant nearby, such as Casa Mia, Da Alberto, or Santa Marina. Yes, they had menus in English, but we were only the tourists at La Perla, the 4-5 other tables were all speaking Italian, and there was a constant flow of local Venetians getting pizzas to go(aka &#34;take away&#34; in Europe).<br><br>The food wasn&#39;t mindblowing, and the atmosphere was low key. But it was good, solid, simple, Italian home-style cooking at very reasonable prices:<br>7 euro Gnocchi in tomato sauce...simple, and yum!<br>4 euro grilled Zuchinni...simple, and yum! Though the portion could have been bigger.<br>13 euro Rosemary steak...big and yum! I think it was 12oz worth. <br>6 euro mezzo(half) liter of red house wine...the BEST wine I drank during my 2 week Italy vacay!<br>4 euro Panacotta with chocolate syrup...simple and yum!<br>4 euro Grappa apertif...good, strong, and it was about 2.5 shots worth! O_o<br><br>It was our last night in Italy, after dinner I was packing up and realized I left my $600 camera there! I ran back, the restaurant was closed! But luckily our waiter was still there eating a late night dinner, smiled, and handed me my camera bag! I was sorry I had no cash on me to give him an extra tip :(<br><br>The only memorable restaurant in Venice...I&#39;ll have to try the pizza next time! :D<br><br>(BTW: The movie reference is &#34;Goodfellas&#34; The manager/owner reminded me of Pauli or Tutti, and our waiter reminded me of young Henry.)",

"reviewcomment":"Ristorante Carpaccio is an amazing little spot right on the Grand Canal.  Our concierge recommended this gem on our last night in Venice.  If you are looking for pizza is is not the right spot for you, but if its seafood or seafood pasta you seek, then look no further!!  This place is not the easiest to,see while,walking down the canal it is located in corner behind one of the larger touristy places.<br><br>My wife and I had, had some average experiences our first few meals during our trip to Venice and wanted a real home run for our last night.  When we got there we were sat immediately by the owner Rossario.  We started with a wonderful antipasto Salmon over warm toast with thyme and lemon.  We both went with Seafood Pastas,  my wife had talgliolini  with scallops and zucchini and I had Pappardelle with mixed seafood to which there was plenty of!  Having tried both dishes we both agreed this place nailed it on taste and did over salt or over season it was just right.  The staff was very friendly and attentive.We can&#39;t wait to come back",

"reviewcomment":"What a little gem this place is. It can be difficult to find this place so plan your route ahead of time. Of course, most places in Venice are hard to find. This great little restaurant is ran by the owners. The wife is the only waitress and the husband is the chef. They were such wonderful hosts and they both chatted and thanked us on our way out.<br><br>This place specializes in seafood and it was all very fresh and cooked beautifully. I really enjoyed the flavor of the cuttlefish cooked in it&#39;s own ink. The only time I&#39;ve ever enjoyed an ink sauce was with this dish. We had several dishes and we were all very full. The highlight of the evening though was after our first and second courses. The homemade tiramisu (family recipe) was outstanding. The best I&#39;ve ever had. The best part of our meal though was the homemade creamy limoncello they make. We ordered a round after the meal and enjoyed it so much they offered us another on the house. We even asked if we could buy a bottle but unfortunately it needs to be freshly made.<br><br>Please check this place out and make reservations beforehand. This place is perfect for a romantic meal in Venice.",

We came back by it a couple days later and I joked, &#34;Finally, I get to try the infamous Gino&#39;s.&#34; We ate there and it was phenomenal. What was me making a joke, turned out to be one of the best meals I had in Italy. I order a pizza of all things and I&#39;ve never had a better pizza. Thin crust with alfredo sauce, mozzarella, brie, I cannot remember all the ingredients, but it was great. one of my coworkers wasn&#39;t really hungry and ordered spaghetti. I ended up with it as well. Beside my own secret recipe I&#39;ve never had a better spaghetti meat sauce in my life. I also tried another&#39;s lasagna.  So good.

"reviewcomment":"I visited Venice with an armful of restaurant recommendations; all proved to be pretty good but this one was stellar! <br>It has all the ingredients for the perfect Venice experience - owner-managed by the charming and knowledgeable Isabella, creative menu using the best local ingredients, a knock-out wine list (kick off with the pink Prosecco and then trust Isabella&#39;s recommendations including dessert wines - we did and they were perfect) plus it has the feel of a true neighbourhood restaurant ie no pretensions, a mixed bag of clientele and bags of flash-free charm. Dress up or down - you&#39;ll feel equally as comfortable. <br>Book to be sure of a table and, for a pre-dinner treat, take in a cocktail at the legendary Danieli Hotel which is only a 5-minute walk away.",

The reason I love this place is because it was the only cafe I&#39;d found on the island (I&#39;m sure there are others) that offered coffee and desserts at the &#34;right&#34; price. No overpriced 4 Euro cappucinos here! <br><br>Good coffee and a good price. Lovely service (a wonderful lady delivered our coffee and desserts). AMAZING selection of bread and desserts.",

Our server, I can&#39;t remember his name but he has brown curly hair and is very jovial, was so sweet and explained everything on the menu to us. He was really patient and didnt push anything.

"reviewcomment":"My first real meal in Venice....<br><br>...and it was amazing!<br>Granted, we were here for business and the meal was totally free, so I can&#39;t vouch for prices on things. Basically, there were seven of us and we ordered a set dinner compete with two carafes of perfectly chilled white wine and bottled water.<br><br>First course: A delicious, creamy and amazingly seasoned pasta. I was later told that there was crab in this dish, but alas, I did not taste the crab. All I tasted was 100% deliciousness!<br>Second course: Fish with grilled polenta, olives and roasted cherry tomatoes with a light white wine cream sauce. Super tasty, however I didn&#39;t finish this plate. I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s because there were a few bones in my fish and I was tired of picking them out, or if it was because I was still full from the pasta.<br>Dessert: We had a huge choice of tiramisu, panna cotta with berry sauce, a fruit cup or a huge hollowed out pineapple, filled with pineapple chunks. We settled on splitting the tiramisu, and definitely don&#39;t regret it.<br>To round out the meal, we ordered coffee (espresso in tiny cups for all you <br>Americans!).<br><br>Again, I&#39;m not sure how much this meal cost but I&#39;m guessing it ain&#39;t cheap. The interior was beautiful and reminded me of old spots in NYC or San Francisco. The waiters were kind and patient, and let us carry out our three hour meal without disruptions.<br><br>Definitely a memorable meal, but I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;d ever go out of my way to eat at this place just because of the potential cost. I&#39;d have to say it&#39;s worth four stars because of 70% food, 30% company. Hurray for places like this!",

"reviewcomment":"My first real meal in Venice....<br><br>...and it was amazing!<br>Granted, we were here for business and the meal was totally free, so I can&#39;t vouch for prices on things. Basically, there were seven of us and we ordered a set dinner compete with two carafes of perfectly chilled white wine and bottled water.<br><br>First course: A delicious, creamy and amazingly seasoned pasta. I was later told that there was crab in this dish, but alas, I did not taste the crab. All I tasted was 100% deliciousness!<br>Second course: Fish with grilled polenta, olives and roasted cherry tomatoes with a light white wine cream sauce. Super tasty, however I didn&#39;t finish this plate. I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s because there were a few bones in my fish and I was tired of picking them out, or if it was because I was still full from the pasta.<br>Dessert: We had a huge choice of tiramisu, panna cotta with berry sauce, a fruit cup or a huge hollowed out pineapple, filled with pineapple chunks. We settled on splitting the tiramisu, and definitely don&#39;t regret it.<br>To round out the meal, we ordered coffee (espresso in tiny cups for all you <br>Americans!).<br><br>Again, I&#39;m not sure how much this meal cost but I&#39;m guessing it ain&#39;t cheap. The interior was beautiful and reminded me of old spots in NYC or San Francisco. The waiters were kind and patient, and let us carry out our three hour meal without disruptions.<br><br>Definitely a memorable meal, but I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;d ever go out of my way to eat at this place just because of the potential cost. I&#39;d have to say it&#39;s worth four stars because of 70% food, 30% company. Hurray for places like this!",

It&#39;s just a fantastic tour of taste with I think about 10 or more different delicious little things to try plus Falafel. Also the fried artichokes are really good! Lemonade and ice tea is home made and also worth to try! In addition to that here are a bit less tourists and you can sit in front of the waterside. Prices are quite normal to low price. If you come by waterbus just hop off the boat at Guglie, head just a few meters to the right and enjoy the wonderful food :) Just want something cheap on the go: ask for the gam-gam take away just arround the corner with fantastic pizza and little things filled with sweet or savoury (vegetables) stuff.",

The atmosphere and setting are fantastic with one of the nicest views across the canal, looking out over to San Marco&#39;s Square. The price is right for the 2 Regional cuisines they serve here, which can be delicious, and the Prosecco is always fresh cool and bubbly. If you&#39;re into beer , definitely try the Menabrea, Italian beer from Piemonte,.. it&#39;s a winner that surely hits the spot!

"reviewcomment":"We stumbled upon this gem of a restaurant on our last night in Venice, while looking for something intimate, tasty, and memorable. Al Pesador delivered just that. <br><br>An unimposing storefront in what looks like an old warehouse on the canal, the restaurant is separated into two levels: bar and several tables downstairs, and a cozy space with vaulted brick ceilings and cute windows overlooking the water upstairs. <br><br>The staff are friendly and knowledgable, provide impeccable recommendations, and are very forgiving to the English-speaking diner. Very importantly, Al Pesador serves food made from regional ingredients.<br><br>We started with a nice white wine, on recommendation from the server. I chose a first course of cichetti, assorted bar appetizers selected by the chef. Delicious fish meatball, fried sardine, monkfish and cheese toast, salami and artichoke toast. Delicious. My husband had ricotta gnocchi with monkfish sauce, which was also excellent. <br><br>For the main course, he had cuttlefish in ink sauce with white corn polenta. The fish came lightly drizzled with the ink, and was sweet, tender, and delicious. The polenta was soft and smooth. My main course was a divine duck breast in honey sauce. It was nearly rare, which I never order, but was just the right temperature and done-ness to highlight the intense flavor of the duck. <br><br>For dessert, we shared tiramisu, which was divine. After, the server brought complimentary grappa, which was also excellent (but potent).<br><br>Overall, this meal was a highlight of our trip. It featured local preparation of regional foods, but in a way not unlike an upscale restaurant at home. Memorable, delicious, and perfect.",

"reviewcomment":"Easily the best food we had in Venice.<br><br>Right along the Grand Canal in the Hotel Metropole, Met Restaurant couldn&#39;t be easier to find.  Atmosphere is so so stiff, stuffy, formal.  Be sure to pack your monocle.  That&#39;s pretty much my only complaint about the restaurant.<br><br>Water list.  I was ill prepared to make this kind of critical decision.  Minerals, pH, origin, what will they mean?  We selected, water arrived.  It tasted like quality water.  Good...Good...just as we intended.<br><br>They offer a couple different tasting menus, one of which they tell you nothing about, and you may not take pictures.  I forget the specifics, but I remember every course being at minimum good, my wife loving even the pigeon, and a hickory aroma explosion as the servers swirled the lids from an arriving dish.  <br><br>Our wine was good but not as amazing as others we had throughout our trip.  Some of that is the luck of the draw though.<br><br>Creative presentation, wonderful food.  Two Michelin stars is about right.  Not the pacesetter, but still 6th Yelp Star worthy.",

"reviewcomment":"It&#39;s every difficult to find a good service restaurant here in Venice, until today. We got an older gentleman who greeted us like we&#39;re family. He recommended the fish lasagna and squid ink pasta. Both of which is so delicious. <br><br>Our table also ordered fried fish/calamari mix, ravioli and sardines Sao (sardines in lemon juice and onions). If you love exotic flavors, this is a must try. <br><br>The reason why I gave this place 5 stars is because #1 great service. #2 great food. #3 great wine (try the house red wine) it has subtle sweet notes. <br><br>This restaurant really made me not hate my trip to Venice because of the first restaurant &#34;LA Gondola&#34; who ripped us off by adding a lot of service charges, water and wine chages that was told to us would be included. The charges was about 30€ more than what we were suppose to get charged. We complained and the guy who hustled us into the restaurant gave a BS explaination. All I can say is shame on them. <br><br>Enough of that bad restaurant, my recommendation for Trattoria Rivetta would be the Sardines, cuttlefish ink pasta, fish lasagna, house red wine, and the tiramisu.",

"reviewcomment":"Don&#39;t let the bright yellow exterior fool you. This is a great luxury hotel overlooking St. Mark&#39;s Square and the Basilica. The nondescript entrance is right in the middle of the shopping district, a few doors down from a McDonalds. The reception desk and lobby is up a flight of stairs or a tiny elevator. <br><br>My family and I arrived a few days early before our departure on a Mediterranean cruise. We booked our stay at a place I stayed in years ago while backpacking with friends. Big mistake since I&#39;m more of a roller bag traveler now. We got new accommodations through the tourist desk at the train station. <br><br>Wow. Talk about awesome. We scored a room 50 feet from the Basilica&#39;s side entrance. The room was spacious and had a bathroom en suite. There is a wide ledge you can use for a window seat and people-watching. <br><br>The breakfast buffet was abundant and delicious. Most of the guests were well-dressed couples. We met a few other families so we didn&#39;t feel so out of place in our casual dress. <br><br>The staff was very helpful, if aloof. They pointed us to great restaurants and interesting day trips. They recommended a local guide that took us into Venice away from the tourist traps.  But, skip the other tours. You can arrange for a cheaper trip to Murano. Also, a private tour on a water taxi was nice but again, expensive. The local water bus is cheaper and more fun. <br><br>If you want to splurge, I recommend Hotel Concordia for a few days of champagne wishes and caviar dreams.",

"reviewcomment":"We came in because we thought we found a hidden gem. We walked by the place every night (3-4 nights in a row). It always looks so good, all seafood dishes. The place was packed everyday! We decided to check it out Sunday 7pm. We didn&#39;t have a reservation. The place was packed again. We waited for an hour. After being seated, we ordered our food right away. We got our appetizer in the next 40 min. We were pretty patient (try to be understanding given how crowded the place was). We basically waited about 30 min between courses! <br><br>Above all the biggest disappointment was the food! The food was just ok. It was not bad but definitely not worthy of all the wait we put in. We had mixed seafood appetizer (ok), spaghetti seafood (worst of everything we ordered), mixed seafood grill for an entree (best of the three that we ordered but still average in my opinion). The price was reasonable. The vibe was good. But the food was average. I won&#39;t go back to the place and won&#39;t recommend it too<br><br>The place takes cash only. We ended up paying in usd. They accepted it which was nice",

"reviewcomment":"We saw how cute this place looked when walking around and decided to come back for dinner. We were seated right away around 7:30 without a reservation. The place is tiny (about 4 tables) but has a charming ambience and feels cozy. <br><br>The owner asked us if we were Italian and we noticed she did this with other diners as well. I got the sense we were getting the tourist treatment especially when the menu was conveyed verbally (without prices). She was pleasant but not particularly genuine, and we felt rushed to order since there was no menu to peruse. <br><br>My husband ordered the pesto lasagna and I had the spaghetti della casa. I had wanted to try the mushroom risotto but it was only available for 2. We were both very happy with the food and the portions. The lasagna was bathed in melted mozzarella and tons of pesto sauce (almost like a thick soup). My spaghetti was a garlicky arrabiatta sauce with chunks of tomato and generous amount of parmesan cheese.<br><br>For the two pasta dishes and a bottle of water, we were surprised to pay 50+ euros. Despite the high price and feeling a bit that we&#39;d been had, we enjoyed the meal and would likely go back on the strength of the food.<br><br>Visited September 2011",

"reviewcomment":"We arrived in Venice at about 9 pm and decided to explore before the flood of tourists got there in the daytime. We picked this place because we weren&#39;t able to eat dinner yet and it was one of the few restaurants still open. Waiter was very nice and the glasses of house wine and food came out promptly. 3 of us ordered penne arrabiata which hit the spot. The others had margherita pizza and spinach pizza and those were excellent as well. We sat outside so it was great for people-watching and kicking back. One of the best meals I had in Italy.",

Considering the location, it&#39;s a good option for budget-conscious tourists who still want to eat something decent in a cosy environment.

While traveling in Italy this was the best food I experienced other than La Zucca in all of Italy. I was so tired of all the pizzeria restaurants in Italy. I couldn&#39;t believe the tandoori mixed plate. The Shrimp that come on the plate are huge and so good. Eat the head and all. The sauces for the curry dishes could use a little more punch or aroma I think. Maybe more ginger? The owner is very friendly and interesting. She even remembered me 2 weeks after my first visit. She grew up in Venice but traveled the world. Everyone there seemed to be Indian too which is promising. Prices for food in Italy is very high. A special fixed plate including dessert is between $30 and $40 US Dollars.  Or you can go with entrees.",

It was just a short walk from the Hotel Molino Stuckey and well past the overpriced and culturally outlying option of Harry&#39;s Bar.<br><br>Ostaria Ae Botti seemed like more of a locals place, including an interesting display of PDA give-and-take within the Sunday evening &#34;Happy Hour&#34; bunch just behind our table. Our table overlooked the water, and we also did our best to avoid the water that had accumulated on the canopy over our table. <br><br>There might be finer dining out there in great Venice, but this was of those situations when the food, service company, and romantic outdoor venue all came together for a relatively magical moment in time. The next morning, Erin and Jim would be heading to Paris, while Gayle and I would be traveling to the Dolomites.

The nondescript entrance is right in the middle of the shopping district, a few doors down from a McDonalds. The reception desk and lobby is up a flight of stairs or a tiny elevator. <br><br>My family and I arrived a few days early before our departure on a Mediterranean cruise. We booked our stay at a place I stayed in years ago while backpacking with friends. Big mistake since I&#39;m more of a roller bag traveler now. We got new accommodations through the tourist desk at the train station. <br><br>Wow. Talk about awesome. We scored a room 50 feet from the Basilica&#39;s side entrance. The room was spacious and had a bathroom en suite. There is a wide ledge you can use for a window seat and people-watching. <br><br>The breakfast buffet was abundant and delicious. Most of the guests were well-dressed couples. We met a few other families so we didn&#39;t feel so out of place in our casual dress. <br><br>The staff was very helpful, if aloof. They pointed us to great restaurants and interesting day trips. They recommended a local guide that took us into Venice away from the tourist traps.  But, skip the other tours. You can arrange for a cheaper trip to Murano. Also, a private tour on a water taxi was nice but again, expensive. The local water bus is cheaper and more fun. <br><br>If you want to splurge, I recommend Hotel Concordia for a few days of champagne wishes and caviar dreams.",

However, they are comfortable. <br>Friendly and helpful staff, nice (small) bar, great buffet  breakfast, completely rennovated (modern w/open beam ceilings) in quiet part of town. <br><br>Easy walk to Vaporretto (water bus) stops. Canal view is nice, but not required since you&#39;ll not be in the room much! Very cold AC is great in late July! Brought a water bottle along that we refilled all over the city from the lovely fountains...one located just down the street from front of hotel.<br><br>This is such a lovely hotel!

We waited over 40 minutes even after calling the waiter over so we could at least have water, no menu was given, he was extremely rude.    Another 5 mins go by and we had the menu, never received water.  We walked out.  Obviously they discriminate against any non-Italians, as people sitting near us from other countries experienced the same rude behavior, but Italians were being catered to.

"reviewcomment":"In the tourist-trap-filled labyrinth known as Venice in terms of food, I thought Osteria da Baco was pretty good. I ordered two sandwiches - one with shrimp salad and radicchio, and the other with prosciutto in it. My friend also ordered two sandwiches, though I forgot what was in hers. We enjoyed our sandwiches, and the ingredients were fresh. Nothing earth-shattering, just simple and fresh. It was a cozy shop, and people were constantly coming in and out. It is somewhat of a soup nazi line in there, but it&#39;s understandable given the size and the tourist traffic. I would stop by if I go back to Venice (versus no way for some of the other rip-off places encountered!).",

Yes, it&#39;s cicchetti but you can grab so much food that it will completely stuff you up. Try ALL their offerings! This place is also the first place that I&#39;ve tried spritz con aperol and it&#39;s fruity, bittersweet flavor provides a nice foil to the saltiness of the cicchetti that you order.",

I had their famous summer Granny Smith green apple gelato. It was so refreshing, light and juicy capturing the real essence of &#39;apple&#39; (if you can do such a thing). I only got a small scoop as I felt like I&#39;d sampled way to many gelato&#39;s in Italy, but I wish I got the bigger one!<br><br>I don&#39;t know if I can ever find this place again due to the maze that Venice is, but I will try!",

I could have taken him back home, too!",

"reviewcomment":"This was our only dinner in Venice and the restaurant did a great job accommodating us.  Our service was really great.  The food was good and the company excellent.  There was plenty of wine that went along with our meal.  I forget how much we paid our tour manager for it but it was an add-on excursion as opposed to an included meal.  The food was good though.  If you&#39;re ever on a Contiki tour, do the food add-ons because they are worthwhile.  There&#39;s no wait and they expect a big group versus being ill-prepared.  <br><br>We had a selection of: cheeses, roasted vegetables, pasta (2 kinds), meat &amp; potatoes with salad, and a dessert which is classic Venetian cuisine, we were told.  Since I was at a table for four with only two people who drank wine, we had plenty to imbibe.  No surprise that we ended up passing our wine along to another table because we couldn&#39;t finish it all.  It was already paid for and we couldn&#39;t take it with us!  I had a great time with all the people I had met on my trip.  Good dinner, great experience.",

The atmosphere and setting are fantastic with one of the nicest views across the canal, looking out over to San Marco&#39;s Square. The price is right for the 2 Regional cuisines they serve here, which can be delicious, and the Prosecco is always fresh cool and bubbly. If you&#39;re into beer , definitely try the Menabrea, Italian beer from Piemonte,.. it&#39;s a winner that surely hits the spot!

We stumbled over to look at the menu and thought, why not? It&#39;s right here, next to us, where we are currently standing and we are hungry. We sat outside under a canopy  it was raining but we were sufficiently protected and it added to the general mood of sultryness and mystery that pervades Venice in the rain.<br><br> We had a pizza and a litre of wine and 2 tiramisu(s) which came to about 30 euros for two of us, including service and cover charge. Service was friendly and efficient, house wine was good value and very drinkable and the pizzas were perfectly adequate. The thing with pizza in Italy, and the same often goes for wine and ice cream  even the rubbish ones are usually better than our best offerings. Not that the pizza was rubbish, I ate the whole thing and very much enjoyed it. The homemade tiramisu was delicious.",

My hubby ordered what he called the best seafood pasta he&#39;d ever had (and believe me he&#39;s not a seafood eater)and  I had a traditional fried calamari (sorry I had a craving). During our dinner there was an accordion street performer that played while we ate which added an incredible ambiance to our meal.

You have to pay €4 per person cover charge and an average size pizza can run you about €12-16. <br><br>The food is nice and tasty and the service is good. I had pizza here and I enjoyed it. It was a little different in the sense that the crust was a lot softer and chewy as opposed to be being crispy and chewy and I did not mind it at all. <br><br>The Pannacotta for dessert with berries was also quite good and I enjoyed it a lot. The coffee is ok and the staff were prompt and friendly. <br><br>Given the choice and time I would go elsewhere as you can great pizza for a lot less in town. If you want a more upmarket setting then I would pick this place as it is a great spot for people watching and it is right next to the theatre.",

"reviewcomment":"We stumbled upon this gem of a restaurant on our last night in Venice, while looking for something intimate, tasty, and memorable. Al Pesador delivered just that. <br><br>An unimposing storefront in what looks like an old warehouse on the canal, the restaurant is separated into two levels: bar and several tables downstairs, and a cozy space with vaulted brick ceilings and cute windows overlooking the water upstairs. <br><br>The staff are friendly and knowledgable, provide impeccable recommendations, and are very forgiving to the English-speaking diner. Very importantly, Al Pesador serves food made from regional ingredients.<br><br>We started with a nice white wine, on recommendation from the server. I chose a first course of cichetti, assorted bar appetizers selected by the chef. Delicious fish meatball, fried sardine, monkfish and cheese toast, salami and artichoke toast. Delicious. My husband had ricotta gnocchi with monkfish sauce, which was also excellent. <br><br>For the main course, he had cuttlefish in ink sauce with white corn polenta. The fish came lightly drizzled with the ink, and was sweet, tender, and delicious. The polenta was soft and smooth. My main course was a divine duck breast in honey sauce. It was nearly rare, which I never order, but was just the right temperature and done-ness to highlight the intense flavor of the duck. <br><br>For dessert, we shared tiramisu, which was divine. After, the server brought complimentary grappa, which was also excellent (but potent).<br><br>Overall, this meal was a highlight of our trip. It featured local preparation of regional foods, but in a way not unlike an upscale restaurant at home. Memorable, delicious, and perfect.",

"reviewcomment":"It&#39;s almost impossible to find a bad meal in Italy, and this place proves it. We literally stumbled onto this place down a pitch-dark, narrow little alley called Calle Albanesi, not far from Venice&#39;s famous St. Mark&#39;s Square and the &#34;Bridge of Sighs.&#34; It&#39;s decorated with great art work, and the prices were pretty reasonable for an expensive city like Venice. We had a typical four-course Italian dinner of lasagna, salad, rosemary roasted chicken, and gelato with fruit. Everything was great. (Bread or rolls also comes with every meal in Italian restaurants and you&#39;re charged for it whether you eat it or not, so you might as well eat it.) Not bad for a totally blind pick.",

"reviewcomment":"Located a few blocks away from the Rialto Bridge, this quaint little Venetian osteria offers a reasonably priced local dish that are decent. Considering the location, it&#39;s a good option for budget-conscious tourists who still want to eat something decent in a cosy environment. Our vongole spaghetti was subpar but I really enjoyed the squid ink pasta (spaghetti al nero di seppia).... check it out!",
