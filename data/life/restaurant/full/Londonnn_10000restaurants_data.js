The chargrilled prawns, the ruby chicken, the broken potatoes and the  black daal were stand - out for me. They also provided me with a version of their menu that had all the gluten-free options highlighted, which was much appreciated. <br><br>The staff made some great recommendations as to what we should order, and the restaurant itself is really nice.

The location is great, the restaurant itself is very inviting and is great for both large groups or an intimate date. <br><br>I&#39;ve been here 4 times now and each time I&#39;ve been delighted with my meal. The pink grapefruit mojitos are absolute heaven and the smoked chicken noodle dish is outstanding!

Bodean&#39;s certainly helps rectify the situation. <br><br>Bodean&#39;s is always packed and you should always expect a queue. My favorite is the Soho special, which combines burnt ends (the house specialty) and pulled pork. Match made in heaven if you ask me. Their cornbread is also pretty decent and they have pretty good wings. I&#39;ve never tried their ribs *gasp* but I have friends that swear by them. I also appreciate the North American bottled beer selection which includes Blue Moon, Coors, and Brooklyn Brewery. Of course I appreciate local British and European beers, but sometimes you just need a taste of home.",

"reviewcomment":"Summary: <br>+ GREAT food AND DESSERT<br>+ Spacious and chic ambience <br>+ Order at the counter, which also serves as food display<br>+ Follow the sight of food, follow your heart <br>+ But remember, your eyes are bigger than your stomach <br>+ It gets very busy. So be ready to elbow your way in to find a spot <br><br>Overall: <br>Located in the heart of Wardour Street, this gorgeous Italian deli café is one of my favourite places in SOHO. They have freshly baked breads, steaming hot pizza, salad bar, hot main dishes and great cakes. In other words, they have EVERYTHING. <br>From outside, the place looks like a chic hotel restaurant. The interior does not betray your expectation. The dusky brightness of brass tables somehow matches the white marble walls and dark stone floor. The combination gives this large dining space a tasteful refinement without being glitzy. <br><br>The place is apparently called Princi. <br>I can never remember what it is called. The place is too stylish to have a big banner of their name at the back of the counter. The only branding they have outside the restaurant is very small and the fancy swirly font makes it impossible to decipher what is written. So when I refer to this place, I am usually forced to use rather unsophisticated descriptions such as &#34;that big posh Italian place in SOHO&#34;. <br>Hopefully, writing a review will help me remember the name of this charming café. <br><br>Anyway, the place was as busy as usual when I went in for a dessert break. (I seem to do that a lot these days.) I often see one or two creative types with their laptops (mostly Mac) here but there were none of them that day. God knows what those people do for their lives <br><br>I joined the group of people who are forming a kind of &#34;organic&#34; queue that you see in good old British pub. <br>When I felt I had waited for a sufficient amount of time as a courtesy, I attracted an attention of one of the servers at the cake section and ordered Cremoso alla fragola (layered berry mousse cake).  <br><br>Food: <br>This three-layered delight came in the shape of a fluffy strawberry mousse sandwiched by a thin sheet of mixed berry jello on top and moist sponge at the base. The little bits of fresh berries in the top jello layer enhance the airy texture of the cake. I like the way all the elements worked together without one dominating another.  <br><br>One other thing to mention is their toilet smells incredible. They have some sort of lemon grass incense that fills the private space with heavenly fragrance. That said, I have only been to male toilet. So I can&#39;t speak of female one. <br><br>I only went there for a tea this time but they also have great food and bakery section. Maybe I will review them next time.",

"reviewcomment":"I&#39;ve always been a fan of The Breakfast Club. <br>Big portions, decent prices, and tasty food. Only caveat is to avoid peak hours because of loooonnnggg lines (no reservations, unless weekdays after 6pm). <br><br>The Soho location is the smallest of the other Breakfast Clubs. The menu is smaller, eg) they only offer the Moroccan Chicken Salad (£8.50), and not the other 3 that you see on the online menu (Waldorf&#39;ish Salad, Mardi Gras Salad, Rocket &amp; Parmesan). <br><br>I was in the mood for healthy, so was impressed with the Moroccan Chicken Salad. Portion was good and got full. It was fresh and not overly done with the tzatziki. The grilled red and yellow peppers gave the salad an extra meaty touch and flavor. <br><br>Also, ordered the When Haloumi Met Salad Wrap (£8.30). It was delic. Came with a side of coleslaw and some lamb&#39;s lettuce. If you&#39;re not a fan of coleslaw, cancel it out. The mayo was oozing about and I didn&#39;t like it. The wrap was tasty- the balsamic reduction was on point and added good flavor. You can also request to make the wraps into a salad version. Next time I will probably do this because the balsamic would be a good dressing. <br><br>The juice maker was broken during my visit, so was a bummer. Hopefully they&#39;ve fixed it by now. <br><br>It&#39;s BYOB after 6pm at this location.",

If you&#39;re in a hurry, this is not the place for you. <br><br>Food wise it is greasy as all other reviews say, to the point where you are given a kitchen towel roll to wipe your hands and arms as the grease goes everywhere. <br>My personal favourite was the Bingo Wings, and I would be happy to go there just to have those wings again. They are a must to try!<br><br>It&#39;s not as expensive as you think it would be, with the burgers ranging from £6.50 - £9, and they are filling.<br><br>All in all it is a nice experience with friends, but you need to have extra time on your hands, and be ready for some greasy hands as well.",

"reviewcomment":"Loved everything about this pub - it&#39;s one of the oldest pubs in London, which made the experience even better. <br><br>Located on Fleet Street, keep your eyes peeled when looking for this place. It&#39;s tucked away in an alley and can be easily missed. We walked right past the alley a few times before finally finding it. <br><br>There are three levels, you have to take a flight of really tricky stairs to go to each. You literally have to hunch down to get through - I hit my head going back up when we were leaving, so be extra careful. <br><br>We went down to the 2nd level and found some seats. The place is really charming. Loved the ambiance - it&#39;s dark and candle-lit, but still very lively. Definitely felt historic. As we sat down, there was a huge group of Brits trickling in for what seemed like a family reunion; they were having an awesome time. It kind of felt like we were watching a British movie, haha! <br><br>You seat yourself and to grab drinks and food, you have to go down to the basement level, which was my absolute favorite. Sadly, it was way too packed, so we couldn&#39;t find a seat down there. <br><br>Their fish &amp; chips were DELICIOUS! Just what I had been searching for. Definitely the best I had during my trip and believe me, I tried it at several popular places.",

What more could you want?<br><br>OK, there isn&#39;t a huge beer selection, so don&#39;t come expecting a wide variety. You&#39;ll most likely be choosing from the usual Fuller&#39;s choices. Still, it has to be better than Greene King!<br><br>As far as the food goes, you probably know not to expect your general pub grub since it serves Thai. It&#39;s not very upscale food, to be honest, but it&#39;s pretty good value for money (and quick!). So if you&#39;re ever fancying a quick, budget Thai, this is a great choice.<br><br>You&#39;ll probably want to make reservations for food, or go extremely early and try to eat fast so they can fit in those who have made reservations. I have had the Pad Thai and the Pad Kee Mau. The former has pretty good flavour for the cost, and the latter nearly brought me to tears. That&#39;s a great thing when you&#39;re looking for spicy food!<br><br>The other thing I like about this place is the atmosphere and the interior. It&#39;s kinda crazy with all the hanging plants and the collection of figurines spread out all over the pub. But it&#39;s entertaining and not at all boring to look around in.<br><br>So do try The Churchill Arms out, not for high-end pub grub, but for a casual outing that just needs good, comfort Thai food and pints of beer.",

"reviewcomment":"I promised my wife that I wouldn&#39;t make our long-awaited UK vacation all about barbecue. When we discovered that world-renowned chef Gordon Ramsay had &#39;que on the menu at one of his London restaurants, she was kind enough to give me a hall pass for the day. I knew Gordon wouldn&#39;t be preparing my food himself, but I was still eager to sample the barbecue that his restaurant churns out.<br><br>A swarm of about eight staff members showed up to attend to us as soon as we opened the door. They took our coats and umbrellas, got our reservation, and seated us in their plush lounge area for cocktails while we waited. The ambiance and decor at Maze Grill were both very inviting. Their spacious, modern dining room was classy and trendy without being overwhelming or pretentious.<br><br>As anxious as I was to eat Chef Ramsay&#39;s interpretation of barbecue, I couldn&#39;t help trying out an appetizer first. We decided to sample the Chilli and Garlic Prawns, which come on grilled sourdough. The prawns were a little smaller than I was expecting, but were very tasty nonetheless. They definitely had some heat from the chili peppers, as well as a great sweet flavor. I also liked the bite from the garlic.<br><br>Not only do they tell you about the different steak options available at Maze, they show you the actual steaks and describe the flavors and marbling in full glorious detail. I guess steak is more of a luxury in the UK, because their selections included a 12oz Wagyu ribeye for £130.00 (roughly $218.00). In Texas, I could probably buy a BBQ pit, a bag of charcoal, and four Angus ribeyes for the same price or less. I just stuck with my pre-planned entree selection and ordered the Smoked BBQ Pork Ribs, which also come with Chilli Pickled Cabbage. Since I didn&#39;t plan on more than a small tasting of the pickled cabbage, I also added a side of Mac &amp; Cheese for good measure.<br><br>Their pickled cabbage seemed like the Brittish version of coleslaw, neither of which typically agrees with my tastebuds. The cabbage was piled on top of the slab of ribs, so it came with its share of barbecue sauce. I found a nice crunch, as well as a pleasant acidic sweetness. The mac and cheese was delightfully creamy, and the crunchy topping added a good texture change. There was a good blend of cheeses, though I&#39;m not sure what they were.<br><br>I assumed from the outset that my pork ribs would be baby backs, but these were larger than anticipated. There was a thick layer of sauce slathered on top, so that was sure to be the dominant flavor. The sweet barbecue sauce was ok, but I think some molasses would have made it better. The rib meat was very tender. I couldn&#39;t really taste any smoke, probably due to the sauce. I&#39;m not completely opposed to barbecue sauce, but I&#39;d rather see the meat shine on its own. That being said, the ribs were still pretty tasty.<br><br>There were a lot of great options for dessert, but we settled on their interestingly-named Knickerbocker Glory. I tried to listen to the description, but through our waiter&#39;s thick Hungarian accent, all I caught was &#34;meringue,&#34; &#34;salted caramel ice cream,&#34; and &#34;raspberry&#34;. Good enough for me. This was by far one of the best desserts I&#39;ve ever had. It was very complex: crunchy, nutty, creamy, chewy, sweet, salty, fruity, acidic, and chocolatey all at the same time. There were so many different flavors and textures going on, but they all somehow tied together perfectly.<br><br>At the conclusion of our meal, the manager came over and invited my wife and I into the back to see how a real Gordon Ramsay kitchen operates. The sweltering heat gave me much more of an appreciation for the work these guys do. It was really kind of them to give us a quick mini-tour, and it made the experience all the more memorable. If I&#39;d ordered a steak instead of ribs, I&#39;m sure that Maze Grill would have been a five-star meal across the board. Regardless, it was really fun trying out some barbecue from across the pond.",

We started a bottle of wine while standing and waiting.<br><br>Service and food were incredible, and prices were very reasonable (100 pounds for 2 people, including wine).<br>We had the Octopus with Capers, Milk Fed Lamb (it was brain this night), chips (french fries, Fillet of Beef<br>2 specials we tried were the fish (Sole) and the duck breast. The fish was salty and had a buttery consistency; it was my favourite dish. <br><br>This was one of the best meals I&#39;ve had in London, and I didn&#39;t leave feeling overly stuffed, but just right.  The service was also excellent.",

"reviewcomment":"I have to admit that I wasn&#39;t thrilled to go to a vegetarian restaurant, but one of our friends had requested Mildreds and so we went with it.  To my surprise, Mildreds was really good!<br><br>Food: We ordered the Mexican platter and panfried halloumi to share for appetisers.  For entrees we ordered the detox salad with goat cheese, the burrito and two jack burgers with fries.  I ordered the burrito which was super delicious and I highly recommend it!<br><br>Drinks: We ordered four bellinis and two fresh juices.<br><br>Price: For four people we paid 102.77 GBP.<br><br>Ambiance: The restaurant is busy on the weekends so be ready to wait.  It&#39;s loud and the seating is tight.  Note: The bar doesn&#39;t serve anything but bread and olives so you can&#39;t order apps while waiting.  The restaurant seems popular with younger people.  There was a large group of young people next to us who were incredibly loud and obnoxious. Even though we were only a group of four it was very hard to hear what we were saying even though we were sitting next to each other.  <br><br>Service: The service was ok.  The hostess and the server weren&#39;t the most friendly.  <br><br>Would I go back?  Yes, but I would go early to have a pleasant dinner and not have to deal with the noise level because the food is actually very good and is the saving grace of this restaurant.",

No, seriously, the glasses are made of ice.<br><br>The people I met here while inside are like those I would meet at a regular club. But its mostly toward tourists (like me) and it was fun.

"reviewcomment":"Recommended by a coworker, this was my first meal in London and by far the most memorable. <br><br>We came around 5:30 for the Express Menu - 23 GBP for 2 dishes or 26 for 3. <br>Started off with the Caesar Salad, which was nice and different &#39;cause it was the whole leaf. But WHY didn&#39;t I order the Bone Marrow which was simply mind blowing. Luckily our friend let us try a bite. It was my first time eating bone marrow and it was DELICIOUS. The caramelized onions on top paired with the mushy bone marrow - perfect combination that reminds me of French onion soup. Even better eaten on top of the crispy toast, which is slightly burnt and buttery. The presentation was also nice - a large portion sliced lengthwise instead of in chunks which imo looks much less appetizing. <br><br>For the main, we all got the rib eye. Sauces are extra so my plate was literally just a piece of meat. It was very tender. For the side, I got the chips - thick cut, crispy outside, fluffy inside and slightly salty - Yum! But even better was the Beef Dripping Potatoes , which is potato chunks, crispy outside, fluffy inside. The ketchup also tastes good with a slight Worchershire sauce flavor. <br><br>I was too full for dessert but I did try a bite of the Sticky Toffee Pudding which was heavenly! Also my first time trying; I had always imagined it to be super sweet and caramel-y, but the texture was more like a warm lava cake, moist but not too dense, with just the right amount of toffee/caramel flavor.<br><br>The bone marrow and sticky toffee pudding were so good that we had to return for lunch a few days after to eat it again (and that&#39;s saying a lot, with the limited time in London and the abundance of good food choices!)<br><br>This time, we tried the Burger (cooked medium rare, with blue cheese. very big portion) and the Whole Sea Bream - very nicely cooked. <br><br>The sides were Buttered Greens (yum! Sprout Tops -more of a thicker leaf), baked sweet potato, and beef dripping potatoes again. <br><br>Highly recommend this restaurant!",

"reviewcomment":"Ever since hubs saw the menu and found out there was eel with black bean sauce on the menu he was sold. This was the first sit down restaurant that we headed to in London. <br><br>We went here for dinner around 8pm on a Saturday evening and were seated on the basement (may be called the ground floor) and service was prompt and efficient. We ordered the eel, hot pot with tofu and Singapore style thick rice noodles. Hubs loved the eel since this is not something we have in the USA or at least in Michigan and ate all but two pieces. The tofu hot pot had fish tofu as well as the regular braised tofu. As is typical with everywhere but the US, the hot pot was smaller than what I was expecting but tasted on par with the average hot pot. Lastly, the Singapore thick noodles were pretty tasty, but I found the curry flavor be not as strong as it&#39;s done in the states. The flavor was still good and contained mini shrimps, BBQ pork, onions, and sprouts. <br><br>Given the price of around 25£, it&#39;s a great place to grab a reasonably priced, some may even say cheap eat when you are looking for a Chinese fix in London.",

"reviewcomment":"Excellent food, as you&#39;d come to expect from any Nobu establishment. All the usual favorites are here, including new-style sashimi, crispy rice with sushi, miso black cod, and creamy spicy shrimp. Although not very authentic, all our dishes were fresh and delicious, and presented excellently as well. <br><br>Service is decently friendly, if a bit unorganized at times (probably due to the fact that you don&#39;t have a dedicated server) - we asked to keep a menu for perusing main courses after ordering some appetizers, only to have it whisked away by a passing waiter. Waters were refilled frequently, and new cups of green teas were brought out as soon as the previous ones were finished. <br><br>Decor leans towards the modern; lots of wood and decent lighting. I do wish they would eliminate the irasshaimase that all the staff shout out at arriving guests - it gets annoying pretty quick, and they all botch the pronunciation anyways.",

The whole atmosphere of the restaurant was great. <br>Food was served very nicely, too. I would recommend this place to  smaller groups, and probably not children. Portion was great.<br>We ordered the daily soup, pumpkin gnocchi, and foie gras. OH THE FOIE GRAS was amazzziiiinggggg! <br>Service was alright. The place seemed a little busy, but we were offered what we needed. <br>Decor was really nice too. Especially the lamps on the second floor. The lightbulbs had wings attached to them, which was really cute.<br>After dinner, we were able to walk around and take nice pictures of the river and the view. Good dinner.",

"reviewcomment":"We had friends who recommended this restaurant to us, so my wife and I booked it as our classy dinner for our week in London. The staff was professional from the start. While there were lots of staff, everyone seemed to stay busy but relaxed, working well together. The room is well-lit with large windows that look out on Hyde park. We had noon reservations and were seated immediately. We both did the set lunch menu, which has 2 options for each course. I ordered the first option of each course and my wife ordered the second options, which meant that we could share and each try both. <br><br>All our dishes were interesting and well executed. A memorable point was the octopus in our salad; it was very tender and appeared to be thin cross sections of bundles of octopus. The quail and pollock were flavorful.<br><br>I felt that the set lunch menu and experience was a good value for the price.",

"reviewcomment":"This restaurant is a self service where you order the food at different counters and they cook is fresh in front of you, this place can be quick once you get served otherwise it&#39;s just the queuing that takes the time. The actual serving of the food is quick.. You order the base of a dish and then can choose your choice of pasta ..For seating is fight for the first place haha it&#39;s ok in the quiet times but avoid during rush peak times..<br><br>The atmosphere is very loud though so not great for a first date..again this is when it is busy the rest of the times it can be quiet..<br>They don&#39;t rush you out of the place which is a bonus once you find your perch.. <br><br>Food is flavoursome and portions are filling I usually order the Chilli Chicken with my choice of pasta, it&#39;s not too spicy and I usually have to add extra chilli oil from the table.. The portion is filling..<br><br>They also have a self serving salad bar and pizza selection.<br><br>The drinks options are sodas behind the food counters but they have a full bar selection at a different counter.. <br><br>Average price of pasta dish £6-11<br>Depends on your budget but you&#39;ll find a meal ;)",

"reviewcomment":"Wow! Now this is more like it! A dimly lit, modern yet warm space, set back from the road. When I was there, Portishead and Massive Attack were providing a sultry, moody soundtrack. Who would have thought a coffee house could make a great location for a 2nd or 3rd date? We haven&#39;t even got to the food, drink or service yet.<br><br>The coffee is certainly impressive. I was a fan of Workshop&#39;s coffee before I came here so the top quality of the Columbian aeropress filter I went for didn&#39;t surprise me. What did surprise me was the price: £4 may still seem high to Aeropress sceptics, but it&#39;s actually good value - nearby Prufrock charge between £4.50-£5 and the more distant Talkhouse Coffee £3.30-£4.  Service was friendly, and admirably quick, if perhaps a little gruff - they did seem a bit short-staffed. Being served a glass of tap water was a nice touch.<br><br>Another plus of this place for me was that it pioneers what I think should be a natural direction for top coffee houses - it sells craft beer too. Just two on the bar menu, it&#39;s true, from Camden and the Kernel, but still, it&#39;s a start, and a welcome way to break up one&#39;s caffeine intake during long stays. I didn&#39;t try the food, but the menu is comprehensive. The fact too that mere drinkers such as I were confined to the bar shows how seriously they take the food side of things.<br><br>Like most serious coffee houses it also sells coffee-making equipment for the enthusiast: Aeropresses, Hario V60s and such like as well as digital scales for weighing out those beans. They also have plenty of their coffee - beans and ground - for sale too.<br><br>One major downside for me was the stunning lack of wifi. That, plus the poor mobile reception inside made surfing near-impossible. I actually have to wonder whether that&#39;s a deliberate move to deter the low-spending, long-loitering student crowd. It is annoying but not quite enough to dislodge its 5 star status for me.",

"reviewcomment":"LOVED Hawksmoor in Spitalfields! <br><br>After hearing rave reviews from friends and colleagues about how fabulous the food is, and how it is &#34;so much better than Gaucho&#34; I decided I MUST get my @ss over to Hawksmoor. <br><br>I decided to make a reservation for Sunday lunch so I can kill two birds with one stone as I was long over-due a Sex and the City style girlie catchup with a close and dear girlfriend. Booked online the day before, so far so good (I was anticipating a full house, and was ready to hit my Plan B, but my fears were unfounded).<br><br>First things first: if you suffer from colour-blindness or myopia you might, just might, walk or drive past the restaurant, despite it being on the main road in full view. The facade is black, very understated, and not conspicuous at all (much to the frustration of my friend who sauntered past a couple of times!). This I like as I&#39;m of the school of &#34;let the food speak for itself&#34;, as opposed to the over-stylised eateries that serve inedible slop masquerading as &#34;food&#34;. <br><br>Coats are checked in at the door and I was swiftly escorted to my table. As I followed the maitre de (can&#39;t spell!), I could feel a warm fuzzy glow emanating through my body &#34;I really, really like this place!&#34;. The decor is warm, cosy, and with just the right sprinkling of trendy. The staff are welcoming, smiley, and attentive without being over-bearing. Oh, I almost forgot to mention - the staff are also very good-looking. In fact, for a split second, I did find myself wondering: where did they find such good-looking people? <br><br>Sorry I digress... Let&#39;s get onto the food!<br><br>So my friend finally turns up and we promptly ordered the beef roast dinner and a side of macaroni cheese. The beef can be ordered medium or well done. We both ordered well done. The food arrives and my taste buds were literally doing summersaults in my mouth upon first sight of the roast! It looked awesome! And about as perfect as a roast dinner can be. The Yorkshire pudding was about the size of a human head, with just the right amount of roasties nestled within it. The beef was perfectly done, a whole slab of beef, cooked individually as opposed to shavings from joint. I did have moments of doubt, that I should have ordered the beef medium, but nope, it was delicious as it is. <br><br>In summary, this is about as perfect a roast lunch can be. Only a couple of things which could make it even better: replace the green veg with another veg (I couldn&#39;t work out what it was!) as it was far too bitter, and provide a larger jug of gravy as it was far too small and got cold quickly. Other than that, the perfect sunday lunch! :)",

"reviewcomment":"Very clean and contemporary dining area. Friendlfy staff.  <br>I had the dorset crab, avocado guacamole, peanut and Avion mango as a starter. Very light and delicious. <br>For my main I had the grilled piece of beef, Swiss chard, bonito butter, crispy shallots, and dauphinois. The beef was cooked to perfection. For dessert I had the chocolate soup with cardamon ice cream. Chocolate soup?! Of course you have to try that. I was very happy with all my dishes.<br>I thought the whole experience was delightful and I would definitely come again.",

Toppings were fresh and good, exterior crust was perfect but the rest of crust was too soft. Feel like they could crank their ovens a bit. Waiter was very nice to a solo diner",

"reviewcomment":"Last Saturday we went to Tokyo Diner. It was a great choice. We were also very lucky because we got seated right away, but immediately after us (around 7.30) people started to line up.<br><br>Tokyo Diner is all about one thing: great standard Japanese food. The setting of the restaurant is very basic and small (don&#39;t dress up for this). All staff is Japanese and very friendly &amp; humble. They refuse any tips because &#34;it&#39;s not part of the Japanese culture&#34; (their words). They don&#39;t sell Tuna because they believe in only serving sustainable food. As much as I love tuna, I can only truly admire this choice and position they take.<br><br>The food was really good. We didn&#39;t eat as much as we normally do at a Japanese place but had a fair amount of salmon sushi (really fresh), pork with curry (tasted like other ones I had before) and Udon noodles (almost the most recommendable dish of the menu! Only £8 for the noodles with chicken and better than any other trendy Udon place I&#39;ve been to in Soho).<br><br>Overall, all the prices are VERY reasonable (almost cheap) for such quality! It&#39;s about £2-3 for a beer for example. And the total bill (and in the end, we were full) was only £50 for several beers, glasses of wine, fresh sushi, pork, udon ... <br><br>I definitely go back when I&#39;m around in Chinatown!",

However I have heard tell tale of long lines and waiting, so I would recommend making a reservation if you can just in case. <br><br>I decided to get the French toast, while the other members of my party chose the Full English breakfast. They were all delicious. With each meal also comes a pot of tea (per person), as well as toast (white, wheat, or both). I chose the breakfast blend tea, and loved the flavor. It went very well with my toast. <br><br>The table setting is very nice, they give you the plates and cups with the Kensington Palace exclusive decorations on them. Table is white table cloth. If you sit at a table by the window, you can look outside and enjoy the view of the palace gardens as well. <br><br>Would highly recommend!",

Just heaven. <br><br>I tried a bit of my friend smokeshack and it was a solid burger but it&#39;s not wow worthy! <br>We also ordered two portions of crinkle cut chips which were lovely if a little on the small portion size and we&#39;re small asian girls, but we eat like elephants yeah? It&#39;s the world&#39;s paradoxes! <br><br>Topped it off with a shake because I wasn&#39;t really feeling concrete just yet! Black and white shake is amazing! I really want one now actually.<br><br>I find the seating quite haphazard, as in, it&#39;s not a service restaurant so I don&#39;t know why there are SO many servers. It&#39;s a bit too much happening. I mean, you supposed to order then pick an area you want to sit and then bring your buzzer to the table where they have two seaters who look for seats for you, that&#39;s their job I assume. And about 3 people are standing at the food collection point to give you ONE tray. They were lovely especially when there was a ketchup queue, and they would go around serving ketchup and mayo but overkill much?<br><br>PPS: I&#39;m writing this review on some shack glasses I asked very nicely for at the PR launch like way back.",

"reviewcomment":"Sometimes I hesitate to give a place like this more than 3 stars.  Feels like I&#39;m falling into a trap where cheap seafood meal deals override quality &amp; service.  I really hope not, but I&#39;ve been to this location twice, and once to their new location in Covent Garden, and have been pretty happy both times (though, I can&#39;t say I recommend the CG location!)<br><br>The atmosphere is slightly stuffy, and most of the time, the tables are so close to each other that your butt will knock over a few things as you try to squeeze your way out to the restroom. For food that cheap that gets pumped out routinely, I wasn&#39;t going to have high expectations.  But man, it was good, and I hope they do have a high rate of consistency, as our party was very happy both times! <br><br>The first time around, Cheryl &amp; I got the unlimited fried shrimp basket which came with tartar sauce, fries, coleslaw, and a margarita for £17.  I can&#39;t say much for the margarita - its a slush and comes out of a machine, and I didn&#39;t enjoy it very much, but its the standard drink that comes with most deals.  The deal is so cheap already, I&#39;ll happily pay for a different drink or milkshake from the menu. The popcorn shrimp was definitely hot, fresh and crispy! Loved the crunch of the shrimp, and it was so delicious!  Refills give you about 4 pieces, usually without fries unless you want more fries as well. We EACH got a side of mac n cheese (£3-4?).  All the mac n cheese sides I&#39;ve ordered are usually a tiny dish, and Cheryl &amp; I are pigs, we admit it - we can usually finish our own sides.  But holy cow, for that price, we each were given a large dish of mac! it was tasty, and more than generously sized! We hardly dented our sides, and had to take it home.  <br><br>Second time, I had the whole 1.5lb lobster (includes fries and marg) for £20.  It was my first whole lobster, and it was cooked really nicely! The flesh was nice and bouncy, not solid &amp; chewy at all! Clarified butter was good, and I did a number on the lobster licked clean every crack and crevice! Definitely great value and tasty for that price! Others were happy with their steak / rib dishes.  Cooked really well, and tender, fall off the bone meat for the ribs.  <br><br>Also, please be cautious of the amount of food you order! These dishes ARE big, so if you do need an appy or side, order 1 between 2 people (especially if you are here on an unlimited night),  If you usually pack up leftovers, then thats fine - but that comment was mainly directed at those who don&#39;t usually bother with leftovers.  I&#39;ve seen so much food wastage here because some people don&#39;t realise how large the dishes are!  <br><br>Anyway, I&#39;ve been happy both times, the quality was consistent, and I hope that if I come back here down the line, it&#39;ll continually be good!",

"reviewcomment":"The best Italian food I&#39;ve had in London.<br><br>There. I&#39;ve said it. <br><br>No, really. Can I give six stars? At least five and a half? Please?<br>I need to get all of this down now before (God forbid) I start forgetting things, and whilst still under the influence of a warm afterglow from having had truly spectacular food.<br><br>And the small/large plate distinction. Fanbloodytastic. In the end, 7 smaller dishes came to the same price as 3 large ones. And my God I was glad for the opportunity to try more of this amazing food.<br><br>My only disappointment, honestly, was that the best (main) dish of the day - the fried sage leaf with anchovies - was the first thing I tried. I think I made a face, contorted with such bliss, that must have made me look (even more of) a loony (than usual). Salty, crunchy, wonderfully balanced.<br><br>Milky, perfectly-fried balls of mozzarella were delightful. I&#39;ve not seen this level of skill much outside of Japan, to be perfectly honest - and the ingredients were just of the best possible quality.<br><br>A singular pasta dish - why, oh why, was there only one pasta dish - was exquisite - the orechiette as beloved by so many other Yelpers - and I&#39;m running out of superlatives here. Perfect pasta. I soaked up the rest of the wonderfully spicy and yet complex pasta sauce with a little of the remaining bread with completely undisguised glee.<br><br>A risotto was perhaps the only slight let-down. But then I&#39;ve never really been a fan of risotto so I must on this occasion defer judgement - the waitress suggested that today&#39;s rendition was slightly too cheesy and slightly too creamy - completely without prompting - and whilst I admire the honesty, that&#39;s a level of criticism that even I find too harsh.<br><br>Drinks.<br><br>I only had one - an Aperol Spritz. It was, by some distance, the best example of the drink I&#39;ve ever had - almost certainly due to the use of anything other than bargain-basement Prosecco. Beautiful and so refreshing on what was otherwise a glorious May weekend.<br><br>Dessert of profiteroles was as close to perfection as anything I&#39;ve ever had the pleasure of eating. The pastry very much played second fiddle to more than generous portions of tiramisu, gianduja and ricotta and cherry ice cream, the latter of which might just have been perfect. I&#39;m only really ashamed to admit that I only licked about half of the plate clean.<br><br>Service was cheeky, and all the better for it - always attentive, patient and unlike in some establishments of this calibre, not at all condescending. Incredible service in an Italian restaurant? Who&#39;da thunk it?<br><br>And all this for just over £30 per head with drinks and service. I&#39;m already desperate to go back.",

But, I was even more surprised when the waitress (very nice by the way), took us to the basement, in a very small room containing 6-8 tables, with nice music, and completely isolated from the ground floor.<br><br>We ordered:<br>05 Steamed Chicken Buns<br>71 Vegetable &#34;Sui Mai&#34; Dumplings<br>29 Honey Smoked Crispy Chicken<br>33 Beef Satay<br>78 Vegetable Goyza<br><br>The Honey Smoked Crispy Chicken was so good and we ordered some more after the first 2 plates. Honestly, at first it tastes like popcorn, and then you crunch in to it which releases the flavor of the chicken... it was just perfect. Big and Great surprise with this dish !<br>All the other dishes were really good, we got out of the restaurant really happy about dining there and already thinking about coming again.<br><br>Little undermining point: the three cocktails we ordered represented half the price of the entire bill. Advice: if you go there for dinner, order some beer ! Or go at happy hour, cocktails for £4.50 !",

Yes, it is intimate sort of but I loved playing around on the projector and watching the chef cook! And there&#39;s lots of games to okay with friends too! <br>The good was great, not a big portion for the price but that&#39;s expected with the type of restaurant it is. <br>Will definitely recommend and go again!",

"reviewcomment":"Summary:<br><br>+ Great weekend brunch/ breakfast at a trendy and casual café <br>+ That pretty much sums up all... <br><br>Overall: <br>I don&#39;t know what else I can possibly add to the super concise summary above not to mention milliards of reviews from dedicated and well-informed yelpers on this page. <br>Oh, did I say this place is great? I probably have...<br><br>The food at The Table Café is without a doubt of top quality among restaurants that serve brunch/ breakfast. It is also a very stylish café with modern wooden furniture and bare concrete that make this place look like a gallery of a modern artist. The large windows bring in a lot of natural light into the large open space. <br><br>The café serves famous brunch on Saturdays and Sundays. There is usually a queue outside but I have never waited for more than 5 minutes. Sometimes you have to share a long table with other people. (Majority of tables are long ones.) <br><br>I have tried eggs dishes, pancakes and waffles so far and I can tell you they are all good. Oh, the eggs. So soft and tender. Before the perfect hollandaise sauce I surrender. Wait, I just rhymed there! <br>It&#39;s so good that it makes me want to pull of some haiku although I have no idea how. <br><br>My only trouble is that the portion is not so big here. And I eat a lot. So sometimes I have to get an egg dish AND a pancake (or a waffle) to fill me up. <br><br>I have also been here for a party of a friend (the café also does event hire) and the food there was lovely too. I haven&#39;t had lunch or dinner but I&#39;m sure they are good too.",

"reviewcomment":"I went here a couple of weeks ago while on vacation with my girlfriend. This restaurant was absolutely amazing. Probably some of the best food I have ever had. The staff was incredibly friendly and attentive. They always made sure we had what we needed and were constantly refilling our drinks right when we needed them refilled. They knew what to do before I even knew. I was also really nervous as I had never eaten a 3 michelin star restaurant so I didn&#39;t want to accidentally do something wrong.<br><br>Anyway, I ordered off the lunch menu and got the globe artichoke, rabbit loin, and vanilla parfait. The globe artichoke was probably the best appetizer I have ever had in my life. It was so delicious. Just absolutely amazing. The rabbit loin I had after was also absolutely delicious in every way. One of the best entrees ever.  Cooked perfectly and absolutely amazing in every way.<br><br>Then the dessert came and that was OUTSTANDING. Probably the best dessert I have ever had. They poured frozen olive oil on it and I just couldn&#39;t believe how good the vanilla parfait was. It was hard for me to believe, even now, that a vanilla parfait could be that good. <br><br>They also had a chicken mousse soup starter and these white chocolate balls with some squares for dessert. All of it was amazing. And for a fancy restaurant the food was actually quite filling. We also were here for a while but it didn&#39;t feel like that long as there was always food on my plate or there was about to be food on my plate.<br><br>I highly recommend if you can get a reservation to go here. Great restaurant!",

I now come here all the time with my boyfriend when we need a snack break from studying because the pizzas are delicious and filling. We usually have to split the pizza because it&#39;s so large.<br><br>I&#39;ve been here several times now and each time the pizza is always amazing. I 100% recommend this place especially for students looking for a good cheap place to eat.",

"reviewcomment":"When I came in on a Friday evening to find the place almost empty, I had some concerns. It&#39;s never a good sign when a restaurant is empty on a Friday night. I&#39;m still unsure as to why there was barely anyone here for dinner, because the food was great. I had the horseradish bashed potatoes (slightly textured, not buttery smooth like the mashed) and the pie of the day which was a lamb pot pie. The potatoes were delicious and the pie was amazing. Flaky crust with perfectly cooked lamb inside. The sausage of the day was a wild boar apple sausage, and that was really good as well. <br><br>Definitely worth a try if you&#39;re in the area.

"reviewcomment":"We went with 2 friends for lunch on a Sunday and it&#39;s the best value set menu I&#39;ve seen in London! For £45, you get 3 courses, an amuse-bouche and the tastiest bacon and cheese brioche rolls ever! Ok, to be fair, there were other roll choices but that one was stunning. They were lovely too, and kept coming back with them. I think I *may* have had four .... We didn&#39;t opt for the tasting menu this time but from what we saw on your neighbour&#39;s table, it&#39;s worth a trip back for.<br><br>It was quiet when we arrived it had just opened so there was a few minutes of quite-awkward when there were more staff than diners. That soon changed as every seat was filled and the place was buzzing, in a reserved way.<br><br>The service was impeccable, as was the sommelier. When we asked her to note down the bottle of wine we had, she came back with the label enclosed in a lovely envelope with a handwritten note. Definitely a nice touch. <br><br>All the food was fantastic, especially the brown sugar tart. For one of us, who wasn&#39;t a big fan of desserts, this went down like a charm. We also opted for the cheese selection which didn&#39;t disappoint. The plate catered to our tastes but we were also introduced to a few new cheeses. The Chinese water deer was also stunning and when we asked for more detail (specifically about the bone marrow), the servers were able to answer them all! <br><br>With only one sitting at lunch, we didn&#39;t feel rushed at all. I&#39;d definitely recommend The Ledbury as it can cater to a lower budget (but for a special occasion) or you can splash out too! It&#39;s not as stuffy as some other Michelin starred restaurants I&#39;ve been to but it was very professional and smooth.",

"reviewcomment":"Absolutely love this place. There can be long queues, especially at popular dinner and lunch times, but totally worth it. I&#39;ve tried both the burger and lobster roll, and have never been disappointed. The lobster roll is packed with lobster meat and served on a delicious buttered brioche roll (yes, that bun alone might be a heart attack, but lipsmacking good i say!). The burger almost seems expensive at 20 pounds compared to the lobster and lobster roll, which are all offered at the same price, but definitely one of the great burgers of London.<br><br>This restaurant has been expanding around London, but I&#39;ve only been to the Mayfair and Soho locations which are very different in terms of ambience (same amazing level of food). The Mayfair location is smaller and feels more intimate while the Soho location has more tables and feels more modern. These locations have different perks but you really can&#39;t go wrong when burger or lobster is involved!",

After exclusively having their pho for about two years now, I finally decided to switch it up and what a treat it was!<br><br>We ordered the piggy aubergine (so soft it melts in your mouth &amp; it definitely had that great caramel quality you get with Japanese miso aubergine. Maybe a little too sweet, but still yummy!)<br><br>The salt and pepper squid was also stunning. Light, crispy skin and cooked to perfection - so tender and not a hint of chewiness. The spring onion, garlic and chili stir fry it comes with, ah that will blow you away! I don&#39;t know what makes it taste so good (MSG? Oops) but it is so fragrant!!! I really wanted more :(<br><br>We also had the mango sea bass and it was almost like a mix of both. Fish cooked really well, crispy on the outside but firm and juicy on the inside. With sliced mangoes and a similarly sweet sauce (again, really very very sweet).<br><br>The two of us shared all that and a bowl of egg fried rice (definitely a sharing portion), and we left having spent about £15 each, feeling pretty darn satisfied.

"reviewcomment":"One year ago today, my husband and I dined at Barbecoa on our first night after moving to London.  Since then, we have taken a number of friends and family visiting, and it will forever be one of our favorites in the city as we move back to the States.  <br><br>The view of St Paul&#39;s is gorgeous (after dinner, take the elevator in One New Change to the rooftop for more amazing views).  The service is of the standard that Americans are more used to.  The steak is perfect - we aren&#39;t fans of British beef, but Jamie does it right.  The servers will take as much time as necessary to assist with the menu.  The wine list is commendable, as well as the cocktail list - so many to try!  <br><br>I highly recommend it for tourists who want a good meal with a view, or for a nice dinner date, or for a farewell meal after a great year living in the UK!",

Unfortunately a dental affliction meant I was limited to the softer side of the food pyramid so I decided not to blow massive cash on food I couldn&#39;t chew properly and went with soft, safe, Italian.<br><br>There was a bit of a wait (30 minutes), and not a lot of room at the bar, but it wasn&#39;t altogether unexpected on a Friday night so no big deal. We got taken downstairs to basically the perfect table - corner booths for the win!<br><br>We ordered the meat board for two as a starter, carbonara and lasagna for the mains. Everything was tasty, looked great on the plate and considering how busy the restaurant was, the service was fast too. It wasn&#39;t the best carbonara I&#39;ve ever had, but the lasagna was amazing.<br><br>I wish I could say that I got dessert as well, but I thought the menu was a bit boring so gave it a miss.",

"reviewcomment":"I&#39;ve been on a search for good pho in London for a while and so far, Song Que ranks high up there for me. Don&#39;t get me wrong, the search continues, but I&#39;m always happy to come here. <br><br>It&#39;s always busy, and don&#39;t be surprised if they seat you right next to another family or better yet, a couple on an awkward first date. This happened to me last night and it was very endearing basically sitting in on their date but also a bit awkward. All part of the experience!<br><br>I opted for #135 which is the pho with rare beef, tendon and tripe. I most often get the &#34;special&#34; which at Song Que, I&#39;ve determined this pho to be. The portion is generous, and cheaper than the green pho place across the road (can&#39;t remember its name!) The spring rolls are consistent and tasty. I haven&#39;t tried anything else, simply because these are my go-to Vietnamese items. I did go with a vegetarian once and she was in love with the bun noodles and found no issues with finding tasty things on the menu.<br><br>If you are confused about which place to pick on Kingsland road for a good pho place, Song Que is a good bet!",

"reviewcomment":"We came here yesterday for lunch. We actually were planning on settling for a burger and some Belgian beers at the Dovetail around the corner, but apparently that place is closed on Sundays. <br><br>But we were not disappointed and actually delighted we arrived at The Modern Pantry. After a 20 minute wait we got our table on the second floor. The restaurant is hosted in an old house they completely refurnished in a more modern style. Think this place is equally good for either a date, a family lunch or catching up with friends. <br><br>I had the lunch option of 2 poached eggs with toast and grilled merguez sausages. This was really good. The sausage was spicy, eggs were perfectly done and the additional tomatoes, fritters and toast made this dish big enough to go for lunch. I had a Vienna lager to go with it, recommended to me by the waiter. <br><br>In total, the bill was about £15 each which was a very good price for the value we got in return.",

"reviewcomment":"Probably the best Mexican meal that I&#39;ve had in London. And not just because of the small free Margherita offer I found on a social networking site just after we arrived!<br><br>The Flautas were very tasty. They actually were not quite as good as the ones I enjoyed in the States, but they were still delicious and grew on me as I went on.<br><br>My main course was Enchiladas rojas....at least it should have been. I had chosen the rojas because my starter and the chips they warm you up with both came with the verde sauce. But my main found it easier being green all the same and because I&#39;m a Brit I just ate it anyway. And it was very good. The rice was kinda plain but the dish as a whole was very very tasty so the order error was quickly mostly forgiven.<br><br>Classy place with a nice relaxed vibe to it. There did seem to be a guy who had been stood up on the table next to us though. Que Incomodo!!!",

"reviewcomment":"It is the best fish &amp; chips I had. Mind that the place is separated between take away (cheap!!) and dining in (not that cheap). <br><br>I had plaice in egg matzo coating. It was basically fried in batter, but it was light, crispy and not oily at all. The batter puffs up so it looks like your portion of fish is HUGE, but it&#39;s not, the regular portion is just big enough to satisfy a standard hunger. Side spinach, coleslaw and pickled onion were all good. They also serve everything with ketchup bowl and tartar sauce bowl - free of charge.<br><br>The service was friendly and very attentive (it helped that we were the only people in the restaurant! - it was their first opening on a Sunday). I liked the ambiance of the place - very cozy, wooden furniture, dark red seating - good space.<br><br>I just wish it was a tad bit cheaper - it&#39;s twice/thrice more expensive comparing to its sister take-out next door.",

My friend usually has the porridge, which she says is really good. I, on the other hand, prefer something a bit more substantial for breakfast and alternate between the full english (Full Borough I think they call it) and the &#39;to-die-for&#39; caramelised bananas with french bread and bacon. Simply perfect.<br><br>The dinner and lunch services are very good too, quintessential British food at its finest. Their steaks are really good, and they cook all the food very well. The waiting staff are very polite and helpful, happy to accommodate any needs. What I would say is that if you have a vegetarian with you, this might not be the best place to go as it is very meat-orientated.<br><br>N.B.: When calling to make a reservation, ask for a window seat. That way you can enjoy your meal looking out across St Paul&#39;s Cathedral and the amazing views of London.",

You really shouldn&#39;t expect to get the classic pizza taste and texture, but you need to give credit where it&#39;s due: Otto makes delicious cornmeal base pizza.<br><br>2. Great menu. I love it when restaurants get the right mix of keeping delicious classics on the menu while also changing things up every once in a while. Otto not only does daily specials, it also changes its menu from season to season.<br><br>3. Amazing staff. The staff are friendly, laidback and very helpful in explaining how to think about your order.<br><br>4. The toppings are extremely generous. When you order artichokes, it&#39;s not just a sprinkling of them or just 1 artichoke heart per slice. They really lump those things on to complement the thickness of the cornmeal base.<br><br>NOTE TO VEGETARIANS: They will cook your pizzas with others&#39; in the same party. Do make sure that you ask for the slices to be cooked separately, or to be separated by your friends&#39; veg option so you don&#39;t get stray pepperoni slices on your order.",

It&#39;s not the place!<br><br>Speaking about the food, the quality of it is really high: dim sum are great, with several different fillings and everyone with its characteristic taste and smell, delicious! strongly suggested the black ones (called black prawn dumplings), with squid ink pastry, and the chicken shu mai, chicken and asparagus in a top opened dumpling. But, just take some of them, portions are not that big (from 2 to 4 dumplings each) and it&#39;s just so good to share everything with your table!<br><br>Don&#39;t forget to have a cocktail or something to drink, this place has a lot of different options you rarely see and their presentation is always special (as example, take the hybiscus spritz: awesome!)<br><br>I still have to try the upper floor, with tables surrounding the kitchen, but I can&#39;t say anything bad about this place, this is just great! ah and it&#39;s not that expensive!",

It was a magical 7 course tasting menu, I still dream of the yuzu truffle oil dressing they used to drench the super high quality sashimi.

"reviewcomment":"Once upon a time there was a student studying for hours in Senate House Library. It became very late and she became very hungry, suddenly craving Japanese food for dinner. Using her trusty Yelp app she found a place called &#34;Misato&#34; that was not very far so she walked to Chinatown to go eat there. And the rest is history. <br><br>Seriously tasty food and shockingly inexpensive! The katsu curry is absolutely perfect in portion and flavour, very authentic (even the little salad that comes with it!). I could literally rave about the breading on the pork cutlet for days. I was so hungry when I got here but I left extremely full and satisfied. <br><br>I also ordered cucumber maki sushi as a side and that was also wonderful. 6 pieces for only £2.50! I would come back here just for the sushi alone.<br><br>Came here after the dinner rush so there was no queue and got a seat immediately. Despite the dinner rush being over all the tables were full so it took a little bit of time for the food to finally arrive. Also, I&#39;m pretty sure I saw a sign that said cash only so bare that in mind! <br><br>This is now my &#34;go-to&#34; place in London for Japanese food. Especially considering the hit or miss of the surrounding places in Chinatown, you can&#39;t beat the prices or the quality of Misato.",

"reviewcomment":"This is my new favorite place to eat in London! First of all it boasts a very informal atmosphere with a great view, friendly staff and wonderful Music. <br><br>First of all (again ha ha) the food is delicious, healthy and affordable. <br>I had the medium plate and tried 3 items plus two salads, yummy!<br><br>To top it off they made me the best chai latte ever with oat milk, which I had never tried before ( they have every type of milk that exists, I find that pretty cool!) and the hazelnut ( vegan) cheese cake was excellent too, although at this point I couldn&#39;t finish it. But when I woke up the next morning I wished I had taken it with me!!! <br>I had stopped in to meet some friends ~ they ran late so I ate by myself, <br>it didn&#39;t in any way feel awkward, in fact everyone including the clientele, were smiling and kind and I had no problem getting wifi ( and I&#39;m from Canada with a locked phone) I found a nicer table before my friends arrived <br>And moved to it and we had wine, a bottle turned out to be a better deal than 3 glasses as the manager/ organizer serving it to me pointed out and it was reasonably priced organic wine! <br>The only reasons I give it 4 instead of 5 stars <br>Is that the seating can be tricky, its a busy place &amp; seating isn&#39;t  monitored and sometimes a single person occupies a whole large table, however you can always ask to join them.. Or stand there until something frees up.<br>In a way that&#39;s part of the charm too! So ok that&#39;s not quite why..<br>I felt that the person piled everything on top of each other on my food plate,  but that&#39;s kind of charming and homey too... <br>So that wasn&#39;t quite it either...<br>However the glass on the food counter wasn&#39;t very clean, someone may have been leaning on it and it was a bright sunny day..<br>But still on a classy -posh scale, it just doesn&#39;t quite add up to 5 stars. <br>Then again one isn&#39;t always in that kind of mood and considering the food tasted like it was actually prepared with love. I&#39;d go back in a heartbeat!<br>And I plan to!!!",

The whole thing was tasty. The Shitake Mushroom was plentiful, the pork was not too much where it overpowered. So tasty that I didn&#39;t need to add miso or chili sauce.  Oulong tea was proper.  Only issue is the space is tight and they are understaffed. <br><br>Oh one more thing that is absolutely charming.

"reviewcomment":"I simply love Bar Italia. It&#39;s one if these London institutions that one simply has to try out. In short: it&#39;s an Italian coffee bar that&#39;s open 24 hours. <br><br>It&#39;s not necessarily cozy in there with plush sofas and plenty of seating à la Starbucks. No, there&#39;s a counter with a giant espresso machine, a shelf displaying all kinds of snacks (think Portuguese custards, pannini sandwiches etc) and behind the counter there&#39;s a small army of Italian baristas (the non-hipster and genuine kind) who will serve you up your espresso drink in mere seconds. (This is also not a place where you should ask for complicated coffee concoctions à la Starbucks - keep it simple and real.)<br><br>Given that this is not a place to linger, I typically come here for a quick espresso before heading on to a next destination - whether it be the National Gallery, a musical or a bar nearby. In the summer though, you might be lucky and snatch one of the prime seats outside. That&#39;s actually quite fun, as you can watch and comment on the diverse Soho crowd parading by...",

"reviewcomment":"Great atmosphere, decor offset the tasty, but quite small dim sum.<br><br>This was my first time at Ping Pong. I planned to have a quick lunch armed with my newly registered Ping Pong Loyalty Card, Email for a free cocktail and booking for the Super 8 Menu. The Super 8 menu consisting of a chicken rice pot, tea of your choice, won-ton soup with dumplings, and 5 pre-selected dim sum pieces.<br><br>I opted to sit outside as it was a nice day. It was a little breezy, but every table has a heating element above it, meaning you&#39;re not left shivering in late September. I would imagine these would be ineffective when the weather drops below 15 degrees.<br><br>The staff were pleasant, but there seemed to be a lot of confusion around my cocktail voucher, and to be honest the waiter was clearly new and picking things up. First to arrive was my cocktail. This was a ginger passionfruit crushed ice cocktail. It wasn&#39;t very good. Next my complimentary prawn crackers with assortment of dips. Note: you&#39;ll need a ping pong loyalty card to get this, but it&#39;s free! These were okay. <br><br>The dim sum arrived shortly after, and I was left slightly puzzled. Normally when I dine chinese, I expect the soup to come first, followed by rice then everything else. I didn&#39;t know whether to pick at my tiny dim sum pieces or wait for the soup and rice pot to arrive...after 5 minutes I decide to tuck in. The dim sum was obviously made in house. Both the taste and shapes made it obvious. These weren&#39;t your run of the mill production line dim sum. But also left room for skimping on the size. The only one adequate size was the chicken/prawn one. The rest were far too small. If I was paying around £3-4 for 3 pieces I would most definitely be disappointed. However in the context of the deal and extras, it was more than filling. <br><br>As I polished off 2 of the 5 pieces, the Lychee Red Black scented tea arrived. The aroma was dazzling, and the taste wonderful. Full of flavour and silky smooth without any bitterness. Beautiful. Then finally the rice pot and won-ton soup came. The soup was strange. Tasted nothing like the wonton soup I&#39;m used to and was surprisingly sour. The wonton dumplings were great. Quite large and tasty. The rice pot was the highlight of the meal. The oyster based sauce full of flavour, and plenty of chicken and lots of chinese black mushroom (a delicacy). One of the best rice pots I&#39;ve ever had. The dipping sauces included chilli oil (all oil, no actual flakes :/), and chilli. The special sauces as a loyalty card holder included chilli black bean sauce (delish), sweet and sour and sesame hoi sin sauce. They were pleasant, but really only the chilli based ones worked with dim sum.<br><br>So in all, the decor of the place really impressed. Somebody really though about the experience visually. Unfortunately the food (in respect to the dim sum) is below average and the order dishes arrive is a little random. Two things that wouldn&#39;t take a lot of effort to improve. Otherwise it has all the small touches I appreciate. Unprotected wifi, loyalty card scheme, lovely interior, unique tea blends. Lets see the major food points fixed, and this place would be an easy 5 stars.",

"reviewcomment":"As American Expats, we tend to try restaurants that make a claim to serving American Burgers. We love everything from the West Coast CHAIN restaurants like IN-N-OUT, Five Guys, Dicks Seattle, Tommy&#39;s, Red Robin, Sonics, Thunderbird Diner, Bob&#39;s Burgers, Mother Fuddruckers, etc. As a reference point, Red Robin tends to be a 3 star (average) for us. <br><br>As for Byron, we were very pleased with the quality, taste and service. The facility itself is very simplistic and meets basic needs.  Tables were packed tightly to accommodate maximum seating. Decor was simplistic and nothing to rave about; however, the burgers were very good... and let&#39;s face it, we cared more about the actual food than the restaurant decor. Menu was simple... No major theme burgers at all.  I had the cheeseburger with blue cheese with bacon... and it was quite tasty and satisfying!!! I also ordered a side orders of onion rings, fries, and zucchini fries to share with our family of 5... The onion rings were great... Similar to onion rings at a County Fair.  Let&#39;s say that my entire family were very happy with their food. They felt that it was a &#34;taste of America&#34;, which is high praise considering we have been living in England for 17 months and have been disappointed many times at many pubs! The slam dunk for my kids was the A&amp;W root beer and creme soda, which is usually not sold in UK  stores; hence its higher pricing, but I was glad to pay it for the satisfying grins on my kids&#39; faces.  Service was &#34;service with a smile&#34;! We will definitely visit Byron again next time we&#39;re in London!",

"reviewcomment":"Perhaps, like me, you are regretting not filling your tubes with more air and wish there was a coffee shop with delicious drinks and food where you could find a pump. Doubling as a bike shop, this amazing spot is exactly what you need. Been wanting to try them since they sold me a Kernel IPA by Waterloo Bridge last summer. Thanks to the second transit strike this year, I rode my bike home from work and, just as I was getting tired, passed by this urban oasis for cyclists. Could not have been better timed. Try their smoothies, shakes, pastries, coffee, or great beer while your bike gets serviced, or just to have a quick rest. Perhaps the most cycle-friendly cafe in town. <br><br>Maybe because it&#39;s such a nice day, I&#39;m having a hard time leaving the outside seating space, especially since I can keep an eye on my bike. However it is 6pm and a huge crowd is gathering, which is another good sign, I suppose. If places like these were more common, I&#39;d ditch my Oyster card immediately. Perhaps I will just so I can ride by it each afternoon. In any event, hoping to be back soon.",

"reviewcomment":"Remember the episode of Seinfeld - yes, I&#39;m dating myself - where they&#39;re waiting for a table in a Chinese restaurant...well, it&#39;s sort of like that. The restaurant is small with mostly 8 person round tables, so it&#39;s also jammed packed. They have all the BBQ&#39;d ducks in the front window and watching them debone a duck is amazing - I&#39;m talking 30 seconds start to finish with a huge cleaver. It&#39;s worth the price of admission. The food is also excellent, albeit with spotty service that requires you to be a bit more engaged in making things happen. Don&#39;t expect a friendly welcome and how do you do - it&#39;s all business with a &#39;you ready to order&#39;, but that&#39;s what makes it fun. Oh yeah, don&#39;t expect a quiet dinner for two - it&#39;s better for a larger group that&#39;s in the mood for fun. <br><br>As for recommendations, you can&#39;t come to a place that can filet an entire duck in seconds without having any. It&#39;s worth it. I also love the crispy pork belly and the spare ribs are great. I also enjoyed the bok choy and the hot and sour soup with a bit of English flair - peas and tiny shrimp. Overall, everything looks good here and I look forward to my next visit.",

"reviewcomment":"I almost always try the most basic ramen when I visit a new place, but this time I made an exception and went for one of my favorites, cold sesame ramen (Hiyashi Chuka). If you&#39;ve never had this before, and it&#39;s a hot summer day, you should definitely give it a chance. Save the hot soup for colder weather.<br><br>Noodles: Very good. Firm and cooked just right. Better than Bone Daddies IMO.<br><br>Hiyashi Chuka sauce/tare: A bit to much sweetness, but overall very good.<br><br>Tokyo egg: Perfectly cooked. However Bone Daddies tea smoked marinated egg is still one of the best I&#39;ve ever had anywhere. <br><br>Toppings: Menma (bamboo) not bad, needed  more crunch. Tomatoes were not the best - since they&#39;re in season now they could have been better. Charsu was a bit to dry, that&#39;s why most places use cooked ham typically (there  is no hot soup to soften the chasu). <br><br>Nit picking now: Needed a small dab of mustard on the side (pretty standard). And cucumbers should be added too - especially since you&#39;re making it in England where they love cucumber too.<br><br>Overall: A great bowl. In Tokyo I&#39;d give it a 3, but for London it&#39;s top notch.<br><br>Other stuff: Service was decent, but I find it really weird in London how so many servers don&#39;t seem to know squat about the food they&#39;re serving. Gyoza were good - and may have been made in house possibly (impressive).<br><br>I will return to try the basic tonkatsu ramen when the weather changes.",

It was like the place was made to be filled with hungry, selfish people  who would overfill their salad boxes and need more. The falafel is amazing and you can customise yours however you like; and that wouldn&#39;t be a problem for the staff behind the counter - they are quite handy and capable of making a beautiful spectacle out of this simple action. Also, the prices are as low as they can get!",

"reviewcomment":"Ciao Bella is the real deal.<br><br>You&#39;ll no doubt be squeezed into a table, elbow to elbow with your neighbours (because they seem to always be full unless you eat about 9.30pm) and your waiter will rush you along almost like he doesn&#39;t want you to be there. But don&#39;t be put off by that, don&#39;t rush, he&#39;ll come back once you&#39;re ready to order. It&#39;s almost an initiation test!<br><br>The food here is fantastic. Obviously fresh, super tasty and quite reasonably priced too. They&#39;ll give you some olives and cheese to nibble on whilst you decide what you want and they&#39;re a good omen - great olives and crumbly parmesan. Not at all bad for free.<br><br>Shared a couple of starters; some juicy bruschetta (seasoned perfectly) and 3 large sardines, which were grilled and the spines came away with ease - leaving no bones at all. Colour me very happy at this stage. For a main I went for a special - the rabbit with pappardelle - mostly because it&#39;s my favourite type of pasta. And it was huge. I think I had half a rabbit on my plate. My friend went for the seafood spaghetti and it&#39;s served in a brown bag and practically poured onto your plate at the table. Nice touch.<br><br>The wine list here is a weighty tome, so if you know your reds you&#39;re in for a treat.<br><br>Overall, great experience and would love to come back. It&#39;s not at all fancy, so you can dress as casual or as smart as you like. Try and grab an outside seat in the summer!",

"reviewcomment":"4 stars solely based on value rather than merely on food quality.<br><br>An absolute institution for students (particularly Asian ones), I used to frequent H&amp;T when at UCL. During peak meal times you can expect to queue for at least 20 minutes before getting a seat. Fortunately they do take-out, so if you&#39;re in a hurry you can just head inside and order at the cashier.<br><br>Food:<br><br>It&#39;s all pretty reliable. The sort of thing I&#39;d score at a 3-3.5. Their katsu curry is solid, likewise for their laksa. The char kuay teow deserves special mention imo because it&#39;s actually objectively good rather than just good for London.<br><br>Their sushi/sashimi is all decent. Similar price to atari-ya but marginally worse in quality. Basically don&#39;t come here just for that (go to atari-ya instead)<br><br>What makes H&amp;T stand out is the value. Mains are around 6-8 pounds each and the portions are obscenely large. I think the best representation of this is the fact that the tempura udon (~7 pounds) is quite a decent portion on its own at the price. But because it&#39;s comparatively smaller than the other dishes, for that price point you get some sushi on the side as well.<br><br>Bottom line - far from the best asian food you&#39;ll have but a combination of decent qualify, decent pricing, and massive portions make this incredibly good value for money.",

"reviewcomment":"Goodman is a legit steak house!<br><br>I&#39;d been wanting to go for ages, and when my parents came to town and offered to take us to dinner, I booked Goodman. The ambiance is upscale, and while I&#39;m sure they would prefer people to be dressed more smarty, it seems like it&#39;s a bit casual there as well. The servers were all incredibly friendly and always coming by to see if we were okay with drinks.<br><br>I needed a bit of a drink to calm down when I arrived so ordered the bartender&#39;s special, The Derby. Delicious (but strong) drink to start the meal. They&#39;re more than willing to bring the cuts of meat over to the table to show you what you&#39;ll be ordering. They have some regular cuts of steak on the menu, but they also have a few special cuts for the evening which are located on various chalkboards around the restaurant. They do both American corn-fed beef and European grass-fed beef. We opted for the grass-fed bone-in rib-eyes and a few sides.<br><br>I also had the seared foie gras starter. It was fantastic. The foie gras was really well seared and it was served with figs and truffle honey (I love truffle honey). The beef was really well cooked. Perfectly medium rare (as a rib eye needs to be to cook the fat) and they served with a variety of sauces. My favorite was the Bearnaise. Super duper delicious. The pepper sauce was really peppery. The only letdown was the Stilton wine sauce. Wasn&#39;t Stilton-y enough for me. We got steamed spinach (perfectly reasonable), beef dripping chips (awesome) and truffle mac and cheese (amazing) as sides. My parents got the chocolate tart dessert and it was oozing chocolate. We ordered the cheese and there were some pretty tasty cheeses there.<br><br>All in all, it&#39;s probably the best steak I&#39;ve had in London. Next time I have the hankering for an expensive steak dinner, Goodman will be at the top of my list!",

"reviewcomment":"It was a childhood dream to actually dine into the Rainforest cafe but sadly the high prices prevented that dream to ever come true then. But because of my boyfriend, he helped me recover that lost dream and took me there. At first it was just a place I wanted to eat for fun and my food expectation were actually very low knowing it was tourist place. <br><br>When it came to decor and atmosphere I was completely wowed. The whole place was recreated into a tropical forest with great attention to detail too. There was even a dome with a view of the starry night sky, a fish tank with tropical fishes, moving gorillas making sounds every now and then and elephants that flapped their ears. Although I understand it is not for everyone I really enjoyed the sound effects such as the sound of thunder. It brought our meal to life and opened up our other senses.<br><br>As romantic the place looked with dangling plants and flowers, dim lighting it is not a place for a first date or a very romantic dinner due to the amount of lively excited children running round. It didn&#39;t bother us though and we felt part of something bigger when all the staff stood up to sing happy birthday with a volcanic cake for their birthdays. <br><br>The menu had most of the classic American dishes and we decided to start our meal off with buffalo chicken wings. I was very surprised at the quality of these wings. As synthetic the sauce was they  tasted fine and kind of how we expected them to be, they were also very well fried, plump and meaty with a lovely crispy skin on top. They were very mild and tasted even better dipped into the creamy light  blue cheese sauce that came with it.<br><br>For mains I gambled with the pork baby back ribs. The reason I said so is because I&#39;ve had many where it is just drenched in a sickly sauce and cooked so much it loses all its natural flavours and texture but I actually really enjoyed these. Although there wasn&#39;t much heat the cajun spices flavoured the meat really well, giving different notes of flavour by the paprika, garlic and pepper. The BBQ sauce was nice and light and only to cover the meat and added a good gentle sweetness to it. It was tender and packed full of its juices and yet still had a good meaty texture to it. <br><br>For the side I chose a baked potato with sour cream and chive and it came in generous size. The flesh was fluffy and soft and creamed well with the sour cream. It also came with a corn on the cob and slices of watermelon which felt out of place. They were both pretty bland but probably because they were not in season.<br><br>My boyfriend went for the Primal Steak and that is where we felt the quality go down. The steak was tough and chewy even when it came medium rare as requested. For the price it was a huge disappointment. Chips were very average but it wasn&#39;t like ketchup couldn&#39;t save them. I was happy I chose the ribs. <br><br>Overall it was a great experience and I still agree it&#39;s a place you go more for the decor and than the food as for the same price there are many places that does it better. However it is also a place I wish everyone could go at least once if you&#39;re into themed restaurant as it is worth experiencing just once. It definitely brings out the child inside of you. <br><br>Service was great, greeted at the door with a &#39;passport&#39; with your name where you hand over to the staff downstairs to get your entry. It&#39;s like you&#39;re really leaving London...haha! Food came relatively quick and all done with a smile. Definitely a place I plan to return to.",

Main course was a tempura creation topped with sliced papaya and tamarind sauce. Unique, but not mind numbing. Dessert was a vanilla panna cotta, which is like a creme brûlée jello.

Service was very nice and caring, and they were short on staff so they had half the tables closed - a good decision as they prioritised good service over filling the room.<br><br>Desserts were delicious and cocoa rice cakes particularly recommended... next time I will have a box of those to go!<br><br>At £18 per person excluding drinks it is quite a good deal for the area and quality.",

Everything was labeled too. We even had a few vegan desserts (aka puddings) to choose from! Using coconut milk, they made panacotta and two different fruit mousses. And also a sticky toffee pudding with dates.  I didn&#39;t realize they were a veggie award winner until we got there! I would eat here more than once, although it was a bit expensive.",

It just means you&#39;re going to order a lot more you can eat :)<br><br>The food itself could have been better - for example I did not like the seafood Jambalaya, though my friend swears by it. They do have nice calamari rings and scalops. And as far as I can recall on my post-birthday dinner/breakfast (at 3am!) I had a nice fish &amp; chips.<br><br>Do be aware that they stop serving alcohol at 3am...which is such a shame - majority of the clubs close at 3am and sometimes you just want to have that one drink - but it&#39;s not a reason not to give full 4 starts to the place.<br><br>The place itself is clean in addition to all other its merits and as I said before - staff is nice and very patient.<br><br>I love it - I love the atmosphere, kind of buzzy middle-of-the-night oasis of life - while soaked in alcohol Soho closes its eyes for the rest of the night.",

If you come when the place isn&#39;t overly crowded, the pancakes are top notch, as is everything else we&#39;ve tried here (all breakfasty foods, I will admit). When it&#39;s very busy, though, the food is a bit hit and miss. <br><br>The last time we were here, I got toasted corn bread with smashed avocado with chili peppers and two poached eggs on top. And a few bites of his pancakes. It was absolutely delicious, and will likely be my new staple - when I don&#39;t have those pancakes. <br><br>Speaking of the pancakes, it&#39;s the plain buttermilk pancakes that are the best. I got blueberry pancakes once and was disappointed to see that it&#39;s just the plain pancakes, served with a blueberry sauce instead of maple syrup. When I think blueberry pancakes, I think blueberries in the batter - but maybe that&#39;s just me?",

They were so friendly and made fried wontons for us even though they didn&#39;t have it on the menu.

There is also a good sit down place with a large beautiful fish tank in the back! If you come here around 5 PM, there would be barely anyone, so you can sit anywhere you want. <br><br>Most of us ordered the traditional Fish &amp; Chips with various fish styles. I got Cod for example, and it was absolutely delicious. The fish is very fresh, and they come with &#34;unlimited&#34; supply of fries or salad. Yes the fries are unlimited and tasty! The price is also decent; we each paid about 16 pounds including tips. Highly recommend!",

"reviewcomment":"Been meaning to go here for brunch for a long time and wish it had been sooner. Not very busy at all (open at noon on Sunday) which was worrying at first. I think it&#39;s the prices that are keeping traffic down as it was on the high side for brunch in London. <br><br>I had the burger and my wife had the hanger steak. They walk out the latest meat cuts a la a true steak house which includes filet mignon bone in surprisingly. My wife also had the oysters which she said were the best on a long long time. I&#39;m not a big fan so can&#39;t judge. The hanger steak was perfectly cooked and well seasoned. The burger though was the star. Chopped short rib meat was amazingly flavourful. Well seasoned which I like and an interesting cocktail sauce made at hix which had a great mix of spicy and sweet. <br><br>I&#39;ll be coming back because there were tons of things on the menu we wanted to try. With Automat closing this will be our new London brunch place.",

The location is great - close to Holborn station and not a very far walk from Oxford Street or the Bloomsbury campuses (if you&#39;re a student like me). <br><br>I&#39;ve come here a couple times to try different flavours because they have such a huge menu! If you are looking for American style fluffy pancakes then get the Butterscotch ones. They come in five regular sized stacked pancakes, topped with powered sugar and whatever topping you chose. The chocolate chip pancakes I ordered were super sweet and very filling! <br><br>The other pancakes are more similar to a crepe, thin and easily folded. They are seriously gigantic and you need to be very hungry to finish the whole thing! But a bonus to these is the lovely dutch painted plate they serve it on :) <br><br>Service was fine, nothing spectacular but not too bad. The pancakes are definitely the main reason I come here, so many options and delicious every time!",

My choice of meat was chicken, and I added sour cream, guacamole, and cheese to accompany the coriander-lime rice and veggies already included.  In my opinion, first the meat has got to be delicious, and the chicken was fantastic. But, what sets burritos apart are the veggies and optional additions -- daddy donkey has fab veggies -- cooked and prepared to the T.<br><br>All in all a fantastic spot for lunch, and place to satisfy your burrito craving!

We ordered the curry chicken, hainan chicken, and bread with the curry dipping sauce. Our food was served promptly and the entrees were served before the appetizer. <br><br>I thought the curry chicken portion was plentiful and I left very full, however DH hoped for a bigger portion of his dish. As far as flavor and style of the dishes, I have only one other Malaysian restaurant to compare it to in NYC. The curry flavor of my dish was very strong, which I prefer, but it did seems bit oily. Still, it was nice to try Malaysian food in a different country and see the variances. If we have the chance to come back to London, we would certainly give this place another shot.",

Make sure to get there early though because they stop serving breakfast around noon and the queue is quite long (but very well worth it).<br><br>We ordered a latte, cappuccino, muesli with yogurt and berry compote and cheesy focaccia with onions. Absolutely delicious. It hits the spot if you&#39;re looking for a divine way to start off your day.<br><br>The atmosphere is wonderful as well. We sat at a wooden communal table and were surrounded by lots of lovely people who were all catching up and looking for a delicious brunch just as we were.<br><br>On our way out, we couldn&#39;t help but grab a loaf of bread to-go. I highly recommend doing so! Nothing beats the aroma of freshly baked bread.<br><br>I highly recommend popping by!",

"reviewcomment":"This little joint seems to have quite the reputation. Ordinarily I would have given it a pass but I couldn&#39;t resist taking my partner here one evening as we passed through Chinatown towards Soho. It&#39;s a little clandestine, like a speakeasy for dim sum! Heed the sign on the front and knock their door to be let in. Don&#39;t be shy, they are very nice and service at Leong&#39;s is noticeably more personal than at any of the other places in or around Chinatown. <br><br>Do yourself a favour and treat this place more as a tapas style dining experience than a fully loaded, plates all around Chinese meal experience. Leong&#39;s make their own xiao long bao (little dragon buns) which are a melt in your mouth revelation. If you don&#39;t know the correct way to consume these little pieces of paradise then it&#39;s a good idea to watch others closely or Google it. Its a nibble, sip and chew kind of thing... It sounds crazy but I promise you it tastes better this way and you won&#39;t hurt yourself in the process.<br><br>My partner and I ordered the xiao long bao, chive dumplings, sticky pork and mushroom rice (which came in a bamboo pot) and a pot of tea. We would have ordered more but were on our way to dinner in Soho. Apparently neither of us have any self control. :P<br><br>Come at the right time and it can be very intimate (late lunch or early dinner.) Come at peak time and face a queue that begins at the bottom of the basement stairs. The customers here are a good mix of British and Chinese and are mostly locals (living, working or studying in London.) The feeling I had at Leong&#39;s was a world away from the kind of experience I&#39;ve generally had in restaurants in Chinatown which quite often pander to a tourist demographic and are not concerned with repeat customers for that reason. It&#39;s lovely to see Leong&#39;s taking a huge step in the right direction. Hopefully others might follow suit.",

"reviewcomment":"Moro is one of those places I&#39;ve wanted to eat at for ages but haven&#39;t because I don&#39;t like having to reserve ages in advance so fortunately we were able to get a table for 9pm on a Friday evening with only a few days notice.<br><br>It was great. Inside it&#39;s buzzing with a simple, open layout and open kitchen at the end. A long bar extends the entire length of the restaurant (taps menu only available at the bar).<br><br>Ordered the mushrooms on toast for starter which was excellent. Simple and with balanced flavours. They could have given the dish a fancy name with some unfamiliar funghi name on  char grilled crispy sourdough bread with olive oil from some single estate in Spain (which it all may well have been) but credit to them that they just called it &#39;mushrooms on toast&#39;. Sometimes pretentious menu descriptions fail to deliver when the actual dish shows up but in this case it was the other way round.<br><br>For mains I ordered chargrilled lamb with rice and some beetroot based sauce. That wasn&#39;t the actual menu description but just my memory of what I ate. The waitress mentioned the lamb would be served pink and was that OK. Yes, no problem. This dish was just delicious. A generous serving of yes, very pink lamb slices on a bed of rice and some other grains which had been slow cooked with spices and something else which just made it great and a cold beetroot based  sauce over the top. Back to the lamb. It wasn&#39;t rare in the normal sense yet tender and flavourful. Perhaps it was cooked sous vide and then finished on the chargrill....However they did it, it was just excellent.<br><br>For desert I opted for the Malaga raisin ice cream. So simple again and so good. What made it was the glass of sherry poured over with some giant raisins which may also have been sherry soaked. Yum.<br><br>Service was efficient and food arrived pronto, yet no feeling of time pressure at all even though tables were turning around us with only minutes between the next diners being seated.<br><br>I&#39;m looking forward to going back.",

"reviewcomment":"I had seen this restaurant on Gordon Ramsay&#39;s Best Restaurant, and had walked past it a few times in my lunch break, and have been dying to eat here since then. <br><br>So when i was in charge of organising a celebratory work dinner, i knew this was my chance to feast!!<br><br>The reservation process was quite easy, and the staff were super friendly and helpful. <br><br>Upon entering the restaurant, we were greeted by smiley faces, who were very welcoming. After putting our coats in the cloak room, we were shown to our table. Majority of our group were having the set menu, however a few of us had allergies and needed to order from the al a carte menu. <br><br>The wait staff were extremely knowledgeable in all the dishes, and were quick to offer suggestions that would suit our needs. <br><br>The one thing i did notice was the amount of wait staff. Although there were a heap, you didn&#39;t feel pestered or &#34;watched&#34; over the course of the meal. <br><br>I can highly recommend the set menu, it has very generous servings, and is great value for money. Also from the dessert menu, the lemongrass chili and lavender rose sorbet was the highlight of the night. <br><br>Even though we had a little mix up with desserts and the cloak room, the overall experience was not tarnished by these things. <br><br>Two big thumbs up!!",

I find it odd they call it a Brasserie as we don&#39;t really have brasseries in America and if we do they&#39;re French. :) <br><br>There are SO many great things on the menu to enjoy so I recommend returning until you&#39;ve tried them all. Burgers, pancakes and milkshakes... all with fries... it doesn&#39;t get much more American. I&#39;m still waiting for a Southern American breakfast of biscuits and gravy (that&#39;s bread biscuits not cookies to you Brits and no, scones are quite different). :-) <br><br>My fellow Americans (in London and visiting) if you&#39;re looking for a taste of home hit Automat and for those looking for the American diner experience this is the place. It&#39;s good, it&#39;s lively and this American Southerner just might bump into you there y&#39;all. Enjoy!",

Our server was a very kind Ukrainian girl. What impressed me most was the buttons &#39;&#39;press for champagne&#39;&#39;, that was very original. They asked us if we want to order champagne, and we were like, yes but first we will wait for you to go away and then we will press the button. It was fun. The meals were all delicious, my friend Nadya order some kind of fish, I don&#39;t remember the exact name, but was good. We had from those minus 18 degrees shots of vodka, very nice too. <br><br>Overall I had a great time and will love to go back, when visiting London.<br>Thank you all.",

"reviewcomment":"My first time to this part of London and Bermondsey Street is such a cute area. This restaurant is fairly far down along the road that comes from London Bridge, like a good 15 minute walk, but I passed a lot of cool restaurants, bars, and shops along the way.<br><br>We came for brunch and it didn&#39;t seem to be that crowded, with some empty tables around us at peak time. I ordered the lobster benedict, which was a menu item I hadn&#39;t seen before, and it was delicious. I don&#39;t know how much food they give you with the small portion, but the large one was a good amount and I would definitely have been disappointed with less.<br><br>My friends had the buttermilk and buckwheat pancakes, which looked good but fairly standard. I don&#39;t think they&#39;re serving anything mindblowing in terms of brunch food innovation, but the food was very good and the decor is fantastic (and there&#39;s no queue).",

"reviewcomment":"Some friends suggested we pay a visit here for brunch and not really being a believer of those faddy in-between meals, I was a bit reluctant. I mean, really? Have breakfast or lunch, why do you need something else? Greedy. But the Elk in the Woods changed my mind. Be still my groaning stomach!<br><br>We got here just after 11 and luckily my friend had made a reservation or, and there&#39;s no doubt about it, we would have been hunting for somewhere else to eat. This place gets busy, and for good reason.<br><br>We were seated in a nice big oak table by the window where we could watch the world go by and surreptitiously check out the shop windows opposite and already, we felt like we were in for a good time. <br><br>As we were there for brunch, it made obvious sense to order the complete full English. Fried eggs, bacon, baked beans, pork and apple sausages, tomatoes and two slices of toast, both white and bread. You get the full shebang here. They even do a veggie option, which left my mate feeling pretty pleased with herself as she&#39;s usually resigned to eggs on toasts.<br><br>Everything was good. I mean, everything. The toast was crunchy and came with butter on the side, so if you&#39;re like me and like your butter unmelted on the bread, you&#39;re in heaven. The sausages were plump, juicy and perfectly cooked, the bacon was well done but not crispy, English style and the eggs had runny yolks. Hallelujah! Brunch, I&#39;m a convert. Never will I forsake you again on a weekend.<br><br>We ordered a breakfast tea to go with our meals too, expecting a nice mug of tea. But what we got was so much better. A full tray, complete with milk jug, teapot and little white china teacup and saucer, with brown sugar on the table to taste. So what was initially one cup of tea ended up being three once you&#39;d finished off the teapot and excellent value for money.<br><br>For what you get, the whole thing is cheap at half the price and the atmosphere just adds to it. It&#39;s called Elk in the Woods and you really do feel like you&#39;re nestled in a little log cabin in the mountains, only you&#39;re watching people in fur coats wander past instead of the animal. <br><br>The only thing stopping it from being a five star review is the space you get. There was another table wedged in next to us and so at times, it felt like I was eating with other people instead of my friends and getting in and out around the standing light was tricky. But that&#39;s a minor issue in what was otherwise the perfect start to any day.",

For so much to eat, it&#39;s a great price that can&#39;t compare to other Turkish restaurants. <br>Not only is the food great, but the atmosphere is amazing. The plethora of hanging lamps gives out an ethnic, homey aura and even though it&#39;s constantly busy, you can sit in there for ages and enjoy the setting. I also like the outdoor seating, where you can see bustling Angel.",

As soon as you walk through the door, the wonderful aromas hit you and, let me tell you, the food tastes as good as it smells. <br><br>We shared an assortment of starters and each of us enjoyed a different main. The waiting staff were lovely and the food was very quick to arrive. <br><br>The decor of the place was also gorgeous - dimly lit and intimate. That being said, the majority of the tables are structured so that your party can be seated on a large square table with another party, so for those looking for a romantic one-on-one setting, I&#39;d recommend requesting a table to suit this beforehand.<br><br>Not the cheapest place in the city, but not the most expensive either - well worth the money!",

"reviewcomment":"I was in London with a friend to celebrate her 30th birthday. She loves Gordon Ramsay&#39;s restaurants so we of course had to eat at one of them while we were in town. The Savory Grill is a little out of my price range, so we opted for The Narrow instead. It is a little out of the way, but once we got there we enjoyed every minute of it.<br><br>They seated us on the patio so we had an excellent view of the river and a perfect sunset. <br><br>For an app, I got the crab on toast. There was a TON of crab on that toast. It was good, but I don&#39;t know about £12 for crab on toast. My friend got the scallops and really loved them.<br><br>For mains I was really in the mood for a burger, so I went for it. It was very good. Cooked perfectly and really flavorful beef. Totally recommend if you are looking for a burger. The special of the night was a beef wellington so that is what my friend got. How could she pass up the signature dish for her b-day celebration? She loved it.<br><br>And while we were both quite full from all of the food and wine that we had already consumed, we decided to get some puddings. I got the special which was homemade donuts with a caramel/chocolate dipping sauce. The donuts were ok, but I would be happy to have more of that dipping sauce. My friend won in the battle of desserts with the Knickerbocker glory. I have no idea of what all was in it, but it was incredible. <br><br>I wouldn&#39;t go out of my way to go here, but if for some reason, you are in the neighborhood it is a nice place to grab a meal.",

"reviewcomment":"So first time here having seen Atul Kochhar on the tv on many occasions I was very excited to actually go to this resturant.<br><br>The actual setting was very easy on the eye and very well polished from the time we went through the front door to the time we left. The lady on the door was very polite and well turned out. The decor has its light and dark areas and unlike some restaurants is not so dark you cannot see the person across the table without leaning over and I always find that to be a plus. The background sounds were not intrusive so definitely no shouting to be done to have a conversation.<br><br>We had a very nice champagne cocktail to start with along side the mini popadoms and a selection of dips to go with them. As to be expected in an establishment of this nature there was a waiter to take your wine order and a different one to take your food order. It was quiet when we arrived as we were their for lunch so perhaps that is why by the time we left we had been looked after by at least four different waiting staff, but it was not a problem as none were intrusive and it never affected our order.<br><br>Whilst the portions are not large they most certainly hit the spot for both taste and quantity. For some people out their the first two courses would have constituted a meal (we had a four course meal ) surprisingly for an Indian resturant the deserts were very good.<br><br>All in all I would definitely go back and try something else on the menu as what I had was all very tasty. The only downside I guess is that the main man was no where to be seen . I guess everyone gets a day off at some stage.",

"reviewcomment":"Another really hyped place. Specializing in Rum based drinks and the asian-latin fusion food. Portions are very large here when compared to other places. Plus it&#39;s the restaurant in the hotel and it was only a matter of time before getting a meal here.<br><br>Started out with two dishes for the group: <br><br>SCOTTISH SALMON AND SALTED AVOCADO HELADO - nice and well balanced. A great starter to have.<br><br>SPICY HAMACHI AND PLANTAIN THREADS - plantains were not as crunchy as I would have preferred as it would have been a great texture to have with the hamachi.<br><br>My main was the CUBAN BBQ CHICKEN which was recommended from our waitress. It was a solid dish. Chicken was moist and bbq of the tamarind had nice flavor. Like I mentioned above, huge portions here and this is was huge. Definitely a good recommend. Props to her.<br><br>Desserts equally are huge. Mexican doughnuts were good with butterscotch filling and sauce on the side. The Cuban Opera cake was also quite good, but you must be a chocolate fan for it. <br><br>Overall a good spot but one of the more pricey places around. Weekdays are days when you can walk in and get a table. Weekend, then you&#39;ll need to plan ahead and reserve.",

I&#39;ve heard many good things about their breakfast, but we went for dinner and it didn&#39;t disappoint.<br><br>The decor is an eclectic hosh posh of candlesticks and tissue wrapping paper, metal ladders and jars of goodies lining the walls. Service was friendly, but a bit slow.<br><br>It&#39;s got food for friends down to a tee. The menu has all the basics - burgers, risotto, fish and chips, but with nice little twists, like the hummus and halloumi burger I had. Desserts were lovely, not mind blowing, but you can&#39;t really go wrong with mini cinnamon doughnuts!",

"reviewcomment":"I couldn&#39;t visit London without trying one of Gordon Ramsay&#39;s restaurants.  I had picked this one because it was elegant yet casual, and it was a short walk from our visit to St. Paul&#39;s Cathedral.  Had lunch here with two friends Easter weekend.  As soon as you walk in, the bar and large restaurant is just stunning; it is a bright, inviting, modern french brasserie style space.<br><br>Although they were still serving brunch, I ordered a main...I can always order eggs anywhere!  I had the roasted cod with crushed potatoes, artichoke, salted capers, red wine and lemon sauce, and shared a side of broccoli with chili and ginger.  Although my main was tasty, the fish and overall dish was extremely rich.  I don&#39;t regret ordering the cod, but I generally do not prefer to have such rich, buttery entrees.  My friend ordered the trout,  and agreed that although she enjoyed it, it was very buttery.  That being said, I was on vacation, cleared my plate, and did an extra long cardio workout later that day;)  I had a glass of wine with my meal and finished with a nice latte.<br><br>Service was friendly and the food served timely.  I had read other reviews and it was indeed odd that there was a &#34;cover charge&#34; on the bill of 2GBP per person.   Overall, a beautiful restaurant &amp; I&#39;m happy to have dined at this Gordon Ramsay restaurant during my visit London.  Cheers!",

"reviewcomment":"I&#39;ve eaten in the grill portion of Skylon twice. The location obviously cannot be beat. My first time going I went with a friend and we had an excellent view of the Thames at sunset. The food was good and relatively well-priced compared to the restaurant at Skylon (right next to the grill). Once I had ravioli with peas which was delicious and steak on a separate occasion which was also good.<br><br>Service could have been better, but overall had a positive experience here given ambiance, location, and food.",

"reviewcomment":"Beach Blanket Babylon is tucked away on one of the streets off the Notting Hill High street, which is nice. It&#39;s not on a busy road but also close enough to walk from the station.<br><br>BBB is all about the ambience. The restaurant boasts a very sexy interior with chandeliers, fireplaces and furniture that would make Marie Antoinette go red with envy. <br><br>Sadly, BBB is not really all about food. Don&#39;t get me wrong, my veggie starter and my risotto main were great, but they just weren&#39;t what you&#39;d expect from BBB. Maybe it&#39;s the interior and the service that set the bar too high, which isn&#39;t necessarily a bad thing. It&#39;s not food that will keep you coming back, it&#39;s the atmosphere. All in all, I had a lovely date night, hence my 4 stars.",

HOWEVER, this is definitely not an ideal spot for a romantic dinner ( I don&#39;t know what we were thinking) as you sit elbow to elbow with the next table and sometimes feel like you should contribute to their conversation and take bites off their food.<br><br>We had the chicken gyozo and miso soup for starters, both of which were fine albeit unremarkable (although I&#39;ve never met a remarkable miso soup), and I ordered the eel bento box while my boyfriend had a chicken noodle dish (I don&#39;t remember its name because I was too busy savaging my box of bento).<br><br>For 14GBP, the bento box is quite filling, although it&#39;s more rice than anything else. I had several pieces of salmon sashimi, tuna sushi and a few rolls in one section, then nigiri (eel covered in teryaki) on top of sticky rice, and a small salad section of edamame and peppers).<br><br> I&#39;d definitely come back for the bento box and ditch the starters; it&#39;s great value for money and a perfect meal for when you&#39;re starved of sushi but need something more filling. Despite my spilling my soup and making a mess, the waiters were great, friendly and cordial while quite brisk at their service. It&#39;s a great alternative to other restaurants where you tend to feel like cattle being prodded to eat and get out asap.<br><br>We also had cold sake and bypassed the dessert; frankly, the restaurant&#39;s central location means you have so many fantastic dessert options just around the corner in Soho, and you will definitely need a walk after a meal at Taro.",

"reviewcomment":"I&#39;ve been coming to this location daily for the past three days, since it&#39;s just a couple minutes walk from my hotel.  It&#39;s a chain restaurant here in London, offering baked goods, coffee, and of course sandwiches in a crinkly, biodegradable plastic bag!<br><br>My favorite breakfast item is the smoked salmon and egg salad sandwich.  It has a few sprouts to add some balance.  For some reason, the salty smoked salmon and creamy egg salad goes very well together.  Like my other favorite lunch sandwich place, Paul, they use long, crunchy baguette  breads which makes it easy to eat.<br><br>Both the chocolate and almond croissants are also excellent - very flakey and crispy if you like that.  It&#39;s not very dense but very tasty - a perfect way to end the meal without being overly full.",

After a long morning of playing tourist (and I am a bad tourist because I would rather sit in pubs than make my way around museums!) I parked my tired limbs and ordered the pancakes. Ave Maria and all the saints, they were good. It could be that I haven&#39;t eaten gluten for a year (hey, a gluten allergy doesn&#39;t count on vacation, right?) but these fluffy disks of comfort food hit the spot.

"reviewcomment":"Summary: <br><br>+Great food <br>+Nice and modern ambience <br>+Best among other competitors in the area <br>+Shrimp summer roll: Fresh<br>+Beef pho: Yummy<br><br>Overall:<br>I paid a visit to one of my favourite establishments in East London. Viet Grill is an unassuming gem of Vietnamese restaurant on Hackney Street. Surrounded by five or so other Vietnamese restaurants on the same side of the street, Viet Grill stands out in both food and ambience. <br><br>I went in at 11:30 for an early lunch before a meeting in that area of London to catch them just opening the restaurant. <br>I was shown into a window seat in the well-lit roomy dining space that is decorated with modern wooden floor. From a quick glance, this place could be easily mistaken to a nice French café apart from the large paintings of bamboo in warm pastel colours that decorates the walls and lively discussions in what sounds like Vietnamese from the kitchen. <br><br>The staffs were all amiable and helpful. <br>Since it was my first Vietnamese meal in a long time, I decided to go with the classics. Beef pho for the main and prawn summer rolls as a side. <br>The waitress pointed out that those dishes happen to be included in the lunch combo, so I could have them for only £10. Nice. <br><br>The service was very quick. The summer rolls were served within five minutes. <br>In another 5 minutes or so, I had my bowl of pho noodle. This suggests they had a stack of summer rolls ready before the busy lunchtime war. They clearly know what they are doing. I like that. <br><br>Food:<br>The summer roll was packed with fresh salad, rice vermicelli and thin slices of shrimps all wrapped tightly in a soft rice paper. <br>As I bite into one of the rolls, the flavour of mint and coriander filled my mouth. I liked the way they sliced the shrimps into smaller pieces so they don&#39;t make big lumps inside the wrap. The peanut sauce on the side has a typical South East Asian mix of rich sweetness and spiciness. <br><br>The beef pho was a true delight.  The beef-based broth was rich and yet not too fatty. The sweetness from roasted onion and subtle flavour of coriander adds another dimension to the taste of broth. <br>As in any Vietnamese restaurant, the pho was served with a set of herbs that enhances the taste of broth. There are variations to this flavour booster kit but it usually consists of thai basil, bean sprouts, a slice of lemon or lime and sometimes chopped red chilli peppers. I like to have first couple of sips without the boosters and appreciate the richness of naked broth. As usual, I threw in the herbs and lemon juice half way into the meal. The change in the broth is both pleasant and dramatic. The once sweet broth now has edgy sourness and bitterness to it. <br>I always find the flat rice noodle hard to eat without making a mess. But I think it&#39;s more about my clumsy chopstick skills than the dish itself.",

"reviewcomment":"Kappacasein is an amazing food stand right at the end of a row of great lunch choices at Borough Market. You&#39;ll be tempted by all the other offerings, but I implore you to pass them up at least once for that toasted cheese sandwich. After one taste, you&#39;ll probably pass them all up again, and again, and again.<br><br>The queue starts up after 11/12, but since I&#39;ve become very lucky in living close to Borough Market I&#39;ve taken to coming around 10:30 and making a brunch out of it. Believe me when I say you won&#39;t need much more until dinner time! And that way I only ever wait about 5 minutes for my gooey goodness.<br><br>The bread is toasted to PERFECTION, and the cheese is perfectly melted, even some of the cheese on the outside becomes nice and crunchy and beautiful without being burnt whilst everything on the inside is gooey and irresistible. The addition of onions and leeks makes it really special without taking the focus away from the cheese. I sometimes find myself feeling like I&#39;m intoxicated by cheesey goodness, just comfort food at it&#39;s best. For a fiver, you really cannot go wrong.",

And this place had lovely outdoor seating at the front and amazing restaurant seating inside with an open kitchen and a beautiful bar. <br>We tried their unique cocktails and ordered again and again. Plus their freshly made pizza and the chunkiest hips ever was a perfect unplanned dinner. On a second visit tried the sea bass with the mash potatoes baked perfectly. Would recommend to anyone.",

I don&#39;t know much (anything) about Scandinavian food but YESSSSSSS! Their beetroot salad and sweet potato salad are ace. Not to mention the little bits of fried onion and dollop of mustard on their roast beef / salami on rye things (I don&#39;t even know what they&#39;re called, sozz, but they taste real good). Big yes on the Smørrebrød and kladdkaka! I&#39;ve had better cinnamon buns but these aren&#39;t too far off. Although for coffee it&#39;s probably best heading to Kaffeine across the road - not a fan of super milky coffee!<br><br>Popped in last week and they&#39;ve recently schnazzed up the place! The counter&#39;s all done up now - in super slick black and  salads in big wood bowls. Also noticed that they sell violet liquorice!! A box for 75p maybe? Not even a liquorice fan but trust me, these&#39;ll win you over too.",

"reviewcomment":"I bloody love Wagamama. Any of the branches, but this is my regular. Arrive early for lunch else you&#39;ll be queuing up the stairs, out the door and down the road. For our American friends, you have to understand the deal with this restaurant chain before you go: long tables shared with strangers, food arrives when it&#39;s ready regardless of whether or not your lunch partner&#39;s food is ready. That&#39;s just how it is. This is Japanese food for European taste buds and American appetites (according to propaganda ;) so if you&#39;re after more authentic Japanese food you should carry on down the road to Brewer Street where there are several really cheap cafe style Japanese restaurants with good selections of grilled meat and fish, sushi and sashimi. <br><br>The only negative point I have (although I have not deducted a star) is that Wagamama is definitely better as a lunch venue or a quick dinner fix, not for lengthy, chilled meal or with a big group.",

"reviewcomment":"About a 3.5: Wagamama is a restaurant chain in the UK that is supposedly inspired by traditioanl Japanese ramen bars.  They have a communal type of a seating arrangement, and their menu offers items such as ramen, teppanyaki, curry dishes, donburi, chilli dishes, salads, bento boxes, and desserts.  I tried their Chili Beef Ramen - the noodles were in a spicy chicken soup with slices of beef steak, bean sprouts, red and spring onions, and some chili peppers.  I can see why having a bowl will be nice if it&#39;s a wintry/rainy day.  The ramen was just okay as it wasn&#39;t as hearty as I would have liked it to be, but it came in a huge bowl and was quite filling; I&#39;m glad I tried it out as this is one of those popular chains in London - the place was jam-packed with communal diners, downstairs of a building.  You can also purchase the orange Wagamama shirts as souvenirs (which I so did!).  Service was friendly, extremely fast, and efficient.",

She didn&#39;t blink when we ordered everything :-D Guess we weren&#39;t the first Ottolenghi enthusiasts. <br><br>The first impression was good, it was all delicious and I will definitely go back for much more. I was actually thinking to bring a tent and permanently camp in front of this bakery LOL<br><br>PS: the place is very very small, so it&#39;s perfect for takeaway, not so great for a party of more than two people, as they only have one large table downstairs, which customers share.

"reviewcomment":"Located on Lancashire Court, tucked away behind loads of buildings, lies Hush. I did have to ask for directions to get here even whilst I was on the street, but I got here in the end.<br><br>Last night I was invited to a yelp event dinner by Yee Gan O, who arranged a dinner for me whilst I was down in London, which was delightful! Andrew M also attended, and it was fantastic getting to make more friends through Yelp outside of Glasgow. I arrived early, and so had a glass of white wine, which was gorgeous, while I waited. <br><br>Shortly after the others turned up, we set to ordering. We were actually talking so much I think ordering 2 courses took us about half an hour, but eventually we managed it. Yee Gan and I both opted for the Crab &amp; Avocado Salad to start, whilst Andrew went for the Pulled Pork. Both were absolutely delicious and went down a treat. Then for mains Yee Gan went for the half lobster, Andrew for the Salmon Fishcakes, and I went for the fillet steak with béarnaise sauce. My steak was cooked to perfection and was absolutely delicious. The homemade chips left a lot to be desired though, but I&#39;ve often found that good steaks come with bad chips. The two guys both cleaned their plates, and food satisfaction was had for me. <br><br>I&#39;ve noticed that I&#39;m the first person to review this place with 5*, but I genuinely cannot fault my experience here. The decor is absolutely stunning, the food was excellent and the service was great. It&#39;s definitely a place pretty people like to go to be seen and spend money, but that didn&#39;t influence my enjoyment. I had blackberry sorbet for dessert, which was gorgeous and sweet and delicious and rich and I just love sorbet. Andrew had the mars bar cake and Yee Gan had the hot chocolate fudge cake. <br><br>Definitely recommend this place. Excellent food, excellent service and everything excellent in between. It&#39;s definitely on the pricey side, and the 12.5% service charge is popped on at the end, but I thoroughly enjoyed Hush.",

"reviewcomment":"This place doesn&#39;t look like much from the outside( or inside) but the pastries were surprisingly delish and reasonably priced. My son enjoyed his hot chocolate and I enjoyed my abbreviated British tea experience. I never really have been a scone person( they are usually soooo dry and crumbly to me, who likes that? ) but the ones served with my tea were very good here. I was sad they did not have clotted cream to go with them as I had been looking forward to trying this mysterious garnish (never seen it stateside with scones before) but apparently on Friday they are out for the week( at least that&#39;s what the server said). Also really good was the Mille Feuille. Again, not something I usually order because all the ones I have had in the past are pretty tasteless and boring but because another yelped recommended it, I tried it, and can concur, it was pretty darn good.  This place definitely delivered for a quick, tasty snack where I didn&#39;t get fleeced for all my pounds and left with boring, tasteless food ( my experience at most other establishments in London during my short trip).",

They also have all sorts of deals through lunchtime. That being said and topped with the high quality of the food itself adds up for a brilliant choice for a lunch spot. <br><br>If you&#39;re in the area you should definitely try it, despite the lack of imagination regarding the design of Cubana - it seems quite unwelcoming to me.",

"reviewcomment":"Simply Awesome! Go here and feast!<br><br>Located in the Fulham residental area, this unassuming pub can easily fool the eye. Looking like many of the pubs around, this is one of the few pubs to hold a Michelin Star. Came here on a Sunday, so appropriately so, a Sunday roast is required. They had 2 on the menu, one as part of the specials (Venison) and the standard one (Beef). Each of the roast are recommended for 2 people and with 4 in our group, we had to get both. Here&#39;s the rundown:<br><br>Starters:<br>Bread<br>Eat the Soda Bread. It&#39;s that damn good.<br><br>Butternut squash soup with squid and garlic<br>This was amazing. It came in a small shot glass-like cups and was savory and succulent. Only wished there was more as it was a great instrument to cut through all the meats.<br><br>Harwood Arms Scotch Eggs<br>Not on the menu during our visit, but we ordered it and you should too. I haven&#39;t had scotch eggs before so I couldn&#39;t compare against anything, but this was also quite good. Slicing through the egg allowed for the gooey beautiful yolk to ooze onto the outer meat layer. <br><br>Roasts:<br>Beef<br>Beautiful pink center with an outer ring. Along with the beef&#39;s own jus, it was melt in your mouth goodness. <br><br>Venison<br>This was wrapped in bacon to keep the venison nice and moist. It also added a salty-sweetness to the game meat. Having the soup along with the venison was a great interplay to cut through the meat.<br><br>Along with the huge pieces of meat come several accompaniments. All very good in their own as well.<br><br>Accompaniments: <br>Crispy Garlic Potatoes<br>Nice potatoes that served a nice textural difference. Not only that, they were darn good with the garlic essence and spices.<br><br>Cheese Cauliflower<br>A very flavorful and another addition to the cutting through the richness of the meat.<br><br>Mushrooms &amp; Beets<br>Two separate sides, but both roasted and just simply good.<br><br>This was a lot of food and I&#39;m still missing several sides. You&#39;ll need to come extra hungry in order to be even close to finishing this behemoth of a meal. With that said, all the food was excellent and I would recommend everything above and anything else you can fit in your stomach. Absolutely amazing.",

"reviewcomment":"This place is my religion. <br><br>Called Bao Zi Inn in English but 人民公社 - &#39;The People&#39;s Canteen&#39; in Chinese (a tongue in cheek joke about life in China during the latter part of the 20th century.) This is, in my humble opinion, the most authentic of the Chinese restaurants in Chinatown. Its menu is small and modest and consists mostly of noodles, dumplings, cold salads and individual rice dishes. The restaurant is small (don&#39;t bring a large party here!)<br><br>I come here often for lunch and order dan dan noodles, zha jiang noodles or beef and bamboo noodles. Their noodles are excellent and very authentic, certainly the best I&#39;ve eaten in the UK. Some of the spicy dishes are very spicy so beware but if you&#39;re a fan of Sichuan cuisine, maybe ask them to add extra chilli is it&#39;s not quite THAT authentic. ;) The fact that this place is always filled with Chinese expats and students longing for a taste of home should be pretty telling. Do not expect to find the kinds of dishes you&#39;ve become accustomed to at your local takeaway or at any of the other restaurants along Gerrard Street.<br><br>The seating isn&#39;t very comfortable but this place is really designed for a quick meal rather than a long drawn out affair so I&#39;ve never found t to be a particular problem.<br><br>12.5% service charge is included. Minimum charge per person is something like £8 so that you don&#39;t come in and just order a bowl of £7.50 noodles. Get a pot of tea and everything will be under a tenner. 2 people can enjoy massive bowls of noodles or a rice and meat dish for a very reasonable £16-17. What&#39;s not to love about that?",

"reviewcomment":"Honestly in a city ravaged by chain pubs, the Marquis of Cornwallis offers a very high class environment while seemingly avoiding the chain-tag. Though I am never surprised to find out something is a chain, this doesn&#39;t appear to be one.<br><br>This pub doesn&#39;t have the greatest prices in this century, but is a good place to grab one pint. Food prices hover around the 10+ pound range so again, this isn&#39;t a cheap place, but is is quite nice! Coming in here for a pint or two is all I&#39;d recommend if you are on a budget.<br><br>The seating is extremely comfortable and the pub is very spacious, including a second level. It has a wholesome feel and is very very clean. Staff is semi-eager to usher you out after you&#39;ve finished your pint, but they won&#39;t do anything about it if you sit around talking.<br><br>The selection of beers on tap is another plus; there are several microbrews and the standard mainstream beers. It&#39;s worth trying something new at this place, the local taps are tasty as hell!! (is hell tasty?)<br><br>Overall, this place is a grand slam (baseball reference). A true touchdown (american football reference) of the sphere of pubs in London. Honestly, it&#39;s a slam dunk (basketball reference). <br><br>Hole in one (golf).",

"reviewcomment":"I&#39;m sad to see that this place only has about 3 stars here on Yelp, because that was not at all my experience! I walk by it all the time, on Thornhill Road which is roughly 2 streets over from Upper St and runs parallel to it, and it has the most adorable front area where you always see people sitting outside on a sunny day. I passed by today and people are even there with their laptops or a book because it is just such a nice place to hang out. But when my friend and I stopped by on our pub crawl around Islington the other day, I was amazed to find out that the back garden totally puts the front area to shame! They have the nicest big tree and enough tables to fit hundreds of people. It is exactly where I want to spend my sunny weekends, and it can easily fit large groups which is perfect. Looks like people aren&#39;t such big fans of the food, but just come here for a drink, or a few, and the atmosphere!",

No worries, they let us sit in the more casual pub down stairs by the bar. Awesome service, very un-pub like in that way. Three of us shared the fish and chips. We loved the fish and the mushy peas, chips were average. But then on a whim we shared one order of their sticky toffee pudding! One was not enough, it was the best I ever had. Many puddings are way to sweet to eat more than a bite. This sticky pudding was perfectly addictive. I would return for this alone!",

The service was fabulous (even walked away with some suggestions for other great places), the clientele was cool (chatted with a few locals), and the ambiance was just what I like. Modern and open but still somehow cozy.<br><br>I ordered the pork belly roast, which came with au jus, stewed carrots and red cabbage, also a small side of pudding, which was delicious. I don&#39;t know what the bread was, flaky and dome-like, but it was great. Also had one of the special cocktails (something with spiced rum, spices, coffee, and kahlua), and it blew my mind. Super spicy and super tasty. I ate everything they set in front of me, even the big knicker-bocker glory that this Harry Potter fan was simply unable to pass up (remember Dudley having one at the zoo?). Prices were appropriate.<br><br>When I go back to London, I will definitely be having Sunday Roast at The Folly, and I recommend that you go too.",

It&#39;s fresh and you should never have them put this fine piece of fish in a bag for eating later. It&#39;s imperative that you sit down, order a beer and enjoy the shrimp, lager and wait for this fine fish.<br><br>I walked over 1.8 miles each way to enjoy the halibut. Worth every step.",

Then menu was pretty extensive, but we restrained ourselves and ordered har kow, char siu cheung fun, sticky rice, spare ribs, and stuffed tofu skins. <br><br>We found the prawns in the har kow to be fresh with a nice crisp to them and the cheung fun was really similar to what we have experienced in other restaurants. The sticky rice was not too gloopy and was prett flavorful. <br><br>The service was friendly and prompt. We were seated and able to pay our bill without difficulty. We were seated in the back of the main level and the air conditioner was almost too cold, which just made us drink more hot tea to warm up.  We may consider coming back if we were in the area again.",

"reviewcomment":"We finally managed to go here. I had been wanting to go to the Red Dog Saloon for a while now and it completely delivered on my expectations. <br><br>First of all, they take reservations. Given the fact this is a famous burger-place, that&#39;s definitely a plus-point, compared to all other burger-places here in London. <br><br>And you get exactly what you&#39;re expecting: great American-style wings (we took first the combination platter and then went for a second round of the spicy mustard ones), pitchers of beer and fatty juicy burgers. I had the standard bacon cheeseburger, topped with two extra patties, making it 4 layers of meat, bacon and cheese it total. This was heaven dripping down my fingers. The whole thing staying relatively together while eating.<br><br>I do have to say I expected the burger to be a little bit bigger (given that I made it almost double it standard size). Maybe it&#39;s because I was already a bit drunk, but I had no problem finishing it (having had some wings beforehand and a side-order of fries to share as well) while I was expecting to have some heart-failure afterwards, which wasn&#39;t the case.<br><br>But in the end, a great evening with friends and some great American-styled food.",

Has an amazing interior, which makes the atmosphere so calm and yet so lively. The mirrors are my favorite thing in this whole conception, they give a classy and elegant look to the place.<br>The food is amazing, it seems like always the products that are used for the dishes to be cooked are so fresh, especially the vegies, they taste like that they have just been harvested from the garden. <br>This place is highly recommended!",

"reviewcomment":"This is my favourite dim sum restaurant in Chinatown (note: dim sum is served daily but only till 6pm or so - standard Chinese restaurant practice). It offers an extensive dim sum menu, with classic stuff (e.g. har gao &#34;prawn dumplings&#34;, prawn dumplings in mock shark fin soup, crab siu mai, char siu bun &#34; juicy honesty-roast-pork bun&#34;) and more creative stuff (e.g. quail egg siu mai, juicy liquid custard bun, beef meatballs, etc). What distinguishes Dumplings Legend from other Chinatown restaurants is, firstly, their Xiao-long-bao &#34;soup dumplings&#34;, a Shanghai classic and Dumplings Legend makes it even more special by offering a variety of stuffing options - all fantastically delicious and truly authentic; and secondly; all of the dim sum (including the aforementioned XLB (soup dumpling) are all freshly handmade onsite by  the restaurant&#39;s team of dim sum chefs, NOT machine made or made elsewhere by some central kitchen (so products will be frozen!). Pretty impressive stuff! <br><br>The restaurant&#39;s a la carte menu is also very extensive (perhaps a bit overwhelming if you&#39;re not familiar with Chinese food, but the English translation of the menu is pretty high standard and gives clear descriptions on the dish content). The cuisine style is mainly Cantonese with quite a lot of Malaysian dishes. I really like their roast duck and other honey-roast meat, and the Malaysian flavours give some really flavoursome spicy edge to the menu! <br><br>The restaurant has 3 floors, and several private dining rooms upstairs that also double as party rooms/karaoke booths because each room (differently sized) is equipped with karaoke facility (with loads of Chinese and English songs). My colleague had his birthday do at one of the rooms last year and it was really good fun - authentic Chinese food and really good sound system with lots of new chart songs. Another plus is that on weekend nights it is open until 3am.<br><br>I&#39;ve been a regular to Dumplings Legend for over a year and the food there is always delicious and satisfying. The downsides of the restaurant has to be its service staff, who don&#39;t normally speak good English (as a result their English could sound rude at times) or understand how to approach customers courteously especially when the restaurant is very busy. The staff might be struggling themselves with so many tables demanding for their attention, and there can easily be a queue on weekend evenings, so the service level dropped even more. I understand this is a causal Chinatown restaurant, not some posh Mayfair venue, so am not expecting service to be impeccable, but I would certainly enjoy my dining experience at DL even more if their staff could be trained a bit better and looked more lively. Hope I&#39;m not asking too much here :P",

"reviewcomment":"Imagine the scene; some friends and I were watching a TV program where some detectives have to interview the owner of an ice cream shop. <br><br>Also imagine that as we are watching this TV program we are all very hot on a July evening in London. All of us at the same point recognised the establishment on the TV and yelled &#34;It&#39;s Marine Ices!&#34; and instantly agreed that we should head to Chalk Farm (even though it was 10 PM) and piled out the door.<br><br>The most excitable of our group was skipping her way down the street shouting &#34;ICE CREAM ICE CREAM ICE CREAM ICE CREAM!&#34;. Naturally, we all agreed that the best way to hit M.I. would be to take the top down on the car. With the breeze in our collective hair, before we knew it, we were parking up around the corner from Marine ices. <br><br>They do not have the biggest selection of ice cream that I have ever seen, however they have all of my favourites, so screw everybody else!<br><br>When it comes to the big decisions in life I feel that I can make sound and insightful choices. However, when it comes to the super ultra really really important decisions in life, like which flavour of ice cream I should choose, I just fall to pieces under the pressure. After deliberating between white chocolate, pistachio and rum raisin I went to the latter. And me being me (in that I can&#39;t do anything by halves) I did not get mere &#34;scoops&#34; of ice cream - I decided to go for a half litre tub.<br><br>For one moment I stupidly thought that I would wait until I got home to eat the ice cream and before I had even taken five steps away from Marine ices I had doubled backed with a trot and grabbed one of those small plastic spoons.<br><br>Tearing the top open with animal-like aggression, I stabbed the tiny plastic spoon into the firm, yet creamy top of the ice cream. I had not had Rum and Raisin flavour before at Marine Ices, but I was rewarded instantly with the hits of frozen sugary moo juice.<br><br>And yes, if you are wondering I did eat the whole tub in one sitting, almost even before I had reached my front door. And certainly before we resumed the TV program that we were previously watching. <br><br>Just like Chic had - &#34;Good Times&#34;.",

"reviewcomment":"Another stumbled-upon spot for us.  I say this because we hadn&#39;t even planned on eating again, just yet, but happened to be meandering around looking for an entrance into St. Paul&#39;s and found the steps down to the basement to be open so, of course we wandered down there in our tourist-induced daze.  There we found out the admission to the Cathedral was way beyond what we were prepared to pay so we decided to check out the basement some more and possibly take advantage of the facilities.  After doing so (thank you for such a wonderful and clean place to freshen up!), I noticed the cafe offered &#34;high tea&#34;.  For some time now I have wanted to see what this meant exactly but could never quite convince the spouse to join me.  This place seemed like the perfect opportunity to broach the subject once again, and once I got the go ahead and we were seated under the vaulted ceilings, let me tell you, the Cafe in the Crypt did not disappoint.  The atmosphere, the little sandwiches, scones, clotted cream (pre-crumbed!  whoever thought of such a thing), brownie, tartlet and maccaron, were each fabulous in its own way.  Of course the tea was nothing less than brilliant, either.  And the staff were so very friendly.  They assured me this was what high tea was all about.   Very fun experience all together.",

"reviewcomment":"I&#39;ve been brought here on multiple occasions by friends and have had amazing food each time. It is really best for groups so you can share dishes and try lots of different things. I would definitely recommend the shrimp dumplings dim sum but I think every dish is delicious and true to it&#39;s name. We have never ordered something that turned out to be very different i.e. not crispy, not large enough, too much fruit/veg rather than meat. <br><br>I was very surprised at some of the previous reviews (save for the review by Sarah T. just below mine) as I&#39;ve always experienced wonderful food and wonderful service when I come here but perhaps they have improved in the last couple of years. I particularly want to highlight the staff who are so patient. They were very nice to my friends who aren&#39;t used to dim sum and very helpful when we asked about various ingredients. They have also been respectful about my slight fish allergy. <br><br>I prefer this restaurant over all the others in Chinatown. It may be a bit more expensive but it&#39;s worth it.",

"reviewcomment":"Just a little over 4 blocks from Paddington Station (in the same SE direction as incoming trains, down London Street) is a little gem of an Indian restaurant. During my recent week in London I returned there several times and was able to sample a number of dishes. All were delightful. The little corner restaurant is cozy inside with a very competent wait staff. But it is the food that drew me back. Everything I sampled was delicious.<br><br>Their nan, which has been mentioned in prior reviews, could be the best I have ever tasted. A lamb appetizer folded into a puri &#39;pancake&#39; could have been a meal in itself. It was a winner. Among the entrée dishes, I especially liked the chicken tikka, the lamb curry and their signature chicken dish. The curries come in three grades of heat. I ordered the &#39;Madras&#39; which was described as &#39;hot&#39;, but I detected little if any heat. Next time I would go with the &#39;vindaloo&#39; which is the next step up and described as &#39;very hot&#39;. <br><br>Their butter chicken was quite flavorful but had a subtle sweetness that I had a mixed reaction to. At between £9-13 a dish, the food quality surpasses many of its more expensive London competitors.",

Hip, young things swigging coffee, talking about their polenta brunch choice and spending £4.50 on an orange juice. <br><br>Yes, we waited. We waited over half an hour, but it was brunch so what&#39;s the rush? <br><br>We ordered a sweet muffin, which was kinda of like a cupcake-muffin, with frosting. Sourdough toast with avocado and sausage and a chorizo bake. Everything was good but next time I definitely want to try the waffles!

You name it - they have it.  This way you can make your burger to your liking.<br><br>Keep in mind that it can get pretty busy at peak times for lunch and dinner so go early if you want to sit and enjoy your burger.<br><br>Would I go back?  Hells YES!  It&#39;s on the favorites list.",

As I said, I recommend their bavette steak w/ red wine, shallots and fries for £10.90. They also boast a fantastic wine and beer selection. <br><br>Pierre Victoire is definitely THE place to go on a romantic date. Two main courses and a bottle of red will run you about £40--not a bad deal for the quality of both their food and service. Highly recommended!",

This is a solid, upscale neighborhood pub.<br><br>What really seemed odd in a pub, was to be charged shy of three pounds for the bottle of tap water they placed on our table with four empty glasses.  A crew of regular patrons were surprised and bristled when the bill came, mumbling it was not great hospitality, and I suppose I can see their point.",

"reviewcomment":"Yum Yum is... well, the joke is too easy there, but yes, it&#39;s pretty delicious. <br><br>I didn&#39;t actually come here for food, so I can&#39;t speak about that, but the cocktails? Man, these cocktails are phenomenal. Well prepared, a long list of interesting concoctions (I got one with gin and fresh grapes called The Lonely Tree) and strong.  Just the way I like it. <br><br>The atmosphere is sleek and chic, mood lit to the point of maybe being a little too dark, but with comfortable seats, even a nice area around the corner from the entrance for drinking only. They did play jungle sounds instead of music, which was a little strange, but when I stopped focusing on it, it actually was kind of relaxing. <br><br>Cocktails run about £7/£8 a pop.

Because without a doubt the food here is good, tasty and worth the asking price.<br>The main detraction however is ambience. My partner and I were sat downstairs in a small white box of a room, packed with tables and customers. This I can deal with, but when the number of patrons impacts the service I start to become wary.<br>My meal was excellent, tasty and felt authentic. However the venue for the meal lacked any ambiance or class.<br>I came here because of the good reviews, and my food lived up to them. The over-all experience though was tainted by the lack of ambience and friendly service. Don&#39;t get me wrong - the service was good. I just wasn&#39;t classy enough to make me smile.<br>In a nutshell, if you want tasty Chinese food in Chinatown you can get it here.

I actually have been here a few times (for lunches and dinners) as I was staying at the hotel so I can definitely say I enjoyed it. The service was great and the food came to the table fast. I like the relaxed atmosphere of the restaurant and the bar area. It&#39;s just as ok to go there alone and read a book or with a big group and have a great night out. There is a nice buzz in the restaurant and in the hotel lobby bar. I recommend!",

"reviewcomment":"Andrew Edmunds is a quaint European restaurant in SoHo in London. I had heard of Andrew Edmunds from friends before and it is quite highly rated on Zagat so decided to book dinner for a friend that had just moved to London that evening. When we arrived at Andrew Edmunds, we were surprised to see that the restaurant is around 8 tables or so that are closely packed (reminded me quite a lot of a small restaurant in Southern France). The decor is quite romantic with used wine bottles corked with candles burning on the table, a chalk board with up to date wine specials, and a handwritten menu. The wine list is phenomenal - they source their wine list from high-end retailers in London and buy the last few bottles of a bin at a significant discount. They truly pass along the discount to the costumer - bottles begin around £18 for their house red Corbieres and upward to hundreds of pounds for known vintages of French, Italian, Spanish, Australian, and Napa/Sonoma wines. The menu is filled with classically French and British dishes that are simple but well crafted. We decided on the winter stew, lemon sole, and lentil and aubergine for the three mains, along with the charcuterie for an appetizer, and the cheese plate for dessert. The Corbieres was splendid (and reasonably priced) and the mains were surprising great (plus, the price point was from £12.50 for the lentils to £22 for the sole, so quite reasonable for SoHo). The cheese dish was sourced from local farms outside of London and was one of the nicest cheese plates I have had in a long time. As an aside, Andrew Edmunds does not do online reservations and does not accept them more than a week in advance. Calling for reservations 3 or more days in advance is quite recommended in order to get a spot (especially for the weekends). The staff were attentive and helpful in selecting a dish, but were also not too hovering, so we felt we could sit for as long after our meal as we wished. The dishes were also well-timed, so courses did not overlap. Overall, Andrew Edmunds was a splendid restaurant. If you are looking for a higher end French/European restaurant to take a date or to catch up with good friends, Andrew Edmunds is a great choice.",

"reviewcomment":"Tucked away behind a garden wall on Queen Caroline Street, The Gate is the best vegetarian restaurant I&#39;ve been to in town. <br><br>I took along one steadfast meat eater and by the end, he was converted too. Beautifully decorated, chilled and happy with a delicious and vast menu - The Gate is a rare vegetarian treat. A restaurant so good the fact that it only serves meat free food shouldn&#39;t put anyone off. <br><br>You get what you pay for, so it&#39;s best saved as a pay day treat. Personally I prefer a lunch time here as it&#39;s not quite got the &#34;date&#34; vibe, but more dinner with friends.",

"reviewcomment":"Binchooooo!<br>I used to LOVE this place (especially when I could eat for half price on the tastecard, or when they do special offers with vouchers in Japanese newspapers...) but for some reason I didn&#39;t come back here for a few years, so I forgot how happy it makes me. Then my hens brought me back here last weekend for meat-munching joy with their set menu. It is actually a really good place to come with a large group...<br><br>Stuff I looove:<br>- The unagi!! I know unagi is not a traditional yakitori dish, but they do it sooo well here! I wish more sushi places could serve unagi as good as that. Om nom nom.<br>- The bacon-wrapped things (asparagus and bacon or tomato and bacon...) But be careful with the tomatoes they are little bombs of heat, so WAIT form them to cool before you eat them!!<br>- And of course all the usual meat-on stick type yakitori (tsukune, Negime, tebasaki... even chicken gizzards) <br>- The ochazuke - because it is the perfect way to fill you up, and end the meal<br>- The deserts (always gorgeous if slightly over priced)<br><br>Stuff I&#39;m less keen on:<br>- They always seem to run out of the cheaper umeshu (or maybe my friends always drink too much?) it almost seems like a ploy to make us pay for the more expensive stuff...?<br>- The staff can be quite hard to flag down",

The food really does taste fresh and well made, and the service is always friendly and attentive even when they&#39;re busy. It&#39;s not five-star fancy dining, but it&#39;s not trying to be. The place always feels clean and welcoming and smells delicious. What more do you want in a solid lunch spot? <br><br>Full disclosure, I&#39;ve also been in here drunk for dinner. They didn&#39;t treat us like the drunk slobs we were, and I appreciate them for that. There&#39;s also beer here to keep drinking. Delicious all around.",

The only drawback is on a Sunday it can get quite crowded. And there are a lot of smokers out on the patio. Also they had some kind of special barbecue going on Sunday. Be warned it is self-service which actually makes things go a little faster if you&#39;re pushy. By the way the desserts are not to be missed especially the toffee pudding. Also if you have kids it&#39;s only two blocks from Regent Park and a terrific playground.",

"reviewcomment":"There&#39;s been quite a lot of hype around Five Guys, and well, I think much of it is justified. The interior may be similar to McDonalds in some ways, but in all other ways the comparison is completely off: the quality of the burger and chips is immeasurably better, and I love the option to order as many or as few sauces as one wants. The prices may be rather higher for the £8 double patty burger, but it&#39;s very filling too (far more so than a Big Mac) - the smaller, single patty burger for £5 should not be overlooked in your quest to satisfy your hunger. Five Guys also deserve credit for using and preparing their burgers freshly - something that McDonalds certainly cannot claim to do.<br><br>There are oddities and inconveniences here too. Chief oddity is all the endorsements on the wall from little-known US regional publications.. circa 2008 (?!). Chief inconvenience is the wait, both to get into the restaurant (a rope and door attendant regulates access) and to be served. So you may want to pick your moment to sample what Five Guys have to offer. <br><br>Overall though, Five Guys are definitely worth checking out. And as a new entry in London&#39;s already saturated burger market, that&#39;s saying something.",

(spicy)<br>The classic dishes are, Thai green curry and pad Thai, loving there style of calamari.<br><br>The drinks are lovely especially the Guava Bellini.   (small in size but packs a punch).<br><br>The Cons... Sharing a big table with various other diners . ( stop looking at me) lol<br><br>I must admit over the years they had more of a wide range menu, but the menu has been limited to the various classic dishes. <br><br>One of the drinks they used to offer was Cherry bollen soda, love it! Has been removed.( Not happy. )<br><br>Overall it is one of my spots to go to in west-end after a long day shopping, to catch up with my friends and enjoy some tasty dishes.",

The meal fed both of us. We loved how tender the chicken was ... we always seem to lament the chicken we get back in the States. The veggies fresh and the tamarind sauce - just right. Noodles were prefect and not too sticky. <br><br>We loved it!! Definitely a great fast, easy, and affordable choice in the SoHo district!",

Stairs to the basement lead to a nice place with 6 foosball tables, 4 of them next to each other, two separate, a set of couches and some tables and a bar. <br><br>This is a great place to book for team building events. The whole of the basement can be booked. They make good sandwiches too. At my current firm I regularly visit this place. Twice a year, we have a foosball tournament here. <br><br>I love the ambiance. Everyone is screaming out names of the foosball players and encouraging and having drinks, taking breaks to bite a sandwich, it so full of life. The bartenders are also very helpful. They fix the foosball tables if something is not working. <br><br>I totally recommend trying this out.",

This place is very spacious with dinning tables &amp; bars located upstairs and down. <br><br>The menu has a delicious farm to table menu. I highly recommend the charcuterie plate for an appetizer and the Suffolk Chicken for dinner. The sauces that accompany the dishes have remarkable flavor. I am torn between the classic gravy and the red wine reduction sauces as my favorite.   <br><br>They also have a great selection of cocktails, wine, beer, and whiskey. My recommendations are the mint julep or the mojito if your seeking something fresh. Also, let&#39;s be honest one can&#39;t go wrong with a good bourbon or rum cocktail. <br><br>I recommend making reservations in advance. They get packed quickly in the evening between 6-8pm. <br><br>Of the two meals I have had there, I am yet to have room for dessert so stay tuned for an update. <br><br>Cheers!",

"reviewcomment":"Always busy, always noisy, so please don&#39;t complain about the noise. It&#39;s quite plain to see from outside that this place is positively heaving for most of the day. It&#39;s not surprising given its locale so keep that in mind and remember it&#39;s communal tables so don&#39;t try to fly while you eat :)<br><br>I treat Wagamama as an in and out experience. Order your food, scoff, pay and leave. The seating isn&#39;t comfortable and since this one is so crowded all the time, it&#39;s probably not a good idea to stay for no reason after you&#39;re done eating. <br><br>Eating here can be very economical if you steer clear of alcohol and dessert. Chicken katsu is a filling and cheap option, free green tea makes it a complete meal. I don&#39;t feel the ramen dishes are as filling but hey, if that&#39;s your thing than knock yourself out. Kare lomen is where I think it&#39;s at but the Wagamama ramen is pretty decent. Seafood hete is always nice and fresh. Sides and desserts are pricey so I would stay away if you&#39;re hoping to get a meal for under a tenner per head. <br><br>Wagamama&#39;s a safe bet. I will never claim that it&#39;s particularly good food but given that it&#39;s quick and available just about everywhere in London, it&#39;s one of the places I&#39;ve come to embrace as a sanctuary for the cold, weary and hungry.",

"reviewcomment":"One of the top 10 best meals I have ever had was at Woodlands. This is no slight compliment, as I&#39;ve eaten at many of the top restaurants in the U.S. The food was so flavorful and delicious that I worried that I was disturbing the man reading his newspaper next to me because I couldn&#39;t control my exclamations of delight as I was eating. <br><br>It&#39;s worth noting that I eat mostly vegetarian and that I am not an incredibly adventurous Indian food eater. So if you are a person that is constantly trying the most exotic, fiery hot things on the menu, we may have different palates. But no matter who you are, I doubt you&#39;ll feel misled if you take my advice and come here sometime - preferably while very hungry.<br><br>The decor of the restaurant is pretty clean and attractive. Nothing that really stood out to me. And the service is good but not great. It is really the food - and the vegetarian emphasis - that brings people here.<br><br>I personally loved the &#34;set meals&#34; which give you an appetizer, large main course consisting of 6-7 dishes of various foods, and dessert. My favorite one was the New Delhi, and I believe the one I liked second most, which my wife enjoyed, was called the London. They&#39;re the bottom two meals on that section of the menu. As far as bread, the dosa (crispy-yet-soft shell filled with potato-y goodness), latka-like potato pancake, and all forms of naan were delectable.<br><br>I only regret that I live 9 hours from London, or else I&#39;d come here once each month to treat myself.",

"reviewcomment":"We deliberately chose to visit this Wagamama, which is close to our heart as it was the first Wagamama we ever visited after discovering it at the back of Covent many years back.<br><br>I&#39;m sure many people have passed this Wagamama by without realising it was here and I suppose that is part of it&#39;s appeal, for those who know about it.<br><br>On our visit, my first impression was the broken tiles on the steps down, which made me a bit apprehensive, wondering if it had gone downhill.<br><br>On turning the corner I saw the welcoming sight of the wooden tables and benches, settling into the familiar ( yet somehow unique) decor of the Wagamama.<br><br>We ordered our drinks ( green tee is a must), but I noticed my glass had a few dirty marks. Our server resolved the issue immediately and not too long after our Goma Wakame Salad appeared followed by my wife&#39;s Chicken Katsu Curry. <br><br>Unfortunately it was sometime later, by which time my wife had almost finished her meal and the salad was over half way finished, before my Yasai Pad-Thai appeared. <br><br>Luckily it was so tasty and fresh, and after spending most of the afternoon walking around London from Kings cross, Waterloo before heading up to Covent garden.. I was  desperately in needing a good vegi meal, I have to say my wife didn&#39;t have long to wait.<br><br>We finalised our meal with some tasty and fresh juices as the deserts would have been too much for us.<br><br>Overall the experience was good, We understand that food appears once it&#39;s ready, but for some reason it appears that the vegetarian meals take longer? ( this is not the only Wagamama this has happened to us and we are starting to expect it )",

It was Sunday and I opted for the tomato soup and fish and chips.  The tomato soup was good and I would order again. The fish and chips was revolutionary and probably the best I&#39;ve had in my entire life. The batter was so crispy and delicious that they must have double fried it or simply dusted it with a bit of heaven.  Wow!  I can&#39;t wait to go again!",

"reviewcomment":"A few weeks ago I went to the Old Queens Head in Islington for a gig. I decided to go there early to have something for dinner.<br><br>When I arrived, the pub was quite full - this seems to be a popular place among the locals. But I was lucky enough to find a place at a table. For the food, I ordered the sliders and fries. While the fries were good, but not extraordinary, the sliders were excellent. Just a bit small, I should probably have ordered six instead of three. There are three different sliders available with one veggie option. And I must admit, that I quite enjoyed the veggie slider. <br><br>Later I went upstairs to the gig. The room offers lots of comfy places and service throughout the gig - good if you are hungry or thirsty, a bit annoying if you are there mainly for the music. But overall it was fine. <br><br>The lineup was quite extensive, raging from singer songwriter artists with a voice and a guitar to complete bands. The sound was fine and some of the artists were really good. The Old Queens Head is definitely a place I will keep in mind when searching for gigs in the future.",

"reviewcomment":"One of the best yelp finds since we arrived in London!  Normally you need a reservation for this location but since it was early on a Monday evening we were able to be seated with no problem.   An extremely warm and welcoming women (maybe owner) explained Okonomiyaki to us.  I&#39;ve only heard of this but have never eaten it.  OH MY GOD Okonomiyaki!!!!  I had to make a formal apology to my stomach and soul for denying both for so long.  Okonomiyaki is a &#34;pancake&#34;  that consists of a batter made of flour and grated yam &#34;nagaimo&#34;, shredded cabbage and egg. You can top your pancake with an endless list of choices.   It took us a while to decide what to order but finally selected.  I had prawns and squid and my husband chose the Kobe beef.  Both were cooked on a flat top in the middle of our table by our very experienced  waitress.  Each one was topped with two sauces, fish flake and dried seaweed flake.  It was one of the best things I&#39;ve eaten in a very long time.  The service, food and overall experience was one of the food highlights of our London trip.",

Heaps of delighted tourists loading up plates with gooey orange meats at the all-you-can-eat isn&#39;t quite what I&#39;m looking for.<br><br>Glad I checked Yelp and popped into this little noodle shop (err, bar?). There is indeed a final station of hot counter food to ensnare you, but walk on by that and be astounded by the noodle soups they do at the benches in the back.<br><br>I noticed all the other Chinese folks were getting the knife-cut noodles with slow cooked beef, so I knew I couldn&#39;t go wrong. Watched the chef slice and dice &#39;em up fresh, and after a few dollops of the chili sauce, the steaming bowl of noodles was perfect. Big chunks of meltingly soft beef with a hint of tendon, and the broth itself isn&#39;t just a faceslam of MSG.<br><br>A meal on the heavier side, but great to warm you up! Definitely coming back, and the prices are reasonable (around £6 for everything).",

"reviewcomment":"ACCOMMODATIONS<br><br>I had just moved to London and this was the hotel I was selected to be accommodated in. <br><br>My first impression when I walked through the door was a 10! The staff was very attentive to customers arriving and if there was a wait. The lobby smelled of fresh flowers and daily there were fresh settings. <br><br>Despite asking for an early check in my room was not yet ready but the gentleman at the check in counter had worked his magic to move me to a room that was available. Quick and painless overall. <br><br>Room accommodations are very spacious with a lovely marble bathroom equipped with a good size soaking tub and duel headed shower with great pressure. Turn down, laundry/dry cleaning and room service were top notch.<br><br>FOOD &amp; DRINK<br><br>The first marvel that caught my eye being from the US was the extensive bourbon collection the JW Steakhouse had. Robert the barman was very knowledgeable of their stock and it was nice that he too had an appreciation for the craft. I was impressed with not only some of the rare small batch bourbons on the shelves but that they barrel mixed cocktails as well. They also have a great selection of beers, tonic, cider and wine. Enjoy a meal on their outside heated patio overlooking Hyde Park. <br><br>Breakfast Buffett is the way to go for price and options for the hungry patron. I highly recommend the lobster and any aged steak on the steakhouse menu...all cooked and seasoned to perfection. <br><br>They also offer afternoon tea and other dinner selections in an adjacent room across from the Steakhouse &amp; Starbucks. <br><br>I enjoyed sitting in the library near the fireplace to unwind in the evening with a drink of choice which came complimentary with crisps and nuts. <br><br>PRICE<br>This is Mayfair...enough said :)<br><br>INTERNET/WIFI<br><br>Free public WIFI offered in the lobby/library and dining areas. Pricey purchase for availability in the room unless you have a suite, then it&#39;s included.",

"reviewcomment":"So let&#39;s let the cat out of the bag. This place is amazing. <br><br>First off, yes, this bar has a cat. And it wears a cat sized Jacobean ruff. And his name is Tom Paine (after the revolutionary I assume). And he wanders the bar and does whatever the hell he wants and does not mind if you take pictures of him, but really, he&#39;s just going for his food and water, which is on the bar. <br><br>And he wears a tiny freakin Shakespearean Jacobean ruff! (I know I&#39;ve said it already, but seriously!) <br><br>This is an old man&#39;s pub with a lawyer theme, which makes it feel even older. Long bar with seats as you walk in and lots of rooms to sit in if the bar is taken up. There are props from lawyer films and courtrooms throughout the space, all which look they they were hung there centuries ago and never moved or dusted. But my god, the charm of this spot. It&#39;s amazing.<br><br>Good ale selection, nothing fancy, just classic beers. Amazing food selection. This is not your typical pub fare, but classic pasta, meat and cheese dishes. I got the roast beef with horseradish sauce and potato salad, all three things I love. The meat was fine, basic well cooked meat, but the potato salad was one of the best I&#39;ve ever had in my life. Made with homemade mayo and herbs, each bite blew my mind.<br><br>The staff were quick but cheeky, answering my questions with sly answers (I go how long does it take to make the food. She goes, &#34;Hmmm, 45 minutes.&#34; &#34;Really?&#34; I say. &#34;No,&#34; she says, &#34;This is a pub.&#34;) <br><br>Loved this pub, love everything about it.

"reviewcomment":"As with any other country-specific foods, I suppose, where there is a &#39;correct&#39; taste to these dishes, it was the authenticity of the vibrant Malaysian flavours which I was eager to judge during my dining experience at C&amp;R in Chinatown.<br><br>C&amp;R boasts an extensive menu of all the Malaysian/Singaporean favourites, from *real* Singapore Fried Noodles to nasi lemak, from chendol to ice kacang. And they just had to, had to, had to throw in the Asian-dining-in-Europe quintessential: Pad Thai.<br><br>The portions are exceptionally huge for some reason, but it makes me feel alright about spending £6.50 on my mountain of mee siam which is SG$3.50 (£1.75) in Singapore for a more sensible portion.<br><br>It&#39;s a little unfair, but my mum makes the best mee siam in the world, so I can&#39;t say that this dish was brilliant. Unlike the version served in a milky, spicy soup back home, this is the original &#39;dry&#39; version which is truly Malaysian. These noodles were surprisingly spicy for my standards, let alone for the poor tongues of the British. I downed the iced Milo in the background quickly, but the spiciness lingered. Before the chilli became torturous, I did enjoy the noodles, which were tasty enough with a fragrance of bean-paste, and came with prawns, tried tofu, beansprouts, fried egg and some veggies. If I&#39;m not wrong, the lemon wedge should have been a lime instead.<br><br>Char kway teow is also another extremely popular dish of Malaysia and Singapore. It is described as &#39;broad rice noodles stir-fried with egg, prawn, fishcake and bean sprouts.&#39; This dish was actually of the average Singaporean standard, but then again, with black sauce, everything usually comes out okay. I&#39;m glad they added in the chives, which are necessary for a great taste and texture contrast, together with the crunchy bean sprouts, an added yay-factor.<br><br>I definitely recommend sharing one dish between two diners, (unless you&#39;re a big guy/not having dessert/skipped breakfast/trying to gain weight) or taking away the leftovers. (Additional cost of 50p) Singaporeans and Malaysians will rejoice at this eatery which serves all our authentic local favourites at a good value.",

"reviewcomment":"Good spot for Cuban food fix. I ordered the Pollo con aguacate (Steamed chicken breast with a parmesan cream sauce, avocados and coriander. Served with rice, black beans &amp; plantain). Personally it was too creamy for me...but that&#39;s just my preference. The taste was good and the chicken was not dry, which is always my fear when ordering chicken breasts. The cream sauce was delicious for those parmesan cream lovers. The rice and beans were good (hard to mess up). The plantains were a bit disappointing. It was more like banana chips  as opposed to the expected traditional way of preparing plantains...not to mention 2 chip pieces. From my Cuban food experience, when plantain is on the menu, it&#39;s not this. <br><br>I liked how the inside was all Cuban decor. Has a good ambiance and loved how the music wasn&#39;t blaring so loud you have to shout throughout the meal. From some of the posted pictures, I thought that the inside would be super dark, but it was actually nicely lit and cozy feeling. <br><br>We also ordered the Ropa vieja a la Cubana (&#34;Old Rags&#34; A Cuban favourite Shredded braised beef in a sauce of herbs, fresh tomatoes, onions and sweet peppers Served with rice, yucca (cassava) &amp; plantain). I will be ordering this on the next visit.",

"reviewcomment":"+ Great food<br>+ Nice ambience in a lovely neighbourhood <br>+ Both classical British food and inventive dishes <br>+ Always busy <br>+ Therefore, it can be a bit noisy and crowded<br><br>Overall: <br>The pub was already packed with people celebrating the end of week when we got there just before 6 for an early dinner. The area at the front of pub was SO noisy as people (mostly post work drinkers) were practically shouting to each other to make themselves heard over excessively loud music from the speakers. But they found a table for us in a smallish dining room at the back. <br><br>The back room was much quieter. In contrast to the bar area, the customers in the back room consisted mostly of families and couples with hairy dogs (like the ones rich people have). My seat was a little tight as the tables are laid out quite closely to each other. But I didn&#39;t mind. I only care about food. <br><br>Thomas Cubitt is a great gastro pub that serves great modern British food. The dining bar with warm wooden furniture has abundant of natural light from large windows that look out to Elisabeth Street.  <br>I&#39;ve only eaten downstairs but they also have a formal dining room upstairs for posh people. They have separate menu there. I&#39;ve only looked at their website but the upstairs room seem a little too formal and stuffy for my taste. <br><br>Food: <br>I ordered pumpkin, quinoa and green apple salad. The salad was great. <br>Red quinoa and pumpkin add a pleasant texture to the fresh spinach laves. Red cabbage and the yogurt based mustard dressing help combine all the individual ingredients. However, the star of this dish is the green apple. The firm and fresh apples introduce the nature zing and delightful juiciness to this salad. The fish and chips my friend ordered was great too.",

Which would make the institution non-profit.<br><br>Soho rents are expensive as you-know-what - so having free rent, goodwill and a very charitable orientation does AMAZING things for food prices.<br><br>(Always useful in London where it practically costs two pounds a minute just to breathe air.)<br><br>How is the food?<br><br>a) This is a vegetarian place.<br><br>b) There are a very limited number of items on the menu.<br><br>c) These items will rock your socks off.<br><br>Of especial note are paneer (cheese) dishes which are of absolute distinction.  Fire-y hot, with great complex taste in the sauce, and cheese with a rich fantastic comforting taste.<br><br>(Mediocre commercial paneer tastes like cardboard tofu with worse texture. Good paneer is very hard to find.)<br><br>A terrific thick mango yogurt dessert that is like mango lassi that found godhead just before being put onto your tray.<br><br>Pappadam with a warm resonant grain-like flavor from the cooked flour itself and not artificially spiked with the spice that was dumped into the batter. Most lesser pappadams are tasteless crackers with spice camouflage. I could have eaten the pappadams alone all night and been happy.<br><br>Tremendous dals and vegetable curries and an interesting peppered vegetable rice.<br><br>Six zillion desserts - most Western (but homemade and vegetarian - but some Indian as well.<br><br>Note that their food is unbelievably filling. I ordered the 13 pound extravaganza because I was hungry.<br><br>Plus - as the Brazilians say - I am really good with a fork.<br><br>Taking the standard platter that was half of the size of what I ordered would have filled me up for hours.<br><br>But the food is not at all heavy - and god, is it tasty.<br><br>Note that I have not seen this place reviewed in any of the Cheap Eats or published tourist restaurant ratings books - and yet to my mind, this is one of the best cheap food deals in London - and certainly one of the better Indian meals in London.<br><br>This food is so good, you might even be tempted to join their religion!",

Must have been a glitch, but were not made to feel bad for this and were quickly included. Thank you. Thus we missed the start and the starting cocktail which is a shame.<br><br>Seemed like a nice bar.

"reviewcomment":"Disclaimer: I&#39;ve never been to Vietnam and don&#39;t know what &#39;real&#39; pho tastes like. ALL I WANT IS TASTY, SATISFYING FOOD AT A GOOD PRICE! And on my list of such places, Cay Tre is right up there. I only ever pop in for Pho and can&#39;t comment on anything else but OOOOOH THE BROTH - hearty, rich and beefy (and maybe a little sweeter than I&#39;d like) but still so so good. Halfway through the meal you look at your bowl and notice how the soup&#39;s surface glistens, and you smile, thinking oh yessssss, fat is flavour.<br><br>We decided to try the &#39;add-ons&#39; this time round. The option to add Chinese &#39;you tiao&#39; (fried dough) threw me off a little (that doesn&#39;t seem very &#39;authentic&#39; but I wouldn&#39;t know..) And for £2 you only get two extra meatballs :( They&#39;re good - firm with little spots of melt in your mouth goodness but idk if they&#39;re worth a pound each :(((( Their tendons were a real surprise though! I&#39;m not usually a fan - so often they&#39;re crunchy and bitty and unpleasant overall but ahhhh these had that magical QQ quality! Soft, gelatinous, not so much chewy but has good &#39;bite&#39;, a little tasteless, but boy has it made a tendon convert out of me!<br><br>The restaurant&#39;s quite loud and service definitely could be better (it sometimes takes a while to get their attention) but the long and short of it is that I&#39;ve been to Cay Tre many many times now and I&#39;ll keep coming back! I&#39;ve also heard good things about the other dishes, maybe next time we&#39;ll give them a try.",

"reviewcomment":"Galvin at Windows, featuring head chef Joo Won, is a gorgeous Michelin-starred restaurant overlooking Hyde Park in the London Hilton at Park Lane. The staff is knowledgeable, friendly, and even playful for such a usually serious atmosphere. One of our servers was a bit overbearing, but she lightened up by the end.<br><br>We were lucky enough to get a reservation right by the windows! I wish we came during a greener season, but the view was still beautiful.<br><br>We had their set lunch menu with a starter, main course, and dessert. Fortunately, there were 5 of us, so we had a great family-style tasting of each dish.<br><br>One of the starters, seared scallop with caviar had a rich, buttery foam and could have passed for an entree. It was so great. The smoked haddock fritters, Moroccan couscous &amp; lemon yogurt were my second favorite starter.<br><br>My risotto was a bit too rich/creamy for my taste, but a side of their seasoned carrots and lightly dressed salad really evened things out.<br><br>I highly recommend this place -- the set menu is delicious and does not require you to put out a lot of money for what you get. Yum! They even gave us postcards to send to our friends/family, and sent them off for us!",

"reviewcomment":"I&#39;m a fan of Wagamama. It&#39;s uniform in its quality and presentation because that stuff is important in a chain restaurant which really rocks my boat. It was a good choice for an early quick dinner close to where I had just finished work before I had to head out for the evening. I felt like a secret agent trying to find this branch though. It&#39;s behind an Oxfam bookshop just down the road from the British Museum. It&#39;s also in the basement. So that was um... nice. I don&#39;t care about it being in the basement really but it was rather difficult to track down so do beware of that. <br><br>I&#39;m not a huge ramen fan so I don&#39;t go to Wagamama too often but I&#39;m very partial to their prawn kare lomen and free green tea :) This time around I decided to take the plunge and finally give their chicken katsu a try. <br><br>Service was fast and efficient. It was quiet when I arrived and only two other parties were there. It was only about 5pm so I guess we were all ordering off the early bird menu. My katsu arrived in under 5 minutes, steaming hot and beautifully presented. The two pieces of chicken were very crisp and tasted great, the rice was well cooked (I&#39;m a rice snob so it&#39;s a good thing they get it right) and there was plenty of it. There was a side salad which I was grateful for since I can&#39;t stand meals that don&#39;t include some sort of rabbit food. The one criticism I have is that the katsu sauce tasted quite artificial. I can&#39;t describe it but if you&#39;ve ever cooked with those golden curry cubes or had a curry pot noodle, then you probably know what I&#39;m talking about. <br><br>Oh well, I won&#39;t complain too much. Dinner cost me just under a tenner, the tea was free and I was in and out in under 20 minutes. Just the remedy for a busy day when the only option for dinner seemed to be Pret.",

The flat breads are great way to start, especially the one with goat cheese and caramelised onion and you can&#39;t also go wrong with the short ribs. Overall a really wonderful dinner with great service.

"reviewcomment":"I went to this place with my friend because she had recommended it to me. <br><br>Located on Middlesex street, really close to the Liverpool underground station, this place looked incredible with its design. As soon as you walk in, you find this Chinese inspired decorations, from big vases to beautiful chandeliers, this place felt great.<br><br>The staff, while being respectful and friendly, weren&#39;t that talkative. I expected a courteous treatment from smiling to asking if we needed any help, but that&#39;s a minor thing to complain about. We ordered rice, plain noodles, spicy beef and chicken that came in a bowl over a small fire. I love spicy food and so the spicy beef was a good treat. It was, however, a bit too oily for my taste, but other than that it was a delight. The plain noodles were... Well, plain, but that&#39;s exactly what I wanted. My friend had the rice, so I wouldn&#39;t know how it tasted. As for the chicken, it wasn&#39;t bone and skin-free which was a bit surprising for me. My friend had explained to me that there is the bone and skin free variety which we could have ordered.<br><br>Now to the prices. The prices were high on the average end. Meaning, most dishes cost around 8 pounds and you&#39;d have to order everything separately. Like the beef costs 8 or 10 and noodles cost 4. So expect to pay something from 10-20 pounds per person. I did notice they had set meals which could be a better options for those watching their wallet&#39;s diet.<br><br>All in all, I found the place nice and it&#39;s definitely worth a visit if you haven&#39;t tried it before. I think I will try it again in the near future!",

"reviewcomment":"Masala Zone is an Indian restaurant with several locations around London. I visited the Earls Court location and really enjoyed the experience. The atmosphere of this place made me feel like I was back in India with the dark setting and the aroma from the kitchen.   <br><br>We ordered a variety of starters including the Sev Puri and Dahi Puri.  They were all delicious and I could have eaten it all by myself! For my main course, I chose the thali which is a traditional Indian platter loaded with little bowls of various treats.  Everything I tried was good.  <br><br>The most amusing thing for me about this place is fact that they had Masala Coke.  I first had a Masala Coke in Delhi, India.  I remember tasting this creation on the streets of Delhi thinking that my friends had pulled a joke on me.  It was quite possibly the worst thing I&#39;d ever tasted.  So when I saw this rancid thing on the menu here at Masala Zone, I realized that my friends back in India had not pulled a joke on me.  I had to try it again here at Masala Zone and while it still wasn&#39;t very good, it was a lot better than the one I had back in Delhi.  <br><br>4 stars for Masala Coke and making me feel like I was back in India.",

"reviewcomment":"In short: tasty food, pretty restaurant, attentive service...but missing the &#34;x factor&#34; for a 5th star.<br><br>We were here for Sunday lunch, when the restaurant was surprisingly empty.   I was initially disappointed that there was no brunch menu; it was unclear why (other reviews seem to indicate there used to be brunch available) and I think they&#39;re missing a key market opportunity.  Oh well, the rest of the menu looked tasty anyway!<br><br>And tasty it was.  I had the mussels and fries while my friends both got Sunday roasts.  We all kept raving about the food -- it was fresh and cooked to perfection.  It was nothing overly unique, but it didn&#39;t need to be and wasn&#39;t trying for that approach.<br><br>Likewise, the atmosphere was simple, bright and classy, and the service was attentive and gracious.  Nothing about this place was trying to be trendy; it was clearly meant to be &#34;just&#34; a delicious meal in a nice setting.  <br><br>The whole effect came across as enjoyable but a tad bit boring to this twenty-something.  It would be a great choice for lunch with mom or a business meal, but perhaps worth trying somewhere else for a lively &#34;guess what I did last night&#34; Sunday brunch.<br><br>Side note: Based on some other reviews, it seems like the place might be a lot livelier in the evening for drinks -- I would definitely give that a try, especially if the cocktails are as good as the food was!",

I&#39;m not big on spice so everything had just the right amount of kick and was pretty flavourful. The portions were huge so couldn&#39;t finish mine but definitely would have if I had the room.

"reviewcomment":"My boyfriend, I dare say like most men, loves meat. I am not so keen on it though I&#39;ll eat a bit from time to time. But from all the good things I hear about Rodizio Rico, I figured bring him there on our anniversary.<br>So don&#39;t go here if you&#39;re looking for a romantic dinner XD Thankfully we weren&#39;t, I just like food and he&#39;s not too picky. The price is a bit high but you get a lot for your money, and you could sit there for hours if you really wanted to. They have steaks, chicken, pork, everything. I actually did enjoy it even though I don&#39;t like most meat; they have lots of salads and hot dishes you can help yourself to (RICE AND BEANS DONE RIGHT IN LONDON???). I would say that if you&#39;re a vegetarian, it&#39;s probably not worth the money for the vegetarian thing which is just the salads. Though they&#39;re nice, it&#39;s not going to fill you up much, in my opinion.<br>The boyfriend loved it. He&#39;s a huge steak eater and they cut it so that you can choose whether you want a bit more well done slices or bits that are a little more &#39;bloody&#39;.<br>The service is great and fast. There weren&#39;t many people around when we went so we got everything fresh off the spit :D Not sure if I&#39;d go again any time soon, but it&#39;s great for special occasions.",

"reviewcomment":"Definitely one of the best Italian restaurants in London. While I was visiting my dear friend in London, she and her boyfriend took me to this, supposedly, one of Victoria Beckham&#39;s favorite restaurants. The decor was very classy and staff was very pleasant. <br><br>Our waiter brought a bread box and a mini-pizza plate with smile in the beginning. There were many different kind of bread in the box, and I had to try all the bread and rolls. They were delicious, but I had to stop as I didn&#39;t want to be full before ordering a real meal. We ordered a bottle of wine and several appetizers. We ordered Octopus Carpaccio, Salad, and Tomato soup (can&#39;t remember the name). I also had to order Watermelon martini since it was special on that day and looked very cute. It was very delicious.<br><br>We ordered Seafood pasta, Seafood risotto, Chicken dish (again, can&#39;t remember the names of the dishes...). The waiter explained about each dish with Italian accent (cute!). The foods were just delicious. We were really enjoying our conversation during dinner, and the waiter commented that we seemed very happy people with the accent (I guess I just loved the Italian accent). <br><br>We then had Tiramisu, gelato, Chocolate tart, and cream crape with another baked custard on top ( Can&#39;t remember the name...I&#39;m so bad...). We also had cappuccino that was just perfect. The waiter brought a pastry plate along with all the desserts we ordered, and our table was full of sweets that made me very happy. <br><br>We stayed for like two hours to finish all the food, and all this time, everyone here, the waiter, the sommelier, and the dessert guy (there was another waiter brought the dessert plate to show us Dolci of that day) were very pleasant. <br><br>I will be visiting London again soon, and I would definitely like to come back here again.",

"reviewcomment":"I loved this place!. This is the first time I&#39;ve seen anything like this. The theme of the restaurant is epic. There are Chilli Challenges, which you can try.<br>So this is more like a burger place which serves great choice of drinks also. <br>I had a Red Chilli cheese burger. It was really good. Juicy and amazing with a little bit of spiciness. Loved it. I didn&#39;t go for anything else like fries as I thought it would be too heavy. The burger wasn&#39;t as big as I expected but it was filling though. I chose a drink that I had never tried before that day. It is called Bitter and Twisted. And just as the name suggested it was bitter towards the beginning and the taste got twisted into something sweet as you gulped it. It was like a mix of beer and ale. <br>There was a sort of milkshake I wanted to try, but thinking about the fact that I had to go back to work and code again, I avoided it. The heavy lunch would put me to sleep for sure. <br>This was a team lunch, with my coworkers. So we all had a variety of stuff. I&#39;m pretty sure if you are a meat lover you will love this place. There is also one vegetarian option. Halloumi and Mushrooms! Neither my co-workers nor I was interested in checking that out. So you can share your review of that item with me when you try it. <br>I totally recommend going here.",

"reviewcomment":"I really wanted to give this place a 3 and a half, but Yelp! don&#39;t do things by halves!.<br><br>I had heard about Mishkin&#39;s quite a bit and was curious.  When the Yelp! Book Club came up and there was a tenuous link between the book and Mishkin&#39;s I opted for that.<br><br>So, first impressions.  The place seemed hectic and the staff harried.<br><br>The took a long to time to serve, first to take the orders and then to recieve them.  Whilst refereshing, I found my Diamond Fizz a watery disappointment.  Although, for a reasonable £7.50 I guess I can&#39;t complain. <br><br>Now, in the food department this is where Mishkin&#39;s excels.  I had a half portion of the blue cheese and portobello mushroom Macaroni cheese and a the beetroot, feta and cumin salsa slider.  Both delicious, but the slider in particular was stand out!  Beetroot and feta patty is an interesting and imaginative veggie option.  Great combination of flavours that I found enjoyably satisfying to eat.  <br><br>They could have saved themselves with the food but we decided to go for some grown up milkshakes - milkshake with a shot of alcohol of your choice!  I was all excited with anticipation.  After another long wait what was presented in front of me was milk with flavouring - THIS IS NOT A MILKSHAKE!  A real milkshake should pretty much be almost melting ice-cream so thick and creamy you can barely suck it through a straw.  This was not the case here - another disappointment.<br><br>All in all, I would recommend the place for the food, but given the anti-climactic drinks and extremely slow service you might be better off just getting take-out - which they do.",

So i went out on a monday, don&#39;t judge me. Mexican-esqe vibe, low ceilings, candles, lots of tequilas. Really chill. <br><br>The bartenders were attentive, the crowd fun and there was enough room to have your personal space but still close enough to people if need be. The music can be a bit loud, but it was otherwise really fun. <br><br>I don&#39;t remember what I had because I just  told the bartender to make me something juicy and awesome like me.. and it was. Something with grapefruit and bubbles. Twas nice.",

"reviewcomment":"I came here for a celebratory anniversary dinner with my girlfriend, returning after an office Christmas party a few years ago, and we had a wonderful meal.<br><br>We started with gravadlax with potato latkes and pierogi. The gravadlax was succulent and smoky, tender and delicious. The latkes were crispy and I really enjoyed them, delicious with the sour cream topping.<br><br>The pierogi were a big hit with us both and I would happily have ordered the bigger portion!<br><br>For main courses my girlfriend had the spiced lamb and I ordered venison with a grilled pear. I asked for this to be cooked as the chef saw fit.<br><br>The venison was fantastic, cooked very rare and swimming in delicious juices as well as the excellent sauce it came with. I really enjoyed this and the presentation was excellent.<br><br>I tried some of the lamb too and was really impressed with this, I almost had food envy!! Interestingly the lamb tasted more like something I would expect from a Moroccan restaurant; the flavours and spices were very North African and wouldn&#39;t have been out of place in a Tagine.<br><br>Although this was a little surprising this was no bad thing and it was delicious.<br><br>Service was very attentive and quite formal, not what I&#39;m used to but this is more of an upclass dining establishment. As we were dining two days after Christmas the restaurant was very very quiet, although the privacy was nice this did throw me a little! I would have preferred a little background chatter, but perhaps next time. <br><br>I would definitely recommend. If you&#39;re a beer drinker try and Pszeniczniak, delicious.",

"reviewcomment":"Planet Hollywood is located right next to the Cineworld at Haymarket, and so it is a somewhat regular place for me to go to if I fancy a drink before a movie (Cineworld is great in many other respects, but it doesn&#39;t serve a good selection of alcohols). <br>The place is not too expensive, at least by the standards of the location. But it&#39;s quite glitzy. The bar area has a number of television sets which continuously show some sports or musical programmes or wish customers, not all of them kids, on their birthdays. <br>They have quite a good and extensive cocktail menu. They make a really good &#34;Long Island Iced Tea&#34;. They serve the drink after mixing the Coke well with the alcohol, just the way I like it. <br>I haven&#39;t eaten at Planet Hollywood very often, but there is one dish there that I love. It&#39;s their world famous chicken crunch. The four pieces of fried chicken breast are served with a fantastic creole mustard sauce and carrots. The coating of the chicken is slightly sweet, which goes very well with the mustard. I order this quite frequently with my drink. <br>The bartenders here, unlike most in London, do like to talk and they also enjoy their conversations with customers, at least with the interesting ones like me ;) I have many reasons to keep returning.",

"reviewcomment":"I confess, it&#39;s not a regular tipple of mine but still, every now and then it&#39;s a nice way to spend an evening (or afternoon).<br><br>I believe the bar is actually called Searcy&#39;s but Grand Champagne Bar is a pretty good description of just what this place is about anyway. Plush looking with a central bar area and two long, narrow stems of seating reaching out from either side ensures that this bar covers quite an area. Service is available at the bar but table service is the norm here and the staff have been attentive in my experience.<br><br>Obviously the sparkly stuff is the order of the day here and they have it in abundance from prices as low as one could reasonably expect from a classy establishment all the way up to the bottles which may as well be marked &#39;Are you having a laugh?&#39;. Numerous nibbles as well as some cocktails are also available.<br><br>There is an inside bar here too, which I haven&#39;t been in to yet, so expect a review update when this happens. This is more likely now that winter is blustering in and the platform/outside (but not out-outside) bar does get chilly. We left our coats on last time but it&#39;ll only get more discomforting in the really wintry months.<br><br>Also, just a note on the service. Last time I was here, midway through a bottle a bill was dumped on our table and payment or a bank card for a tab was more or less demanded. Clearly quite disgruntled at being interrupted like this - it was done rather discourteously - apologies were forthcoming and complimentary snacks were also brought out after a brief remonstration but the act was more than a little unexpected. An equivalent would be inviting a person over to your house and then bringing the vacuum cleaner out when you&#39;re done with them. We were reassured a little that it has become more of a standard practise for them as a number of customers have fled without paying their bill. Though I understand this and I&#39;ll learn to be less affronted should it happen again, the situation could have been avoided if approached more tactfully. So now you know.<br><br>Aside from that one incident - proper lush!<br><br>TTFN<br>Ian",

"reviewcomment":"fantastic restaurant. worth every penny you spend here. the interior really makes you say &#39;Wow&#39;! you don&#39;t see much when you walk in, but as you enter you get that richness vibe in it. There&#39;s even a Waterfall inside the restaurant.<br>It could get better in their service. I found it very very slow for a such a classy restaurant, sometimes its even unbearable. I ordered for a glass of wine, and this guys runs with this glass full of wine several reminders later, with things dripping all over. First of all, i wouldn&#39;t even touch the glass, but hold it by the stem..uhm uhm..not here! which is a put off...<br><br>Food was excellent, it could be classified as one of the Finest Indian restaurants as close to home I could get. Had tears in my eyes after tasting their &#39;Hyderabadi Dum Briyani&#39;, and Goa&#39;n Fish curry. Portions are small, so order for yourself and others. Can&#39;t share....you will not share :)...as it is so yummy. <br><br>Very pricey, and they add their service charge of 12.5% to every bill also...so watch out before you pay a tip. <br>We were given a table around a large group with a family of kids, hence it was a bit too noisy, with kids playing around you, but thats not their fault i guess!! Would go back for sure.!",

"reviewcomment":"Me and a few friends went to Maxwells two weeks ago as a friend of ours and her boyfriend were visiting from Brussels. There was seven of us on a Friday night. Where to go for dinner? We were lucky to be able to get into Maxwells with just a little wait. About 15 minutes and we were seated and got menus. Since we had already gotten drinks from the bar while waiting the waiter did not have to get us any. He seemed a little disappointed when we ordered only food.<br><br>The food was good, some had Mexican food while a friend of mine and me had a tranditional burger. At GBP 10.95 for a burger I was hoping for a good one. Luckily, it was and it certainly was enough to deal with my appetite.<br><br>We had a few more drinks and when paying, we added a little tip (to cover the service charge - I think service charge is inappropriate for a small group but hey, instead of a tip ...).<br><br>All in all, good food, not too long wait even on a Friday ...",

"reviewcomment":"Spicy, finally!<br><br>This is one of the classic spots I love: small, one room restaurant, hidden in an anonymous road.<br><br>Your table will be prepared when you arrive, it&#39;s very casual and you&#39;ll feel a lot relaxed!<br>We were a group of 8 people, so I basically have the opportunity to try everything, and every single dish was just right!<br>ok so first of all you have to keep in mind that this is not a fake place: they are asian and they really mean it, when you order the extra spicy soup you&#39;ll definitely feel it!<br><br>So.. be prepared! order a nasi goreng, a pad thai or anything from the menu (it&#39;s not that long anyway!) and enjoy your asian food! Just a small suggestion: take two dishes, one can be a bit too small..<br><br>There is not that much to say, it&#39;s just a sweet, lovely place with proper and good asian food, cheap and casual! The only people who won&#39;t like this place are the ones who can&#39;t stand hot and spicy food: everything is spicy, and when I say I really do mean spicy!",

"reviewcomment":"My boyfriend and I ate here purely because of the Yelp rating and proximity to our hotel. The restaurant was under construction in the front so it was hard to see the name at night, but once we entered I really loved the atmosphere / decor and quickly forgot about the exterior.<br><br>We ordered the lemon rice, prawn masala, mango curry, malabar paratha, and pachadi. We also received some complimentary appetizers. Everything was absolutely delicious. My least favorite would probably be the prawn masala (I heard they were well-known for their seafood but this is probably for a different dish), but everything else was very flavorful and filling. I typically eat bread with my yogurt and the malabar paratha/pachadi mix was great - the pineapple and pomegranate mix balanced out the yogurt, which paired very well with our spicy dishes. I was skeptical about lemon rice (I was considering ordering the Tomato rice) but I&#39;m glad I went with it; the lemon rice and mango curry went very well together.<br><br>Throughout our meal, we had several different waiters serving us and asking about our experience, which was a bit confusing but I suppose better this than having no service at all :)<br><br>While ordering, I indicated that we only wanted the small prawn masala dish but we got charged for the large. I noted this to (one of) our server who immediately apologized and adjusted our bill. The manager (?) also apologized on our way out while holding the door open for us. I really appreciated this act of customer service.<br><br>Overall, I had a lovely time and would recommend this restaurant.",

"reviewcomment":"This is a great place for a casual dinner before a night out on the town. Compared to a few other Vietnamese places on Kingsland road, Tay Do can be a tad bit more costly (i.e. £1 more for pho). I favour Song Que for it&#39;s &#39;Special&#39; pho which includes tripe and tendon for the adventurous people. Nevertheless, Tay Do does the trick. The bowls of noodle soup are generous and the best part, it&#39;s BYOB. If you like a few beverages, the amount you save on BYOB with no corkage more than makes up for any slight comparisons in price :) <br><br>There&#39;s a reason why there are two locations on Kingsland road! Worth a stop by to either. No queue when I popped by just before 7pm on a Friday night but within the hour, the place was packed!",

Entering the building is like walking back to the 1930s, but not in a way that feels contrived. The Art Deco/beaux arts interior is simply stunning, and the atmosphere is exciting as a result.<br>We ate in the Brasserie Zedel, but glimpsed into the Bar Americain and the cabaret club and both complimented the overall vibe greatly. <br>The food was incredible, and met the standard of real French cuisine. I chose the Choucroute de la Mer, which consisted of a very generous serving of a variety of seafood (salmon,haddock,mussels,prawns) served on a bed of sweet cabbage in a light creamy sauce.

"reviewcomment":"So I walked past this place before with Wendy L and she was amazed I hadn&#39;t tried this place yet, I asked if it was new? A shocking &#34;No!&#34; followed, it has been here many years.<br><br>So, on the last bank holiday Monday of May, we originally wanted to go to Ten Ten Tai but this place and Kulu Kulu were both shut, and I remembered this one! Yes! It&#39;s open! But it only takes cash, is that ok? Yes! Food please!<br><br>Having looked at the menu it was a toss up between Ittenbari Ramen and the Miso Ramen. I picked Ittenbari and the other 3 people picked Miso Ramen. Curious, because the miso ramen contained marmite! Marmite? In ramen????<br><br>Anyhow, I REALLY LOVED the stock in the Ittenbari ramen. It didn&#39;t have an overpowering taste of MSG so I wasn&#39;t gagging for water, but really wanted to drink the whole thing, except I was full from a snack earlier in the afternoon! The noodles were nice, felt like it could have had more meat in the bowl, and the half egg is nowhere as nice as the one from Bone Daddies. <br><br>I tried a bit of the stock in the Miso ramen but couldn&#39;t really taste the marmite. Hmmm. My friends also tried the salmon salad, which had some good chewy seaweedy vegetables inside, they were quite nice with the salad sauce.<br><br>We did order the sushi but I didn&#39;t try them, was too full! The sushi looked like a good size, but they were quite dear also.<br><br>A comment is that the ventilation isn&#39;t that good in the restaurant. Further in there was a fan, but where we were, there was nothing. We were getting a bit overheated in there, even though it was rainy freezing outside!<br><br>Ah well, another place to go for ramen, yay!",

"reviewcomment":"We absolutely LOVE this place, we have never eaten anything that was ever remotely average, or &#39;just ok&#39;. Everything is fantastic. It&#39;s the first place we think of when we think about having a meal out or if we have visitors in town, I&#39;d eat here every day if I could afford it.<br><br>Everything is delicious but standouts are the Cold Tofu with spring onion and bonito flakes, the Deep Fried Soft Shell crab, the Tonkotsu Ramen, the Grilled Mackerel with Salt and for desert the Mochi, Daifuki and both Green Tea and Sesame Ice Creams. Looking over the menu we have tried others and this list could really go on. Ooh yes, the cucumber with miso paste was my Mom&#39;s favorite who was visiting from home.<br><br>Do also always have a look at their specials list - we had chicked livers once that among the 4 of us we had to order a total of 3 orders after we had gobbled up the first portion that was meant to be shared in 5 seconds flat.<br><br>And they actually make a mean sushi too, we&#39;ve had both international rolls and nigiri, and they have both been better than at many sushi restaurants that charge far higher prices.<br><br>The also have a pretty amazing list of Shochu that can be either served cold, hot, or just neat - although if you&#39;re interested in this I would highly recommend doing a bit of research beforehand, we&#39;ve had (very sweet and attentive!) waitresses a couple of times who&#39;s grasp of english made recommendations a little difficult (but they did always bring good shochu nonetheless!).<br><br>Overall, possibly my favourite restaurant in London.",

"reviewcomment":"So good I ate them twice! Amazing light fluffy American pancakes; I had the blueberry pancakes to start,  we arrived quite early so service was instant! <br><br>You get a huge jug of syrup and butter if thats your fancy and 4 well sized pancakes,  a sliced strawberry and piece of orange on the side! They were lightly dusted with icing sugar and u added a nice helping of syrup!  When looking at them they look thick and stodgy but they are incredibly light abd fluff with a nice amount of fruit in....spot on, I quickly demolished 4, I have a good appetite so promptly ordered a quick stack of banana. ....ecen better this time, the banana had caramelized slightly!  <br><br>I must add 4 is enough for most but I have an incredibly sweet tooth and eat 4000 calories a day! This was a treat so went all out with 2 stacks! <br><br>Not cheap in doing so and they automatically added 12.5% to the bill for 2 of us....which im not against tipping but id like to do so at my own will.<br>Again not a cheap diner but the taste was there to back it up. The place is a little shabby and too American to seem authentic but we were both happy with our food &amp; drinks! <br><br>Ill be back when I next have a pancake craving!",

We got our food so fast we even had time for dessert! We tried a banana, caramel and &#34;biscuit&#34; concoction not knowing what we were getting into.

"reviewcomment":"I went to the relaunch night after their makeover and i was impressed.<br>The cocktails were flowing i had a strawberry margarita followed by a mango one then on to the obligatory salt shot lime lol.<br>We shared a nachos while looking at the menu, the starters were nice but the nachos were the best, I had a rib eye steak , over done on the first go but they replaced it with a perfect steak no problems.<br>Our waiter was very attentive and helpful. They also had a live band and dancers which was a great touch.<br>A real difference from the last time i went, so i will def be back to see if its the same on a non launch night",

"reviewcomment":"Hands down ranks as one of the top 3 Thai restaurants that I have ever been to (outside of Thailand, of course).  I&#39;m reluctant to even try any other Thai restaurant in London now that I&#39;ve stumbled on to Siam Central.  <br><br>I have come here twice (both times for lunch), and the food has been consistently amazing.  Even after finishing off my own meal, I&#39;m often eyeing the dishes on neighbouring tables.  Every plate is chock-full of bright, savoury colours, and the appearance certainly does not belie the taste.  I would easily try anything on SC&#39;s menu, so I don&#39;t see much point in recommending any particular dish, but for the sake of risk-averse restaurant go-ers, I&#39;ll vouch for the Tom Yum soup (spicy enough to give you a kick but not too spicy that it numbs your experience of other flavours) and Gaeng Karee Gai.  <br><br>Besides the great food, Siam Central is very good value.  It is priced like most other casual thai restaurants (6-8 pounds for a main), but offers way more value in terms of both the quality of food &amp; the atmosphere.  You won&#39;t find yourself sitting in a dining room cluttered with cheesy Buddha and elephant statuettes.  This restaurant keeps it nice and simple, with a modern European twist on thai decor.<br><br>Suffices to say that I will hit Siam Central any time I feel a craving for thai....",

"reviewcomment":"Amazing dining adventure! I went there with 4 friends on a Saturday night and went for the 10 course tasting menu without wine pairings.<br><br>While looking at the menu we were offered with a tuna tartare with potato and garlic croquette as &#34;amuse-buche&#34;. Definitely a great start. The actual tasting experience started with quail poached egg served on a (really amazingl) asparagus cream. This first course made us understand we came to the right place.<br><br>It followed a tuna tartare served with mini fried squid tentacles and basil velloute&#39;. Again, an extraordinary preparation. (Only flaw in the evening, we had already been served tuna tartare before, I wouldn&#39;t expect such a repetition in a top notch restaurant like this).<br><br>After the tuna we&#39;ve been served white asparagus with garlic jelly, crab mayo and iberico ham. While the quality of each ingredient was astonishingly good, I found the iberico ham better tasted alone. <br><br>The next course was poached and roasted sole with lemon grass mashed potatoes. The best course in the menu. Full stop.<br><br>The fish was followed by veal fillet with garlic cream and mashed potatoes - definitely not disappointing. <br><br>The cheese was  French Comte&#39; and British Stilton - For the first time in my life a british cheese completely overcome France. It was followed by a &#34;Tasting of lemon and blood orange&#34; basically a layered dessert made with lemon sorbetto, orange jelly and lemon foam on top. Good stuff.<br><br>Finally for dessert, we were served a chocolate crème with caramel sauce, salted peanut ice cream and chocolate jelly - which despite the &#34;complex&#34; description, was nothing particularly interesting, even though very well done.<br><br>During the evening we were proposed with a broad selection of different breads, ranging from italian focaccia to a (superb) onion brioche. <br><br>We order two bottle of wine (one for the starters, one for the mains and the cheese) and while we picked the first one ourself from the very well supplied wine list, we asked the sommelier for advice on the second one. He proposed the Madrian Baste 2010 with very good structure and the right level of tannins (the wine was left breathing in a decanter, as any wine with good body should).<br><br>We finally asked for coffee, which was served with a selection of small pastry that I actually enjoyed more than the dessert.<br><br>My overall sensation about the place: astonishing. Despite being quite expensive (we paid about 150£ each with service) it was worth it every pence. I strongly  recommend the pied-a&#39;-terre to anyone looking for a fine dining experience in London.",

"reviewcomment":"Came on a Thursday with reservations. Service was great - which is a deal breaker for a restaurant in this price range. Ordered a bottle of bubbly that was kept chilled through out our meal.  We ordered a few things, however the standout dishes were the pork belly and jamon croquettes.  I also appreciated the fennel salad. In fact we ordered a second plate of croquettes because it was that good. No dessert was ordered since we stuffed ourselves with tapas.  Small portions and surprisingly decently priced, but not necessarily on the low side. <br><br>The only negative was that the food can out too quickly and would have preferred a slightly slower pace. <br><br>The restaurant is in the lower level, so no natural light or views of outside.  Despite this, the restaurant feels bright enough and not claustrophobic. <br><br>I would return, but for a special dinner.  Total came to about £125 for about 7 plates and a bottle of bubbly for two of us.  Applying our lousy dollar conversion rate, it&#39;s about 200 bucks.  Not bad considering we ordered whatever we wanted and walked away feeling very satisfied. <br><br>A special call out for the host who was very kind and welcoming upon our entry and departure.",

We&#39;ve been 3 times and mostly just binge on sushi and sashimi platters, but definitely try some other dishes as well. They serve Ashai on draft (so much better and colder than on bottle) and have a few sakes as well.<br><br>In my experience, the service is nothing to complain about and always has been great.<br><br>Another great thing about this place is the venue. Hosted in an old pub, they barely changed the setting and so it&#39;s something different compared to most Asian restaurants.<br><br>If you crave sushi and don&#39;t want to spend a fortune in London; this is definitely the place to go!",

"reviewcomment":"Excellent gastropub. <br><br>We spent the day in Greenwich to do some touring, and had decided in advance to do Sunday roast while we were there. I did some pre-research and wrote down a few pub names. This one is a little off the beaten tourist path by a few blocks, but was nonetheless packed -- a good sign, since they were likely all locals. <br><br>We had a 15 minute wait - not problem, and a little mix up that the people before us got seated first. But the waiter was profusely apologetic so no harm done.<br><br>We were with a toddler and they were able to bring food for him right away - the pigs in a blanket (mini sausages wrapped in bacon - so amazing), and a side of perfectly good chips. Husband had the roast beef roast. I had the vegetarian roast. Both came on a bed of roasted veggies and some greens, drizzled in gravy and a yorkshire pudding. Husband thought the roast beef was exceptional. I was literally in heaven with my veggie cheese tart and accoutrements. It&#39;s so rare to find a good vegetarian roast. Every mouthful was delectable. The one weakness was the yorkshire pudding, which was pretty dry and crunchy. I like some breadiness there for sopping up the gravy. <br><br>I would return here in a second. Wish i&#39;d found a similar place in the city.",

Mainly because I end up spending soooo muuuuch money.<br><br>Okay, baring in mind that getting there can be a bit of a pain - I decided to do the whole tourist package and get there on a Clipper. And that in itself was actually really fun.<br><br>The market itself reminded me a bit of the crafts area of Camden Market (you know, the one on the left hand side in the kind of house?) but in a more authentic way.<br><br>You get welcomed by about a dozen street-food stalls offering fresh exotic dishes, and make your way into the stalls of these small creatives where you can find anything from paintings to jewellery.<br><br>One of the things I like the most, is that most of the time, it was the artists themselves managing their own stall, and the people you meet tell you a great story about their products.<br><br>A small market full of personality, definitely something I would suggest for an afternoon a bit away from Central.",

"reviewcomment":"I really wanted to love this place as I frequently get American style brunch cravings and brunch, as I have often complained, has not quite caught on here in London just yet. Fingers crossed that TBC marks the beginning of a quiet revolution though...<br><br>I&#39;ve been here a few times now, first with a friend who was showing me around my new stomping grounds, a couple of times for meetings with clients and a few times for pleasure too.<br><br>Now this place is quite hidden away near Liverpool St station and has (or so I hear) a speakeasy style bar tucked away inside a Smeg fridge converted into a door. It&#39;s not difficult to find really but certainly is not the kind of place you may stumble upon as a tourist wandering around the area.<br><br>I usually order an American full, although I have to admit I can&#39;t actually remember if that&#39;s what it&#39;s called now... 1 sausage, a slice of bacon, two pancakes, scrambled eggs, home style hash browns (think bubble and squeak) came to about £9. Coffee and juice on top of that and it&#39;s a close to £15 per head affair which I feel is a little on the pricy side considering the portions are not so generous.<br><br>It would be delightful to see some real American classics on the menu, pancakes and bacon are great but what about french toast and bacon, waffles and bacon or even... chicken and waffles! Come on please, indulge me...<br><br>I mentioned that I wanted to love this place and I&#39;m still trying to find that love. I do go back out of my own volition and enjoy the food they serve but wish that the portions were larger and some truly indulgent options were available on the menu. Come on chicken and waffles/french toast and bacon! Aside from that, this is a perfectly charming place to have brunch, with its industrial chic decor and tucked away location, it&#39;s a lovely little gem that you&#39;d never guess was in such a central location!",

From outside, you wouldn&#39;t think it&#39;s a Michelin Star restaurant. The facade was simple. <br>Inside, the decor was modern and the restaurant looked clean and crisp.<br><br>We all tried their prix fixe lunch which includes an amuse bouche. Here was their menu:<br><br>Appetizer (a choice of)<br>Salad of Radishes with Black Quinoa with crime fraiche, fennel and dill OR<br>Baked beet roots with blackberries, goats curd and herbs.<br><br>Both appetizers were delicious. I just found the salad of radishes similar to their amuse bouche for that day.<br><br>Entree (a choice of)<br>Poached Hake with Parmesan Crust, confit tomato and squid ink OR<br>Roe Deer cooked in cocoa and juniper<br><br>The Hake was good but the deer was the best. It was very flavorful and tender. <br><br>Dessert<br>Cheese Platter OR<br>White chocolate and cardamom Panna Cotta with orange and olive oil purée and cherry sorbet<br><br>None of us tried the cheese platter. The panna cotta though was delicious. It was the best way to end a lovely meal.<br><br>If you want to try a Michelin Star restaurant, this is a must try especially if you are traveling on a budget. For a three course meal, we spent £28 per person.",

I was expecting it to be more like a fast food restaurant but it&#39;s actually a table service place which was a nice surprise.<br><br>My burger was delicious. Little bit of burn on the onion and burger with a nice pink interior to the patty added an extra touch of flavour to this already delicious combination of beef, veggies and bread.<br><br>I was there super early (5pm) but the place was getting quite busy before I left at 5:40pm. They have more seating downstairs so I don&#39;t know if you&#39;d need to book but you can if you want to so I&#39;m told.<br><br>I made a bit of an error asking the waitress to validate my check in offer that was running until the end of March for free fries. When the manager came over I suddenly realised this was a check in offer that expired almost a year ago that I must have picked up at the Yelp event. I immediately apologised and pointed out it was out of date but they did it for me anyway which I thought was extremely nice of them.<br><br>I feel like going back to try the other things on the menu but I don&#39;t know if I&#39;ll be able to deny myself that burger.<br><br>Prices around the same as Byron, less suitable for large groups maybe but give it a whirl. There&#39;s always a Byron round the corner if you can&#39;t be seated here.<br><br>Take away also available.",

"reviewcomment":"A straight shot walk from Marble Arch, I highly recommend making a reservation (they&#39;re really particular about that) at this tiny little Burmese restaurant. While I wouldn&#39;t say this a place that inspires much in terms of ambiance their food is to die for. To be clear, I wouldn&#39;t criticize them for just having a clean mom and pop space, but just keep your expectations simple. <br><br>I went with the coconut chicken curry noodle soup (with a little bit of extra heat at request) and the cucumber/papaya salad as recommended on Yelp. ALL THE YES. I&#39;ve never had Burmese food before, but I am totally sold. I wasn&#39;t expecting the complexity of flavors from a curry noodle soup or an appetizer salad, but they were both quite nuanced dishes. <br><br>Definitely will make the effort to trek out here again.",

"reviewcomment":"Even though you&#39;re in London with its culinary prowess of international tastes and delights, you just fancy good old fashioned English food done really well. When I met a work friend for a pre-theatre dinner, that&#39;s what we wanted. The catch was, as a coeliac, the restaurant to cater to my friend&#39;s tastes.<br>We plumped for Porters as on paper, it fulfilled the requirements and was close the the West End. But, did it live up to its promises?? The suspense!! Ok, suspense over because it most definitely did!<br><br>6pm with a table reserved for 2, we turned up to a delightfully quaint restaurant with a Tardis-like quality (bigger on the inside, casual Dr Who humour there). Good thing we booked, obviously popular for the pre-theatre diners. The walls were lined with old playbills of productions past, which for me is basically perfect decoration so that scored many a point.<br><br>The waiter was friendly and helpful, providing us straight away with the gluten-free menu. This menu however, whilst what it promised, seemed a bit disappointing in choice. My delightful work colleague ended up with some nicely marinated chicken and assorted vegetables, which whilst lovely was dry. I had a pie (so she could be naughty and steal a bit of my gravy), which was much better. Filled with soft, tender game and swimming in a rich port reduction, this pie definitely lived up to the restaurant&#39;s look and feel. Filling too! All for £14, so you expect quality here.<br><br>Pudding was a bit disappointing, we had heard there assorted ice creams were incredible, so whilst they were smooth and creamy with interesting sounding flavours, my apple &amp; cinnamon ice cream was basically all cinnamon. I love cinnamon, so win! But apple would have been nice too.<br><br>Slightly delayed in getting the bill so we had to march rather quickly to the theatre loses this place the full 5 star treatment, that and the gluten free menu. Don&#39;t advertise a whole menu if your offering isn&#39;t as good as your main a la carte in my opinion.",

Hidden away, this place is a secret from the start, and a real treat.<br><br>Basic decoration, with beautiful art and a busy service, I warmed to it from the moment I stepped in. Surprising to see so many suits though ;)<br><br>I had a caramelised onion &amp; goat&#39;s cheese tart to start, which was absolutely divine. Just thinking about it is making my mouth water actually. I&#39;d go back just for that. Looking around, the pork rillettes also look really nice - but I always have that, so thought I&#39;d mix it up.<br><br>For main I had the roast duck special, served perfectly pink with red cabbage, fried and dressed green salad. Utterly lovely.<br><br>Left feeling satisfied but not overfed. Will definitely be back. <br><br>Service is exactly quick though, so maybe good for an afternoon or an evening.",

"reviewcomment":"Setting: This restaurant is big and airy and it really feels like you could be in a mid-20th century French brasserie. The atmosphere is very relaxed and is great for brunch. Even the bathrooms are big and bright. Being in Covent Gardens this is a great location to meet someone from the other side of the city for brunch.<br><br>Service: The service was excellent. The staff were attentive, friendly and helpful without ever being overbearing. I really enjoyed this aspect of the experience.<br><br>Food: I had my first ever Escargot here and despite my hesitancy over eating snails they were delicious. As brunch goes I wold recommend the Moules Frites. The mussel portions are very generous (I was full before I got to the fries). However the fries are more crunch than substance and a thicker cut (if going off the french fry vibe a little) would make them even better. I definitely want to try the rest of the menu and would come back.",

Upper street is crawling with restaurants, bakeries and cafes these days, but Fig and Olive is a real standout for it&#39;s delicious food, reasonable prices and adorable atmosphere.  <br><br>Breakfast/brunch here is great value, with meals between £6-13.  I&#39;ve had the veggie full breakfast (all great minus one kind of dodgy vegetarian sausage), the Halloumi Salad, and most recently, the pancakes with bacon - all so yum!  <br><br>Clean, bright space, with friendly staff and strong coffee make for a great place to spend a lazy Sunday morning/afternoon.<br><br>This will continue to be a top choice for me!",

"reviewcomment":"This place is like a cross between chinatown dim sum and Yauatcha. Nice decor, good range of non-standard westernised dim-sum and pricey. However factor in the 50% on weekends and this place wins hands down on value for money.<br><br>The cocktails are quite nice. Particularly the lychee based ones. However a lot of them were &#34;not available&#34; when we visited with a Groupon. Whether this was availability of deliberately restricting us peasants with our Groupons, I&#39;ll never know. <br><br>Service throughout started well. Very attentive, then suddenly disappeared. We sat for quite a while after finishing out meal with not a single waiter/ess in sight. Extremely strange. What saved this place from getting 3 stars was the dim sum itself.<br><br>I can&#39;t for the life of me remember the names of anything I ate apart from the prawn scallops that were very good. However one dim sum was particularly memorable because upon biting into it, there was a delicous broth that dribbled down your chin that was oh so tasty as an accompany to the meaty filling, that I&#39;d never seen done before. Also the sea bass dim sum along with the scollops were cooked to PER-FEC-TION. One disappointment were the pricey and mountainous spare ribs cooked with chilli and cracked black pepper. Really, tough, hardly any meat and super chewy. Note the portions were similar to other places. 3-4 pieces for normal dim sum. 2-3 for specials like sea-bass.<br><br>So apart from one bad choice, the quality and breadth of not your average dim sum elevates this place to good for people you wish to impress. It&#39;s not as cheap as chinatown, but there&#39;s some great dim-sum to be had if you find yourself in Marylebone and consider Chinatown too far to meet your dim-sum cravings.",

Yet what a glorious failure it has been! Leon is the easy, fast, healthy lunch place I&#39;ve been waiting for. No more £5 sandwiches that don&#39;t fill me up at Pret, I wander to nearby Leon (this one has plenty of seating) and savour a bit of hummus &amp; flatbread, a superfood salad and a filter coffee and watch the people go about their day in busy Spitalfields. There&#39;s nothing like it. <br><br>If I&#39;m out from work early and need to be somewhere later in the evening, I often grab a bite here before setting off. Being a member of their club entitles you to 40% off food after 4pm. It&#39;s free to join so well worth it!",

There was a BBQ to cook some of the tapas, hats off to the chefs!

"reviewcomment":"I think if you combined the different franchises of this single restaurant concept around London, you might actually find it to be one of the higher rating businesses, and certainly one of the strongest performers among &#39;chain-ish&#39; restaurants. Certainly since my first visit, I&#39;ve been back several times, and have converted several people by convincing them to &#39;Give Peas a Chance&#39;... and they&#39;ve all loved it.<br><br>Hummus Bros does... hummus, unsurprisingly, but they do it very well. Warm pitas, fresh toppings, mmmmm. Also, a falafal salad I die for. And, a mint and ginger tea that never fails to refresh.<br><br>This is a little slice of the Mediterranean that shouldn&#39;t be missed, among locals and visitors alike. Situated so well between Holborn and Russell Square stations, there&#39;s not excuse not to stop in.",

"reviewcomment":"This place is way off the beaten path.  It&#39;s located in west London in what appears to be a quiet and cultured neighborhood.  I took the 8 to get there (from Wormwood) and got there shortly after 9am.  For me, it was a little hard to find because they had the roof down (light drizzle) and a farm vendor was setup right in front (the bus stop is RIGHT across the street).<br><br>Once i found it, I walked in to find only locals...I figured this since they all turned to look at the Yank that appeared without a jacket on and full backpack (plus, I had the &#34;American&#34; accent).  I decided to &#34;stop&#34; at a table outside and proceeded to order the Full English and tea with milk.  It was classic, grilled stem mushrooms, grilled tomato halves, sausage, bacon (which isn&#39;t cooked to a crisp like us American&#39;s like) and a thick slice of toast with an egg over easy.  You will walk away full and content, it will keep you going for hours as you walk around the British Museum (which is what I did...).  Simple meal with simple flavors, add pepper if desired.<br><br>For 10 quid, you can&#39;t go wrong.  You get to experience the &#39;burbs of West London and chat it up with the locals (I met 3 locals in a boxing club, to which they invited me!).  A must go if visiting London!",

I got a table on arrival at 5pm on a weekday and spread myself out to do some work and take advantage of the free wifi before going to the theatre (literally next door - this is a good meeting spot if you&#39;re going to the St James).<br><br>I had the steak which was decent and tasty and a friend had their rabbit stew which he seemed to hoover up quickly enough.<br><br>It&#39;s not exactly cheap but we are in tourist central with the palace round the corner. <br><br>It got very busy by 6pm (I had to start sharing my table and put the work away) and by 7pm it was heaving with post work/pre theatre drinkers. Still service was efficient and friendly and, considering the lack of decent places to eat and drink in Victoria, shall be on my list for future drinks.",

"reviewcomment":"This place is seriously delicious. We stayed at an airbnb find upstairs, and were delighted to discover this gem downstairs. <br><br>I was worried that the food would fulfill eastern European stereotypes - bland and greasy. Not so. The food was incredibly flavorful and some dishes had a bit of a kick to them. Very nice. <br><br>The borscht was divine - I have been dreaming about it for weeks. Definitely get the appetizer sampler - all the dips are unique and delicious. And the cheese bread??? Heaven!!<br><br>I went for the beef stew entree and it was dreamy. There was something minty going on, which was a nice element to the flavor  My husband went for the chicken, and it was okay, but not my favorite. <br><br>We got a cheesecake dessert that was ok but they ruined it a little with some overly sweet raspberry sauce. Would have been better as is. <br><br>Breakfast pastries are super yummy and they do a nice coffee. <br><br>Ambience is cozy and homey - very cute. The service is spotty but very sweet, and expect some mild miscommunication. It&#39;s byob which is great if you&#39;re in to that. <br><br>All in all, I would recommend making a trip out there. Truly unique cuisine, lovely experience, oh and the brunch looks great!!",

"reviewcomment":"Whenever it&#39;s cold and wet and I&#39;m not sure how I can make it through the day, I find myself shuffling zombie-like over to Berwick St, parting with my well-earned £5.50, wandering out lugging my steaming box of veggie delights and feeling ready to face the afternoon.<br><br>I am a hard-core meat-eater. I suspect I&#39;d eat a puppy if they served it up with a good sauce. Hey, I lived in China for a year; I probably already did. But this place fills me up good and proper and I never, ever feel like something&#39;s missing. Why aren&#39;t all vegetarian restaurants like this little gem?! It perfectly compliments the equally wonderful vegetarian double-eatery Mrs Marengo&#39;s / Mildred&#39;s around the corner on Lexington St.  Whilst they are more upmarket, with a refined vibe and unusual taste combos, Beatroot provides hearty, stomach-filling fare at not-unreasonable prices. The staff are friendly and make sure to fill your box until it can barely close . . . in fact, they always have to use a sticker to secure mine and have been known to double-box it when it starts to burst under the strain.<br><br>My hard-to-please, sophisticated head of department is as much a fan of this place as I am; a hard-to-please, not remotely sophisticated underling. I&#39;ve even seen celebs chowing down at the friendly communal tables.  Moussaka comes highly recommended, as does the cauliflower cheese. They do veggie versions of all the traditional meat-filled dishes (lasagna, sausage rolls etc) and offer both cold salads and hot food all year round so you can alternate according to the season, or have a mix if you so fancy.  A warning: as soon as you add anything from the cold counter, the heat dissipates from the hot food pretty sharpish and you just get a mush of lukewarm stuff, so stick to one or the other if you&#39;ve got to walk pre-nosh.<br><br>Beatroot is without a doubt one of the best things about working in Soho.<br><br>I wish I&#39;d gone there for lunch today.",

"reviewcomment":"As par of our honeymoon, my wife and I passed through London.  London is a great city and one we hope to spend more time at in the future, but the most we could manage was a 20-hour layover this time around.  Given the short amount of time we were here, we decided to squeeze in a few sights, shopping at Harrods, and of course, a meal.  The wife is a Gordon Ramsay fan, so I decided to have us visit one of his many restaurants.  Because I knew shopping at Harrods was going to be a priority, I chose Petrus.  Petrus is a short 10 minute walk from Harrods on Kinnerton Street.  It is a 1 Michelin Star restaurant serving French food with British flair and British ingredients.<br><br>The atmosphere here is a balance of modern and classic, with the focal point being the enormous, circular glass wine cellar in the center of the dining room.  Around it are the tables with a variety of regular tables &amp; chairs in addition to tables with booths.  The service here is, of course, top notch.  It&#39;s very attentive, but not overbearing at all.  You have a good amount of privacy, but your drink will never sit empty and empty plates will never sit in front of you.  But of course, you&#39;re probably wondering how the food is?  It&#39;s great!<br><br>The menus here change seasonally and are presented a la carte (3 courses, 65GBP) or Chef&#39;s Tasting Menu (75GBP).  On our visit, my wife chose to go the a la carte route and I chose the tasting menu.<br><br>To start, we were both serve an amuse bouche consisting of a foie gras + jelly sandwich and a cigar filled with truffled cream cheese.  This was followed by a carrot soup.  All were very tasty small bites.  Wish I could have had more!  <br><br>The first menu item up was my wife&#39;s appetizer.  She chose the a la carte menu just to order this special.  It&#39;s a pasta with wild mushrooms, parmesan foam, and A LOT of fresh Alba truffles freshly shaven table side.  At the same time, I was served my first course:  ballotine of Landes foie gras with semi dried grapes, green beans and hazelnut crumble.  Again, both dishes were simply AMAZING!  The foie gras was very well balanced and the wife&#39;s pasta was just pure decadence.  <br><br>Next up was my second course:  pan-fried sea scallops with cauliflower, anchovy and caper, lemon beurre noisette.  The scallop was perfectly cooked, as expected, with a great crust and tender center.  This was followed by our main courses.  My wife ordered the roasted venison with braised red cabbage, smoked chestnut puree and juniper berry jus.  For my main course, there was a choice in the tasting menu, so I chose the Red leg Partridge with pearl barley, pancetta, roast fig, walnut and jus.  Both were good and different for both of us, as these kinds of dishes aren&#39;t available back home in Hawaii.  <br><br>Next up was my palate cleanser/pre-dessert.  There was a choose of this standard dish or cheese plate (additional charge).  The standard option on this occasion was a Blackcurrant sorbet with lemon meringue and champagne foam.<br><br>Next up was dessert.  For her&#39;s, my wife chose the caramelized figs with hazelnut sable, fresh honeycomb, cob nuts and yogurt sorbet.  My dessert, on the other hand, was the standard menu item, and the dessert they&#39;re known for hear.  It&#39;s a chocolate sphere with milk ice cream and honeycomb.  It&#39;s served to you as a sphere as the name implies, however, they pour warm chocolate sauce over it, melting it and revealing the ice cream.  Both were great, though the wife wished she had ordered something sweeter.  <br><br>Finally, we were served petite fours of white chocolate coated ice cream.  <br>After we paid, the staff gave us a tour while we waited for our cab.  We even got to meet Petrus&#39; head chef.  After that, it was back to the Renaissance London Heathrow to get some sleep before heading over to the airport for our noon flight the next day.",

"reviewcomment":"The epic combo of an incredible Champagne list from Sandia Chang and ultimate #foodporn hotdogs from her husband James!! I absolutely love this place!<br><br>I have only been here once so far after having a few too many cocktails and looking for some scrumptious food to fill the belly! I had the Reuben beef Hot dog(with sauerkraut, Russian Dressing and melted swiss cheese £7) and sweet potato fries (£3.50). I can honestly say this is the best hot dog I have ever had, definitely trumps any of the trendy burger chains too... Plus the &#34;sweet potato&#34; fries &amp; champagne combo make you feel like you are being healthy &amp; classy at the same time as eating a hotdog haha. :)<br><br>Really chillaxed quirky venue with cute features like the collage on the bathroom walls of restaurant menus that Sandia &amp; James have dined at. Great place to start the night (or end it) in Fitzrovia, London<br><br>P.s I here the &#34;Kitchen Table&#34; hidden through the back of Bubbledogs has a highly recommended tasting menu that I am still to try..",

"reviewcomment":"I decided to try this place again. The more London gentrifies and the fancier it becomes, the more I want parts of its crumbled, bedraggled past to remain and keep it all a bit real. Nothing has changed inside Fryer&#39;s Delight in the two and a half years since I set foot in here. Which is no surprise as it might not have changed since before I was born. The only thing that needed to change for me to like this place a lot was the freshness of the fish. And that is one thing that has, thankfully, changed since my last visit.  The fish was good enough to bump up my previous rating to 4 whole stars. I would have left skipping, if I hadn&#39;t been so full I could barely walk. <br><br>Remember this is a &#34;chippy&#34; and the food comes with no frills. However, it is good enough not to need any. And stepping inside is like stepping back in time. There aren&#39;t many places left you can buy time travel AND good fish for a tenner.",

The menu has very little selection which i think is a good thing - it means the chef can concentrate on perfecting the few things they have on the menu rather than trying to juggle a load of mediocre dishes throughout an evening.<br><br>Instead of a basket of bread to start they serve popcorn cooked in beef juices which is wonderful. The house flat iron steak is tender and full of flavour and you can get a selection of sauces - I got peppercorn and my girlfriend got bernaise - both really tasty.<br><br>I had a small carafe of house red wine which was delicious and went with the steak perfectly.<br><br>Highly recommend!",

"reviewcomment":"**FANFARE**<br><br>My 100th review!! I was saving it for somewhere I really liked.<br><br>I originally was going to give The Counter Cafe 4 stars but something gave it that final star. More on that later.<br><br>Firstly, a 5-7 min walk from Hackney Wick, The CC is right on the canal and some of the tables are on a ....I don&#39;t know what the official name is, but a &#39;floaty bit&#39; *facepalm* outside with plenty of barges moored nearby, so whenever someone steps on or off it kinda wobbles a bit. My mum would never sit here &#39;Im scared Anoop, we&#39;re going to fall in!&#34;. Whatevs, Mum.<br>Anyway, fk&#39;it.<br>I had scrambled eggs with smoked salmon and it was sooooo good. Really light but very flavourful - hurrah for organic food! My espresso which I think was Rwandan was an interesting experience - I found it salty, was that deliberate?<br>The staff were lovely, and I really liked the vibe that being amongst a gallery gave.<br><br>So, next door, I don&#39;t know what was going on, but I there seemed to be a party going, either a general bar area or one still happening from the night before. Anyway, cue lots of good looking people drinking wine and beer at 11:30am and playing (not too loudly) house music. <br>Now in my opinion, anywhere that allows me to hear house music before midday and gives me an amazing breakfast, can only get 5 stars. And there, Ladies and Gentlemen is why I gave it 5 stars.<br>PS My second choice was going to be the Turkish eggs which looked REALLY good, so bags that for next time.<br><br>In conclusion, I shall be going back, yes :)",

"reviewcomment":"Strongrooms is a great place for drinks with a nice outdoor area with it&#39;s own bar. There is food, pizzas, wraps, sandwiches, the usual fare. Nothing special, but decent enough for lunch.<br><br>The atmosphere is nice and relaxed without being overtly trendy or pretentious. In Shoreditch that is something you need.<br><br>I think there is limited parking at the site itself, perhaps utilised by the recording studio nearby, which commonly leads to people nearly getting run over, as drinking whilst a car is pulling through is not a helpful thing. But I guess helps keep you alert.",

The traffic light never sees red - not on our shift.<br><br>The variety coming off the grill is respectable with no grilled veggies and similar pollutants pissing on the meat parade.

I would have to say my memory can still taste the dessert - their Bitter Chocolate Fondant (au rhum caramel) is absolute perfection.  They offer set menus, which are actually quite reasonable for London - £29 for 3 courses (don&#39;t skip the dessert - seriously!).  The food is very rich - you will love it if you have a taste for French cuisine, and it will not break the bank for regular visits.",

The sausages are nice. I ordered the one sausage with chips. The staff are friendly. The only reason for one star down is the portion can be bigger. Just one sausage for a portion might be not enough. Before we leave we went down to toilet and realised actually there are more space downstairs and with a big screen playing some movie or movie trailer which is really nice if you come with s group of friend.",

"reviewcomment":"Fika is a slightly pretentious Shoreditch type place but it actually has some substance behind the hipster froth.  <br><br>I liked the way they presented the cocktails, for example one came with the alcohol in a bag to be added to the drink and another came with the constituent parts in different beakers. The menu was presented on a map and was due to change to winter at the time of our visit. Some Swedish cultural knowledge is required when interpreting the menu as most main courses come with sides that aren&#39;t mentioned. I had the mashed potato and chicken which was really good. The great smell in Fika is caused by the Swedish meatballs so I would recommend those to. <br><br>Overall, despite its hipster pretensions, I quite liked the place and will try and come back in future.",

"reviewcomment":"Came here for lunch. The first thing we noticed was that the decor was nice and trendy. Then, we ordered the lunch sets and extras. Portions were appropriately sized (i find indian food fairly filling anyway). We ordered the seekh kebab, chicken tikka, and meat platter. They were all very flavourful and delicious. <br><br>Then we ordered the chicken tikka makhani and jalfrezi. The makhani was the usual butter chicken, not as flavourful as other indian curries, but definitely a good representation for butter chicken (had brought people here who never had butter chicken in UK before). The jalfrezi was much nicer just because of its spices (just preferred it in general anyway).<br><br>The lassi was great, but very filling. I suggest skipping a starter if you don&#39;t typically eat a ton of food.<br><br>All in all, it was a great experience, and the atmosphere and lighting was perfect for a relaxing lunch.",

"reviewcomment":"Finally my friend got to try the infamous honey cake on our second visit last week!  Initially I popped in around 5pm to buy a piece of honey cake to takeaway as it was sure to be sold out if we waited until after dinner.  When I mentioned to the server that the cake is so popular and is always sold out in the evening he kindly offered to save a piece in the fridge so that we could return after dinner.<br><br>Later on we went back and the verdict on the honey cake which is made up of layers of cake with ground walnuts and cream is that it is light and crumbly and definitely worth the effort to try.  So light that my friend could have eaten another slice but of course there were none left at that hour!  My friend is now blaming me for their addiction to l&#39;eto caffe!<br><br>I had a halva latte since I could not try the honey cake which contained walnuts, the latte had a pleasant nutty aroma from sunflower and sesame seeds.  I wanted to order one of the custom teas but they had run out of the clear teapots to serve the tea!  So I guess I shall have to return to try the custom tea.",

It&#39;s ordered like small plates - choose 2-3 per person and go to town on the array. The meats can be hit or miss, some were super tender and falling off the bone, others were dry and chewy. However, every dish was extremely flavorful, lots of kick with the heat and heavy on the spices than most. They go similarly extreme on the cream and butter factor, but in the end with small plates this is a good thing... At such concentrations of flavor, a little goes a long way!",

"reviewcomment":"Definitely a popular place to settle in after the Columbia Flower Market for your Sunday Roast! <br><br>Ringing in at £19, you get a slice of roast, with yorkshire pudding, cooked greens, carrot mash (with wholegrain mustard), and deep fried potatoes slathered with some really really delicious gravy.  I thought it was a bit pricey for roast (considering you can get it for much cheaper at other places around the city), but I think this is probably the better roast meal I&#39;ve had in London in comparison to the £13 dishes I&#39;ve had. I loved the greens, would happily ask for more to mop up the gravy (though there wasn&#39;t much left).  <br><br>I wasn&#39;t too keen on the carrot mash, so I think I&#39;d ask for all the sides to be swapped out for the greens. yum! <br><br>We also ordered a bowl of triple cooked chips for £3.50 - thick sizeable crispy chunks with garlic aioli.  Some of the best fries I&#39;ve had, very crispy on the outside, fluffy on the inside.  <br><br>Would come back again!",

"reviewcomment":"We order from Boho Mexica more frequently than we should (through <a href='/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fdinein.co.uk&amp;s=c79f6c6d29ab9e5cd2c4a49464b4702a7babc97363a0439277a496de11f58fd0' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>dinein.co.uk</a>) because it is one of the most authentic Mexican we have found in London so far (not saying a lot, necessarily...) I was happy therefore to have been invited to a Cinco de Mayo dinner to finally see where all this tasty food was coming from.<br><br>Unfortunately this restaurant suffers from an external blandness that makes it difficult to locate even with the exact address in hand, and internal lack of ambience that almost comes off as dark and dreary. Not exactly the most festive atmosphere for Cinco de Mayo.<br><br>However, the margaritas were excellent. I had the cucumber margarita, which I highly recommend. The spicy salsa and avocado tomatillo accompanied by homemade tortilla chips were as good as we had noted from our deliveries, but we were disappointed to only receive a handful of chips with each dip. Not nearly enough for our group to even make a dent int he salsas. A refill of chips was 1.50.<br><br>We shared an assortment of the tacos including Al Pastor, Cochinita Pibil, and Pollito al Pepinito. I favored the Pibil but all were delicious. We followed this with the Quesadilla Gringa and the Enchiladas Roja. The Quesadillas very flavorful, but I found the Enchiladas very bland.<br><br>The meal was a success until the end when we found ourselves unable to flag down any member of staff to get us our bill. Finally after 20 minutes we succeeded, but there was a charge for unrequested extra avocado that the waitress seemed unable to explain except that it was part of one of the dishes. After some confusion and back and forths with the menu and her manager, it was taken off but not before we were left feeling like we had put them out by requesting an explanation for its presence on our bill.<br><br>Overall, I think the food definitely holds up as some of the best in the city, but I think I will stick to our delivery routine to enjoy it in the future.",

"reviewcomment":"Many years ago when I was a youngster, my mom would take me to TGI Fridays on a Sunday as a treat for going shopping all day ( I was only 6 at the time, and had already built a hatred of shopping!). I remember the original desert dishes and the amazing fun we had. My Mom and I still speak of the happy memories we have there. These have just been built upon with my first visit in over 15 years!<br><br>My friend and I decided to go to a TGI Fridays as we both wanted a steak and a nice big pitcher of beer. We arrived and were shown to a table and discovered after looking at the menu that neither of us wanted the stake any more. I elected to go with the ribs and found them rather tasty, albeit we a wee bit too much sauce. My friend chose  a meat plater and was overly impressed with the amount of food and how good it was!<br><br>The service was as quick as could be, and our waitress was extremely friendly and fun. We agreed we would go back to see if it was just a one off, which it wasn&#39;t... you will see this type of service from all who work here!<br><br>If you are looking for a good place out for lunch with friends, then TGI Fridays might be a good bet!",

That would be my sum-up of this lovely restaurant. <br><br>Well, that would be easy, if I could just get away with just one sentence. However, I know my fellow yelpers would want more so here goes. I ordered the Beef stroganoff which was so filling and there were several flavours overwhelming and overlapping each other. The mixture was interesting, yet delightful. They also have lots of other dishes, prepared especially for you, my carnivore friends. There&#39;s lots of pork belly on the menu and you really can&#39;t go wrong with any of its options.",

"reviewcomment":"Another day, another GBK. I&#39;m fast becoming their best customer. Armed with my GBK app, I fear not hunger because no matter where I may venture in London GBK is just around the corner... generally speaking.<br><br>GBK&#39;s name is a bit aspirational. It&#39;s not gourmet, it&#39;s not as atmospheric as say... Byron and it&#39;s not as good as Patty &amp; Bun... and they don&#39;t let you choose how you want your patty cooked. It&#39;s still really just a fast food joint with half table service but the beef burgers here are made with grass fed British beef, the shakes are massive, the fries delicious (and choices numerous), you get free refills on soft drinks, there are vegetarian options, great salads and even a secret vegan option. Yes the prices are extravagant for burgers and fries, even the milkshakes come with price tags to match their serving size but it&#39;s London, you should be used to prices like these by now. <br><br>This particular branch in Soho is tucked away off Soho Square on Frith Street. Like all GBK&#39;s you can opt to use their takeaway service but do remember that the shakes become about 35% smaller but remain the same price. If you have the time, take a seat inside, there&#39;s no pressure to be a big spender and tip. <br><br>I will be honest and say that although I appreciate a bit of blue steak and the odd brioche burger, I&#39;m by no means a burger aficionado and have never ordered a beef burger from GBK that wasn&#39;t their classic. It&#39;s not because their burgers don&#39;t look good, they&#39;re stacked and look delicious but their secret menu vegan burger, aptly named the &#39;Dippy Hippy&#39; (£7.45) is so insanely original that I hardly ever entertain the notion of ordering anything else. Add to it some skinny fries, a side of slaw and a bottomless elderflower fizz and that&#39;s lunch done (and dinner too because you probably won&#39;t need to eat until tomorrow.) <br><br>Shakes are big and cost over £4 so if you&#39;re with someone else, think about sharing. Likewise a regular side of skinny fries is large enough to share if two people are ordering individual burgers. Ketchup is free but posh mayo costs. <br><br>There&#39;s a good lunch menu that starts at £6.95. Essentially you pick a burger and the side is free. If you don&#39;t fork out for a drink and just drink water, it will cost you about £7 for a burger &amp; side depending on which burger you choose.<br><br>The staff here are lovely, I especially love being here when Jonathan is on shift. Oh dear GOD I&#39;ve become one of those people who are on first name terms with the staff at their favourite burger joint... <br><br>Do yourself a favour and get the app for loyalty rewards. It&#39;s very much worth it. If you&#39;re a student let them know and they&#39;ll make sure your GBK account automatically entitles you to 30% off food Sunday - Thursday. The offer lasts until the end of August 2014. <br><br>N.B. Dippy Hippy is a grilled aubergine, pineapple burger topped with spicy peanut sauce, alfalfa sprouts and a slice of tomato and it is everything that&#39;s right with the world.",

The service was good, staff were quite attentive, but it was busy so I understand why they were running around. <br><br>We didn&#39;t have starters this time although when we have in the past, the nachos are good and also the potatoes skins are special! <br><br>I had a burrito with chicken, black beans and rice. It was brilliant! <br><br>The only reason this place doesn&#39;t get a five out of five was because the service was good but not exceptional.

"reviewcomment":"I entered the Ship rather apprehensively given some of the other reviews here but left knowing I couldn&#39;t give it less than five stars.<br><br>The food here is simply excellent. My friend and I came here on a Sunday and opted for two chicken roasts. The chicken was cooked well and accompanied by a huge Yorkshire pudding, gravy, roast potatoes and various sides, such as sweet potato puree. If I had one complaint about the roast it would be that the potatoes could have been slightly warmer, but &#39;tis a small blemish.<br><br>No matter though, because the desserts took the experience up a couple of notches. I went for a fig and maple syrup bakewell tart with prune ice cream and my friend sticky toffee pudding with ice cream. One bite of each was all it took to seal this place&#39;s 5 star rating: warm, flavoursome and oozing quality. The sticky toffee pudding was particularly good, up there with the very best I&#39;ve had.<br><br>Elsewhere, there are plenty of other pluses. Though a Young&#39;s pub, it had a few other ales on draft, including the ever-dependable Samsbrook Wandle and new beer Pumphouse Pale Ale. The other food on offer looked very good too: tempting scotch eggs that sadly they&#39;d sold out of when we took our seats; burgers in posh baps and string fries. The rest of the dessert menu was extraordinary, containing no less than five dessert wines, something I&#39;ve never seen before on a pub menu. And perhaps most surprising of all, the food wasn&#39;t that expensive: about £13 for the roast chicken, £4 for the Samsbrooks and an admittedly fairly expensive but still worth it £7 for the desserts. Service was good and there&#39;s plenty of space inside.<br><br>The only slight negative of the experience was that it took about 20 minutes to be seated. Really though, that&#39;s not bad compared to how long waits can be. And in this instance, it was easily worth it.<br><br>As for the yuppies, it&#39;s true that there were a few here, but they were in the minority. I didn&#39;t find them particularly irksome - not like the masses of hipsters to be found out east. And indeed, arguably if it weren&#39;t for the spending power and preferences of this Fulham set, the food wouldn&#39;t be what it is, so heck, it could be said they&#39;re a force for good...",

Lots of great beer.. the guinness was good, but not the real stuff :(<br><br>Although it doesn&#39;t look like anything French, my buddy who took me says that apparently the place did at least house or serve as a meeting point for the French resistance in London, hence the name... <br><br>All in all, it&#39;s a pretty cool and chill hangout spot...

Just grab anything that looks good, or order off the menu if you feel like something else. It&#39;s a fun eating experience.<br><br>The only drawbacks are:<br>1- The price. Sushi is always pricey so there&#39;s no sidestepping this one. I always feel like the portions are small and that I&#39;m not getting my fill (should probably just eat more rice). Also, having food sail by in front of you is very tempting and you quickly forget how much you are spending.<br>2- The seats were uncomfortable and offered no back support.

"reviewcomment":"The restaurant is very good and I think that 4 stars is just the right mount that I can offer without feeling too generous. <br><br>Bella is an Italian place so we ordered some bread and after that, a variety of pasta meals. The bread was out of this earth; so delicious, warm and crunchy that I was afraid that I would fill up on it and won&#39;t be able to continue; so I put it aside. <br><br>Continuing on to the pasta; it was delicious and quite rich in flavour actually. The generous portions were quite welcomed but I was already slightly full from the bread basket so I couldn&#39;t finish my meal. <br><br>I loved the waiting staff, with their matching outfits and quirky attitude. The guys were really nice and generally, I loved the place.",

"reviewcomment":"My home town in America has an exceptional number of great Korean places, so I was curious to see how London&#39;s Korean compared. The answer is: very well! Enjoyed a lovely, flavorful Dolsot BiBimBap with nice crunchy rice and great veggies. Very small compared to American Korean places though, about half the size. Or maybe their lunch size is small?<br><br>Service was fine, though the server spoke so little English we could not communicate that we wanted a raw instead of a fried egg on our BiBimBap, and it took us a long time to communicate that our friend could not eat rice (for medical reasons), for which they refused to substitute. So service and size are definitely where this place loses one to two stars.<br><br>The side dishes were great though, I really enjoyed them. More savory than in America where they are much more sour. The potato was lovely. I&#39;ll definitely be back soon.",

My sister and I witnessed a most impressive flaming (literally!) cocktail being poured from glass to glass (<a href='http://www.yelp.co.uk/biz_photos/viajante-london?select=PgWAh0RCmoBTCkf94O2cgQ#5ZzLSOqv8WewnaHZfAJMJg'>yelp.co.uk/biz_photos/vi…</a>)<br><br>As Chef Mendes won&#39;t be bringing his unique inventive cuisine here any more, I won&#39;t give a blow by blow description of the inventive style of cooking of his multi-course tasting menu supplemented with many extra amuses. For example, imagine mackarel with blackberries and coffee. I love this inventive style of food and this was one of my favourite meals in London",

"reviewcomment":"It was Sunday evening and time for dinner just didn&#39;t know what we were in the mood for, so I whipped out my handy Yelp App to look at some choices and after looking over the menu we settled on Thai Square and was even able to make a reservation through my Yelp App, pretty sweet I say.<br><br>Made our way to Thai Square, I told the host we had reservations, she looked at her book and didn&#39;t see any, but another lady went to the back and came out and addressed me by name, I thought that was a nice touch and we were shown to our seats. I have to say, Thai Square is very nice, felt swanky, hence the reason for no food pics, just felt like I shouldn&#39;t haha.<br><br>I started with Chicken Satay, it&#39;s the peanut sauce that I really crave and well I wanted to see if it&#39;s just as good in London as it is in Phoenix and yep it&#39;s amazing! The chicken had great flavor, it is sort of sad to cover it with the peanut sauce for it could stand on its own, but omg I love the peanut sauce and since I can&#39;t just eat with a spoon its best it goes on the chicken. <br><br>For my drink I ordered the Thai Tea, it was perfectly blended and tasted great! <br><br>For the main dish, I went with the Panang Beef Thai Hot (been told food in London is bland so I was thinking Thai Hot really wasn&#39;t going to be hot on my heat scale) . This was prime beef that had been slow cooked in coconut cream and Panang curry paste and it was garnished with lime leaves, I also ordered a side of coconut rice. When the meal came out it looked amazing, the server placed the food on the table then served me, that&#39;s right, she placed curry on my plate followed by some rice, felt kind of spoiled.  The Panang Beef was amazing, the flavors the texture, oh so good! And going Thai Hot was perfect for me. That was a great curry dish. Now I&#39;ll have to find it here in Phoenix or cook it myself.<br><br>Glad to have found Thai Square on my Yelp App, look forward to coming back.",

"reviewcomment":"I made a reservation for 7pm, however we arrived around 6:30pm, as we were quite hungry, and was seated at the bar until our table would be free. There were quite a lot of free tables in the restaurant. At 7pm we went to ask where our table was, and it was like they had forgotten us.<br><br>They took us to a table that had been free the entire time. <br><br>The atmosphere in the restaurant is quite cool. And i loved the interactive tables, and the ability to order our own food. <br><br>The food came out quite quickly and the staff were attentive on ensuring our wine glass was constantly topped up. <br><br>The portions seem a little off. And the descriptions of the food on the menu are also off. I ordered what i thought was salad, however came served on rice, and for the price was incredibly small. My other guest ordered duck which was in fact cheaper than my dish and was huge. <br><br>I do wonder how they can charge 12.5% for service charge when in fact the staff don&#39;t actually do a whole lot other than deliver your meal to your table. <br><br>I&#39;m a fan because of the atmosphere, and the idea behind the restaurant, but the staff and lack of attentiveness needs work.",

"reviewcomment":"I went to the Boundary Rooftop for lunch with a friend on a sunny, but not overly warm day. We walked in at 12.10pm and asked if there were any tables. The hostess downstairs told us that she could give us a table inside, but nothing was available outside. We were fine with that and went upstairs to the rooftop. <br><br>It&#39;s a beautiful place, with an outside area full of comfy sofas and chairs and a covered area that is more like a restaurant dining room in a greenhouse. <br><br>We were sat (inside) by the window with a great view over Dishoom. It was actually a little chilly to be sitting outside, so we were very happy inside. We had a good view of the kitchen and it was lovely and airy. <br><br>The food was amazing, I had the burger (which wasn&#39;t actually called a burger on the menu, it was actually described as: &#34;Boundary Pan Bagnat - a Niçoise-inspired sandwich with a flame-grilled beef patty, goat&#39;s cheese, roast vegetables and green salad&#34;) and my friend had the muscles with the amazing bread basket. We shared a carafe of white wine that the waiter recommended. For pudding my friend had the mango and pineapple eclair (sooooo scrummy) and I had the ice cream, that was home made and a revelation in taste! We both had lovely coffees and in total, I think we were there for over two hours. <br><br>What was really outstanding, was the service. Everyone was extremely attentive, friendly, warm and really made us feel welcome and looked after. I would heartily recommend a visit here.",

We were hungry and tired, and Bumpkin rejuvenated us. The atmosphere was modern cozy. It was light and open. We were also happy to see a children&#39;s menu. My daughter eats almost anything but I was pleased to see child-size portions for her. My older daughter devoured her fish and chips. My husband had the roasted chicken special of the day and declared it the best chicken ever. I had the vegetable soup of the day - very tasty - and a salad. I was very satisfied with the meal. The staff was good. They helped each other and they knew the menu well. They were an asset to the place. It is a bit pricey but it was good. Would come again. A great casual restaurant.",

"reviewcomment":"I wasn&#39;t even aware of the buzz around Ceviche when I went last night - we just needed somewhere to go quickly, and luckily were early enough to be sat outside to have a couple of dishes.<br><br>First things first, the service is great - the host was friendly, helpful and personable. He kept an eye on us (when you&#39;re sitting outside, this is a huge plus) and chased up the dishes to make sure we got all of them as swiftly as possible. When it started to rain, he moved us inside for dessert, and the service at the bar was also excellent and attentive. Full marks.<br><br>We had two glasses of the Malbec - I wish I&#39;d known how infamous the Pisco Sours are! That said, the wine was wonderful, and I had to stop my companion from pilfering the very stylish glasses.<br><br>To start, we shared the Cheese &amp; Chard Tequenos. I&#39;ve never had anything like them - very moreish, although quite rich so two each was enough, but I&#39;d definitely recommend trying them.<br>I had the Panza &amp; Higo (Pork Belly) skewer and unfortunately, it was just alright. Quite tasteless and not particularly appetising. For me, the confit fig wasn&#39;t quite right with the pork, but I think that&#39;s just personal taste. It is worth mentioning however that I still ate it all!<br>The dessert was the highlight - Chocolate Tart with sea salt, and pecan ice cream. I&#39;ve recently discovered the delights of a good choco-salt combination (I know, I&#39;m late to the party), so my expectations were high. This tart more than met them - beautifully rich, perfect portion size, right amount of salt. Wonderful.<br><br>The restaurant is quite cramped, but that could be said of most of them in Soho. It wouldn&#39;t stop me going back for more (and I do really need to try that Pisco Sour).",

"reviewcomment":"My favorite place to go for dim sum in London.<br><br>Food is well executed, service is good, and the place is clean. I&#39;d recommend making a reservation for weekends if you don&#39;t want to wait for a table (although not the worst place to have to wait for a table, since they have a full bar and lots of couches). <br><br>No push-carts here, although I don&#39;t recall ever seeing push-carts in London.  Honestly though, I don&#39;t even like push-carts. I&#39;ve been to yum cha enough times to know what I want on a menu, and things can go wrong with push-carts. First, it is more likely you&#39;re getting &#34;leftovers&#34; on a push-cart. Nope, I didn&#39;t want the ugly under-fried radish cake the first time I saw it come around on the cart, so why would I want it the fifth time? Second, I get irrationally upset when the push-cart ladies speak Mandarin instead of Cantonese, and don&#39;t understand when someone tries to order in Cantonese. I haven&#39;t had this problem in London, but it&#39;s a common occurrence in Canada nowadays.<br><br>Anyways, everything I had here was well prepared. I particularly liked the cuttlefish cake tofu skin cheung fun and the XO beef chow hor fun. Generally, nothing too innovative in terms of dishes, but still my first choice when I&#39;m craving yum cha.",

Trust.  Its essentially all you can eat meats and veggies for £20 and your food is cooked in a double sided pot with two types of soup atop of a skillet thing in the middle of your table. <br><br>There was lamb, and beef, and mushrooms of different types, and meat balls of different types (i don&#39;t know what they are i just ate them. Don&#39;t ask questions.. just eat) and beautiful shrimps and noodles and spinach and and and and... so much!<br><br>Our technique was to just dump a ton of food in there and then scoop out what you wanted to eat in  few minutes and voila you eat the said meats and things with delicious dipping sauces. <br><br>nom nom nom",

Expect fresh seafood in a slightly classier environment, with a price to match.<br><br>Got there on a Friday for dinner, early in the evening, and it was pretty packed. We managed to get the last two free seats at tables, though. The service was courteous and speedy. <br><br>The mixed grilled fish platter house specialty with a chips or a rocket salad, which turned out rather fresh. The fish of the day was dover, which came grilled, with nice char marks. There was also a whole shrimp. Apparently this dish changes on the daily, though, so don&#39;t expect the same thing!<br><br>Sea food salad came with mussels, squid, prawns, and scallops, as well as some greens and a citrusy dressing. Everything was fresh and flavorful, if a bit skimpy on the portions. <br><br>Overall, wonderful quality. All of the fish were juicy. The produce was fresh.

"reviewcomment":"I come here all the time. This little restaurant has a lot of history. Though the decor isn&#39;t anything hugely exciting, this adds to the experience - you&#39;re here for the food. And there&#39;s something about the large mirrors and raw walls that evoke the 1930s but in a wounded way; perfect for this cuisine; and the high ceilings are beautiful. I love the location, tucked away, the last building before the underground rolls past (you can watch the trains from the window in the back bit if you&#39;re into that haha).<br><br>It&#39;s all about the steak tartare for me. Prepared in front of you, it&#39;s simply a must. Love most things on the menu though... The duck is my standard delicious choice for a main but the breaded veal is excellent too. If you want something special ask for jajka faszerowane.<br><br>The vodka must be tried as well. This is something not fully appreciated in the UK; a shot usually served at room temp and usually some kind of abomination like Smirnoff. At Daquise ask the waiter for a recommendation and they will serve you a variety of proper vodkas, ice cold and in frosted shot glasses as they should be. The honey vodka is my personal favourite but take the opportunity to be a bit adventurous ;)",

"reviewcomment":"Why is it that one only discovers the gems in a local neighbourhood just as one is about to leave it? 222 Veggie Vegan is an 5 star joint however I look at it. It&#39;s super-cheap, for one: £7.50 for the all-you-can-eat lunch buffet is incredible value, particularly when one considers the &#39;pay-per-weight&#39; policy usually applicable to vegetarian places (e.g. Tibits). Second, the quality and variety of food is really good. The cold salads include tomato and lettuce, avocado and spinach and red cabbage, while the hot dishes centre around chickpeas, polenta, potato and most memorably, plantain.<br><br>There&#39;s quite a bit on the menu beyond the lunchtime buffet too: a couple of organic beers (the pretty decent Sam Smiths organic lager and the rather average Freedom organic lager), smoothies and unexpectedly delicious organic, fairtrade coffee. There are desserts too: my eyes were instinctively drawn to the wholewheat pancake that I was too stuffed to try, but made a mental note of for next time.<br><br>And finally, the atmosphere here is great, with a truly representative mix of locals to be found here. And on laid-back, diverse, unpretentious, friendly North End Road that&#39;s a good thing<br><br>Seriously, I am gutted that in 5 weeks time I&#39;ll be living 20 minutes cycle ride from this place rather than the 3 minutes walk that I currently do. But I fully expect to be making the trip on a regular basis regardless.",

The venue is huge; the downstairs and upstairs both have an outdoor area to get air or smoke. It closed around 2am, so we had to leave for another venue, but had a solid few hours of fun here! No strict dress code, saw some guys in suits but also jeans. Music was good, no cover to enter except for the £2 to get in to the upstairs dance floor, and I don&#39;t think the bathrooms were disgusting (my standards for east London bathrooms: &#34;not disgusting&#34; is all I ask for).<br><br>I prefer it to Hoxton square bars, which have the opposite vibe-- too small and too crowded.",

We ended up being seated not long after 11:15am. <br><br>I had checked out the menu earlier in the week, and had finally decided on what I was going to order. Mind you, I will have to go back a few times to really try everything I want to. <br><br>I settled on rice porridge with coconut yoghurt and mango, with an americano, and my friend on the full Aussie breakfast, complete with tomato sauce, and tea. <br><br>The service was attentive, and there seemed to be plenty of wait staff. Our meal came out quite quickly. However the coffee&#39;s came out ever so slowly.<br><br>My porridge was amazing! It was soo delicious. And the Aussie breakfast looked unreal, the eggs were so creamy!<br><br>I had ordered a second coffee, which was forgotten, until I asked a second time. Which was a bit of a shame. <br><br>But overall the experience was enjoyable, and felt like I was home. Perfect experience for the homesickness in me.",

"reviewcomment":"A beautiful and classic British restaurant located just opposite of the famous Savoy theatre - perfect for a pre theatre dinner. The place holds a great deal of history as it was originally opened in 1828 as a chess club and coffee house. <br><br>The service was impeccable and the dining room is very charming. We all ordered one of the signature dishes &#34;Roast rib of Scottish beef (aged 28 days)&#34; with Roast potatoes, Savoy cabbage, Yorkshire pudding &amp; horseradish. We were very pleased with the taste, but even better was that they roll the huge piece of beef out in a trolly and make a show of the carving process. I very much enjoyed that and the food was very good too, especially the horseradish. <br><br>I gladly recommend!",

"reviewcomment":"We stumbled across this place when we wanted to go somewhere for a quick drink and snack, and ended up having dinner. The bar is quite big and spacious that&#39;s perfect for having huge groups of friends, but there are little tables if you&#39;re with one other person, which is where we sat. It&#39;s great when the sun&#39;s out because the sunlight pours through the big windows and right where you sit. <br><br>We ordered drinks and three appetisers: fried wings, nachos and cajun fries. They came in huge portions so if you&#39;re looking for just a light meal, don&#39;t order too much! The fried wings were definitely my favourite... crispy on the outside and so juicy on the inside. The whole thing was covered in buttery bread crumbs, which I&#39;ve never had before. Absolutely addicting. The nachos were great as well, just enough stuff on top so there was no chips left behind. The fries were covered with cajun powder-stuff along with cajun mayo... the whole combination was phenomenal. <br><br>Just the three choices left us completely full and satisfied. Felt really guilty because it was so unhealthy but hey, that&#39;s what weekend gluttony is for. So if you&#39;re down for a fattening experience with a bunch of friends, this is a great place to indulge :)",

There are other good burrito places, but what make Benito&#39;s Hat stand out is the ingredients.<br><br>I work nearby, so we walk over fairly often. They change what they have on offer. Unlike Chipotle or Tortilla (both fine in their own ways), Benito&#39;s hat changes things up from time to time. I&#39;ve had spicy tofu, spicy mushrooms, and different kinds of vegetables. They also have my favourite Mexican beer (Negra Modelo) and they serve it with a lime (just like they do in the US). It&#39;s also nice to get a few tortilla chips thrown in when you get a burrito. We usually munch on those during our walk back to the office.",

But surprise, surprise, nothing has happened and nothing will any time soon.<br><br>In 2004, tight on cash, a friend introduced me to this chain. It was my first introduction into food in the UK that had great flavor. From then on, I learned a valuable lesson: If you like a blast of flavor in your food, find the ethnic food in the city. Nando&#39;s, a Portuguese chicken joint, fits the bill! I get the pita, like it spicy, and get the chips as well. The mango drink is nice if it&#39;s a rare warm day as well!",

Silla&#39;s (the owner of Feng sushi) passion for what they do really shone through and their commitment to sustainable fish is admirable. The fact that even someone as cack handed as me managed to turn out reasonable looking sushi rolls is testament to the brilliance of this class. I would definately recommend trying one of their sushi making clases and impressing the hell out of your friends with home made sushi the next time you throw a soiree! And if it all goes horribly wrong the Feng Sushi delivery service will save you, shh they&#39;ll never tell that it was them who made it ;-)<br><br>My favourites were the crab, avocado and mayo, a classic combo that really works in a sushi roll and the salmon nigiri topped with beautiful pea shoots, that was almost too pretty to eat. Almost.<br><br>I have to say the BBQ was a bit too salty for my taste but I have really cut down on my salt so I think that is just my personal opinion and certainly one that did not seem to be reflected by others around the table!",

I must say, it is rather daunting to go there by yourself if you&#39;ve never been before as the menu doesn&#39;t give much off by way of help.<br><br>I had the Tom kha chicken as my main dish. But their side dishes are perfect. They offer a great variety of dishes, which all have their very own distinct flavour. I cannot get enough of the Thai Calamari and the Chicken Satay. Those dishes are a must have when you go.<br><br>The only bad thing about this place is the fact that they don&#39;t take reservations. It is very annoying having to line up outside waiting for a table, especially during the dinner service. But it is definitely worth the wait. Enjoy.<br><br>N.B.: As they do not take reservations, you might want to get there earlier and be prepared to wait until a table is ready for you. This is especially important when you&#39;re with a large group.",

"reviewcomment":"I feel really bad when people come back from a restaurant I&#39;ve been to where I personally had a great dining experience and they had a really bad one. It seems Shaka Zulu is one of those places. Reading through previous reviews most of them are either really good or really bad and it is a combination of food and service. It seems to be a place that lacks consistency depending on what day you go and what you order. However this was my second dining experience using a Gourmet Society card and I can honestly say on both visits I had an amazing experience with lovely, attentive service and delicious food. <br>We went there on a Wednesday night and found it to be pretty empty. It didn&#39;t bother us at all as we enjoyed the company of the statues and was too &#39;wowed&#39; by the African carving on the walls of African warriors and animals, beautifully crafted tables and the rest of the luxurious decor. It was a two storey restaurant connected by indoor escalators and big enough to hold two groups of Kizomba dance lessons downstairs which we enjoyed watching as we ate. <br>Although there did seem a shortage of staff, the one waiter guy we kept seeing was awesomely fast paced at getting round to everyone and making sure our needs were met. Couldn&#39;t fault on his service either as he was approachable and friendly.<br>We started our meal with Crocodile cigars and Ham Hock and Wildebeest. Our intention on visiting was to try out exotic meats and although that is what we ordered, the starters did not allow us to explore it&#39;s original flavour and texture. They were great as they were though. For example the Crocodile cigars came as spring rolls, light pastry and lightly spiced and if they were just originally spring rolls I would have been very pleased. But knowing we&#39;re paying double to taste crocodile meat it did fail us as there wasn&#39;t enough in there to taste what crocodile is or get the texture. The curry spices also hid it&#39;s original flavours. Wish they could find another way of serving the meat. Ham Hock and Wildebeest was more successful as it was more meaty, coarse and generously portioned. The meat was juicy, lean and well seasoned  But I still had trouble distinguishing what was pork and what was wildebeest. But if I was judging on the flavour of these starters rather than my intentions they were very decent and tasty and it is only fair to review them that way. <br>For mains we shared a zebra fillet and springbok loin both cooked medium rare as requested. All the steaks were served with shoestring fries and a little side of salad although they were more for decor and texture rather to fill you up as the portion was teeny. As lovely and crunchy the fries were it was just the crisp end. But it was all about the main event and I can honestly say it was one of the best steaks I&#39;ve had. <br>The zebra was incredibly tender and soft, more spongy in texture compared to beef and sweeter tasting. For a fillet it wasn&#39;t very gamey but more delicate in flavour and sweet. Springbok was more firmer probably because it was the loin but I preferred the texture. It was still incredibly tender, effortless to cut with the knife and had a richer deeper meaty taste compared to the zebra. Both were very succulent and cooked perfectly pink inside. I highly recommend both.<br>For those with a big appetite like us it definitely wasn&#39;t filling and so for sides we ordered celeriac mash and roast cinnamon butternut. Both were amazing with the butternut beautifully grilled till soft so some of the sugar caramalised. The celeriac mash was also seasoned nicely and creamed till smooth. It had more taste than the usual potato and I much preferred it. <br>For dessert we decided to take the full advantage of trying African cuisine so we ordered the trio of South African dessert. It consisted of a African milk tart but the filling with not as creamy and milky as I would have liked it. It was quite actually dense and rubbery. More successful was the koeksisters which resembled very much like a Turkish doughnut with it being coated in syrup, spongy, sticky and sweet. The last dessert was more a African cocktail made from icecream mixed in Kahlua to give that coconut essence. The alchohol could have been stronger but that&#39;s my personal preference. I do love coconut and ice cream so enjoyed it nevertheless. Altogether the dessert platter was average but it was nice to get a taste of what African dessert is.<br>I would highly recommend Shaka Zulu as a place everyone must visit at least one. Of course I do hope everyone experiences the same level of quality of food and service as we did that evening but just for the amazing eye catching decor it has to be visited. I would advise everyone to stick to the steaks as they did not disappoint. There is usually a 50% offer on Toptable across mains made available to everyone because without it the damage can be quite bad. But this is no ordinary restaurant and definitely one I put on the &#39;romantic&#39; and &#39;birthday&#39; venue list.",

"reviewcomment":"Great location for this pub (just a bit south from London Bridge, on the corner at Stony St. right next to Borough Market. Had an interesting beer, here, Stonehenge Eye Catcher, but tended to gravitate back to the more traditional London ales. Good service during the afternoon (both at the bar and at the table) at midday when the place was a little less crowded.  It gets hectic later on, though. The afterwork crowd fills the place later on making the service understandably less reliable. Food is pub classics, mediocre, but what you want in a pub. Great place for a pint off Borough Market if you&#39;re headed this way for the day.<br><br>I was a tourist here but felt like I was treated as a regular, so that scores high in my book.",

Remind me again why we couldn&#39;t move?!<br><br>Obviously, because the meal was free, we were dining on a select menu. We ordered the chicken wings, the fajitas and the ribs. The presentation was nice but the quantity and quality of the food was not outstanding. We shared a pitcher of pornstar margaritas, which were really good, but I&#39;m not sure about the value for money on that one.<br><br>Reading some of the other reviews, I&#39;m not really surprised as I see what they are saying. Ruby Blue isn&#39;t known for being a restaurant, but more as bar. Clearly, the reason for this is the food itself.

"reviewcomment":"A cute French dinner spot across the street from a bunch of Lebanese and Persian restaurants.  It&#39;s a bit tiny inside - low ceilings, narrow walkways, and maybe three stories high.  Kitchen and dish washing on the top floor, hidden from the public.  Daily specials written in French on chalkboards but menus fortunately have English too.  Waitstaff were also French and very efficient with their service.<br><br>Our group of six ordered a bottle of Pinot Noir and Merlot, which went well with half the group ordering meat and the other fish.  Both went down smooth and had little aftertaste.<br><br>Shared appetizers include snails (a dozen for the table) with strong garlic and a green (pesto?) butter sauce, amazing mussels in garlic wine sauce, and a bit of grilled yellowfin with quinoa.  My favorites were the mussels by far.  Their free bread was pretty amazing too by the way - firm outside and chewy inside.<br><br>For my own starter I ordered the fish soup, which reminded me of bisque.  Very savory and hearty - must be the broth.  The shredded cheese melted quickly and added more richness.  Bread slices came with this yellow sauce that looked like mustard but tasted like roasted garlic - divine.<br><br>For entree, I ordered the duck confit, which arrived in a cute little cast iron pot.  It was cooked in beans and pork sausage - a cassoulet.  Duck meat had wonderful charred skin and the meat was well seasoned, enhanced by the sweet sauce they offered on the side.  Beans were a bit too much so I finished maybe half only.<br><br>Desert was chocolate fondant with praline ice cream.  It&#39;s similar to a lava cake, but based on a flour less shell filled with hot fudge that oozed out when cut open.  Very rich and decadent - having a side of black coffee is a must.  <br><br>Overall a nice, reasonably price French place in London that I would highly recommend.  I haven&#39;t been to France yet but could sense they are probably authentic.  One of our group members don&#39;t eat pork products so the wait staff will not make substitutions as it would alter the main dishes. Luckily they have nice beef options without pork too.",

"reviewcomment":"Man, I haven&#39;t even finished yet and I have to write a review. <br><br>Some friends and I tried to get into the one at South Bank the other night but there was a 90-minute wait for a table, so I knew I had to pop in another time. When I found it at Westfield in Shepherds Bush, I had to jump in. <br><br>I&#39;ve ordered a sweet potato side, slow-cooked pork burrito and the Tequila Experience. <br><br>Sweet potato - I don&#39;t know what they&#39;ve done to it but I&#39;ve never had anything like it. Crispy on the outside and so smooth and sweet in the middle. Perfection. <br><br>I&#39;ve made the mistake in the past of eating traditional Mexican before and adding cheese to the burrito. I learnt my lesson that time. The pork is so tender. It falls apart in your mouth. Jesus would say &#34;Fuck you, Judas, I&#39;m hanging around,&#34; if this were served at the Last Supper. <br><br>And the tequila! I&#39;ve only had two of the three but they are so smooth, babies&#39; arses everywhere are jealous. Looking forward to the last. <br><br>This is a must-do if you like food and you&#39;re in London. I will be returning again before I leave.",

"reviewcomment":"If you are not made of £50 notes or not a regular on the TV then this probably wont be a place for you. <br>I only used to go because my friend had influence there and although yes the nights were fun and you would always be sure to see some sort of A,B.C list celeb it was because of this it could become quite daunting. <br><br>On a weekend this place will always fill out, the doormen are not stupid and either are the management. As a priority they allow in lots of bimbo chicks who are either some sort of kiss n tell types, or high class prostitutes who are purely there to hunt soap stars, or footballers and get their own name in the tabloids. So yeah lots of fake smiles and laughter when you go in.  <br><br>On the best nights the women would be normal, approachable types which is much better and the crowd would not be so posey. <br>Having seen how security behaves and how people get turned away for the most stupidest reason this place loses points. <br>Once you are in through the doors you will probably always have a good night but do have a few drinks before you come here so its easier to relax around what could be the most pretence crowd ever.",

Ordered an americano and I thought it was pretty good. They add a nice touch by including a mini bottle of milk with the coffee. Ordered the brunch Eggs Royale. It was good, but the eggs were overcooked. Didn&#39;t get any runny yoke...instead it was pretty solid. Friends ordered the sandwiches and looked great. I&#39;d recommend the roast beef sandwich, which I will be ordering next time I&#39;m there.",

Trinity does not do that. It remains modern and interesting without losing sight of the customer&#39;s empty bellies and salivating taste buds. <br>6) Clear winners for me were the &#34;Coriander Seared Tuna, Avocado, Soy and Lime&#34; and the &#34;Blackberry and Apple Parfait, Caramelised White Chocolate and Hazelnut&#34;. They were simply out of this world! <br><br>Cons:<br>1) One negative is the fact that some people could find the dishes too rich and heavy...there were A LOT of powerfully flavored and heavy dishes. I didn&#39;t find this to be the case, but it&#39;s worth a note for those who like more delicate dishes.",

When I ordered it, our nice waitress warned me that it was spicy. The menu said the same, but I assumed that she was only exaggerating. I consider myself a spice lover, but this was way out of my realm. Like I said, the flavor was great, so if not for the immense spice, it would be a five-star dish. It seems like instead of listing it as &#34;spicy,&#34; the menu should have classified it as &#34;very spicy.&#34; Everyone else in my six-person party enjoyed their food, so the spice in my dish is the only thing holding it back from a five-star review.",

"reviewcomment":"Sometimes I just need some Dim Sum. There is something rather special about the little balls of sweet and sour filled joy (buns) coming in piping hot thatched wooden gazebo box. Dumpling of various varieties and sticky rice wrapped in banana leaves. It&#39;s the perfect thing to share with a group and this is just what we did. 11 of us at a large round table made it a great atmosphere to &#34;pass that yum thing&#34; around. <br><br>I was a little dismayed by the prices, though for London, I guess I shouldn&#39;t have been too shocked! The menu is pretty big with lots of choices for everyone. I wasn&#39;t particularly hungry after a huge lunch so went for the lighter options. I actually was in the mood for veggie things and found a great deal to choose from. I personally ordered the vegetable dumpling soup which came with a gorgeous broth which was warm but not overpowering. Perfect appetizer. I had the vegetarian sticky rice which came all wrapped up. I had some of the chicken dumplings which were tiny parcels of joy and went great with the sauce. I pinched a bit of the little lamb chops off the table which were succulent and gave just enough tug when you tried to rip it off the bone. Also, the beer deal was pretty legit as we got a bucket (yes, a bucket) of 10 beers for like 29 pounds? <br><br>Next time I go, I am definitely going to pig out on the 29 pound set menu.

"reviewcomment":"Oh how wonderful this place was!<br><br>I came here on a Saturday night (my birthday) and had a wonderful time.<br><br>To start, I had the Roast Macsween haggis with mash &amp; bashed neeps, and while this was the first time I&#39;d had Haggis, it was amazingly good!  My only regret is that I didn&#39;t try Haggis sooner in life!  I did add the Nogg of whiskey and it was delicious.  That was accompanied by Marsannay Les Vaudenelles 2008, which accented it very well.<br><br>For dessert I had the Raspberry cranachan cheesecake, also excellent.<br><br>I&#39;d gone in wanting to try the Macallan 30yr Fine Oak, but alas it was sold out.  Instead I went with the Glenmorangie 25yrs, of which I ended up having two.  Old enough to drink itself in any country, it was very smooth, dancing with flavors, and wonderfully balanced.  I suppose the fact I ended up having two makes my point best o all.<br><br>I decided to indulge and had an Epicure No 2 with my first glass of Glenmorangie 25, it was light-medium and very tasty.  The taste was smooth and left a nice but not too strong aftertaste.<br><br>There was live music, a Jazz/Blues band, and after making friends with one of the guys that happened to be a member he got us (and some very lovely ladies) seated right near the band.  They were excellent and if any indication of the average band that plays here, something you&#39;d be unwise to miss.<br><br>As the evening was winding down I wanted one more drink and had a pint, though the name escapes me.<br><br>The whole place was alive the entire time I was there.  Had I not be alone I would strongly suggest reservations, but prepare to stay until closing as I did, you don&#39;t want to miss out.  They are open much later than many places around, which is wonderful if you want a full night out.<br><br>In short, this place is not to be missed.",

"reviewcomment":"Heaven in a hotpot! The hotpot definitely outshines the rest they have on the menu. The broth is so thick and rich in flavors. It doesn&#39;t taste too spicy even though it looks so, but you can also taste sweetness. The pot has everything from marinated sliced beef, tofu, onion, kimchi and a selection of vegetables. They also have pork, seafood and kimchi hotpot. <br><br>The seafood pancake was alright. It doesn&#39;t come in small portion so it&#39;s good for a shared starter. I thought the dipping sauce wasn&#39;t so good. It&#39;s just a plain soy sauce without additional spices. <br><br>My favorite menus in Korean restaurant are japchae or vegetable fried glass noodles and BBQ ribs. Both were well served in Assa but the BBQ portion is small so you may want to order more if you consider eating just it. <br><br>Additional kimchi side is £2.50 and they give seaweed pickle and bean sprouts for free with free flow cold ginseng tea. <br><br>The place is rather small and can get very busy during lunch or dinner time. You will see a queue in front of this place but make sure you don&#39;t enter the other Assa next door (Japanese).",

"reviewcomment":"Some highly rated restaurants can be a disappointment.  Hibiscus, which boasts two Michelin stars, is most definitely not one of them.  On a recent visit, 3 friends of mine and I had a quite superb meal. <br><br>Located in a small central London side street off Regent Street, south of Oxford Street and Hanover Square, Hibiscus is one of those restaurants that might be easy to overlook.  Its exterior is unprepossessing.  Indeed, the building looks more like a suite of offices from the outside than a high quality French restaurant.  The interior is small.  There is a reception desk and a very small seating area just inside the door.  Beyond that is the dining room, which again is not large.  It is, however, intimate, cosy and welcoming.  <br><br>The food is stunningly good.  My friends and I opted for the six-course Tasting Menu.  Part of the fun of having that is that there are no details on the menu of what you are about to eat. It&#39;s all a real surprise (although the waiters do make discreet enquiries beforehand about allergies and particular dislikes, presumably to ensure that any unnecessary disappointments are avoided).  Everything we ate was wonderful.  I would single out a pea veloute flavoured with curry and buttermilk (a sort of refined pea soup); a chicken dish with liquorice and banana flavours; and a caramelised light chocolate tart with a lemon sorbet.  We had a very good, and a reasonably-priced, red wine that was recommended by the sommelier.  It was deliciously smooth.  The post dinner coffee was accompanied by mouthwatering chocolate and assorted petits fours.  All in all, it was a superb meal.  Not surprisingly, such excellent fare does not come cheaply. The bill was £130 per person!  But it was well worth it.  The service was excellent.  <br><br>Hibiscus is one of the best restaurants I have ever been to.  It&#39;s undoubtedly worth a visit for that special occasion or when you just feel like spoiling yourself.",

"reviewcomment":"I consider myself a traveler, not a tourist and I hate tourist trap restaurants. I really wanted good fish and chips on a recent trip to London so I checked Yelp rather than the tourist guide books. I read the reviews for Toff&#39;s and decided to go there. I didn&#39;t realize Toff&#39;s was such a journey away from Kensington where I was staying so my mother and I set off in search of great fish and chips. <br><br>We took the train to North London and got off and started walking. She hates walking and it was 15+ minute walk uphill for the most part. She complained the entire way. She didn&#39;t even appreciate the wonderful park views or lack of tourists. The only thing that stopped her complaining was when the fish and chips were set down in front of us. In short, it was worth the walk and the complaining. The fish was huge and  crispy and delicious and it was fresh. The chips were the best I had in London or pretty much anywhere. A testament to how good it was is that my mother, who picks at food and eats very little usually, ate everything on her plate and finished before me!<br><br>The best part of the meal though: the sticky toffee pudding in custard. I&#39;m drooling now thinking about it. I had also wanted authentic sticky toffee pudding while in London, so I killed 2 birds with one stone at Toff&#39;s. My mother had the creme caramel and loved it. In addition to the mouthwatering food, the service was friendly, fast, and totally efficient. The owner joked around with us and Alex, our waiter, was a delight. When my  mother complained to him about the walk from the train he told us to take a bus from right outside so she wouldn&#39;t have to walk back. It was one of best dining experiences we had in London. They should consider opening more branches, specifically one in NYC,",

Very tasty accompaniments. (BTW, if you want more bread, you will have to ask for it, as it will not be offered. My only real ding on this place. This is a tapas restaurant, after all, and bread should be easier to come by.)<br><br>Nice Covent Garden ambiance, although somewhat of a dated dining room with lots of 90s burgundy and black.  Afterwards, walk around the Apple Market for a late night Covent Garden feel. Wondering outloud if Gwyneth Paltrow named her daughter after a Victorian night market in Covent Garden in her throws of London amore?",

"reviewcomment":"Perfect place for a big group dinner (as long as you&#39;re with people who don&#39;t mind eating family style!) I brought a group of 11 people here and we all fit snugly around the round table at the back of the restaurant. Was a bit cozy, sometimes our chopsticks hit one another as we ate, but that added to the fun! <br><br>We ordered 8 dishes to split among us, with a big steaming pot of rice to pass around as well. Everything was delicious, spicy spicy spicy, but the perfect amount of food to try more than a little of everything and walk away feeling completely sated. In the end it came out to less tan £17 each, and that was with everyone having at least one beer (two options: Tiger or Tsing Tao) to wash away the heat.",

As you can see from my stars, the good has defeated the not-so-good in the end and the jerk has won me over to the jerk side.<br><br>I really like the word &#39;jerk&#39;, it sounds funny and it carries a certain ring to it if you keep saying it over and over. You&#39;ll find a lot of jerk here, it&#39;s the City of Jerk we&#39;re talking about. They serve quite big portions and it&#39;s not like there&#39;s a plate full of veggies with a miniature piece of chicken - the meat and veggies are equally distributed and you&#39;ll find it surprising that you&#39;ll run out of both at the same time. <br><br>It&#39;s not very expensive, yet some of the dishes seem a tad overpriced as opposed to some other joints in the area.",

"reviewcomment":"The food is always so fresh and vibrant.<br><br>The service is interesting. They care about what they serve and they&#39;re proud of it, but they aren&#39;t your best friends. A bit surly, even. The decor leaves a lot to be desired, chairs are old and don&#39;t match. But it&#39;s the food I&#39;m really after. <br><br>I only had three days in London for this trip and I went to Gaby&#39;s twice. I also ordered the same  thing twice, which was the daily special: Hungarian goulash. The meat was so tender, the sauce was so flavourful and the variety on my plate was great. It comes with a soup (get the lentil, it&#39;s so good), some salad and either rice or pita on the plate, which balanced my meal perfectly. I asked the server and she said the rice went well with the goulash, so that&#39;s what I ordered. It was the best (but only) goulash I ever had. My best friend got their hummus special on one occasion and their falafel on the other and both tasted fantastic. Prices are decent, location is convenient and I left feeling so satisfied.<br><br>I would have ordered some things for takeout, but I couldn&#39;t carry much on me and I was much too full. But their selection looked so tempting and delicious. It also makes me happy knowing it&#39;s a local, family-run business. You&#39;ll see all sorts of people in here, from 60-year-old business men to a family of four out for lunch to us, two girls touring London. I will definitely be going back one day.",

There&#39;s just too many variables to take into account that can&#39;t be recreated in a building, particularly one that has to meet food hygiene and safety standards!<br><br>This said Satay House is one of the better Malaysian restaurants that tries it&#39;s best to recreate the more formal malaysian dining experience that you can get particularly in the capital of Malaysia. The sambals and chilli are not as I remember them, not as spicy and sweeter, but the satay with compressed rice, onion and cucumber were great. As was the coconut rice. Fluffy and not too salty.<br><br>Each dish had plenty of flavour and the portions were decent. Whilst there is limited seating upstairs, downstairs, we were situated in a quite luxurious booth where there was a nice HD tv screening the football. It wasn&#39;t at a perfect angle for the table, but get there early and you&#39;ll have some additional entertainment to the company :)",

Which leads us to the real reason this place is such a gem.<br><br>Where else can you play the original arcade version of TMNT, foosball, and N64 Mario Kart all to the tunes of some of the best/worst pop music of the 90&#39;s.

"reviewcomment":"Down a side St near Canary wharf and facing the Thames, the Gun was firing on all cylinders. First, it&#39;s a proper pub with decent beers, friendly, welcoming atmosphere and appealing outside terrace directly on the Thames overlooking the O2. <br><br>Second, the food was just fantastic. Smoked haddock and mussel soup was so good I almost licked the bowl clean, the roast cod with borlotti beans and garlic was really well executed, full of flavor and the fish was thick and succulent and perfectly cooked.<br><br>We didn&#39;t make it to deserts but they looked good, maybe next time.<br><br>Great wine list with my favourite Italian white, Greco di Tufo and reasonably priced.<br><br>Third, impeccable service.<br>Really impressed. You could go for a drink or for dinner and feel right at home.",

I visited on a Wednesday evening where as the evening progressed, so did the queues!<br><br>I went for a number of the smaller dishes. The falafel was some of the best I ever had and the hummus and baba ganoush are also pretty great. The food doesn&#39;t all come out at once, which I didn&#39;t mind apart from that our fried fish dish was brought out about 5-10 minutes after everything else.<br><br>The service was ok. It was very busy so I can forgive it not being 5*. One issue was where our table was placed though (in a corner behind stairs) which meant often having to wave erratically to get any attention.<br><br>That being sad, I am a fan of this place!

They had a special going for lunch that included a drink and a dessert, along with the entree and fries, for I think around 6 pounds. My favorite was the breakfast, though, delicious and very well priced. I really enjoyed the atmosphere and the staff was always friendly and helpful. <br><br>They also seem more than accommodating: there was one day where friends and I were there, not sure if anyone else would join us. The waitress went ahead and took our orders, etc. A few of our classmates showed up, and she was quick to pull up chairs and make room for them, and get them served asap. It was nice!",

I&#39;ve been here quite a few times now usually walking towards the river or the Tate Modern and I suddenly remember there is a place that offers a free view of the city! Yes, thats right, you can come to the 6th floor of 1 New Change without paying at all. Of course it is great to sit with a drink in the sun and soak up the atmosphere but don&#39;t feel obliged to, I&#39;ve seen many people come up and take a seat and some photos and then leave without security or the bar staff ever approaching them. Perfect for a Saturday night pre-drink or a lazy Sunday afternoon.",

Freshly shelled crab (both brown and white!) with a squeeze of lemon was good but slightly on the bland side. <br><br>I had the breaded pork with brown butter and capers. The crispy breaded coating covered a nice thin slice of pork.  It was tasty and could have done with a bit more of the brown butter.  It came topped with a slightly overcooked egg.  I ordered a side of sprouting broccoli as well.<br><br>My partner had the fish pie.  What can I say, it was a fish pie.  Tasty but slightly heavy handed on the dill.<br><br>We had a very nice bottle of pinot noir though.  Very smooth.<br><br>Overall, it was a good meal but not necessarily over the top amazing.  The restaurant has a nice atmosphere without being pretentious which I really appreciated.  A good place for a lazy meal!",

The first time we were sat upstairs, and it was lovely - I believe I wrote a review on this a while back. The most recent time, the upstairs was reserved for a private party so we sat downstairs and it was such a different experience. <br><br>The atmosphere downstairs is more of a pub with tables crammed in, if that makes sense. But the food is, of course, just as good - my parents both had the onglet and loved it; I had the fish and chips and it was great! The peas weren&#39;t overly pureed, the breading was crispy... all in all, a very good pub fish and chips. <br><br>The pub itself is on the outskirts of Kentish Town, just past Gospel Oak overground station. A bit easy to miss. But worth it - for the food, at least. There&#39;s not a lot of space to stand around and have a pint after work, unfortunately.",

If you order the calzone, it&#39;s the size of a 1 month old baby. The pizza is not only huge, but toppings are plenty and the crust is delic. You don&#39;t feel ripped off at all. I always have some left over and get a takeaway box. <br><br>*The garlic bread order is basically a whole pizza, but garlic and cheese. So be prepared to share with 5 ppl, unless this will be your main order. <br><br>There&#39;s usually always a wait and typically I don&#39;t have the patience or personality for long waits for a table, but for me, this place is worth it.

I&#39;m a huge sushi fan but would never have considered coming here if not for a friend inviting me to dinner. <br><br>We sat at a table not at the carousel and indulged on a variety of sushi and sashimi, all of which was fresh without any fishy smell to it. I especially like their warm plates which are a brilliant idea for when you want to have sushi and can&#39;t eat a whole chicken and rice meal. These guys have you totally covered with their little plates of menu items which ordinarily come as a rice and meat dish but instead are served on a little sushi plate at a fraction of the cost. Brilliant!<br><br>Sadly I haven&#39;t been back here since as it&#39;s not really close to anywhere I need to be on a regular basis but next time I&#39;m in Holborn or perhaps visiting the National Gallery, I&#39;ll see if it&#39;s possible to stop by for lunch.<br><br>Also, 10% discount for students. Score!",

"reviewcomment":"Lowlander is a great pub. Easy to get to and with an extensive beer menu. They have guest lists of beers that are always changing. As a fan of Belgian beer this was the perfect spot to come to. <br><br>We had mussels and pulled pork. The pulled pork was flavorful and had a wonderful side of coleslaw. Only issues was if it&#39;s busy do not expect a very attentive waitress (fair enough and understandable) and incredibly loud. Lots and lots of yelling. Nice interior though and as mentioned before great beer options.",

"reviewcomment":"All of the Galvin Brothers&#39; restaurants are great, but their Bistrot is my favourite. It has an intimate, club-like feel and décor, and yet is quite relaxed and informal, without any pretension. The diners always seem to be comprised mainly of repeat customers; not surprising as there is no hype to this place that I&#39;m aware of.<br><br>They keep your details on file and know your contact numbers when you book... perhaps to screen out the no-shows? And booking seem to be always a good idea as I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever been when they weren&#39;t full, even in mid-week.<br><br>Their menu changes quite frequently, but has retained some favourites since their opening some eight years ago. Exquisite crab lasagne, layers of delicious crab meat between thin, circular pasta sheets with a creamy sauce, served in a portion that leaves you craving your next chance to visit; terrines of ham hock, chicken and foie gras, about as good as terrines get, though I think the idea slightly better than the reality. Perhaps I just prefer hot foie gras...<br><br>Main courses have included a pigeon tagine, possibly the tastiest version I&#39;ve ever had, perfectly deconstructed; squab pigeon roasted pink; slow cooked, falling apart belly of pork and my favourite, calf&#39;s brains. A whole brain cooked slightly crispy on the outside, with beurre noisette &amp; capers... My biggest disappointment in life was that this was no longer on their menu when I last went.<br><br>The tables are a bit close together, but no more so than other bistros and the service is European and professionally efficient.<br><br>OK, enough of that, I&#39;m going to find a free evening to go again...",

"reviewcomment":"You know when you have been craving something and finally find something that fills that craving???  This is the story of that experience!  I like to think that I embrace the local foods wherever I go, however, sometimes you really just want a little taste of &#39;home&#39;.  While I love the UK and think that people who say that the British food isn&#39;t very good have clearly not been to the right restaurants, as an American, there are some things that I do long for.  One of those... American pancakes.<br><br>Just a couple of weekends ago, Work BFF (a fellow American) and I hit the road to try out some American pancakes and were pretty disappointed.  This past weekend we were in London for the NKOTBSB concert (I know you are jealous) and I was tasked, again, with planning our food experience.  One of Work BFF&#39;s requests was a brunch place for Monday morning.  In my Yelp! research, I found this place.  I read the reviews and we looked at the menu (increasingly, restaurants can score brownie points with me if they have a sample menu online) and decided to try it, but, as the British say, we were managing our expectations.<br><br>When we arrived, it wasn&#39;t so busy we had to wait, but it seemed to have some regulars that were meeting up for their usual lunch/brunch.  We could choose wherever we wanted to sit, so we opted for the back of the restaurant as there was a skylight where the sun was coming in and we could get away from the noise of the High Street as the door opened and shut.  Our waitress was lovely, quick, and very attentive.  The menu... an indecisive person&#39;s nightmare... in a good way.  They have a breakfast portion of the menu and a lunch portion of the menu and the waitress also had some specials to tell us about.  Everything looked delicious and I was almost swayed from my mission of pancakes.  Work BFF was struggling to decide as she was set on having breakfast, but after taking a look at the menu, decided she might want lunch.<br><br>When our waitress came back, we ordered, Work BFF the Cinnamon French Toast, and me the American Pancakes with bacon.  I did ask the waitress if I could have my bacon done a bit crispy she said, &#34;No problem!&#34;  Love it.  Our drinks (orange juice, an Americano, and two glasses of tap water... with ice) came promptly.  Honestly, we didn&#39;t wait very long before our food appeared... and not in a &#39;we&#39;re in a rush to get you out of here&#39; sort of way.  I have posted a picture of our food... it looked almost like it would in the U.S.!!!!!  I say almost because usually pancakes are served with a bit of butter on top, but the pancakes were nice and large, golden, and FLUFFY... so fluffy I could die (sorry, I always think of that movie when I hear or say fluffy).  And the bacon... it was three pieces of crispy, streaky bacon!!!!  My level of excitement may have been equal to that of seeing the Backstreet Boys in concert the night before, hearing they were recording another album, and my favourite, Kevin, was coming back to the group... just sayin&#39;.<br><br>I poured the syrup on and went for a taste... HEAVENLY!  This is what I have been searching for!  I can stop searching for places to have pancakes!  They were delicious and I thought there was just the right amount on the plate.  They do skimp a bit on the syrup, especially with the size of the pancakes, but if you ask they will give you more, as Work BFF found out when she asked for more for her Cinnamon French Toast (which looked awesome with the strawberries and bananas on the side... she reported it tasted good as well).  We also discovered that the syrup was real Vermont Maple Syrup (Work BFF was able to identify the bottle from across the room), not that Tasty Treat Maple Flavoured Ice Cream Topping.<br><br>Our waitress stopped to check on us a few times, which was nice that we didn&#39;t have to wave her down for anything.  And... for the enormous pancakes and bacon, it is £6.25.  I believe I reviewed another restaurant for their three tiny pancakes and their cost is more than that!  And my Americano was £2.40... under £10!  Work BFF&#39;s French Toast was £6.25 as well, and her orange juice was more than £2.40, but she also had a massive glass of it.  This was a good bargain in our opinion (and we get paid in USD...)!  The search for the American pancake is over!",

"reviewcomment":"I am lucky enough to have a friend with membership who took me here last Friday for drinks and dinner. It doesn&#39;t look a lot from the outside, but it&#39;s nestled in the corner of Portman Square, which gives it a great view (I&#39;ll come on to that later.) <br><br>We walked in to a beautiful, but not huge hall, that led to a gorgeous double staircase. We climbed up to the first floor and started to look for a table in the beautiful drawing rooms. It truly is a labyrinth - we walked through gorgeous room after room, each slightly different to the last. There was one where they were preparing a jazz singer for some evening entertainment. We finally settled in one where there was an empty sofa and table. We were next to a smartly dressed, older woman who was asleep on her sofa. That&#39;s the thing that I really noticed - everyone seemed fairly normal. I mean, they were all &#34;white middle class normal&#34; ;-) but they weren&#39;t too pretentious, or trendy, or young or trust fund rich. <br><br>We had a couple of gasses of wine (they had viognier by the glass, I was so happy!) and some bar snacks that came with the wine. We took our time and then asked about tables available in the two restaurants. We were hoping to go the pan-asian Octagon restaurant that used to be the lady of the house&#39;s boudoir, but that was fully booked. So we settled on the rather obviously named &#34;The Restaurant&#34;. <br><br>We had to walk down the stairs, through to another house and back up to &#39;The Restaurant&#39;. It really is a bit of a rabbit warren, but as long as you remember your gps device, you should be ok. The Restaurant is beautiful and we got a great table right at the front with the most amazing view of the square - it&#39;s so green and leafy at this time of year, and as the sun was setting it ended up looking like a very very beautiful garden. Pity I was there with a female friend really - although the whole thing really was so romantic that she might have got lucky if I had had another glass of wine! <br><br>We invested all our meal into one course and went for the steak. Oh my, was that a good decision! It was absolutely delicious, with chunky, crispy chips, a tomato and a mushroom - plus the spinach we had ordered on the side. We ate the whole thing, even though we probably shouldn&#39;t have. It was spectacular and the red wine that the waiter suggested we try went perfectly with the meal. <br><br>We couldn&#39;t even contemplate a coffee after that, we were so stuffed, yet very very happy! I would certainly jump at the chance to come back here - I&#39;d love to try the Octagon restaurant.",

The cook from far away seemed to wonder why the waiter and the manager were so strict on the rule.  <br><br>Original review:<br><br>After passing by many times we ended up trying this place for an English breakfast. We were clearly not disappointed by our choice, which led us to come back again few times, even just for coffee.<br><br>So for food, our English breakfasts were delicious. One of us also tried the sandwiches which were great. And the other plates we saw passing by looked delicious.<br><br>We went back simply for a morning coffee also, relaxing on the nice couches they have in a corner.<br><br>So this place is a great choice for coffee to food for breakfast and lunch, and has a nice cosy atmosphere. The tables are nicely spaced apart so you can enjoy your own conversation or read a book. The whole place is also nicely decorated.<br><br>As for service: very friendly.",

I wanted to lick my plate.<br><br>Great lamb chop, wide and interesting variety of wine selection. Knowledgable staff that gives great recommendation on f &amp; w pairing. Very attentive service. Lovely atmosphere...<br><br>And may I just say that they make some mean champagne cocktails? I don&#39;t normally drink cocktails at all. But I had their old fashion champagne cocktail and my mind was blown. I had such an amazing time at Texture that i can&#39;t wait to go back again!",

"reviewcomment":"I first visited Cafe de Hong Kong when my Greek friend took me to try Taiwanese bubble tea which I hadn&#39;t had since living in China.  INTERNATIONAL.  At the time I thought it was excellent but on reflection, after the craze hit the UK good and proper, I realised that it was only because I hadn&#39;t drunk the stuff for years and any bubble tea is better than no bubble tea.  In actual fact Bubbleology&#39;s taro-flavoured offering is tastier and Candy Cafe&#39;s plain version is more authentic.  But despite all that, Cafe de Hong Kong holds a special place in my heart for being the conduit into London&#39;s bubble tea scene and a return to the drink which had got me through Guangdong&#39;s blazing hot summer afternoons when I had to teach in concrete classrooms with broken fans filled with seventy teenagers whose culture had yet to embrace deodorant.  Happy days.<br><br>This place reminds me of my Chinese life for other reasons too: the meals are uncannily reminiscent of those found in cheap, family-run, hole-in-the-wall joints.  Their dishes are full-on peasant food, even if they don&#39;t promote it as such; beef and tomatoes, black bean pork, ho fun, and even offal with relatively unconventional sauces, served on cheap crockery and slapped down in front of you with barely a smile.  Cantonese cuisine with appropriate service to match: what&#39;s not to love?<br><br>The decor is naff and plastic.  The benches don&#39;t move and you&#39;ll be crammed next to a table of nine Chinese students comparing smartphones and tablets and whatever technology the kids use these day.  I quite enjoy going on my own, taking up residence in a corner and working my way through a gratifyingly familiar, simple dish.  It&#39;s most certainly not a place to bring a date.  I&#39;d hesitate to take anyone, actually, unless they too have visited the Far East and hold sentimental memories of miserable waiters, sloppy food and suspect ingredients.  But despite all this, the food truly is delicious, with strong southern Chinese flavours, occasionally unrecognisable vegetables and controversial cuts of meat.  I can&#39;t help but love it and I&#39;d hope that anybody who can see beyond the superficial lack of cliched Oriental charm would wolf it down as well, and ask for more.  Yes, my viewpoint is skewed, but many pleasant memories surface when I gorge myself on unpretentious Cantonese comfort food and of all the places I&#39;ve tried in London, Cafe de Hong Kong remains my go-to spot for sourcing this stomach-, mouth- and mind-pleasing fare.",

Their burger is mouthful, it literally is the size of my mouth. But it tasted so well, even better with the fries and a bit of jalapeño to spice it up. <br><br>The staff was wonderful. They asked me how I want the meat to be and recommended if I wanted any sides with it. When my food came, it looked so yummy and made me decided to put away the utensils and ate it with bare hands instead. The beef patty was just like the way I wanted it and it comes with bright red jalapeño and blue cheese, all served to perfection. All the fries were good. The sweet potato was special and cheesy fries was absolutely luscious. <br><br>I could still smell the blue cheese and onion on my fingers after the diner. But I loved it.

"reviewcomment":"Without a doubt the thing I miss most about the states is whipping up some BBQ on my trusty Weber.  While it will never replace the smokey goodness of wood chips in the air or the satisfaction of having friends help me tackle racks of ribs or heaps of shredded pork, Bodeans has been where I go to get my fix.  <br><br>I like what they are doing here.  Start out with an order of the outstanding Diablo wings.  These are fiery devils.  Big, sloppy wings that definitely bring the noise.  I&#39;d prefer these broken up at the joints and have that bunk tip tossed.  It makes them a bit tricky to eat, but please this is no excuse to use utensils on them.  Sack up and get your hands dirty.  <br><br>Another thing that Bodeans excels at are the burnt ends, and I always get them.  This is a Kansas City smokehouse staple where the tip of a beef brisket is sliced off, cubed up, sauced and returned to the smoker for a few more hours.  As I can never seem to pass on shredded pork, make mine a combo platter, slaw, sub beans for fries.  Beans are far better anyway.  A side of the Diablo sauce or the Carolina vinegar sauce on the table makes for a happy piggy.  <br><br>There are a bunch of good American brews to choose from on tap and in bottles: Sierra Nevada, Brooklyn and Sam Adams (brewer/patriot) being best of show.  Nothing pairs better with some quality que than a nice cold one.",

These were all very tasty, well presented and great to share.<br>For my main I had the curry udon noodles with prawns. The prawns were beautiful and the red curry sauce was delicious. Huge portion too. <br>To top it off my lychee iced tea was packed with lychee flavour and so refreshing on the hot day!<br>Really loved the food this time (perhaps better menu choices but everything was fresh and authentic).

The food is delicious, and judged to be totally legit in terms of authenticity by my boyfriend (who lived in Korea for a year). My favourite is the dolsop bibimbap for its hot beefy, ricey, eggy, cabbagey goodness. And the doenjang-jjigae is his - it&#39;s apparently a very traditional Korean dish rarely ordered by westerners, but very spicy!<br><br>I really can&#39;t fault the food or the service at Asadal. Both have been very good on all of my visits. Plus, the place is always filled with east Asians, which surely says something. <br><br>The only reason I can think that its reviews would be so bad is perhaps due to its very convenience. As if it&#39;s a requirement to travel outside of central London via National Rail to guarantee authenticity... or to add to the sense of exoticness. Thanks, but no thanks. I&#39;ll happily pay a bit more for my meal at Asadal and hop on the central line home, than travel for an hour to New Malden so I can bring my own cheap wine from the off-licence.<br><br>Extra bonus points: Asadal has a private dining area for six that you can book ahead of time for an extra cost.

"reviewcomment":"It&#39;s always nice to find a cafe that offers exclusively vegetarian and vegan food.  Mixed bag of customers, lots of young and hip. Service is quite quick, both times our food came out within 10 minutes. The vegan burger is homemade and was delicious. It&#39;s a large space with lots of seating and a lovely back garden (also with seating) when the weather is fine.  I noticed they had a couple of high chairs for people with children.  One thing: I was there twice in a week and both times I couldn&#39;t get the wifi to work. It wasn&#39;t a big deal for me because I didn&#39;t need it, but if you do, best ask before you order.  The sweets are mostly all vegan and really good!",

"reviewcomment":"I went back this evening with a couple of friends after a gap of about 3 years since my last visit. It was just as good as I remember - lovely service, fantastic  view and wonderful food. <br><br>At the moment they are doing a really good festive deal - three courses from a set menu for 27.50. I had the game terrine, the roast turkey and then the plum pudding with brandy custard. <br><br>The game terrine was ok, a little dry and I could have done with some chutney, but very pleasant. The turkey itself was a reformed slice that was a bit odd, but the rest of the plate was divine. The bacon wrapped sausage was outstanding and the brussels were luuuuuverly! <br><br>But, and here the best was definitely saved until last... the plum pudding in brandy custard was probably the most outstanding dessert that I have ever had. Ever! Wow, that was good - hot, warming, alcoholic, just perfection!",

If you want to grab drinks and chill out with good folks, this is the place to be.<br><br>There are plenty of signs reminding you to watch your bag for thieves, which is actually fairly helpful (and a bit sad eh?) for me who is a tourist who isn&#39;t as aware or used to dealing with rampant theft.<br><br> It&#39;s nicely placed in central London and still avoids the anxiety-inducing prices that the area is known for. Also there&#39;s a ton of room, so you&#39;re almost always guaranteed to find a place to sit. The service is decently friendly and the food also succeeds at hitting the spot. Probably cus you&#39;ll already be a bit buzzed anyways.<br><br>I don&#39;t really get the hate on Wetherspoons. From my experience it&#39;s quite sufficient in delivering the mediocrity but decent prices it promises. The staff was friendly enough and the food was deep fried to expectations.  If you need a cheap drink, this is the place to be!",

"reviewcomment":"One of my favorite fast food eateries in America is Chipotle. As with most American imports, the food here is priced by replacing the $ with a £, thus making it overpriced. I patronized a London Chipotle once and vowed to never return.<br><br>Today I discovered Tortilla and finally satisfied my craving for inexpensive Mexican food! They essentially offer the same options as Chipotle, with minor differences:<br>- Spanish rice (in addition to cilantro/lime rice)<br>- Diced onions<br>- Shredded AND chopped lettuce (oh boy!)<br><br>Anyways, though the food isn&#39;t anything to write home about, I gave Tortilla 4 stars because of the price point. The medium burritos and burrito bowls are only £4.95. It&#39;s much cheaper than it&#39;s competitor Chipotle, and affordable on my student budget. Also this location offers tons of seating on the main level and upstairs, or you can go outside and enjoy the views of Bankside.",

"reviewcomment":"We found this place by chance as we were walking to a different place we had planned to go to. Since our trip to Tokyo a few months ago, we miss good Japanese food so we thought we&#39;d give it a try. We were not disappointed!<br><br>They seated us without a reservation at the last available table. Great ramen noodles (love that toppings were presented on a separate plate)  and miso soup - in addition, we shared a sushi roll and some sashimi, which did not disappoint.  Service was fast and friendly -- we ordered wine and water and both were brought out quickly, with the food following shortly after. <br><br>We recommend the five fish roll and the eel sashimi (I think all of the ramen bowls are good, so I won&#39;t be specific).<br><br>Added bonus: When I discovered the bathroom had a heated seat and bidet, I really felt like I was back in Japan!",

I was there on a nice day so sitting with the open window people felt great and Church Street is great for people watching.<br><br>They do seem to get pretty busy in the evenings, so if you&#39;re really hungry i&#39;d advise to get there early or book a table.

"reviewcomment":"I&#39;m glad I didn&#39;t read any reviews before I went to the Diner, or I may never have gone in. And what a meal I would have missed out on! We came here on a whim, looking for brunch food and curious about the thought of milkshakes. We had to wait 10 mins to get a booth (as we&#39;re used to in most places in Shoreditch, so no big deal). The service was absolutely fine in my opinion. Maybe Sundays are less crazy? Certainly the waitresses had a full house to attend to but we never had to wait, and everything came as it should have.<br><br> (For the record, those complaining this is not an authentic American diner... you&#39;re right it&#39;s an American-diner-themed restaurant in East London! Jeez, most Mexican places are nothing like authentic Mexican food and yet everyone still loves to eat there. Let it go).<br><br> We started with fries and milkshakes while we waited for our friend to arrive. The fries were fries - nothin&#39; special but just what we wanted - and the milkshakes were heavenly! I love the fact that in addition to your tall glass of milkshake they give you the rest of the shake in the stainless steel cup so you practically get two whole milkshakes! Thick, creamy, lots of flavour... Love love love.<br><br> Our friend arrived, and ordered macaroni cheese (tasty, although not life changing, but then - it&#39;s mac &amp; cheese), as well as chilli fries; my other half had the Mexican Breakfast and demolished it (he said he&#39;d get it again); and I had the huevos rancheros with the eggs poached. Which was spot on, and only £6.20. Ordering took a lot of deliberation as the menu has so many enticing options. Love that you can also get every side dish you can think of, from hash browns, to french toast. If you like a build-your-own breakfast you can totally do that here.<br><br> Despite the place being full and people always coming in looking for a table, we never felt rushed and were there for an hour and a half all up. I was surprised to come home and read the rubbish reviews, however, despite that I will still be going back to The Diner again. I guess I don&#39;t expect much from a casual, diner-themed restaurant. Fun, tasty meals for £6-£8, lots of choice, and great milkshakes will do it for me.",

I didn&#39;t believe such a thing existed, but Soho Joe is there to prove me wrong.<br><br>I turned up to see some friends who had already ordered some pizzas to take out.  Next thing I know a beer has been put in front of me - apparently you get a free beer while you wait.  That was a good start.  The pizzas are £12, so very reasonably priced.  I ordered the Soho Joe Special, which had aubergine, artichoke, parma ham and other stuff.  It was a decent classic italian style thin crust pizza.  All the ingredients were cooked perfectly, and I liked how the ingredients were just draped over the pizza without too much care for making each slice equal.  Being italian style, most the pizzas were various combinations of parma ham, pepperoni and vegetables.  Don&#39;t expect anything like a meat feast.<br><br>The staff are all really friendly and chatty.  The decor is bohemian chic, so the same as pretty much everywhere else.  <br><br>We got our pizzas before we even finished our beers.  Then we went down to soho square to eat in the sun.  Would definitely go back!",

The decor and staff uniforms may look a little bit over the top, but it all adds to a fun atmosphere, and makes the place feel vibrant.<br><br>The other Mexican restaurants in the area all look quite modern, and from outside, this makes them seem a bit cold and impersonal.<br><br>I had the chimichanga as a main course, and was a bit surprised that this comprised of 3 smaller wraps, rather than one large one, but they were still very tasty, served with delicious salad, rice, and some sort of pepper and bean stew.<br><br>They have a good selection of South American beers, so I tried a couple of these to wash the meal down.<br><br>I&#39;d definitely recommend this place to anyone who likes Mexican!",

Their food is consistently good and they offer a ton of crowd-pleasing options (think burgers, mac &amp; cheese, ribs, lobster roll, honey-fried chicken). I&#39;m also into the quinoa salad which is a healthier but very tasty option. Smashed potatoes loaded with garlic and butter-y goodness is clearly a no-brainer. The chocolate cream pie dessert option is also top-notch.<br><br>Love their drinks as well, and would always recommend stopping in for a drink on a Saturday night.

"reviewcomment":"Jen Cafe is one of a few reasons I would ever go into Chinatown for chinese food. Firstly it is definitely a cafe, not fancy at all and service is very rushed and definitely do not expect manners as for most chinatown restaurants. It is like a chinese greasy spoons without the warm smile not even for a regular.But it is one of the places in London where I can forgive the restaurant for bad service as it is part of the experience if you&#39;re planning to eat in Chinatown in the first place.<br>The cafe itself is very small, cheap metal tables and seats, plastic cutlery and plates, bright green walls and an &#39;out of service&#39; sign always stuck on their toilet which makes it all very unwelcoming. But I like it and especially when they make the most fresh and delicious Beijing dumplings in London. And you should only come here for their dumplings and their popular variations of Bubble tea. Only use the other items on the menu as a stomach filler for the more hungry ones as the quality would not match the dumplings at all.<br><br>You can tell it&#39;s fresh from the lady sitting facing the window making the dumplings in front of you as you walk by and there is a choice of either pork or vegetarian and then boiled or pan fried. I always go for the pork just because it is more fragrant and then a portion of it being pan-fried for £6.00 and a portion of boiled for £5.00. They are like no other Beijing dumplings anywhere else in London. First of all they are made from glutinous rice flour rather than all-purpose or plain flour. This provides a more lighter and softer pastry, more sticky which makes the dumplings more moist, making it a delight to eat. The filling is perfectly seasoned and flavoured well with chives and other ingredients. Flavours are definitely not lacking here.<br><br>Whether it is pan fried or boiled both varieties comes to you piping hot. Even though I always order both varieties I always preferred the boiled ones as it&#39;s a fresher, cleaner taste, more squidgy and holds more of the pork stock inside. However I know many prefer the pan-fried just for that smokey flavour and crispy base. Once it&#39;s left on your table it&#39;s to your customisation with the condiments on your table and the platelets given. The usual mix tends to be a spoonful of vinegar and half of that in soy sauce and then chilli oil to your preferred spice level. Of course you can keep adding each to get the flavour you want.<br><br>As a stomach filler I would recommend the noodle soup dishes to the rice dishes as I find their meat over rice a bit too greasy with fatty and poor in quality meat. I always go for their special which is shredded pork and pickled cabbage with rice noodles and make sure you ask for rice noodles or they will give you instant noodles instead. So the noodles aren&#39;t the best quality, a bit plasticky but for the price of £5.50 I&#39;m not complaining because it is the pork and pickled cabbage that flavours the broth making it very appetising and warming to the soul with the meaty, savoury and sour taste. You can always spice it up with the chilli oil on your table too.<br><br>Depending on what time you go it is always quite packed and yes service is very rushed and they will throw the bill at you straight after you finish your last bite so a bit of warning there. But with that in mind and a bit of openness you will find yourself having a very nice delicious, quick yet filling meal there. Definitely not a place for a romantic meal but for good quality, authentic Beijing dumplings.",

"reviewcomment":"Best Vietnamese in London<br><br>I love this restaurant and have been loads of times but for some reason I hadn&#39;t been for a while until last night.  I was really looking forward to it and as usual it did not disappoint.<br><br>We tend to order the same things as we know what we like.  Favourites include the springrolls which are sublime, thin and crispy on the outside with delicious generous fillings and the fresh rolls served with a peanut dipping sauce which are so lovely and leave you feeling virtuous and healthy.  The choice of fish cooked on the bone is great - my favourite is the sea bream with lemongrass and chilli.  The goat with galangal, the crispy aromatic duck and the singapore noodles are real winners too.<br><br>This time though there were a few new additions to the menu and we opted to try the chargrilled goat which was really tasty and succulent and best of all the spicy soft shell crab which was the best soft shell crab I have ever tasted - I&#39;m dreaming it of it now and wish I could have another plate of it!<br><br>Desserts are limited but interesting - we had the Vietnamese Rainbow Drink described as Mung Beans, Gelatinous Seaweed and Coconut Milk, but don&#39;t let that description put you off, it was sweet and delicious and a lovely way to finish our meal!<br><br>This used to be a BYO restaurant but not anymore unfortunately, but wine and beer are reasonable.<br><br>If you find yourself in Battersea you need to give this place a go, but do book in advance.  We were there on a Monday night and people were queing out the door - I guess that says it all!  Oh and one final thing - it&#39;s cash only, so don&#39;t get caught out!",

She has had the same chef for 23 years.  She came to the table and asked if every thing was OK and also said goodbye to us when we left.<br><br>There are a few other Vietnamese restaurants in Camden but Than Bhin offers much better food with lower prices and the portion is bigger offering good value for money.  <br><br>I will go back and try many more lunch menus and dishes on the a la carte menu.",

"reviewcomment":"Went to this place on my last night in London and my experience helped make it one of the best nights of my month-long stay in England. <br><br>We got a bottle of wine to split between four of us and enjoyed the outdoor seating with a view of the Market. We split aioli with bread that I only wish I could recreate. I got the wilted spinach with pine nuts and chorizo with rocket and roasted red peppers on grilled bread. I have tried to recreate both because they were so insanely delicious. <br><br>There are certain spots that I&#39;ve encountered in my travels that make me want to go back to the city just to experience again. I can&#39;t wait for the next time I travel to London so that I can order that meal one more time. I won&#39;t even go near any tapas places in New York because I&#39;m afraid it&#39;ll taint my experience at Brindasa.<br><br>Great to walk around Borough Market first and then stop off for dinner before a show at the Globe or some sight-seeing. Also great date spot. I went in early August during the last week of the 2012 Olympics and even then it was peaceful, relaxing, and not at all over-crowded.",

Not only was the steak one of the best I&#39;ve eaten, but the sides, veggie options and cocktails were all great too. The Parrillada Deluxe comes out to your table still sizzling on a mini grill along with some delicious provolone cheese (I do love cheese), and was a really generous portion for the three of us that shared it. I&#39;d recommend the butterbeans too - very tasty. <br><br>Our waiter was fairly new and didn&#39;t have the best knowledge of the menu or wines but the overall atmosphere was relaxed and we weren&#39;t rushed out of our seats at the end of the meal.<br><br>I&#39;d definately go again, despite it being kind of out of the way for someone who doesn&#39;t live in the area.",

"reviewcomment":"Apart from HKK, this is, I think, in terms of food quality the best Chinese restaurant in London. When you consider that it costs slightly under half what you&#39;d pay at HKK it is absolutely fantastic value. <br><br>Chef Peng has now relinquished control of the dining room to his son but remains in the kitchen churning out delicious dishes I&#39;ve never seen on a menu, and owing to the fact that Hunan doesn&#39;t have a menu, I probably never will. It&#39;s best with about 8 people so they can bring out lots of small dishes. Dishes come out of the kitchen at a relaxed pace, once you say you are full to bursting they bring out some fritters and you are done.<br><br>The food is at a flat rate. I think it was around £45 last time I went so it&#39;s not your local takeaway but it is 100% worth the money. Their wine list is excellent too, go for an Alsatian varietal and you can&#39;t go too far wrong. Have a little lychee wine as a digestif and you will be good to go.",

"reviewcomment":"Went here for a birthday dinner-- they sing but sadly no candles-- and it was such an interesting experience. You walk into a dimly lit restaurant and are told to put anything that is a light source (watches, phones, etc.) and your purses/coats into a locker room. You then are greeted by the maitre&#39;d and given a choice of menus-- Surprise, Meat, Vegetarian, or Fish. The &#34;Surprise&#34; one is kind of a misnomer because all of them are surprises really-- you have no idea what your plates are going to look like. <br><br>You are greeted by a waiter who leads you into a completely and utterly dark room (hand on his shoulder) and as you sit down at a sort of community table to start enjoying your meal. This is sort of a make or break point for me-- I ended up having a really friendly and interesting table with lots of good conversation, but I can see how it could end up the other way around. <br><br>The food was delicious, albeit hard to eat (lots of disappointment when your fork reaches your mouth and you haven&#39;t gotten any food on it). I will say that make sure you are ready for an experience because you have no say over what you are eating (unless it is an allergy and you submit that at the time of reservation). At the end of the meal you are lead out to pay with the maitre&#39;d and you are given a &#34;look book&#34; of sorts to see what your meal looked like. I ate kangaroo and I liked it! <br><br>Overall a great experience for the adventurous and the food was delicious prepared. Highly recommend.",

I had once tried it before at a different restaurant and very much disliked it. This time, I rather enjoyed it! The sashimi had great sheen and flavour to it, which is much appreciated by the picky foodie. ;) <br><br>Overall: The food is a bargain for the quality of food they serve and it&#39;s very comfortable! I&#39;d suggest making a reservation if you plan on visiting during the weekend, which is totally possible via Open Table with the Yelp app. What are you waiting for? GO!",

"reviewcomment":"This is a review for nightlife and not food. <br><br>My 2 friends, sister, and I were walking around close to where our hotel was located and every place seemed pretty dead. This was surprising to me since it was Eurocup so I thought everywhere would be a bit lively. Not so much. We walked by The Rocket that had a decent amount of people and a DJ inside. Finally!<br><br>We had sooooooooooooooooo much fun here, so much that we came back again for our last night in London too. We were drinking Tetley&#39;s mostly, which I liked, and Jagerbombs haha. We freakin limboed here. Limbo. I haven&#39;t done that in foreeevverrrr. Then we did this weird dance with guys and girls, which I hated, but whatever, all in good fun. There was a Journey sing-a-long at the end of the night. Typical bar fun. If I had been home, I probably wouldn&#39;t have been too ecstatic about the limbo and things, and would probably have rolled my eyes with a &#34;what grade are we in again,&#34; type of question. But hey, when you&#39;re a tourist, you have to enjoy it to the fullest extent. It&#39;s one of the only times people actually expect you to act like fools. We definitely lived it up at The Rocket.",

After a rough go of getting a table ( I won&#39;t dwell only because I had a glass of wine in my hand) we were seated and had the best service of our entire UK trip. Very attentive and friendly. I noticed that once we had our food in most UK restaurants your waiter literally disappears. Forever. Anywhoo... <br><br>We started with the salmon pate, I had the Welsh Rarebit and my dad the Beef Wellington. Loved my pate, liked my Dad&#39;s wellington, and an OK for my rarebit. I was told I HAD to try welsh rarebit while in the UK. It was just too rich for me and you get four slices of bread! <br><br>I don&#39;t suggest coming across town to try this place but if your in the neighborhood might as well give it a go.",

The food was good, but not great. <br><br>I had the big breakfast, the sausages were good. My wife had the avocado toast and loved it. The bloody mary&#39;s were just okay. We also had the bakers basket which was good and it came with some good jams and spreads. <br><br>The space was set up well and the cooking classes looked like fun.",

I wasn&#39;t feeling too on top of the world due to being ill, but the menu was varied so there was still  a lot of tasty things I could choose from. <br><br>The waiters were fun and really chatty, but not too in your face. Nothing worse than a waiter who doesn&#39;t know when to let you eat!! <br><br>It&#39;s lovely and spacious, and the interior is very elegantly designed.

If you&#39;re looking for a slightly more interesting pub visit, even better - The Cadogan arms has a couple of American pool tables upstairs available for hire that will elevate your gentle drinking session into an epic battle of skill and dexterity (or blind luck....).<br><br>Of course it&#39;s not cheap, this is the Kings Road after all.

"reviewcomment":"Jesus-tap-dancing-Christ this place is good. I came here with a group of people at about 9pm on a Friday and they seated us with no fuss. It was pretty busy, especially outside where people were smoking Shisha.<br><br>The service was friendly and very quick. We ordered a mixture of mezzé starters and main courses to share - all of which were very tasty. I had stuffed vine leaves, which were lovely, and my chicken stew was great. The portions were huuuuuuuge - we were all really full after the starters, so barely made a dent on the main courses.<br><br>It&#39;s a no-alcohol restaurant, but there are loads of fresh juices and smoothies to have, plus the usual sodas and everything.<br><br>Did I mention that this place is cheap? There were 5 of us and each of us had a starter, a main and a drink. The bill? Sixty of the Queen&#39;s finest pound notes. As Tim Wonnacott would say, that&#39;s a bargain.",

It&#39;s run by all Spanish people and all goes very fast. You first choose the main (most of the people go for the burrito obviously) then the topping/filling. I had the Chicken Mole with almost all toppings (though did not really notice any chocolate like the menu says, which I think I&#39;m glad for) including the beans, and was not disappointed at all. Chicken was really tender, and the size was perfect for lunch. We all had a Corona beer along with it, as you do at such a place.<br><br>They have some basic chairs and tables in the back where you can sit cozy, but when the weather turns better, I&#39;m pretty sure we&#39;re going for the take-away option to eat outside somewhere. <br><br>One of the better burritos I&#39;ve had in London so far!",

But I seriously think I&#39;ve found the best Oriental buffet in London or what they call &#39;unlimited Sunday Brunch&#39;. Of course you are paying £30 pp instead of the usual £6-£10.<br>The place is stunning like a quick transport to Thailand with the over excessive indoor plants and eye catching ornaments, dark wooden tables. Even all the staff were Thai. The only problem I had with that the buffet was it was on the second floor so it did mean going and up and down with plates loaded with food. But being a waitress in the past I have a good balance so it didn&#39;t really concern me. <br>Barely spending any time to settle down I immediately went to the second floor for the big excitement and how happy was I to find the whole of the second floor split into three large sections, one for starters, mains and than desserts. Each one was as equally big as the other. Unlike the typical buffet the starters were laid out in small amounts so the chef could prepare it fresh when finished so you were not getting food that has been sitting for hours. And they weren&#39;t just throw onto a pile of the same starter but all equally portioned out in its own dish with different sauces below it for you to scoop on top. Great for portion control especially when there was so much to try. You can always go back for more, no one would stop you. But I would remind everyone who goes to use those sauces as without it some of the starters can be a bit bland e.g. the dim sums and the deep fried starters. I was addicted to their peanut sauce which was thick and crunchy. <br>Everything was high in quality. Prawns were fresh, sweet and plump. The papaya salad had a real spicy kick and made in front of us. I highly recommend the noodle soup which mum ended up going to two portions. It was made to order by a staff with a good selection of noodles, fish balls, duck and vegetables. It was not &#39;buffet; quality at all as the broth had depth, different notes of flavour and satisfying with the al dente noodles and generous ingredients inside. Beautiful flavours and textures coming together. Same quality was found with their daily soup, lots of spices present .<br>I must say starters were preferred over the mains which felt there was less of a selection, mainly being curries but made with different meats, vegetables and fish. The flavours weren&#39;t as delicate as the starter and even the noodle was a lower quality yellow noodle, bland to eat alone and cooked too soft, Still the curries were really delicious, a real kick of spice in some and generous with the use of ingredients including fresh plump king prawns still in its shell and mussels. All the dishes were halal too with a large range of choices to suit everyone. I especially enjoyed a deep dried salmon dish which soaked up all the flavours of the curry making it a delight to devour. There was also roast lamb carved to order but I found the meat overcooked and bland.  <br>Just as plentiful as the starters were the desserts, little cakes, sweets, puddings and exotic fruits beautifully laid out around a table. These were very intriguing, sweets I have never had before which I believed to be authentic like the crispy jelly which was a hard sugar coating around a jelly and a brown sweet, chewy and nutty in flavour which was nice. I particularly enjoyed a jelly panna cotta typed dessert and the lovely sticky rice with jellied mango and coconut cream. Along the edges were also the warm selection that included a chocolate fondant and bananas cooked in coconut milk that I enjoyed more than I thought as it wasn&#39;t too sweet and the bananas still had a bite. I&#39;ll leave the photos to describe the rest of the selection.<br>Service was very efficient but could have been more smiley as friendly as they were. But they kept our tables clean, clearing plates as soon as we left to help ourselves to more food upstairs. <br>We also had a light cocktail called Mai Thai made of exotic fruit juices which was nice although synthetic tasting. I highly recommend the coffee though if you like your coffee strong and thick. I don&#39;t usually take sugar with coffee but had to here . But it didn&#39;t take away from the aromatic  flavours that were rich with depth, smooth with no aftertaste either- really good.<br>I would love to come back to Blue Elephant. for its brunch again. It is definitely a place for a treat especially with the higher buffet price but with its a la carte menu mains around £20 anyway, the brunch is a better value  to get a taste of everything. Blue Elephant is probably the first buffet restaurant where I felt I wasn&#39;t missing out on Thai flavours just because it was a buffet. Quality was present and attention to detail was there in the flavours and the presentation. A must visit especially in the beautiful peaceful riverside location.",

"reviewcomment":"I have been here a couple of place.  Nice restaurant tucked down a side road at Covent Garden.<br><br>It has a downstairs bar which is a nice place to meet friends for a drink.<br><br>The restaurant is 2 floors.  This night we were shown upstairs however, having declined the table next to the gents toilets they took us to the &#39;private area&#39;.  This section was much quieter than the main section however, much preferable to the gents toilet table!<br><br>As we sat down, they told us that there was a 2 hour turn around on the table. We were not aware of this before hand and always find this an annoyance when restaurants do this.  But, we were here now. <br><br>They seemed to be a little short staffed this night.  We had to ask to be provided with wine.  I had noticed the glasses on the table had &#39;bits&#39; in them and had hoped these were for display (you know at some restaurants they always take the glasses off the table and serve you new ones)  however I had to stop the waiter pouring the wine in them showing him the little bits at the bottom. I am not sure he was happy for me to point this out!  <br><br>I ordered the beetroot and warm goats cheese.  Whilst there could be a little more cheese, it was a really tasty dish. My friend ordered the onion soup which she said was delicious (no bread served with this or before our meal).<br><br>I then had the seared scallops and crab risotto which was delightful.  I was very pleased with my main meal and then finished with Chocolate fondant and white chocolate ice-cream which was well made.  All in all the food there was great and would definitely come back again.  Additional down points were that they seemed to be short staffed.  Took us ages to get the bill and they had to go into the other room with my credit card to get signal.  These days you really don&#39;t like having your credit card taken away from you.<br><br>Good point was that I think they were so busy they forgot to kick us off our table at the two hour mark ;)",

"reviewcomment":"Nipped in for a quick lunch, and I was pretty impressed with the menu. For a start, you can easily get lunch for a fiver, which I&#39;ve come to think is impossible in London town, and secondly the service was really quick and accommodating since we turned up in two big groups at different times. <br><br>My instant regret was not trying the burgers. When everyone around you gets a huge hunk of delicious patty and you&#39;ve gone the &#39;sensible&#39; route with a halloumi wrap, I challenge you not to be jealous. (Unless you&#39;re veggie, naturally.) By all accounts, those burgers looked phat and juicy. <br><br>However, the halloumi wrap, friends, is definitely worth a look. None of that scrimping on cheese, the slices were huge. And the sauce, yoghurt (or creme fraiche?) and some kind of Mexican flavoured stuff, was pretty delicious. It came with salad and crisps, which were more than I could finish.<br><br>Love the vibe -- trad pub feel, tables outside for a warmer day, and great friendly staff.

"reviewcomment":"When it comes to local dining at a good price and quality, The Exhibit  has it. Since moving to Balham we&#39;ve come here for more than a good couple of meals. Their 3-9-3 menu (£3 - starter, £9 - main, £3 - dessert) is well worth what&#39;s on offer and their staff are always friendly. <br><br>More recently we went to try their new spring menu at a discount of 50% on all food. I had the duck fillet salad to start with rocket and vinaigrette, then the lamb&#39;s liver with mash and a mouth-watering gravy and I just couldn&#39;t resist the rhubarb compote to end the meal with. Their portions are generous and 3 courses may be a but much for the average person. <br><br>There is also a cinema there which shows relatively new movies in an intimate setting of 12 two-seater couches. You can order your drinks from the bar and bring them in with you and tickets are £5 and I think less if you eat in restaurant as well. We&#39;ve always had a good experience there and even without the 50% discount you still get good, big hearty food at very reasonable prices.<br><br>If you do order the compote, I advise sharing it between two seeing as in comes in a big oval ramekin! I only got through half of it and I&#39;m usually a rhubarb monster.",

I have absolutely no complaints there. I have not had mayonnaise in their sushi either (hurray! Not westernised sushi!) so I am one happy bunny and will not refuse food from here.

"reviewcomment":"After a long trek across London, it was time to eat before tackling the British Museum.  After a brief wander around the streets near the museum, we found this vegetarian-friendly restaurant.  <br><br>We felt a little underdressed entering the dining room in our touristy walking clothes and comfy shoes, but the service was lovely (though one of our waiters was a little hard to understand because he spoke so quietly).  The menu can be a bit daunting with its dozens of offerings and unfamiliar words, but the dishes are all described in English below.  It just takes a little while to read through all of it.<br><br>My sister ordered falafel, and I ordered lamb skewers, and a lime flower tea that caught my eye on the drinks list.  Bread with a yogurt dip and olives were provided to start.  The lamb took a little while to be ready, but the waiter let us know the reason for the delay, and we didn&#39;t mind the wait.  The lamb was very good -- worth waiting for -- and was served with couscous.  I&#39;m not sure how the falafel was since it disappeared quickly from my sister&#39;s plate.  The lime flower tea had a very powerful flavour, but was mellowed by the honey that accompanied the glass.  <br><br>A lovely lunch for two; the cost was about $35.",

"reviewcomment":"I&#39;m a big fan of Sticky Fingers as I have been going since I was a child. It was better in the old days but it is still a good night out and good food. We always used to go for someone&#39;s birthday so we had a trip recently for my birthday even though it was actually not for another 3 weeks!<br><br>This is an American style diner owned by Bill Wyman from the Rolling Stones with lots and lots of memorabilia on the walls. <br><br>As a restaurant it is usually very busy so if you can book ahead do. The staff are usually very helpful but do seem to be rushing around a lot so if you are in a rush this is not the place for you.<br><br>The menu has a lot of the usual things you would expect from a diner, burgers of various flavours, chicken, ribs and a few Veggie Options. This is an important factor for me so veggie options are Veggie Burger which is a pattie or assorted veg mushed together but cooked as well as it could be. They also have vegetable fajitas as an option which are apparently very onion heavy and then a couple of salads. I wasn&#39;t overly impressed but I was there for a burger and the burger was good so I got what I wanted. Fries were good too and you usually get a good portion with a bit of salad on the side too.<br><br>Note for meat eaters: now I have it on good authority from another regular visitor to Sticky Fingers that they have now changed their cooking policy for meat and will not cook your burger rare or anything like rare. The closest you will get is Medium. No idea why and this will probably be a negative for some. <br><br>They also have a bar with a huge selection of cocktails, and, although I haven&#39;t had one for a while, I remember the milkshakes being very yummy. <br><br>Price wise you won&#39;t pay over the odds but things will be on the slightly more expensive side of things, but I have always had a great time whenever I have been to visit and I will no doubt return again - perhaps for another fake birthday!! <br><br>xyz",

I was told I was very lucky because they were having a slow night and usually it would be impossible to seat a party so large. That being said the hostess was incredibly accommodating and arranged the tables for us without making a fuss. The service was great and everyone was attended to in a timely manner. Furthermore, the food was incredible, and was not too expensive. <br><br>I had the prawns, which were huge, savory, and delicious. I also tried the best fish and chips I&#39;ve ever tasted - the fish was crispy on the outside, tender on the inside. Everyone said their plates were delicious, and I was so relieved that everyone enjoyed the meal. I have only passed through London for a few days at a time, and Admiral Codrington&#39;s is definitely the best &#34;British style&#34; food I&#39;ve had in the area.",

They both tasted delicious, fresh and hit the spot like a treat. The cake selection was great too we shared some black forest gateaux. I have had better but it was still tasty. The portion size I felt could have been a wee bit bigger. <br><br>The atmosphere in there was really good and the staff were really great. We sat down and ate. There&#39;s 3 massive benches at the back of the room (which is wonderfully decorated with the crazy light feature). So your sharing with fellow Londoner&#39;s which is not to much of a problem as the shear size of the tables stops it from being cramped. <br><br>The help yourself water station is useful for washing it all down.<br><br>As I was leaving walking round the corner I saw someone eating a slice cake in Del&#39;Aziz that must have been 3 times the size of mine!

"reviewcomment":"Just as good as Italy. I&#39;m not kidding.<br><br>My friend and I went for a romantic date for two to catch up on girly times, life and work over a bottle of Italian food and Italian wine, and she had heard of this tiny little restaurant in Hoxton, and she&#39;s lived in Italy before so I trust her judgement implicitly on these things!<br><br>So this place doesn&#39;t actually do paper menus like 90% of the rest of the world! because it is changed daily, and the waitresses will explain the menu to you. Tip number 1- this place has massive portions. We went for two courses and it was crazy, I couldn&#39;t finish my pasta but I really wanted to. Our starters or Cechetti were melted cheesy aubergines and also scallops in a white sauce with raspberries, yeah raspberries. The thing with the scallops is that the elements individually aren&#39;t amazing, but together, it is a taste explosion, you got the buttery just cooked scallops, with a velvety sauce (that could have been warmer to be quite honest) and then a sharp tang of raspberries, it was unlike anything I&#39;ve had and I loved it, and I wish that there were a tiny bit more raspberries to cut the amount of sauce that you get. The aubergines were Moreish. For our mains, we opted for pasta because I saw they really do special dishes that I don&#39;t really see in chain italian stores, like lamb Ragu with papadalle which is a Tuscan home dish really and I hadn&#39;t tried it since I visited Florence and it was something special. This really took me back to those happy times. We also tried the ravioli which was so well made but damn they they really stuff them! We couldn&#39;t even finish the pasta but I would totally go back. Also tip number 2- don&#39;t fill up on the free bread!<br><br>So, this isn&#39;t cheap, service, food,wine and coffees came to around £75, but I would gladly recommend this as an authentic italian food experience!",

"reviewcomment":"Finally ended up here after a few work drinks on Thursday in the City, after hearing about it for ages as the revered steakhouse in London. I called ahead and they said that there was no queue but that they didn&#39;t take reservations... when we showed up 45 minutes later closer to 9, there was a queue of about 15 people in front of us, but it moved quickly and we were able to be seated within 10 minutes. The food is one of those brilliantly simple fares: you simply order how you would like your meat, which comes sliced with the most beautiful sauce and plentiful fries on the side, and a French style salad for a starter (and bread of course). The steak and fries also have automatic refills, which makes sense for the 5-6 small slices of steak but not entirely necessary for the fries. In addition, there are no sauces for the fries besides mustard- no ketchup or mayonnaise or other options, for that matter. And the service is also so terribly French (aka minimalist at best)",

We decided to check out this cool looking restaurant and was very happy about the experience.<br><br>We got seated in the upper level so that was pretty cool because you get a really good view of the entire restaurant and it is more private and quiet from the rest of the place. I got the chicken burger and it was quite delicious. Although, it was kind of small for what I was paying for. The sauce was definitely the best part of the sandwich. My table also got the unlimited frozen yogurt as dessert so we were grubbing on that afterwards. All my friends from the states wish Nando is in the US, too!",

"reviewcomment":"Summary:<br><br>+ Very large restaurant with dark wooden furnishings <br>+ High ceilings and chic décor <br>+ Excellent food and very reasonable price<br><br>Overall: <br>Saigon Saigon is Viet Grill of West London. Or should I say Viet Grill is Saigon Saigon of East London. <br>This is a widely debated topic that divides the capital into left and right. <br>No, not really. But I just find it interesting that two of the great Vietnamese restaurants are located at both ends of London. But I personally prefer Saigon Saigon. Here is why... <br><br>Saigon Saigon is a gorgeous Vietnamese restaurant in West London that has the grandeur of French colonial Vietnam. Food is really good and portion is not particularly small. But they somehow keep the prices pretty reasonable. I want to know how they manage that. Wait, maybe I don&#39;t wanna know. <br><br>Surrounded by the gorgeous décor, you can dine like a tycoon and pay like umm a buffoon??? My silly pun aside, their cost performance is amazing. <br><br>I&#39;m not Vietnamese but my Vietnamese friends speak highly of this place too. (Borrowing authority) <br><br>I have only come here for dinner but I&#39;ve heard their lunch is really good value for money. One day. <br><br>When I have friends coming over from out of town, I try to take them to this place. I don&#39;t always succeed, as it&#39;s not very conveniently located. But when I do manage to lure them out here, people always enjoy the food and dining experience.",

Great dinner and atmosphere and a special treat if you sign up to their club (do it now!). We came here on a Saturday night at 6pm so we could take advantage on the happy hour (goes until 7pm). I ordered the corn-fed chicken breast &amp; beetroot risotto which was an excellent combination and finished off with a sticky toffee pudding. Both amazing and worth every last calorie. Through out the night the about three different staff members came over to help us and generally just to chat, they were great! Even the manager came over and was genuinely making an effort to greet all of his customers. We also ordered a number of different flavoured cocktails recommended to us by the bar tenders and each was unique and delicious in their own individual ways, they also didn&#39;t hold back on the spirits which can often happen during happy hour! Will definitely be returning ASAP as a special place to take friends I want to impress.",

Soft, tender, aromatic, served in a delicious gravy with black olives - was just mouth watering.<br><br>It came as a disappointment that the expected belly dance did not actually take place but the music played in the background still did the trick and took you to an aromatic, exotic place ( in your imagination).<br><br>The dinner ended with delicious and refreshing mint tea.",

"reviewcomment":"Outstanding! Classic Sardinian cuisine yet young and energetic. We decided to make a meal of appetizers. I had the lentil and carrot soup. It was lovely, but not quite hot enough. I should have sent it back to be heated. My second appetizer was bresaola de tonno. Heaven on earth. Cured and dried tuna, sliced paper thick, draped over perfectly cooked haricots verts and drizzled with a sublime olive oil. Best thing I have put in my mouth in a long time (and I put lots of nice things in my mouth!). <br><br>Dear hubby started with buffalo mozzarella with a mound of caponata. Buffalo mozzarella can be tricky, but this was perfect. The caponata was the perfect balance of sweet and sour and still very fresh. His second plate was artichoke with tomato and shrimp. He raved about that too. <br><br>Since we had been good with dinner, having just two appetizers each after all, we decided gloom at the dolci menu. We went for the panna cotta with a raspberry coulis. The panna was black with vanilla beans. The coulis was extremely flavorful and, thank the good lord, not too sweet. Perfection. <br><br>Service was attentive but not overbearing. Just exactly right. <br><br>Plan to go again. Will be hard to not have the same things we had tonight, but we absolutely must try some of the native Sardinian pastas. They look just scrumptious.",

So fine, tasty and well done dishes.<br><br>I came here for the lunch, which has the advantage of offering a reasonably priced  deal. <br><br>I always order the Biryani, and I also got the naans. <br>- Chutney is wonderful, that was the best I got. It contain high quality real fruits, spices or vegetables. <br>- Naans are small but so good. They come in two different flavors;<br>- Seafood Biryani: I know what is a fine biryani now. The seafood was fresh and delicious, perfectly cooked;<br>- Baby Chicken: a piece of tasty fried leg, comes with crispy and really thin fried potato;<br>- Mango Lhassi: again a fine drink. Try it!<br><br>This restaurant was awarded a Michelin star in 2012.<br><br>I am now reconciled with Indian food at restaurant. I wish we will have such great restaurant soon in Paris!",

"reviewcomment":"I believe this place can get pretty rowdy on Thursdays &amp; Fridays with after-work drinkers.  It is a German beer hall after all.  But we were here for food, on a Tuesday evening.  It was relatively quiet.  That said, all of the tables in the main room were full, but they opened the side room for us.<br><br>For somewhere that is more of a drinking den, I thought the food was surprisingly good.  Different kinds of german sausage served in different ways - chopped up with curry ketchup, or in a hot dog bun, or on a plate with dollops of sauerkraut.  I opted for the latter - 2 different kinds of sausage with sauerkraut &amp; fried potatoes.  I was full, and pleasantly satisfied.  This is no nonsense food.<br><br>The place very much feels like a mopped up drinking hall, so possibly not the best surroundings to enjoy a meal, but if you set your expectations at good solid pub grub, you&#39;ll be grand.  The girls at the bar wear the kind of outfit you&#39;d expect of servers at Oktoberfest, which I&#39;d describe more as awkward than sexy.  And they certainly didn&#39;t seem particularly inspired to be wearing them, or even to be there.  <br><br>Overall, service &amp; decor are uninspired, but the food comes as a pleasant surprise.",

It was some disappointed experiences. But this place was just amazing, tasty dishes after another. The menu are very seasonal and taste exceptionally well. I couldn&#39;t find any fault in this place at all. Staffs are attentive and standard of services made this restaurant my top choice for inviting important friends and my clients.<br>I couldn&#39;t  get a chance to take picture of any of the food. <br>We had four course meal for two. <br>Bill comes about £165. It seems pricy, it is not. It is worth it pay that quality of food.<br>We are going back in two weeks to try other menu option. <br>I am in love with this restaurant.<br>By far this restaurant is my best one in London!Nothing can compare with this restaurant.<br>Thanks for yelpers who recommended this place.

Sam&#39;s Brasserie is where you find the usual easily recognised comfort foods like Baby Back Ribs and Nasville style fried chicken at it&#39;s best with high attention to detail and a bit of extra flare. I was genuinely surprised. <br><br>The restaurant opened at 6:30pm and as we got there early we made used of the Happy Hour they had at the bar, 50% off cocktails and bottled beers and bar food. The bar menu caught my eye with options like fish sliders, chorizo hotdogs and fresh oysters and 50% off too. Sadly we couldn&#39;t try any of the food as we were saving our stomachs for the main event. For drinks I would highly recommend my Pomegranate Caipirinha which had a real depth of flavour in there with a fruity twist.Sadly the Long Island Iced tea was slightly weak. <br><br>Without food the alcohol did go straight to my head so I was glad that by 6:30pm our table was nicely laid out with the menu and a jug of tap water was ready for us to pour out. We were asked if we wanted all of our dishes to come out together because only two of us had ordered a starter. With five mains being ordered and other diners I thought this would be a challenge however in excellent timing they managed to pull it off. <br><br>Unlike the usual soup and bread Sam&#39;s goes the extra mile and served my cauliflower soup with a crunchy cheesy crostini and a fried egg on top. Dipping that into my soup was just a pleasure to enjoy. The other starter of prawn masala off the set menu was packed with flavour and spices and had a really refreshing dressed salad on the side to balance the flavours out. <br><br>Together with the set menu came the Wild mushroom and onion stroganoff which may have been on the healthy alternative from the 5:2 menu but did not compensate on flavour at all. The mushrooms really fragrant the dish and together with the creamy onion sauce just brought the dish alive and left us satisfied.<br><br>The beetroot arancini did seem a bit small for a main, arriving in three medium size balls. The arancini themselves were very delicate in flavour, rice cooked perfectly sticky and fluffy in a beautiful thin crunchy breadcrumb coating. Flavours became more apparent with the goats&#39; cheese &amp; onion sauce which really lifted the dish up. Together with the crunchy roasted radicchio the textures coming together made this dish a delight to enjoy. <br><br>For meat lovers I definitely recommend the Baby Back Ribs. This one was cooked to my liking, one with a good bite and meat hugging the bone which I believe produce the best flavour and texture as it&#39;s the boiled down till the flavours have gone. The meat was juicy and lean, portion was plentiful and the sauce was spot on, not too sweet or salty. They were finger food, sticky and great to get into. Together with the beautifully seasoned creamed sweet potato mash they were a joy to demolish.<br><br>Not so successful were the rib pork-eye that was overcooked even though they said it would be pink in the middle. This made the meat chewier then expected, However we learnt to appreciate the flavours instead and it&#39;s juiciness escalated by the marjoram dressing. The Nasville Chicken also had the same problem with being overcooked. This made the chicken quite dry and dense inside which is usually a problem with chicken breast meat. But once again the flavours from the marinated spices giving it that good kick of heat saved it, that and the lovely crunchy slaw and pickled gherkin on the side.  <br><br>Most the dishes came in a good portion although not all come with a side dish. Chips were one of the better ones, seasoned and fluffy.<br><br>As for desserts I  recommend the Warm Pecan Pie with cinnamon ice cream which was amazing with the soft yet crunchy pecans. The contrast of hot and cold really balanced out the sweetness, the cinnamon giving it that extra kick of nutty flavour. Sticky toffee pudding was lovely but could have done with more icecream to get the ratio right but faultless in flavour- a nice sticky caramel sauce on top into a light sticky toffee cake. The Ginger &amp; Lemon Cheesecake came a lot lighter and fluffier than I expected. It was a nice change to the denser one I&#39;m used to and I love how the lemon flavours were stronger in the sorbet and lighter in the cheesecake for that perfect balance. <br><br>Sam&#39;s Brasserie really did surprise us with the quality and skilled cooking. All the dishes although very recognisable, were unique and had great attention to detail. Service was friendly although could have done with more staff. I would love to make a return to Sam&#39;s if the restaurant was nearer to me- one of the best Baby Back Rib&#39;s I&#39;ve had.  A great family friendly restaurant with a kid&#39;s menu, warm comfortable decor welcoming people of all ages.",

"reviewcomment":"The menu had so many different things that we wanted to try that it was a struggle to decide on what to order.  It&#39;s definitely a spot worth going to if you have a lot of people so you can try an array of things.<br><br>We started with a mixed appetiser plate which included green beans, chicken and bamboo shoots in some sort of peanut sauce, short ribs in a sweet sauce with sesame seeds, some sort of beef jerky strips in chilli oil and peanuts.  All were really good.  The beef was particularly interesting.  <br><br>Our waiter recommended deep fried fish with bell peppers.  The dish had a slight kick to it and the fish fillets were coated in a nice salty batter.  Really yummy.  We ordered some tofu to go with it which wasn&#39;t anything special.  I could have easily made this at home.<br><br>The service was great as well.  Everyone speaks English and were happy to have a chat about the menu.  I&#39;d definitely return to try some more!  Beware, the restaurant gets very very loud if it&#39;s crowded.",

"reviewcomment":"I was unsure what to expect from the Chinese food here in London, but I must say I was pleased with my lunch at Four Seasons in Chinatown. First off, this area of London is much nicer and maintained than most Chinatowns I have been to in the US, which is several. It does not however ruin any of the traditional market-type feel I personally look for in a great Chinatown experience.<br><br>Now to the restaurant, there is something comforting about fresh roasted duck and pig hanging in the front window. The entry way is a bit crammed, which I can see being a bit troublesome at busier times. We went here on a Sunday afternoon around 12:30 hoping for dim sum, but it turned out it was not being served. Not sure if this is normal or not, but it was definitely disappointing. <br><br>Seating-wise it was slightly confined, so be prepared to sit directly next to people you don&#39;t know (basically at the same table). Aside from the close quarters the restaurant did not seem overly crowded.<br><br>For starters I ordered a bowl of Fish Maw soup, which is my absolute favourite. The flavor was great, no complaints whatsoever, but in my opinion it could have either been a bit thicker or had more meat. I was a bit surprised when they only brought out an individual bowl as the menu listed it at £6, and I assumed that would be for the group. I guess that is just London for you though...<br><br>We also ordered 1/2 a crispy duck for the three of us to share, which could have been more food for the price. It was served shredded with a stack of warm rice wraps and fresh veggies. In all honesty I thought this tasted excellent and the delivery was great. I liked how they gave us the bones too in case we wanted to shred a bit more off (which we did). The sauce was a bit sweet for my taste, but I tend to prefer more salty/savory sauces with meat.<br><br>All in all, I will definitely be coming back here to explore more of their menu. I will just have to do more research on when dim sum is served/not served next time before coming.",

"reviewcomment":"There&#39;s been a growth of new restaurants appearing in Old Street and some quite attracting too. Salvation Jane were one of the first ones to open that got me excited to try out being a sister of Lantana, a popular brunch place and Salvation of Jane was no different. I really thought I was in for a let down when I saw they had removed the Spanish Style Baked Eggs off the menu as it was the dish I wanted. My heart sank when I couldn&#39;t find it. But I&#39;m pretty glad in the end as it got me trying new brunch dishes I wouldn&#39;t usually have ordered if I saw baked eggs. <br>So in the end I settled for my corn fritters stacked w/ streaky bacon, fresh spinach and slow roast tomatoes served w/ avocado chilli lime salsa and crème fraiche whilst my boyfriend went for the toasted sourdough, organic streaky bacon, a fried egg, rocket, fresh tomato and aioli. We also added a side of a halloumi. Both dishes were delicious although I only got to have a bite out of the boyfriend&#39;s one so will not review his. <br>There was so much going on that it was hard to believe how wholesome it actually was. The combination of ingredients used was faultless. The beautifully grilled corn fritters had a lovely seasoning, slightly spiced and each bite had soft little burst of sweetness coming through with the corn. Lovely fresh crunches from the spinach and the perfectly salted lightly crisp bacon giving me that &#39;Saturday treat yourself&#39; feel. The perfect sunny side up, avocado and creme friache wrapped things up nicely, adding that buttery creamy texture to each mouthful. The halloumi came nice and chunky and no complaints there. The whole dish was just made with simple ingredients but put together it tasted amazing. <br>I finished with my Chai Latte which was probably one of the best I&#39;ve had as you could actually taste the tea. It was creamy with distinctive notes of ginger which was really warming. <br>Together with the fresh looking wooden decor, natural lighting shining through, homely furniture with a mini bookshelf containing fun little books for a quick read and a self serving condiment shelf, my brunch experience became the perfect start to my weekend. It&#39;s the place I would choose to go for relaxation, a feel of home but being served by lovely waiting staff, all very welcoming too. Really highly recommend this place.",

"reviewcomment":"Brilliant place! I was worried it would be tacky or brash but it was tastefully decorated, authentic, exciting, relaxing and above all, the food was amazing.<br>My friend and I arrived pretty late in the evening (almost 10pm) but after a little cajoling they agreed to serve us and from that point on they were lovely and perfectly attentive. We missed the entertainment though, but from what I&#39;ve heard it&#39;s well worth getting there in time to see it. Next time I think I&#39;ll go on a Friday when there&#39;s music played quite late into the evening as well.<br>I was VERY impressed with the food. We ordered one of the feasts and, O.M.G it lived up to its name. We were full just after the starters! Humous was delightfully garlicky, bread was light and tasty, and the baba ganoush was the best I&#39;ve ever tasted! We were then presented with a glorious pile of shish kebab meat and rice, wich was all very tasty. Then, when we thought we might burst, out came a beautiful tower of dessert: fresh fruit, Turkish delight and delicious baklava. <br>Needless to say, we stumbled out of there clutching our bellies (but smiling with guilty pleasure).",

"reviewcomment":"After a rather annoying struggle to make plans with our friends, I decided to take it upon myself to check Yelp (trusty Yelp!) to make dinner plans for a pre-Christmas get together. As our friends wanted to hang out in their old Imperial College stomping grounds, I quickly chose Pierino.<br><br>The website for Pierino was not working but I read the reviews and called their number. Eureka! They were able to book us for dinner for eight people and had plenty of vegetarian options to spare...which is a must for a group where all but one diner are vegetarians. <br><br>If you&#39;re at South Kensington station, Pierino is a short walk. Don&#39;t arrive too early - if your table isn&#39;t ready, there is no where for you to sit. Seeing as it is December and it was coming down with rain, we were annoyed about not being able to be warm and cozy before being seated for our meal. Reservations are a must - Pierino is tiny and popular. BOOK AHEAD, okay? <br><br>We were seated in a rather cramped section across from the bar, but no matter. The restaurant was crowded and the fact that many of the patrons of the restaurant - as well as the staff - were speaking beautiful, musical Italian gave us good vibes that the meal would be promising. <br><br>We had a bit of trouble ordering drinks due to the language barrier but our trusty waitress took our drink orders. I had a bellini (needed a bit more of the peach puree, if you ask me) and the rest of our group had lemonades or beers. We ordered starters - a mix of salads, garlic bread and bruschetta. Everything came in hearty portions (be warned, one garlic bread portion is MASSIVE while some of the salads are perfect for just two people). We chose wisely due to the help of our lovely waitress.<br><br>Ordering mains wasn&#39;t difficult as there were so many vegetarian choices but BE WARNED: For some reason, at Pierino, some of the dishes that are vegetarian are NOT (seafood is not vegetarian, my friends) while other dishes are vegetarian and are not marked appropriately. Read everything you&#39;re ordering - don&#39;t trust the &#39;V&#39; or lack thereof to order your meal. We selected an array of pastas (the cannelloni was ordered by three of us), pizzas, and one risotto (mine!) and waited for our meal. <br><br>Pizzas arrived first and some of our friends felt strange eating but food was hot and there was no need to wait. The pastas and risotto took a bit longer but our food arrived soon enough and we dug in. All requests (please add chilis, remove mushrooms) were taken into account beautifully and we all ate our food. Portions are generous so one can eat a pizza to themselves if they&#39;d like or order two between a pair and share. Pastas are quite big, as well.<br><br>Everything about Pierino was pleasant. A few bumps in the road but the fact that it&#39;s in such a convenient location is a plus. I don&#39;t know when we&#39;ll be back but I&#39;d like to give it another shot!",

"reviewcomment":"So before heading off to dinner, I treated an old work colleague to a cocktail. She is a big martini fan, so I thought that Christopher&#39;s would work for her. Now I&#39;ve been here before, only for a cocktail mind you and rated it 3 stars. Rude waiters in particular I seem to remember.<br>This time our waitress obviously got out of bed on the right side today as she was very pleasant indeed. We hadn&#39;t made a reservation but grabbed a space on the long bar that glows from within (much like the saying about a pregnant woman). I ordered a lychee and strawberry martini, which was INCREDIBLE. I was intrigued because lychee is such a delicate and subtle flavour it easily have been overpowered by the other ingredients. It was like sipping nectar of the gods, seriously impressive and beautifully balanced. For £11 I was more than happy!<br>My friend had an elderflower &amp; blueberry martini, also really nice but a bit strong on the blueberry for me (I am a massive fan of elderflower though). She was very happy though and was raving about it all over dinner, to the annoyance of the next place we went to (she compared everything to this drink and found it wanting!)<br><br>Well played Christopher&#39;s, you are redeemed",

"reviewcomment":"Wow. Imaginative menu and an uber cool buzz - this place got my attention and held it!<br><br>6 of us got a table on a Wednesday evening to celebrate my housemate&#39;s birthday, sitting right next to the floor-to-ceiling windows for a view I&#39;ll call &#39;monsoon on cobblestones&#39;. Luckily my seat faced inwards, so I could enjoy the open plan kitchen and classy décor - minimalist without being cold, all clean lines and soft edges. It&#39;s one of those places where every party seems to be having a great time and you kinda want to pull up a chair and join in the conversation.<br><br>If the atmosphere hums then it&#39;s the food that sings, right from the olive oil and bread board (in 3 types yay) through a range of reasonably-priced antipasti which the waitress kept recommending and we kept saying yes. The sea bass carpaccio and the blackened octopus dish stood out here, and I think I finished one of the burrata dishes all by myself. <br><br>Eventually someone had the willpower to call a halt to move to mains; cue yummy homemade pappardelle that melted in your mouth stuffed with a flavourful pheasant ragu. I think the menu changes regularly but others had the squid, the pork belly and a seafood-based spaghetti dish which they all seemed pretty pleased with. Have to say I&#39;m not sure how well veggies would fare but for less restricted eaters and happy sharers this is a really interesting menu.<br><br>The taste adventure was nicely topped off with the fact the wine was excellent - the waitress gave us some recs and even let us try a couple first which was a really nice touch! Service was generally attentive and flexible - they were happy for us to sneak up to the counter individually to pay without the birthday girl noticing she was being treated :)<br><br>It&#39;s not an everyday/drop-in place so prices are in the semi-expensive camp, particularly if you try the wine (and you should). Perhaps the first Italian I&#39;ve been happy paying up for. You&#39;ll know what you&#39;re getting into though because you&#39;ll have booked in advance. It&#39;s a Bermondsey gem I&#39;ll be revisiting - your biggest issue with it may well be getting a table!",

"reviewcomment":"Always an amazing experience! I was introduced to this place by a Japanese friend who really knows her sushi, and have been back many times since. The restaurant itself is a really lovely, calm dining environment and does not have the slightly &#39;rushed&#39; feeling of some sushi bars, partly due to its location.<br>The food is always outstanding, and has a great choice of dishes even for me as a vegetarian (I gather it&#39;s even more amazing for those who eat fish). Not the cheapest in town, but ideal for a treat.<br>I&#39;m not sure if the restaurant&#39;s satellite take-away bars are still open, but there used to be a small branch in Piccadilly that served the most mouth-watering sushi at lunchtime. It was all freshly made and yet cheaper than the plastic-tasting stuff you&#39;d buy in supermarkets. Also highly recommended.",

"reviewcomment":"I used to treat myself to coming here on my lunch break back when I worked in nearby Sheldon Square; it was always busy then, and when I returned with a friend last night, it was even busier. Our 2 minute wait for a table to become available, was barely noticed due to the friendly staff explaining specials and getting us menus. <br><br>The menu is full of typical middle eastern fare to suit any taste. We chose to start with some deliciously smooth homemade hummus, and fresh flat bread. This was followed up by a whole roasted baby chicken and my friend a lamb shawarma.<br><br>The place didn&#39;t quieten down the whole time we were there, with people coming to sit down as well as queue up for take away. This small place has an easy atmosphere about it; between the close knit tables glances and comments were shared about how good everything is. <br><br>For us, it was the perfect extension to a few pints in the pub, and with it&#39;s close proximity to Paddington, it could serve as the ideal destination for something a bit different to munch on the last train home!",

"reviewcomment":"I was at Sway bar a few nights ago as part of a big party in one of the downstairs rooms (the Milk Bar, to be specific). I mention this because it means that I obviously had a bit of an unusual experience, but there are some things I can comment on that I think are general about the place.<br><br>First, the service was quite good, considering how busy and big of a group we were.  The bartenders were able to quickly make drinks, handle transactions, and patiently put up with a whole lot of increasingly drunk people who basically didn&#39;t want to go home (woo, end of finals!).<br><br>The drinks themselves were alright--pretty high priced, though I guess that&#39;s part and parcel with the neighborhood. We also had a chance to try food, which was great bar food--wings, pizza, fries, etc. All of it was piping hot and very tasty!<br><br>Overall, it was nice enough--I had a good time dancing and letting go of some stress. I&#39;m not sure it&#39;s my typical cup of tea, but it&#39;s a good place if you&#39;re into cocktail bars with a little bit of funkiness to them.",

They will do anything to make your experience there as fun as possible. <br>I came back after 2 years and even the waitresses were the same. Such a great place.<br>The food is amazing! The large pizza is Really large so you might need help if its only two of you.<br>All pastas are delicious and very authentic. <br>I do recommend this place for dinner or function.<br>I wish I still live in London....",

"reviewcomment":"I really like chilling out for hours here.<br><br> Location &amp; opening times<br>This wine bar is not big so it tends to get very busy, crowded most of the weekend afternoons. The secret is, it is now opened to 10pm, the perfect place in late afternoon when most of the cafes are closed, restaurants not opened for dinner yet, and pubs boring and empty.<br><br> Nice location - close to Liberty, Soho, there&#39;s even the Riflemaker Gallery just round the corner.<br><br> Wine &amp; food<br>My usual favourite here are Cote du Rhone, grilled chorizo, ham, manchego cheese and extra toasted bread (drizzled with fragrant olive oil). There are lots offered on the menu, and all of them are prepared, served with care, to customers who all look the discerning kind. You could order fizzy water, but i usually help myself to the lemon scented water served in water jugs on the counter bar. The food portion is not big, but enough to satisfy appetite of most sizes.<br><br> Ambience<br>The crowd is varied, from young 20&#39;s to etc, friends, dates, families. Atmosphere is relaxed. Very civilised, now who doesn&#39;t like that ?",

"reviewcomment":"This has been endlessly recommended to me, but then by now, so have most places in Tooting. Each one has something different to offer, I find. We chose Mirch because we wanted a slightly smarter-than-canteen (ruling out spice village and lahore karahi, both excellent) setting, and the BYOB was a bonus. <br><br>Mirch has to offer: excellent chicken wings (made famous by the review stuck in the window, which I used as leverage to make my party order them), not very meaty but full of flavour. &#39;Proper&#39; popadoms (not greaseballs). Onion bhajia which is actually like spicy onion rings and deliciously bad for you. Beautifully cooked meat, lovely flavours, huge range of dishes. <br><br>It also has in my experience pretty poor service - mango chutney received ten minutes after we ate all the popadoms (so we had some more, of course), a refusal to take away dirty plates so we had to re-use them, and an announcement they&#39;d run out of okra for my main just after they&#39;d served the other 5 people their dishes.... I was perfectly happy with mine in the end (lamb to die for), and I&#39;ve learned to expect this kind of service as it&#39;s sort of standard &#39;let everyone be&#39; stuff - we did sit for over 2 hours. But it still grated when we ate too much chilli and had to share a single glass of water! <br><br>A friendly and lively Saturday night crowd and no hurry atmosphere make it a good choice though. Not sure about the &#39;best curry in Tooting&#39; tag, but it&#39;s definitely miles above anything Brick Lane has to offer!",

"reviewcomment":"My husband had never been to a Wagamamas restaurant before but chose it because it was within walking distance from the Menier Chocolate Factory where we&#39;d seen a matinee performance.  He was also unaware that Wagamamas is the restaurant of choice for my daughter who was delighted to find out that was where we were going!<br><br>There was a queue of people waiting to be seated but the staff were very quick to find us a table when they discovered that my husband was disabled and couldn&#39;t stand for too long.  It was quite busy and, having sat down, the waiter didn&#39;t realise that we hadn&#39;t been given menus and it was some time before we could attract his attention.<br><br>In spite of the previous comment, the food was fairly quick to arrive at the table.  My husband and daughter had both ordered the saien soba (fried tofu, vegetables + noodles in soup)  and their bowls were massive!  I&#39;d ordered yasai wagamama pad-thai which is egg-fried rice noodles in a tamarind sauce with fried tofu, egg, beansprouts, leeks, chinese chives, spring onions, garlic, ginger, mint and chillies. garnished with coriander cress, fried shallots, peanuts and lime.  It didn&#39;t look very much on the plate but was very filling.<br><br>We&#39;d just started eating when the manager brought over a bowl of edamame for us that he advised the chef had prepared one too many and thought we might like them.  Little did he know that edamame is a particular favourite of ours and something we normally order at Giraffe!  They were just salted and lacked that extra kick that the Giraffe ones have but we added some soy and chilli sauces - delicious!<br><br>Hadn&#39;t intended having dessert but I couldn&#39;t resist the date and orange pancakes and my husband had the sweet ginger and apple gyoza - deep-fried apple + ginger dumplings.<br><br>It was a lovely meal, my husband even came away saying we must definitely go back to a Wagamamas soon and pleased when we told him there&#39;s one in our local shoping centre!  No, we didn&#39;t get charged for the edamame (you never know) and even though we had desserts it wasn&#39;t an expensive evening.  Green tea is provided on the house and you just keep asking for top ups so there&#39;s no need to spend a fortune having a hot drink or one of their range of juices.<br><br>The one downside was the echo effect because the walls were tiled. It was rather noisy at the start of the evening.<br><br>Although they were busy and we had felt a bit ignored to start with, the service was very good such that my husband, one who doesn&#39;t normally tip, made a point of including a tip when he paid!",

I had the confit duck with an Asian slaw and it was as well crisped as any confit duck I&#39;ve had in Paris. The mango and papaya slaw cut through the richness of the duck very nicely. The starters of spring rolls were. Bit more perfunctory but still nice. My dream is to snag the private table for two on the balcony raised over the rest of the room.",

"reviewcomment":"Like the city of old, Babylon stands towering over London as an example of civilisation. And as it&#39;s namesake did, the building stretches up past its neighbours to reach for the heavens. Although in London, this feat only requires 6 or 7 floors.<br><br>Babylon is the bar/restaurant located on the 7th floor of a building just around the corner from Whole Foods Kensington. The fairly non-descript entrance can be hard to miss although the hulking bouncer in front isn&#39;t. On most evenings, you will need a reservation just to get in and if trying to get to Kensington Rooftop Gardens Club (6th floor and part of the restaurant complex), you better be on the guest list or have Sir Branson on speed dial.<br><br>I should add a disclaimer that as one of my close friends works at Babylon, I&#39;ve always had a great time there thanks to him. That being said, from my previous experiences at the club (before he started) and my observation of other patrons, this is a place that really focuses on providing a delightful and relaxing time for all of its guests. <br><br>My latest visit was on one of the rare sunny days London has graciously provided to give a semblance of summer. After taking my time to peruse the extensive cocktail menu, I finally found myself with a cool drink in hand and sat back to enjoy the lingering rays. Some light jazz from the live band filtered through the speakers, perfectly balanced to allow for conversation while covering up any awkward silences. We pushed our dinner reservation back to 9pm and ordered a scallop appetiser from the terrace seafood bar.<br><br>This bar is pretty awesome with a massive assortment of seafood (mainly shellfish and prawns although I reckon you can get some sashimi or ceviche if you ask nicely) on display. They have a limited stock so once it sells out then they are done for the day. While it may be disappointing if you get there late, at least you know it&#39;s fresh! Our scallop taster was delicious with tender scallops bursting with sweetness and served in the shell (which I&#39;ve always thought added an excellent artistic touch to the presentation).<br><br>Finally, we gave up on the dying sunlight and settled inside for dinner. I started off with a Summer Truffle Risotto that was tender and creamy but maintained a delicateness I can only hope to recreate at home. The truffle (surprisingly not my favourite item) did a great job enhancing the flavour of the dish without trying to steal centre stage.<br><br>My Roast Pork Fillet main was tasty and a good mix of textures from the succulent pork, crunchy veggies, and velvety spatzle. I would have liked some more of the sauce as the pork was a tad dry for my tastes but a minor point.<br><br>For dessert, we were treated to a display of liquid nitrogen cooking as an alcoholic sorbet was whipped up in seconds using a recipe similar to a margarita than was then doused in that iciest of liquids. From the billowing steam, a set of frosted glasses appeared with our delightful desserts. The coldness of the sorbet enhanced the crispness of the flavours and was a perfect high note to end the rich meal. We had a bit of an extra treat with meringue dipped in the leftover liquid nitrogen. If you dip it in and then place it into your mouth, each word you speak is accompanied by a puff of smoke. We were having far too much fun and the table next to us insisted on joining in and one lady put us to shame with a truly excellent display of smoke rings.<br><br>Overall, a great night of food and drink in an unbeatable surrounding. The live jazz (every Tuesday) was a great touch and one I&#39;d missed from my time back in Boston. The place isn&#39;t cheap (cocktails are around £10-12, mains £25-30), but it&#39;s one of the few times I&#39;d say it&#39;s worth it. Just make sure to go on a sunny day as it would be a shame not to experience the terrace and gardens.",

"reviewcomment":"Well, lawks-a-mercy, I&#39;ve finally found a good restaurant in the Farringdon/Clerkenwell area! And (oh the irony) it&#39;s veggie, unlike me.<br><br> After several miserable experiences (unforgivably miserable in the case of Modern Pantry) I was on the verge of giving up. I&#39;d never heard of Vanilla Black until the arrival of a veggie mate set me searching.<br><br> Boy, am I glad I found it. I completely agree with every word of the other reviews. This place does proper posh nosh.<br><br> My veggie mate was in heaven and this little piggy (eater) wasn&#39;t far off.<br><br> Staff were lovely, too.<br><br> Criticisms? Enough with the Farrow and Ball grey already. It&#39;s dated, ubiquitous and downright depressing. However, I&#39;m not about to deduct a star on account of the paintwork.",

There are normal tables in the front, then a couple very large L-shaped wraparound leather seating areas (perfect for a big group or to cozy up next to someone) and a small back patio (just a couple tables in a very narrow space) to eat outside. <br><br>Impeccable service. Our waitress had many recommendations and was quite attentive. We did go on a Sunday morning so there wasn&#39;t much traffic. I&#39;m surprised there weren&#39;t more people there for brunch actually. <br><br>While they do have brunch fares 8-12 pounds and lunch was more around 10-15, they also had the amazing option of smoked salmon on brioche for a mere 4.50. What a steal, given the portions were absolutely perfect. Seems like there&#39;s a wider range of prices than at Caravan down the street. Had a 1 pound scoop of elderflower ice cream, which was so sweet and delicate (how have I never had this before!). The server also recommended a peanut butter ice cream. <br><br>I see there&#39;s a Yelp deal (free glass of champagne) and there was a great looking 12 pound oysters and champagne deal they had going. Better go back and try that!",

"reviewcomment":"This cafe bar is perfect for a solitary drink . The staff are friendly, chatty and welcoming and the bar snacks have a nice European feel. The decor &amp; music is cool and quirky but not up itself . I like . <br>Only downfall is the cider selection is one choice . . Koppenberg . As a cider person this doesn&#39;t do at all . But I was comforted with a nice selection of whiskey . <br>Definite ideal haunt for those who need to loose a few hours .",

"reviewcomment":"I popped by Aqua Neuva on Saturday for lunch and it was much quieter than Aqua Kyoto. Nevertheless, the staff were fantastic as was the food!<br><br>We tried the £25 for three course lunch menu, which came with a glass of cava. As we had no allergies and eat pretty much everything, we let the chef loose and he impressed! Each course was perfectly presented and bursting with flavour. Though small in size, we finished the meal with full bellies. I&#39;ve seen reviews which talked about the chef&#39;s inflexibility but it didn&#39;t seem the case today. <br><br>The first course was a delicate potato and chorizo dish, followed by a chickpea and octopus dish, rounded out by the tenderest pork dish. I&#39;m not doing these dishes justice at all! For the price, I thought the meal was great value as everything was of top quality.<br><br>On a nice day, everyone must visit the terraces. There aren&#39;t many places in that area where you can enjoy a nice glass of cava while the streets bustle below!",

In the end they went downstairs to get some. On the burrito side however I have no complaints whatsoever. For £6 (50p extra for guacamole - various degrees of spiciness you can pick from!) you will be full &#39;til dinner time and beyond. Copious amounts of fresh salad, dollops of refried beans, rice and a good sized helping of meat of your choice (pork, chicken, beef or vegy) topped up with sour cream, spicy salsa in a soft tortilla wrap.<br><br>I read the reviewer&#39;s comment below and sampled Luardo&#39;s burrito van on Whitecross St and to be honest, I prefer Burrito Bros (although there&#39;s a really fit blonde girl working at Luardo&#39;s...)",

We were advised on arrival it is best to book, however we still managed to grab a table for our group of 5.  There are candles, comfy chairs an the area goes back quite a bit. There is music but it&#39;s more ambient so you can easily have a conversation  and there is other lighting within the the venue so you can still see easily.<br><br>They have table service (they will charge you an extra 12% for service charge), there is also food available, but nothing really light that I could have eaten before going for a meal.<br><br>The only thing that let this place down was the toilets. After sitting the beautiful and decadent bar the ladies weren&#39;t as nice, looked like need a luck of pain and there was no soap.",

"reviewcomment":"This is now the FOURTH Pho location we&#39;ve been to in the UK!  I think I should get a free one, or something.  This one is on the upper floor of the Westfield shopping center, in a little food court area.  They have a slightly smaller menu compared to the proper restaurant locations, but the prices are the same.  I ordered the chicken pho again, and the green beans/sugar snaps in peanut sauce as a side.  They gave us an electric buzzer while we took a seat (seating area in this part of Westfields is indoor, but great for people watching and has chargers for your phone!) and the food was ready in about 5 minutes.<br><br>The pho comes in a wide bowl, not disposable even though it&#39;s a food court.  Nice as it feels more like a proper restaurant.  They have hot sauces at the counter that you can use to spice up your meal, and they give you a little bowl of herbs/chillis/bean sprouts as always.  After doctoring our soups to the proper temperature, we dug in - and they were lovely.  Just as they always are at a Pho restaurant, the broth was lovely.  I know it&#39;s not the classic pho, but I think the chicken broth is almost better than the beef!  It&#39;s more soothing in a way, like Asian chicken noodle soup.  It was hot (temperature-wise, also spicy after I dumped in some hot sauce), and truly hit the spot on a day when it was pouring rain.  The chicken was juicy and the noodles were abundant.   I love the crisp veggies in the sweet and yummy peanut sauce as well, if you want a veg they are probably your best option.<br><br>Very affordable, and a deliciously filling meal as always.  We&#39;re addicted, if you can&#39;t tell!",

"reviewcomment":"Fairuz is a really cozy Lebanese restaurant in the heart of Marylebone. What I like about this place is the fact that it&#39;s not as glossy and pretentious as your typical Marylebonian restaurant. The interior is very warm and welcoming and it invites you to linger and engage in a wonderful conversation.  <br><br>The other day I went to Fairuz with 10 colleagues of mine. What was really nice was that they were able to accommodate a large group like this at relatively last-minute. Plus, they sat us at one big table upstairs and we pretty much could be as vocal as we wanted. The staff was super friendly and they were fast and efficient. Being a large group, we opted for the standard menu at £25 per person. This gives you the typical hummus, baba ganoush, tabbouleh, falafel and plenty of meat. <br><br>In my opinion, this place offers a good introduction to Lebanese cuisine. In fact, when I came here for the first time many years ago, I was pretty much a virgin when it came to Lebanese cuisine and so I was excited about it. Having been to many different Lebanese restaurants in London since, I find that this place actually only offers the standard fair; at good value for money though - considering that this is Marylebone.",

"reviewcomment":"My partner and I went to Chor Bizarre for lunch one day, and overall, I felt that it was very good Indian food, but felt a little tricked by the waitress. We were walking around Mayfair and ask the concierge at the Athenaeum Hotel for some good Indian food in the area, and he recommended this place. He called ahead, though that wasn&#39;t really necessary because the place was empty for lunch.<br><br>Unfortunately, we were not able to spend a very long time at this restaurant because we had to quickly leave to make our plane back to America. We started with the chutney nadroo (crispy lotus root tossed in tamarind chutney, fennel seed and onion seeds), which were very light and acted as a great amuse bouche. For entree, we ordered the cauliflower and chicken biryani and some bread garlic roti (as well as a chicken dish I forget). They were without except very good,. We both love Indian food, and this is some of the best we&#39;ve had.<br><br>However, I do think to a certain extent that the hostess pulled a fast one on us. They knew that the Athenaeum Hotel had just called for us, so for whatever reason, they did not give us a lunch menu and only gave us the full dinner menu even though we were rushed. Knowing that we had to leave very soon, why give us the menu with the tandoori options that take forever to cook? We didn&#39;t think to ask for lunch menu because we thought it would be provided to us if they had it, so instead of an affordable and quick Indian meal, we had all these dinner portions that we could not possibly finish nor actually take back home with us because of customs. What good is that? So while the food was very good we did feel a bit taken advantage of by the hostess.<br><br>Also, this place was a bit difficult to find. There&#39;s another Indian restaurant on that same street that we went into, and that one also looked very nice. The vibe inside Chor Bizarre was very classic and traditional, and I really liked it.<br><br>Overall, I would definitely recommend Chor Bizarre for Indian food. They had a good number of choices, and the food was delicious. But unfortunately, because we felt a little tricked, I can&#39;t really give them a perfect score.",

The food was also great - I had a perfectly cooked tuna steak, lovely and moist and pink in the middle. <br><br>The only negative to the meal was that several of the menu options were unavailable. However, the staff were flexible and would allow menu options to be adapted (e.g, my tuna dish came with lentils which I do not particuarly like, but there was no problem at all swapping these for a potato dish). Also, there is very little choice for vegetarians - one of our group is vegetarian and there was only one starter option available (a goats cheese and bacon salad requested without bacon) and one main course that he could eat.",

"reviewcomment":"It&#39;s been a while since dim sum in Chinatown. My previous favourite place being Top of the town which unfortunately closed at the start of the year. Dumpling Legends just opposite looks promising, but I can&#39;t stomach the prices and the fact I usually see very few chinese people eating there. However that is starting to change, so maybe it&#39;s good now.<br><br>Anyway the search was on for a replacement and a friend suggested this place or Joy King Lau for good dim sum. The decision was difficult, but eventually we settled on Young Cheng this time.<br><br>There is another restaurant on Shaftesbury avenue with the same name and similar storefront. However the insides of both are widely different. This branch does dim sum, and looks a lot busier, cleaner and professional than the other. Service is quick and efficient. Ordering dim sum as simple as looking at a picture, taking down the number and marking that on carbon paper. Not a word need be spoken (apart from requesting extra chilli of course!)<br><br>The dim sum was great. Nothing spectacular here. But all filling, tasty and well portioned. The chilli oil mixed with chilli sauce was especially delish. It was just the right amount of spice and complimented the steamed dim sum perfectly. One standout dish was the chicken&#39;s feet. The sauce was fantastic. Get this is you want something a little off the beaten track.<br><br>To to recap, great service, great food, nice atmosphere, good value, perfect portions. For two people, 8-9 dishes is close to the sweet spot in terms of portioning. This will set you back about £24-28 incl. service and the obligatory tea of course. <br><br>I&#39;m next to try Joy King Lau, but at present, this will be my regular joint for the forseeable future.",

"reviewcomment":"Popped in for a late lunch on Thursday afternoon.  Lots of space, so we sat by the windows so we could see the river. We each had a Greek Trio for lunch (£8.95) with three different meze picks from the menu. I had veggies with hummus and a smoked aubergine dip to start - the dips were very good. The hot meze included a lamb kefte, which was perfectly seasoned and very juicy, and new potatoes in olive oil and herbs. <br><br>The food was delicious and well-prepared. The service was not great - it was very slow, and a bit odd. I think there was a lack of communication between servers. At a couple of points, we were brought other tables&#39; food that we had to turn away. Both times we were waiting for our bill, which took asking three different servers and waiting about 20 minutes. In a nearly empty restaurant. Bit odd. <br><br>Our bottle of house white was very drinkable, though. Unexpectedly nice, and it did keep us happy while we waited that eternity for the bill to come.",

"reviewcomment":"THE place for fish &amp; chips in London! Now F&amp;C has never been labelled as posh food, but when dished out in a smart restaurant with white table cloth, smartly dressed waiters and a reasonable wine menu, you can be forgiven for not knowing. And though the poorper would think £15 is stiff for battered fish, I&#39;d argue that it&#39;s very reasonable compared to many other seafood places I&#39;ve been to.

"reviewcomment":"Byron is very popular with many locations in the city. Most of the central ones are usually packed with a long wait, so I appreciated coming to the one in Westfield because there wasn&#39;t really a line and it&#39;s on the top floor with a open, sun-lit space. Definitely try and get one of the comfy booths if you&#39;re in a big group. <br><br>I got the Byron burger and it was delicious... very juicy and tender, but extremely filling. So if you have to go back to work and you want to avoid food coma, get the regular burger. The appetiser guacamole was disappointing though, not much taste to it and you have to pay separately for the chips, lame! But generally, love the quality of the food, definitely a great place for work lunches :)",

"reviewcomment":"Went here last night for a work dinner and it far exceeded my expectations.  I must admit, I love indulgent gimmickry.  I live for drag queens and contortionists and fire swallowers.  This place had me at hello.<br><br>I think it&#39;s important to mention here that I didn&#39;t pay for the dinner.  Dinner was pretty expensive, as due to the size of our party, we had to order the sharing menu at £50 per person.  There was lots to choose from including steak, salmon and curry.  All was exceptional, particularly the Scottish black Angus fillet steak.  Just incredible.  Probably not worth £50 per person, but again, corporate AmEx.<br><br>The price of the food is irrelevant when you have a topless fire eater dancing across your table.  Trust me on this one.  If androgynous acrobats and meretricious show girls are your thing (like they are mine!), then you are in for a treat!  The performers are yummier than the mousse if you come in with an open mind and dump cocktails all over it.<br><br>Speaking of cocktails...  My GOD they do amazing cocktails.  The bartenders are impressive (and not just their looks!) and their cocktail list is eclectic.  If ever there was a need to even refer to someone as a &#39;mixologist&#39;, it may be these guys.  I ordered the kumquat &amp; almond caipirinha with dinner.  Very delicious and beautifully served.  I also had the G and Tea, but that was very late in the evening and after several glasses of wine, so I cannot remember all the ingredients of that beverage.  What I do remember, and maybe most importantly, is that it was mixed in a Hendricks teapot and served in a matching teacup and saucer.  <br><br>This place is a great place to go for very expensive and equally delicious cocktails and a show.  It&#39;s also a great place for a date, work do (if your colleagues are open minded) or a hen party.  Circus is just great.  We had a fantastic time.  Next time I have fun guests in town, I&#39;ll bring them here.  Maybe I&#39;ll skip the dinner and go straight to the cocktails when I&#39;m picking up the bill myself .",

Don&#39;t get me wrong, they&#39;re not that small but the food surely is not filling and you have to order a lot if you want to fill up. However, the guys compensate with some quite delicious food and lovely attitude. There was a thing that to me personally was more than brilliant - they replaced my order in just a couple of minutes when I told them it was mixed up. I even received complimentary chili sauce when they admitted to the mistake.<br><br>The prawns and curries are awesome and can make up for an excellent last minute dinner option.",

"reviewcomment":"According to the concierge at my hotel, &#39;it&#39;s pretty good hygienic&#39;  - now if that isn&#39;t a overwhelming recommendation, I don&#39;t know what is. In all seriousness, this place really surprised me - you walk in and immediately recognize it as an upscale chain restaurant. This isn&#39;t a bad thing - you know they have processes in place that are make for a consistently good meal. <br><br>As soon as I walked in, I was greeted and seated in a comfortable table near the window. The waitress handed me a menu and also a pictorial menu of some of their most popular dishes. She patiently explained the Thali, which is a stainless steel platter with little bowls of various dishes - lentils, potatoes, or curry - that can be ordered in two sized. I had the Grand Thali and chose the lamb rogan josh as my curry. What a treat - the side dishes change regularly I&#39;m told, so each night could be a different adventure that makes going back several times more fun. <br><br>I would also pair the meal with the Meantime London Lager. It&#39;s a light beer with real flavor that compliments the spiciness of the meal perfectly.",

"reviewcomment":"So a friend I haven&#39;t seen for a while, who lives quite far away, comes to visit. Her train comes to paddington so I think we will have a quick lunch somewhere near and then head out. I remember this place that I had been meaning to try- it was so good we ended up staying for 7 hours!! <br><br>It is so easy to find but yet still feels tucked away. I wasn&#39;t sure when I walked down the stairs if my friend would be ok with it, she  is more of a high end sort of person, but it has quickly become her go to place when in london. <br><br>When we arrived, at 12 on a Sunday, we were offered food from the buffet as menu service didn&#39;t start until 1. I was actually really pleased as it meant trying a few different delicious dishes instead of just one. The value is amazing - I think it was £4.50 for 2 curries and vegetable sides and rice. In fact as we stayed we tried a number of deserts, drinks including Malaysian tea and a drink with jelly in it and took some deserts to go for others and it was still less than £15 each.   Everything we tried was very tasty!<br><br>I wouldn&#39;t usually stay for so long in one place but we had loads to catch up on, and the staff were so lovely about it - it wasn&#39;t busy so they were happy for us to stay. I will definitely be returning and I know my friend already has, and everyone who I gave the deserts to is planning a trip also!",

When I grimaced the waitress asked me if the wine was off.

"reviewcomment":"Went again for dinner last night with my boyfriend and we had the set menu B with a bottle of white. Service this time was perfect. Everyone was friendly, efficient and anything extra that we needed was brought promptly. The sampler platter was good. Mostly fried things, and the ribs were a little too sweet for my liking ( as was the sweet and sour pork) but still good. Spring rolls were crisp without a trace of grease and the sesame shrimp on toast was very good, too. <br><br>Aromatic duck was the perfect second course, although, again-- more deep fried food.<br><br>The black bean shrimp were slightly spicy with lots if crunchy peppers and the fried rice seemed to look sticky and glue -like but it turned out to be among some if the best fried rice I&#39;ve had. Vegetable portion was small, but I love those little straw mushrooms and the way their texture contrasts with the water chestnut and crunchy snow peas.<br><br>Overall, it was a great dinner. The place is almost always busy and last night was no exception. This is always a good sign. <br><br>I think this little corner has won me over!",

Food is great and even comparable to a similar location in Los Angeles. <br><br>Service<br>From the beginning, I thought the service was solid. The wait staff seemed knowledgeable about the menu and reasonable about their recommendations. For the most part they were also attentive and prompt in bringing our drinks and food. BUT, the second our menu completed (we got a tasting menu) then service pretty much ended. No one checked in and it took several attempts to get any wait staff to come to our table. Rather annoying when trying to end the night and get home.<br><br>Food<br>Overall good food. If you&#39;re willing to spend, then do what we did and grab the Tasting Menu. No one really looked at what was apart of it, but all solid dishes that portioned out well to not be overfilling. I don&#39;t remember every dish, but the anticucho dish was nice. Ceviche and gyoza were also excellent. The sushi sampling was also well executed.<br><br>Overall happy with the place. Of note, the bathroom is a trip with it lit up in the basement. Anyways, I would say try this place out for a nice place for dinner and drinks.",

"reviewcomment":"My mum took me and my sisters here on Saturday to celebrate my step-father&#39;s 70th. We could not have been better looked after from breadbasket to bill. It was just the right ambience with a light hubble bubble of conversation, stunning modern art and a smart, international crowd. The French waiters add to the authenticity, the food was immaculately prepared, the flavours there but not overpowering. Drinks pricey but hey this is Soho.<br><br> A pudding and candle prompted the whole restaurant to sing happy birthday to Julian.<br><br> Bravo L&#39;Escargot",

"reviewcomment":"Myself and two friends from the United States rent motorcycles every year (from Guildford Harley Davidson) and come to the UK and get lost for 10 days. Even though you people drive on the wrong side of the road - we still have a great time. People are fantastic! Last summer we had the opportunity of visiting Ace Cafe AFTER we returned our bikes - so we showed up in a four-wheeler, but still had an excellent time! The parking lot was full of old and new bikes of all makes, models and sizes, Everyone was friendly and I loved talking to the folks who were just hanging out and got a chuckle out of my accent (I didn&#39;t know Americans had accents). Food was typical old-style &#34;on the road&#34; food. But, you don&#39;t come here to eat - you come here to socialize and watch kids pop wheelies on 1,000 cc Kawasaki&#39;s. We will be back in September. <br>Jim<br>Fredericksburg, Virginia (USA)",

"reviewcomment":"Part of a chain of French bakery/restaurants, Le Pain Quotidien is all about the bread and pastries. Not much of a breakfast menu, especially for those on Atkins. I went with the two soft-boiled eggs, which were perfectly cooked and extremely hot.Served with a small stack of dippy soldiers (thin sliced bread for dipping into the yolk). I don&#39;t know how they expect people to peel these eggs. Don&#39;t get me wrong, I love me a soft-boiled. But I think I might have burned off my fingerprints.<br><br>On the table were three jars - nutella, apricot preserves and something in French that might have been blackcurrant preserves. All went nicely on the slices of baguette that came with my eggs.<br><br>Specials board changes constantly with different mains, soups and desserts every day. Today the soups were a tomato bisque and gazpacho.<br><br>Excellent coffee. Rather than a latte, I had a &#34;pot&#34; of coffee which was about two cups of coffee (with an interesting bowl rather than a mug) in a French press. Great &#34;wake up&#34; juice, this will cure what ails ya!<br><br>Note: they have a couple of individual tables, but the center of the dining area is dominated by a very large table. Communal dining. Very Continental!<br><br>All told, an excellent simple breakfast. I will return!",

Firstly, Byron get brownie points for being open at 9pm on a Sunday night, so if you crave a good burger to drown your pre-Monday blues in, Byron is the one. <br><br>I had a veggie burger (the only burger option on the menu) and courgette fries. I&#39;m pretty used to the lack of options when it comes to veggie food at burger joints but I would still appreciate two items on the menu. That said, the burger was delicious and the combination of goat&#39;s cheese and Portobello mushroom in a brioche bun worked great. The fries were a bit too greasy for my liking, though.<br><br>So there you have it - a strong 4 out of 5. Byron Burger restaurants are consistently good, at least in my experience.",

"reviewcomment":"I&#39;m so glad this is somewhat my local, which gives me plenty of excuse to pop by often. I don&#39;t eat a lot of chicken but I love the chicken at Chicken Shop. If you time your arrival correctly, you should be able to avoid the queues or better yet, you can put your name down and head upstairs to Pizza East for a drink while you wait.<br><br>I recommend you eat in as I&#39;ve taken chicken home before and it never tastes the same (always drier). The chicken seasoning is fantastic and make sure you use their BBQ and hot sauces. Between two hungry people, you should share 3/4 to a whole chicken. We usually get a whole and take a few bits home. Corn on the cob comes with the option of melted butter on top (yes!) and the chips are good. The coleslaw is pretty darn good and the avocado salad is good for breaking up the heaviness of the meal. As you can tell, I&#39;ve had everything here at least once!<br><br>Whatever you do, don&#39;t miss the apple pie. If you luck out, your server will portion out a massive piece to you. I can&#39;t get enough of the crust! The custard comes in a big jug so you can pour as much as you like, but a bit of traditional vanilla ice cream is also great. <br><br>You can be in and out pretty quick here, which can be good or bad. There&#39;s always a queue of hungry people too so it&#39;s best to finish up and grab your drinks elsewhere. It&#39;s a big cruel forcing others to wait when it&#39;s this good!<br><br>The prices have slowly started to creep up over the last year but hopefully this won&#39;t continue :)",

Everything is absolutely perfect, from the food, service and staff.<br>Top quality cooking at reasonable prices, but be advised to make a booking at the busier times. They also have a small bar downstairs to have a drink at whilst waiting if you want and also a seated area there where you can eat if you want if there is no space left in the restaurant.<br>I can only ask that if you haven&#39;t been before, please try and make an effort to go as it is just superb!",

"reviewcomment":"This is hidden away in a series of small streets, yet very accessible from the Waterloo area. We were looking for an English pub to eat at, and most of them in the main Waterloo area were absolutely slammed, so it&#39;s a relieve to find this little place.<br><br>We walked in and they didn&#39;t have any tables, but they were really friendly so we hung out at the bar for a little bit until one opened up. They actually helped us get a seat, which was very nice of them. Most people just seemed to be here for pre-game -- get a drink, have a chat, and leave. We actually were interested in having dinner, and we ordered a caesar salad, the fish and chips, and one of the Sunday roasts.<br><br>Caesar salad was, well, caesar salad. It would&#39;ve been quite normal except for the little fillets of anchovies. Nice touch. The fish and chips was huge. It was a big fish fillet, and it was fresh and delicious. The mister really enjoyed it (guess we didn&#39;t go to the UK for nothing!). However, my sunday roast beef was so-so. The gravy was quite bland, and the meat was pretty tough until I get to the stuffing. At least the stuffing was good.<br><br>The environment was friendly, the food was decent, and the price wouldn&#39;t break your bank. This is definitely a cute little pub to visit if you&#39;re in the area.",

"reviewcomment":"First off, let&#39;s get one thing out of the way... I LOVE BRUNCH!!<br><br>Honestly, this had to have been one of the best meals I&#39;ve had in London, and the fact that it was brunch and I was drinking made it all the more better. <br><br>A classmate of mine invited me out to brunch and decided to take me here since I&#39;ve never been to Notting Hill before. Located right next to the Electric Cinema is this place, which I think might be called Electric Diner now. Apparently, there was a fire and they had to close for a while but are now reopened. Funny story about that to follow...<br><br>So, we started off with drinks. My friend ordered the Bloody Mary and I ordered the Horse&#39;s Back since I don&#39;t like Bloody Mary&#39;s. When the BM arrived at the table, I was like &#34;DAMNNNNNNNN!&#34; That drink was so beautiful... artfully crafted to perfection, and garnished with a bazillion pickles on top. Of course I tried it, and I thought it was really good. Never liked a BM until this one, true story. My Horse&#39;s Back wasn&#39;t bad, super strong and had a kick to it, especially being the first thing that entered my stomach for the day.<br><br>As for the food, I was really impressed with my dish, simply called open-faced ham, cheese fondue, and fried egg. I gobbled it all up because it was so amazing. My friend ordered the ham steak and green eggs which also looked good. Seriously, I&#39;m coming back here for brunch, it&#39;s SOOOO GOOD!<br><br>So, during our meal the fire alarm kept going off. Sort of getting in the way of our lovely meal, but it wasn&#39;t really that big of a deal. Eventually, management came over and apologized and politely kicked us out because they had to do an inspection. Oh, but what else? They told us the meal was taken care of. A FREEEEEE MEAL?!!! Hell yeah! Score! Touchdown! Victory danceeeee, babyyyyy. <br><br>YUP. We were TWO happy brunchers. And yup, we&#39;ll be back for more soon.<br><br>**Reposted under Electric Diner now!**",

"reviewcomment":"Upon entry, our party of five were led to a fairly large and dimly lit dining room, filled with quiet chatter--as a previous reviewer stated, the ambiance is &#34;more business than romance&#34;--lots of suits and jackets and A-line dresses and skirts, glasses clinking and polite laughter. Nevertheless, the staff are cordial and friendly and avoid being overly chipper. Our coats were taken and hung for us, and chairs were also pulled out.<br><br>The menus are medium-sized and comprehensive, offering a wide range of both meat and vegetarian options. The drink menu is extensive, with many quality wines available--I do not remember the exact wine we had, but it must have been either a Chardonnay or Sauvignon Blanc. It was absolutely delicious--crisp and lightly sweet. <br><br>After we placed our orders, a huge wooden block was placed on our table with whole tomatoes, cucumbers, onions, lettuce, and other assorted vegetables, and we were given a sharp shiny knife and to cut it &#34;as we pleased.&#34; A bit confused but undaunted, we scissored our way through the salad and had a fair bit of fun doing so. <br><br>Appetizers--<br>Kararee Subziyan (fried okra): was served in a little paper cone. Executed with a playful flair and not as done up as the other dishes, but was simple and had pleasant flavor and crunch.<br>Katli (pa-friend aubergine--or eggplant): absolutely divine and could not get enough of it. Was almost meaty with the way the spices were done.<br>Bhalla Papdi Chaat (crisp fried pastry and lentil dumplings): also spectacularly delicious, but by this point we were wondering whether we had ordered too much, as my stomach was beginning to stretch and I wondered how I would finish it all. <br><br>Mains--<br>Mirchi Ka Salan (spicy lamb curry)--served in a small bowl but with the right amount of kick. I could not get enough of this dish; sometimes I find that in Indian restaurants lamb meat tends to be a bit tough, but this was just perfectly tender. <br>Edichakka Varul (jackfruit)--I had never sampled jackfruit before--the texture of hte jackfruit in this dish was pleasantly meaty with just the right amount of bite. It was a bit odd to be eating it as a savoury fish, but it was nevertheless very enjoyable.<br>Dal Makhani (black lentils)--sounds simple, but was impossibly creamy and buttery (it contained both of those elements, I am sure of it) and did not last long<br><br>Dessert--<br>I cannot locate the dessert mennu online and my memory is a bit fuzzy, but I remember their desserts being very unique and interesting in their conception and quite unlike anything i&#39;d seen before--there was a NOODLE dish that was sweet and milky, and a sort of date pudding that was almost cloyingly sweet. <br><br>Overall, the service was impeccable and the food was very, very good--I&#39;d definitely return.",

"reviewcomment":"I was staying at a hotel in the area while visiting from the US, and this place just caught my eye. The decor is really nice inside: casual but hip, I enjoyed the juxtaposition of the dark wood in the dining area against the white subway tile in the bright expo kitchen. <br><br>Solo diners (I was on my own) can sit along an outward facing counter up against the windows. I enjoyed the people and car watching, and it made for a better night than staring at a dark wall.<br><br>At my server&#39;s recommendation, I ordered one of the 6 oz. specialty patties medium rare; it was a pound more expensive than the regular 6 oz. but apparently with slightly better meat. Obviously, I didn&#39;t order both to compare, but it was damn tasty.<br><br>The way ordering works here is that the menu really only has different patties, varying by size and meat quality. Then, you&#39;re free to add cheese and other toppings as desired. I added bleu cheese and bacon to mine, and the bacon was nicely cooked. Also, it&#39;s not mentioned on the menu, but all burgers are served with lettuce, tomato, pickle, and onion on the side. <br><br>One slight downside was the beer selection: they only serve bottles of Heineken and Huber. I had never tried Huber, which is funny because it&#39;s a Wisconsin brewery. However, again my server recommended I try it, and I was quite pleased. Still, I would have preferred a draught menu with a few more options.<br><br>The fries, which are ordered separately, were very good, but they&#39;re not notable in and of themselves. That&#39;s not a bad thing, though, as you should be coming here for the burger. The fries make no attempt to steal the show--they merely play a perfect supporting role. There were some truffle oil + Parmesan fries that were twice the price and would likely have been more exciting, if you&#39;re looking for a bit of adventure.<br><br>Finally, the staff was very friendly and accommodating. They were a little slow to refill my water and bring my check, but those were minor issues that didn&#39;t detract from the overall experience.<br><br>Brgr Co. is definitely worth your time if you&#39;re in the neighborhood!",

They have some very interesting lampshades combined with Asian influences amongst the wall decorations.  <br><br>We went into the bar area to have a drink before dinner. The range of cocktails is good definitely something for all tastes. Although some contain more ice than actual alcohol!!  The staff were all very courteous and helpful.  <br><br>The menu gives you a good choice, we ate from a set menu, of fish and meats and a veggie option. The portion sizes were good, no chance of leaving here hungry!!<br><br>It was surprisingly quite as there was only us and one other couple, the World Cup is on currently, so it could actually be a good time for you to go and try this place?",

"reviewcomment":"We ended up here with another Groupon meal: a three course meal for two. As it was the night of my birthday, we did splurge a bit on the wine. First, the restaurant was fairly empty. Not the best sign for a Saturday night, but it had also been raining all day, and it was quite cold, so I can imagine people not really wanting to travel out for dinner.<br><br>We both had the duck rillette, the steak and chips, and then I had the lemon tart and the other half had the creme brule.<br><br>So, the rillette was fantastic. I&#39;m not going to lie. Great flavor with an amazing relish. The steak was cooked perfectly served with both a peppercorn sauce and a blue cheese sauce. (The blue cheese sauce was better, and very tasty on the chips). Chips were cooked well, and it was served with a side of green veg that were definitely not overdone. Dessert was great, but the creme brule was the winner. It was just magnificent and lush. We then decided to order some cheese.<br><br>The cheese trolley watches you when you come in the door. There&#39;s an amazing selection of cheeses tantalizing you, begging you to get them. So we did. We split a selection if seven (with a bonus eighth given to us by the server). The cheeses are pretty much to die for, which I already knew as we had done another Groupon deal for the cheese and wine masterclass last year.<br><br>Anyway, I can recommend it. The service wasn&#39;t the fastest, but it wasn&#39;t terrible. The food was really well done. If you go, make sure to get cheese. The cheese is really one of the stars of the place. If you don&#39;t want a whole meal, the wine and cheese masterclass is quite enjoyable as well.",

It has a Las Vegas feel because of the promoters are trying to get you to go to their club. Moreover, everyone is dressed up and no one wants to wait in line.<br><br>Suddenly we find our way to the front of the line at Penthouse. All I&#39;m thinking is what did I just get myself into. My LDN Girl Nat explained that this venue has 3 floors, which means 3 different music scenes.<br><br>Nonetheless, I had myself a smashing good time!<br><br>I remember the staff was friendly, the club wasn&#39;t too crowded, and the music was my kind of jam.<br><br>Until next time, wear comfortable shoes!",

We were seated at the front window, which we love so we can always watch the passing traffic. <br><br>The menu is great and there was SO much I wanted...i will be back...I started with the bruschetta with sweetbreads, girolles and nduja (£8.50). The sweetbreads were soft and tender. The mushrooms provided a lovely earthiness and the whole dish was seasoned perfectly but I missed any heat or spice from the nduja.<br><br>The ravioli of pumpkin and ricotta with a sage butter (£8.50) was so light and delicate that they were gobbled up in a matter of seconds - the portion seemed a touch on the small side.

I don&#39;t know if I&#39;ve ever seen a bouncer on a kebab house elsehwere?!<br><br>It&#39;s brilliant in here! Not done with your night when the pubs close? Well then head on over to Marathon and get your fill! You can usually get drinks at a late hour too although I&#39;m not sure this is entirely above board so you might find the availability of Red Stripe cans fluctuates with how regularly the local rozzers are passing by! They keep the music going, mostly crazy hillbilly rock and the odd bit of live music too.<br><br>The food is surprisingly good - and there&#39;s a huge range too. I&#39;ve been known to invest in a chicken shish kebab with a side or taramasalata! Lord knows why, but hey, I&#39;m in Marathon and I wont be judged!<br><br>For me a night out in Camden just isn&#39;t complete without a jaunt to Marathon.... bravo.",

Having the entrance to the restaurant outside Whiteley&#39;s helps diminish the feeling of eating in a shopping mall.<br>I came with a large group in January for a much delayed Christmas party and we were well attended by the staff. I cannot fault the food. We had an amuse bouche of parmesan cream with anchovy bread, delicious. I chanced having a salmon mousse, never been a big fan and have not had one for years. This mousse was dense and creamy, covered in little brown shrimps. I really enjoyed it, but was unable to finish it, as it was quite heavy. For main I had baked radicchio with Fontina, moreish and inventive. Dessert was a slice of intense chocolate tart, with crème fraiche.<br>Most of the people dining looked like people who lunch. Lucky them.<br>They do a number of menu deals that are reasonable, especially considering its glamorous furnishings.",

Largely due to Koko&#39;s being right there. But this was my first attempt at going to El Parador. We didn&#39;t make a reservation, but were able to be accommodated in a matter of minutes, which was great. They have a good selection of Beef, Chicken, Lamb,  Veggies &amp; Seafood. Although due to lack of desire and potential of death respectively, I abstained from the last two. However, the winner of the night clearly was the SALTEADO de SOLOMILLO; which is fillet steak marinated w/ thyme, garlic &amp; cracked blk pepper with caramelised leeks, butter &amp; Ruby Port. OH EMM GEE, delicious! Followed not too far behind was the ALBONDIGAS or pork meatballs. <br><br>The pricing is incredibly reasonable, the food and service is exceptional, and the overall vibe and proximity to nightlife is great! I highly recommend this place and will hopefully return there soon.",

Towpath is along Regent&#39;s canal and all the tables are outside, so Towpath is prime real estate for soaking up some London sun. <br><br>Towpath&#39;s menu changes daily and is written on a chalkboard. My friend and I both had a dish with courgette, cannelloni beans, and saffron and it was delicious. The dish wasn&#39;t exactly what I imagined - it was hot and somewhat soup-y, but definitely tasty. We also shared a scrumptious oat, chocolate chip, and walnut cookie. Decent selection of wines and beers to supplement the food. <br><br>Lastly, the folks who work at Towpath are super friendly. <br><br>Definitely check this place out if you have a chance. Would recommend going on a warm Saturday for breakfast and then heading to Broadway Market for lunch - another foodie haven!",

"reviewcomment":"I&#39;ve been coming to this place for about 2-3 yrs. it&#39;s just had a total refurbishment after buying the shop next door.<br><br>Firstly the new restaurant looks awesome, it&#39;s kept the old French style decor but it&#39;s double the size. They have used the new space for more seating and also added a small cafe area which serves coffees and crepes. Brilliant idea.!<br><br>The food is lovely, I had mussels to start with a cream and vegetable sauce and rib eye steak with chips for mains. Steak was cooked just wright. <br><br>My girlfriend had duck in a French style sauce which looked lovely. <br><br>The menu also consists of many traditional French courses I.e snails, frog legs. <br><br>The portions are perfect and the service was very quick considering the restaurant was 85% full. <br><br>The prices are good given the restaurant is in a nice part of islington, North London. £13 for the rib eye steak <br><br>I will defo be returning.!!!!!",

"reviewcomment":"#1 on the London Bridge to Tower Bridge Ale Trail, The Old Thameside Inn is located of course alongside the Thames and Sir Frances Drakes Pirate Ship! <br><br>That said, the amazing outdoor seating is dampened by the smell...of the really cool old boat (can&#39;t be helped sigh) and the Thames itself, but that&#39;s not a surprise. Once you&#39;ve carefully used the old, scary steepish stairway from the Bridge, walk down the street and around the corner you will find this large, comfortable place to drink, but not eat. <br><br>To be honest I know better than to eat at any of the Nicholson pubs. As stated in The Cambridge review, I met my BF when he was working at one, thus giving me the details about the food service that I rather not know. Only exception to the rule for the both of us is De Hems, check my profile for that one. <br><br>What I love about the Old Thameside Inn is the seating atmosphere provided. It&#39;s gorgeous inside and out. Kind of dungeon-y with iron castings and old school spiral stairway, there is always going to be plenty of space to enjoy yourself as long as you get there at the right time. Like the nearby Mudlark they too serve a green type of beer. It looks like it&#39;s from the river itself. Awesome. <br><br>While actually doing the ale trail, my mates BF and our other male friend received t shirts and stamps while we were there. We were only on our third pub! My friend and myself were so jealous that they were given extras while we were ignored, but also enjoyed the fact that the bartender was kind enough to reverse the stereotype. <br><br>When it grew too chilly to stay outside we went downstairs and sat feeling posh amongst the dim lighting on the leather seats. It&#39;s a strange pub that appears to be super old but swanky at the same time. It succeeded in providing us with a wonderful atmosphere to have a pint. <br><br>In reading the other reviews I&#39;d agree with them although I haven&#39;t tasted the food so I can&#39;t really say. This place is great for groups, bad I guess for eating, no wheelchair access and the bathrooms were fabulous. <br><br>Take what you will from the reviews, but if anything just go a pint, that&#39;s all pub should really do for us anyway.",

"reviewcomment":"I honestly don&#39;t understand the poor reviews this place has been getting (well, to be fair, the bad reviews are going back more than a year).<br><br>I&#39;ve been here 4-5 times, and every single time, these guys have hit it waaaaay out of the park. Home run, each and every time. Ok, enough with the sports metaphors.<br><br>Before I get into the food, let&#39;s talk about the decor for a minute; this place looks sleek, it&#39;s all wood, looks super modern, and it&#39;s got this long communal bar height table in the centre... which is usually where I like to sit if I&#39;m with a +1; larger groups might want their own sit down table. Little tip... the bathroom is hidden against the right wall... the door is seamless blended into the decor. Clever. And disturbing.<br><br>The food here is excellent; I&#39;ve had a fair amount of Vietnamese food, either on Kingsland Road, or in Highbury, and this place has got it right. In my multiple trips here, I&#39;ve had the:<br><br>- Fresh prawn summer rolls: nicely balanced, good size prawns, the rice paper is not too thick that it sucks all the saliva out of your mouth, and not too thin that it falls apart the moment you pick it up with chopsticks. Always a nice choice.<br>- Prawns &amp; Pork Crispy Pancake: not too greasy, and just so good with that fish sauce, sweet chili and vinegar dressing... just needs some bigger pieces of lettuce and some more mint leaves for garnish.<br>- Grilled Beef in Betel Leaf: for me that is the star of the menu... this dish is totally out of control, the explosion of taste from the betel leaf, which is not overbearing and blends so well with the barbequed beef, I&#39;m drooling on my keyboard as I write this. This dish is a MUST HAVE.<br><br>- Grilled Seabass with Sweet Chilli Sauce: This dish looks impressive, unfortunately for me this was the most disappointing thing I&#39;ve had; not because it doesn&#39;t taste good, but more because it is not deboned, which makes this a difficult one to eat. I love fish, but have always had a thing with fish bones. But it comes wrapped in a banana leaf, is soooo fragrant, and the pieces you do get without bones are soooo good! So if you&#39;re fearless, you&#39;ll like this. If you&#39;re like me, you might pass or ask for them to fillet it for you (don&#39;t know if they&#39;ll do that).<br>- Shaking Beef: Pretty good, nice little pieces of steak, but nothing out of the ordinary.<br><br>- Stir-fried Rau moung - morning glory with garlic sauce: interesting vegetable, never had it before; it looks and tastes healthy :)<br><br>All this washed down with a 12£ bottle of sauvignon blanc. Not too bad.<br><br>If you ask me, this place is awesome with appetizers... the mains are a bit hit and miss... but I usually order so many appetizers that the main doesn&#39;t usually &#39;take over&#39; the meal.<br><br>I&#39;ll keep coming back here, for sure.",

But last Sunday I had a huge craving for noodles and, to my surprise, it&#39;s actually quite hard to find good veggie noodles in Soho. <br><br>So I did the &#39;no shit Sherlock&#39; thing and headed over to China Town. I was with a fellow veggie and he suggested hitting up Plum Valley. All in all, the food was good and they had more veggie options than most places. They even did a really decent ficken (fake chicken) which had that crispy/chewy texture that I miss. Service was nice, we had a lovely seat by the window and food was good - hence 4 stars.<br><br>It might not be very authentic, and if that&#39;s what you&#39;re after, it&#39;s worth going elsewhere, but Plum Valley is a pretty safe choice.",

"reviewcomment":"First things first, I was here last year and had the rabbit, which is now ruined for me. Because after you&#39;ve eaten at The Square, whatever type of meat/seafood you ate there will forever make you a snob. That&#39;s right, I can not eat rabbit anywhere else now, because they rocked my world.<br><br>The restaurant atmosphere is sophisticated and very formal. There&#39;s a dress code in place, and eating was a little stiff. This isn&#39;t the type of place that would welcome walk-ins. <br><br>The starter bread was delicious, as they come around with a selection for you to chose. The appetizers were delightful and beautifully arranged, and light enough that you wouldn&#39;t worry about filling up fast.<br><br>Then you have your main course. This place is michelin rated for a reason. The balance of flavors was wonderful, they give you just enough to satisfy, but not enough to gorge yourself on.<br><br>And then the dessert was a light touching after. Perfectly balanced. <br><br>Go, dress up, eat, and enjoy. You don&#39;t eat a meal like this every day, it&#39;s something to be savored and really a pleasure to have dined here.<br><br>Also, even though I&#39;m not big on wine. The list was superb.",

Fantastic, because it&#39;s like a miniature version of custard heaven.<br><br>The patisserie/bakery is part of a little Portuguese ghetto - with the Lisboa Delicatessen shop right across from it and a little Portuguese stationary shop right next to it. Don&#39;t expect anything posh or fancy - it&#39;s a down-to-earth bakery, where real people eat real custards, so to speak. <br><br>In order to make the best out of this place, I suggest two options: <br><br>1) You come here on multiple occasions, as there&#39;s so many different things that will tempt your palette. You simply can&#39;t eat all of it in one visit, but you simply have to try most of it!<br>2) You talk to your bosses and persuade them to host a Portuguese Happy Hour - that way you can buy a variety of lots of different pastries and you get to sample a lot! (This was the option that I went for.)<br><br>I really love this place - but I suggest you come by on a non-weekend day, as the crowds are simply off-putting.",

"reviewcomment":"My favorite place to go in Chinatown.  The restaurant is really tiny, so there is usually a queue by the door, but usually half of the people waiting are waiting on takeaway orders.<br><br>A HK-cafe style (茶餐廳) restaurant, that also does good Malaysian style hawker food.  My favorite thing to get here is the Malaysian rice noodles in egg sauce (滑蛋河).  They come out in a giant bowl full of seafood, fish cakes, pork, charred rice noodles, swimming in an eggy sauce.  They give you a small dish of chilis to dump in as you please.  Their roast pork (燒肉) and bbq duck (燒鴨) are also excellent. <br><br>My only disappointment is that they do not open before noon on weekends.  This isn&#39;t any different than most of the other Chinatown restaurants, but it still annoys me.  Aren&#39;t Chinese restaurant owners typically known for being industrious?  If I find myself lurking around Chinatown before noon and starving, I&#39;ll usually go next door to Old Town 97.",

"reviewcomment":"This is a real Lebanese restaurant. What I mean by this, is that most non Lebanese will think it is too fancy for a Lebanese. But actually the place is packed with Lebanese people, looking for the real fancy Lebanese experience out of Lebanon.<br><br>You&#39;ll find the staff speaking all languages completely mixed up, service quick and friendly, and plenty of staff for even the tiniest table ;-)<br><br>As for the food, it&#39;s good quality, tasty (though not amazing)<br><br>What made it loose a star for me is that it was quite expensive for Lebanese food.",
