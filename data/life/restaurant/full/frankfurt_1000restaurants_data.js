"reviewcomment":"Perhaps I&#39;m not as with it as I used to be,* but I&#39;ve never heard of Vapiano. Apparently it&#39;s an international chain. I only knew it served pasta, and I was ravenous and walking by.<br><br>Upon entering, some guy just handed me a card of some kind and jabbered at me in German. Not wanting to seem like more of a moron than I am, I just nodded and walked past. Apparently the cards are like those punchcards you get at Katz&#39;s: the staff records what you ordered and you check out at the end. (Don&#39;t lose the thing, or you&#39;re going to owe them $50.)<br><br>In any case, you get in line, grab a tray and then order from one of the a la minute cooks. There&#39;s pizza and pasta, but I usually avoid pizza outside of NYC because I eat entirely too much pizza in NYC. You can choose from a host of different types of pasta, and then you choose your sauce combination from four different price tiers. The cook then makes it all happen in a [traditional Italian] wok. You then go grab a seat wherever you can find one, and stuff your face.<br><br>Strange ordering system aside, I see this chain taking America by storm because it&#39;s a fat man&#39;s DREAM. I know this, because I was even satisfied by the enormous portions, although the drastically overdressed salad turned me off a bit. However, the bread was excellent, the fresh pasta of surprisingly high quality, and the sauces we chose were not half bad. It is a cafeteria atmosphere, but the prices are correspondingly cheap, and I do like the touch of having fresh basil and rosemary on the tables for your use. <br><br>I&#39;m generally not a fan of chains of any kind, but I&#39;ve had much worse meals for much more money, and I&#39;d do it again. <br>_____________<br><br>*I used to be with it, but then they changed what &#34;it&#34; was. Now what I&#39;m with isn&#39;t it, and what&#39;s it seems weird and scary to me.",

Like other reviewers have said I would just go with the staff&#39;s recommendations, especially if you don&#39;t speak German. We had delicious lamb, spicy chicken, lentils, vegetables, potatoes and spinach. It&#39;s all piled on a round plate over yummy crepes you just use to grab everything with your hands -- no utensils required. <br><br>Besides the food, the atmosphere is another big draw. It really feels like you&#39;re in Africa, immersed in the culture. And definitely not in a cheesy way. Just go see for yourself!",

"reviewcomment":"A friend of mine put me onto Cafe Karin and I&#39;m eternally grateful to her. It&#39;s just downright cozy, a bit like Chaos in Darmstadt, it has that shabby look. It offers the obligatory good cup of coffee (and a wide choice to keep me coming back) and if you have achey cakey pangs, they have a nice selection. Believe it or not if I&#39;m there in the afternoon I often have a mint tea instead of coffee (it&#39;s packed with fresh mint).<br><br> Admittedly, It&#39;s not right in the center, but it&#39;s worth the stroll. You can sit outside, if you don&#39;t mind the occasional insane motor cyclist whizzing past and if you can grab a seat.<br><br> The only downside is that they have stopped serving food a couple of times I&#39;ve been there. There seems to be a twilight hour in the late afternoon. Other than that it&#39;s great for breakfast, dinner and lunch.",

"reviewcomment":"The night before we were leaving Frankfurt, a local we met gave us a recommendation to go to the Best Worscht in Town.  I love spicy food, and the thought of 10 different levels of chili and a variety of toppings on sausage piqued our interest.  We walked all around town looking for this place, we asked some people for directions and they all sent us in the wrong way.  It was almost time for us to go to the airport but I wasn&#39;t ready to give up yet.  We ended up taking a cab here and let me tell you, the experience was worth all the wandering, wrong directions, and even the cab fare.  <br><br>It was Tuesday afternoon around lunch time, there were only about 5 people on the line ahead of us.  When I finally reached the front of the line, I froze and didn&#39;t know what to get - there were many options.  The staff was helpful, funny, and friendly.  I explained that I enjoy my food spicy, they asked me to try level C on a french fry (oh boy! that was spicy) and I was glad I didn&#39;t pretend to be a superwoman and order level F without asking.  You get to choose if you want beef or pork sausage.  We wound up getting level B+ and it was perfect with a side of fresh, delicious fries.<br><br>You take your food to the side where you can eat it standing up under the canopy on a counter, everyone there were enjoying their food.  Snack Point gives you a lot of sauce with the sliced sausage, but it seemed customary to finish every last drop.  People were dipping their fries in the sauce and licking their plates clean.  It really was that good.  <br><br>We were full after our sausage and fries but I couldn&#39;t help myself to make another order and take it to go, this time I got level B+ with cheese - I ate it a few hours later on the plane back to JFK.  I wish I could&#39;ve had more than one meal here, definitely worth the trek and was one of the highlights of my weekend in Germany.  Thanks :)",

"reviewcomment":"Indeed the best gelateria in Frankfurt, at least among those I am aware of. Not the best gelato in the world, but certainly very good and seems to be made of natural ingredients. Flavours are therefore not very pronounced. Price/quality relationship is good, especially for Frankfurt: one gelato kugel costs 1 euro, but they make much bigger kugels than typical eiscafes in Germany.<br>Selection of flavours is reasonably wide and includes all the classics (for gelaterias in Germany).<br><br> On the negative side: somewhat remote location (3 mins by foot from U5 station Musterschule), not very friendly service and longish lines at peak times (e.g. when I visited on Saturday evening the line was more than 10 meters long).<br><br> Overall the best gelato in Frankfurt at a reasonable price.",

But it&#39;s the basic you&#39;ll like, with good quality ad good quantity. Not gourmet cousine, right, but good.<br>The place is really nice, with a high ceiling and all the walls covered by black and white photos of Italian movie stars of the past.

The coffee is good and they serve the best croissants I&#39;ve ever had in Germany (close your eyes and you could be in France), which is why I keep going back.<br><br> Cocktails are good and the way they save electricity of an evening is quite funny, if you&#39;re not expecting all the lights to go out it might be a bit of a shock. However, the rest of the food on offer is barely ok, having tried several things off the menu, I stick to the tapas if I&#39;m extra hungry.",

I prefer ketchup and mayo. There are many other varieties of burgers, side dishes and dips and even vegetarians will find something tasty to eat (e.g. the Nut Burger).<br>If you like burgers you should definitely give this restaurant a try.

"reviewcomment":"I&#39;m an american traveling solo and this place is close to my hotel so I thought I&#39;d post some feedback.<br><br>First, the bar is massive. Maybe six or seven different rooms? One actual bar to order from but the bartenders are observant and the service staff is on top of it. They&#39;re all super friendly and all speak decent English so ordering isn&#39;t difficult. <br><br>Second, free Wifi! It&#39;s nice to sit outside, enjoy a good beer or glass of wine and be able to update my family with pictures, etc. <br><br>Finally, the location is great because it&#39;s right across from the train station. You can grab lunch while you wait for you train to Paris. :) <br><br>Overall, great vibe with music and TVs everywhere. Very friendly staff, reasonable prices, and great people-watching.",

"reviewcomment":"I agree with psyebbelwoi. This is the best Mexican restaurant that I have found in Germany, and it was a nice surprise for us; we couldn&#39;t get into the Mouson for a bite before the Tindersticks gig, so we went for a womble and found El Pacifico on the corner. We thought we&#39;d been a bit unlucky again, as it seemed full when we walked in (a good sign of course), but not to worry, they have another section to the side. Just past the giant lizard (no - I hadn&#39;t had a drop).<br><br> They have a nice wine list, you can order by the glass. The atmosphere is friendly and welcoming and you don&#39;t feel crammed in. Beyond the giant lizard the decor isn&#39;t OTT, oh and I loved the tables.<br><br> The hot chicken wings were the best we&#39;ve had in a long time, and yes they were spicy. :) My chicken burrito was delicious, it was spicy and no one had attempted to drown it in salad dressing (When will German chefs realise that salads can&#39;t swim?). Hubby&#39;s burger was good too. The only disappointment was they used Creme Fraiche instead of sour cream. It&#39;s probably the healthier option, but I don&#39;t do healthy.",

"reviewcomment":"We ended up in Frankfurt on a whim. Went to the airport and a Lufthansa flight to Frankfurt was the first one we could get on. So, off to Germany we went! However, we knew nothing coming in. Neither of us had any German language knowledge or, frankly, expectations. One of my favorite ways to do a vacation.<br><br>I observe a vegetarian diet and in countries that don&#39;t speak English or French, I pretty much accept the fact that I will suffice with some sort of bruschetta or pizza or fries. It&#39;s fine, inexpensive and I typically don&#39;t travel for the food. Spending the first evening wandering around Frankfurt, we came across this place. It looked nice enough, several tables were occupied, so we meandered in. We picked up a menu and tried to make sense of the German, when a hostess asked us something. Sorry, we&#39;re dumb Americans. She ended up having a basic English knowledge and gave us an English menu and explained how it worked! Godsend after a long day of traveling. Take a card and pick your station (pasta, salad or pizza.) Tell the cook what you&#39;d like to order, they&#39;ll make it and charge it to the card. You can also order some drinks at the stations and request bread. They also have a bar with the same swiping system.<br><br>We both opted for pasta. My friend got the carbonara and I ordered salvia, which had sage, sundried tomatoes and feta. We loved it! So much so, we returned twice more that week. It is rare that we can agree on a restaurant (for my dietary restrictions, he is way more picky than me!) and find it affordable. The second time, I had to get the pesto rosso, a tomato pesto with sundried tomatoes and ricotta, as they were out of sage and my friend got the scampi. Yep, still delicious. On the last night, we went to our originals, tried and true and still enjoyed. We ate outside one day, but it was during the summer in that heat wave that went through Europe in June, so we ate inside the other times. Booths, high seats and benches are available options.<br><br>I thought the pricing was quite fair for the concept and quality. Higher than McDonald&#39;s, for sure, but had real silverware and plates. Looked it up upon returning home and was happy to discover there are a few locations here in the States, however, browsing the menus show that my choice, the pasta salvia, hasn&#39;t quite made its way overseas yet. Here&#39;s hoping to return one day!",

Initially, I only wanted to capture the architecture up there but this nice little restaurant kept pulling me with its clean and appealing design and delicious scent.<br><br> The dishes are served with no spoon or fork. Instead, on the table there are enough pairs of chopsticks to take from. Some guests on neighboring tables chose to ask for western cutlery, though.<br><br> The waiters are very considerate, so be prepared to be asked several times, if you had ordered anything already or wanted to place your order now. My ear told me they spoke Mandarin Chinese when talking to one another, but anyway, my Thai dish was really excellent. Except the lime could have been a bit juicier. But that&#39;s very ok, given the overall taste and experience was so enjoyable to me.",

"reviewcomment":"Also ich gehe immer wieder gerne ins MoschMosch, am liebsten esse ich das thaicurry mit frischem Gemüse und Hähnchen; absolut zu empfehlen. Wenn ich das nicht esse dann meistens das Rinderfilet mit Pfefferkruste, schön Rosa innen aufgeschnitten. <br>Man kann mit Kreditkarte bezahlen und wenn man nicht zu den typischsten Essenszeiten geht, dann muss man auch nicht reservieren.<br>Egal wieviel Reste ich noch habe, ich lasse sie mit immer einpacken. Am nächsten Tag aufgewärmt schmeckt sogar noch besser ;-) <br>Wichtig ist auch zu dem am Goetheplatz zu gehen, da dieser viel größer und sauberer als der andere in der Innenstadt ist. I always like to go to Mosch Mosch, my favorite is the Thai Curry with lots of fresh veggies and chicken; I can recommend it. If I am not eating that I&#39;ll eat the beef with pepper crust; pink in the middle, cut up in pieces.<br>You can pay with credit card and if you don&#39;t want to go there in the usual eating hours you don&#39;t really have to reserve.<br>It doesn&#39;t matter how much leftovers I have, I always get a doggy bag, because if you warm it up the next day it tastes even better.<br>Just remember to go to the one on Goeteplatz because the other one is not nearly as good.",

"reviewcomment":"Gorgeous upmarket restaurant housed in a museum building which, speaking as both a romantic and a geek, I totally LOVED. Gives the whole place a very classy, elegant vibe, from the cathedral-like arching ceilings to the slick glass walls to the scenic walk to find the loo.<br><br>Cuisine is international; after a refreshingly varied bread basket we went straight to mains and I was v happy with my NY strip loin burger. Or rather &#39;burgers&#39; - it actually comes as 2 oh-so-tasty mini ones with cheese, with a baby saucepanful of chips and mayo-like dip on the side, that all together totally hit the spot after a tiring day. My colleagues had a healthier option of grilled miso salmon with an orangey marinade that got the thumbs up too. I followed with a suitably squidgy &#39;Chocolate Dream&#39; pud for dessert with cardamom and coconut ice cream, served what I call &#39;modern art style&#39; around an oversized plate.<br><br>Downside of going on a Monday = the awesome sounding sushi roll selection on the menu is only available Tue-Sat boo. Upside of going on a Monday = they have a live pianist in! Overall win I think :)<br><br>Service was top-notch and they have one hell of a wine list - our waitress was able to make a couple of recommendations, and brought over extra glasses to let all 3 of us taste a few which made me feel quite spoiled! It was this and the ambience that bumped it up to the 5th star for me.<br><br>I was lucky enough to be corporately entertained this time but otherwise you&#39;re looking at 25-40 euros for a main. Think you&#39;d probably have a very different experience in the daytime given the glass front wall, but in the evenings, by candlelight and piano jazz next to the river, this would make for a great date place. Given the prices save it for someone you want to impress ;)",

My expectations are always accordingly high.<br><br> Right. They don&#39;t save on garlic - but that is typical for the Mediterranean kitchen. Overall impressively authentic, impressively homy. No wonder, it is always packed! But the prices are fair, there are more expensive places in the neighborhood!<br>I have no reason to give less than five stars. Aside possibly from my own knowledge of the Spanish being not well enough to really value it properly.",

"reviewcomment":"This review is only for their breakfast. My husband was craving a real American breakfast. After some extensive googling, this was the best we could come up with in Frankfurt. We thought we&#39;d give it a shot.<br><br>As with most European restaurants, you just help yourself to a seat and wistfully hope a waiter notices you. Once we got the attention of a waiter, he took our order quickly. We ordered a simple breakfast of eggs, which was served with bread and butter. I wouldn&#39;t say it was a traditional American breakfast, but it did the trick. There were a few vegetarian options but not a lot. Overall, I&#39;d say that it was just okay. Their regular menu reminded me of a more limited version of a menu you would find at Ruby Tuesday. I doubt we&#39;d try it again. The location is central with limited street parking. However, there&#39;s lots of other restaurants nearby that look better. The bar is sizable, so it might be worth a stop in for a drink or two.",

I guess, it really is one of the &#34;Hot-spots&#34; in Frankfurt (- Bornheim) at least.<br><br>The location itself really looks beautiful, great interior design - definitively something for the eyes. Though it is quite dark.<br><br>The Tapas are relatively good, but not really outstanding, same thing goes for the cocktails. Since I heard so much about this place, I have to admit I was a little disappointed. Also, the service was suuuper slow!",

"reviewcomment":"We were only in Germany for 7 hours for a layover and decided to get out of the airport and head over to the city for some good German food.  I haven&#39;t been to any other restaurants in Germany so I am not quite sure how this place compares to the rest but really enjoyed the food and ambiance.  Most of the restaurants were closed when we arrived because it was already 10 pm.  However, there was still a good crowd both inside and outside of the restaurant.  Our waitress was really nice and gave us tips on what to order. We chose this delicious pizza and something else.  All I remember was the food was great.  This place had the best pizza in all of Europe.  We had just come back from Paris and Italy and the pizza we had did not even compare to this one.  It was perfectly cooked and had potatoes on top.  This restaurant experience was so positive that I can&#39;t wait to back to Frankfurt and stay longer to enjoy the good local food!!",

"reviewcomment":"This is a great and authentic Korean restaurant. The staff is always very friendly and actually you will talk more to them than in a regular restaurant, as the menu is really small (only 4 different dishes), but there is always at least the same amount of additional dishes available, which are not on the menu. Same with desert and drinks (I had a delicous bamboo tea which is also not on the menu). Korean standard dishes like Bi-Bim-Bap or Bulgogi are very good and delicious as well.<br>Worth mentioning is also the furnishing: The complete interior is made from natural wood planks (tables, floor, ceiling, walls). I liked it very much, because it does not feel as cold as many other minimalistic/modern furnished places, but more cosy.<br>I will definately come back and can recommend this place!",

Well known for After work party on Weds where there is a buffet (which I&#39;ve never actuallly located).<br><br> Anyway, typically for a dance club you may or may not encounter good (or bad) service, long waits for drinks, the usual rigamarole at the door where entry is predicated on the sorts of criteria that doormen use to regulate such things (i.e. multiple males or poorly dressed folks may not get in).<br><br> Prices are typically high for a club of this sort. You&#39;re paying to see good looking women and there are generally quite a few.<br><br> ON Edit: I tried the buffet the other night. Really awful.

"reviewcomment":"We were staying across the Main in the inner city, but a short walk across one of the bridges brought us to old Sachsenhausen, the Frankfurt neighborhood south of the Main. Walking this area&#39;s cobblestone streets, you can easily find apple wine pubs serving traditional German fare as well as Irish-style pubs and fast-food places serving Lebanese, Turkish, and other ethnic foods.<br><br>My father is from the Frankfurt area, so when my girlfriend and I visited the city, one of my goals was to have local specialties he&#39;s talked about: Ebbelwoi and grüne Soße. I was able to do this at Atschel, an apple wine pub founded in 1849 and bearing the Hessian name for a magpie.<br><br>This place is the real deal, serving Frankfurt specialties like Apfelwein (apple wine, pronounced &#34;Ebbelwoi&#34; in the local dialect), Handkäs mit Musik (a soft cheese served with vinegar, oil, bread, and butter), and grüne Soße (green sauce, made from hard-boiled eggs, vinegar, oil, salt, sour cream, and seven fresh herbs, traditionally served over potatoes).<br><br>There&#39;s probably room for a hundred people inside the tavern, which is warm and cozy due to the communal seating at long tables and wooden benches. There&#39;s also a bar if you just want to stop by for a drink. Apparently there&#39;s a garden that can seat another hundred people, but we were there on a cold February night, so we never saw that. It must be nice to sit out there on a warm summer evening.<br><br>We ordered the traditional apple wine at the bar while waiting for a spot at one of the tables. I knew it would be tart, but my girlfriend expect something more like cider, and I&#39;m afraid she didn&#39;t like it. She got the Rahmschnitzel (a schnitzel with cream sauce and mushrooms) with Spätzle, and I got the Frankfurter Schnitzel with Bratkartoffeln (roasted potatoes) and grüne Soße (the aforementioned green sauce).<br><br>The food was excellent, the portions were huge and very reasonably priced, and the atmosphere was wonderful. I finished off my girlfriend&#39;s apple wine, so I was feeling quite content by the time we left. A wonderful experience with my girlfriend, which just happened to be on Valentine&#39;s Day!",

We had been there for about 45 minutes when I saw Maki rolls apear for the first time. Consequentially, the high-priced plates led to an exceptionally high bill for us. Should I return, I&#39;ll make sure to make specific orders for the more down-to-earth offers instead of just taking what shows up by itself.<br><br> For the price we paid, I would rather go to a more comfortable restaurant.

"reviewcomment":"If you&#39;re looking for an Ungerman experience and you&#39;re tired of Starbucks, this is the place. You know this place has gotta be good if it&#39;s always full and the Sbux is less than 100 meters away.<br><br>  You can tell the co. is American because it&#39;s so ungerman and thus quite good. Not friendly, unfortunately, but who expects that in this country. <br> Free WiFi (wlan)! Where else can you sit back with your coffee or tea and surf the whole day for free? On top of that, they don&#39;t harass you, either. However, they need many more electrical outlets. 2 for the whole shop will not cut it.<br> Comfy chairs. Again, very ungerman for cafe but on par with Sbux.<br> The coffee is a rung above Sbux but nothing to write home about.<br> Bagels, Bagels, Bagels!!! Where else is an Ami gonna get his bagel fix? And they are fresh, not frozen.",

"reviewcomment":"Wer mal abseits des langweiligen Mainstreams leckere und kreative Kulinaritäten entdecken möchte, ist in der Heimat genau richtig. Die Karte ist sehr klein, bietet aber für alle Geschmäcker etwas und wechselt auch regelmäßig. Das Essen schmeckt herausragend und rechtfertigt die Preise. Die Bedienung war in meinen bisherigen Besuchen immer sehr freundlich und angenehm zurückhaltend, daher kann ich die anderen Rezensionen nicht unterstreichen. Selbst wenn wir die letzten Gäste des Abends waren, hatten wir nie das Gefühl rausgeschmissen zu werden. Der Inhaber, der azch Sommelier ist, hat uns bisher immer tolle Weine aus der Region empfohlen. Das Interieur hat einen gewissen Schick, der durch alternative Elemente auflockert. Das Restaurant ist klein und ein bisschen eng, was der Stimmung aber keinen Abbruch gibt. Durchweg eine tolle Alternative zu den wenig abwechslungsreichen Restaurants in der Frankfurter Innenstadt. <br><br>PS: Es gibt keine Cola auf der Karte!",

Neverthess, the folks running the joint are super friendly, helpful &amp; great cooks. They also speak English! The burgers are to die for. Juicy, thick, high quality beef patties with fixin&#39;s piled so high, barely got my mouth around the entire bun. The tomatoes, onions, etc were very fresh. Also, the bacon on my Otto Speck burger was crispy but not burnt. I find thier burgers a step above &#34;Die Kuh, die lacht&#34;. <br>I recommend also because the have free wifi for paying customers. The only problem I believe they&#39;ll need to overcome is their location, which is on the back side of Alt Sachsenhausen. Unless you know it&#39;s there, I imagine it&#39;ll be hard for many of the partiers to find. Nevertheless, I predict there are lots of officeworkers nearby that will flock to this place for lunch.",

"reviewcomment":"My experience with Thai restaurants in Germany has generally been quite bad. Most aren&#39;t even run by people from Thailand, and many that are are still low quality, or at least the food is made so bland to match the Germans&#39; taste buds that it just isn&#39;t interesting anymore.<br><br> Koh Samui is a very pleasant change from all that. I haven&#39;t eaten at any other Thai places in Frankfurt, but it&#39;s certainly better than the ones in Freiburg. Not quite on the level of the best Thai I&#39;ve had in the States, but still very good. The interior is cozy and inviting, and the service was friendly, attentive, and quick. The food was tasty, and the dishes they call spicy actually are. My Tom Yam Gai soup was very good, and the Gai Kea Mao was nice as well. Very spicy. Although I did ask for a Pad Kea Mao, which should have those wide noodles, and I received rice instead. The Thai iced tea was also delicious, though the glass is filled half-way with ice. I would recommend trying it without milk.<br><br> Perhaps the best thing about this place, as another reviewer mentioned, is that they have a reduced-price mid-day menu which is extensive and available every day except for Sunday from 10am to 6pm! My Tom Yam was only 2.50, for example, and the main courses (on the Mittagskarte) run between 7 and 8 euros for the most part.<br><br> So this place is worth a visit in any case, especially for lunch or early dinner!",

Most food is from Turkey or produced by Turkish companies in Germany. There are a few German and Middle-Eastern brands as well. While their products are good, the greens are not always the best quality, though always for a reasonable price. There is a bakery section too, but no alcohol.",

We paired it all with a really excellent Bernhard Koch Reserve Chardonnay and met some super kind and gracious locals who went so far as to drop 2 bottles of wine by our hotel the next morning because they wanted to share some German wine with us.<br><br>If you find yourself in Frankfurt and hungry for something outside the traditional German cuisine, I highly recommend Rama V.",

"reviewcomment":"First, the positive: the food is great! Pizza the way they make it in Italy and all the other dishes are to be recommended. The service is very good, considering how full the place always is. Decoration, layout, surroundings, and location are all very pleasant. Prices, for Frankfurt, are acceptable.<br>And now the BIG negative (and the reason I&#39;m deducting 3 stars): the music is entirely too loud! Table conversation is next to impossibleone has to shout to be heard. The guests at the other tables are all shouting to each other as wellthe manager is shouting to the waiters &amp; waitresses and they shout to each otherall this creates an ungodly din! When asked if she could turn the music down, the waitress informed us that this wasn&#39;t possible because it&#39;s programmed to be loud when there are a lot of guests and not quite so loud when fewer guests are there. This leads me to believe that their motto is: Eat.Pay.Get out! Profit, not the guests well-being, is No. 1 priority here. Sad",

"reviewcomment":"The Zeil is the main shopping street in Frankfurt. It is very long: starting almost at the ZOO and going through to the Alte Oper (if you assume Fressgass is a part of it of course). All around you are shops and shops and more shops. It is not as expensive as Goethestrasse but still it has some very good shops. Be warned it is crowded during each time of the day. Especially on the weekends it is hard to walk, biking is virtually impossible although some extreme sport fans might actually enjoy it. During the weekends and the evening there are also many street musicians and artists so it is quite cool to go there and listen to music and watch the crowd go by. As a tourist it is a must place, but you are probably going to pass through it one way or the other it is regarded as the center of the city.<br>cheers",

We went for India food vs. steak though and we ordered beef vindaloo, tandoori prawns. Both were really yummy and felt authentic flavors. probably the best we have had in a while, for sure while in Frankfurt. Had 1/2 of a bottle of wine (Spanish) and it was also really tasty. I have been trying to find a wine like that at the local stores but no luck. BUT, I have to agree that this is expensive, specially when the average indian food is always pretty good and much, much more affordable. I would go back for a nice dinner, but will be hard to convince my husband for the price tag.",

It was my first time eating sushi that comes on a conveyor belt..I was quite excited :D<br><br>As expected, with that type of business model, you&#39;re not going to get the best quality. The guy cuts the sushi in the middle space inside of the conveyor belt. However, the actual product looks pretty much nothing like the photo. If you don&#39;t see what you want, you can order with the waitress..if you can get her attention. Things like edamame and dessert are by request.<br><br>The front area seats about 20ish? They do have a private room in the back that seats 6-8, but they have to then cart the pieces to put on that separate conveyor belt.<br><br>Not bad for the price, but the quality is just really not great..and I guess I&#39;ve been spoiled by the superb quality of the places in New York.",

Nice Asian decor, clean and friendly service.  Reasonably priced for less than €20 per person for lunch.  Good stuff, check it out, I don&#39;t think you&#39;ld be disappointed",

"reviewcomment":"Arguably the finest stake house in it&#39;s price tag. The food is fresh and tasty. The location perfect. In the middle of the fressgass near the fountain. The menu is quite big and honestly I haven&#39;t tried everything, but the things I have are very very good. In the summer it is very practical to sit outside as they have tables virtually on the street, so you can watch the people go by and enjoy the evening. however, I have noticed that sitting outside increases the time they need to serve you, thus have it mind and don&#39;t get frustrated. They offer also quite good Spanish wines, so try them. <br>cheers",

"reviewcomment":"At first I was a bit put off by the brunch price (19.90 pp, drinks extra) but when my girlfriend and I got there, we could see what you&#39;re paying for. There is a large round table where you can pick from a wide selection of cold foods -- cereals, cut fruits, bread rolls, bread, cheeses, salads, lox, and some sauces (like a tasty green pesto). The selection of cheeses isn&#39;t large by any means, but the ones they have are quite good. At least on our visit, they had a nice Camembert, a feta, and the delicious Tête de Moine on a girolle.<br><br> If that&#39;s not enough for you, though, there&#39;s a chef&#39;s station where you can get eggs cooked to order. They even have bacon there! There&#39;s also some French toast as well, but I didn&#39;t try it.<br><br> The cafe is located in an atrium which gives it somewhat of a cold feel, but the modern decor still keeps it pleasant. And with the large windows, a lot of light flows in -- it&#39;s a nice start to the day. Though I wasn&#39;t hung-over, so maybe not everyone would agree. It&#39;s also conveniently located directly next to the Dom/Roemer U4 stop, so you don&#39;t have to do too much walking around the city if it&#39;s a cold day.<br><br> I also have to mention the bathrooms briefly -- for some reason, the proprietors decided to buy the latest, highest-tech bathroom equipment but I think they went a bit far. The bathroom is not maintained to the perfect, pristine quality one might expect from such a pricey establishment and the toilet with 20 buttons on it just seems silly in that context.<br><br> All in all, though, it&#39;s a great place to take a girlfriend for a Sunday morning treat if you like spoiling her. But come with a big appetite and the discipline to take small portions of more items rather than large portions of a few, or you&#39;ll find it&#39;s not worth the price!",

Then we choose the Sama Bento (34 sushi for 20 EUR) which came nicely decoratet on a big plate and could feed two hungry people very well. The sushi was fresh and had a great variety and good rice. For drinks we had the Grüner Tea (green jasmin tea, 1,50 EUR). The staff was very friendly. So in summary I can fully recommend the Sama Sushi to every sushi fan.",

"reviewcomment":"This has to be my favourite place to eat in Frankfurt and surroundings, and if I could, I would give it 6 stars. The food served is rustic German, with a particular focus on Hessian specialities such as Grüne Sosse (a fresh sauce made from a number of herbs and sour cream), Rippchen (boiled ribs) and Bratkartoffeln (sautéd potatoes). The rustic aspect comes across not only in the tasty type of food served but also the portion sizes, which are absolutely enormous. The menu is extensive, with all sorts of meat, fish and vegetarian dishes, as well as salads and lots of desserts. You should definitely order a jug of local apple cider to accompany your meal. Also make sure to visit the Lahmer Esel in summer, so that you can take full advantage of the wonderful beer garden at the back, which is particularly suited to families with children. Service is usually very quick and prices are very reasonable. Easy to reach by public transport (take the U3 to Niederursel) or by car. Altogether, a wonderful place!",

The appetizers comprised of good varieties of authentic Japanese dishes and the teppanyaki dishes are definitely worth to try..

So imagine my surprise when I was invited to dinner (admittedly this was last summer - so apologies for the late posting - but I actually went back again for more in the winter).<br><br>I can&#39;t really describe the menu as a particular genre. It&#39;s modern European cuisine I guess as I had duet of chanterelles with baked parsley powder in two jars (read posh mushroom soup - both visits) and honey truffled ravioli with walnuts and porcini on visit 1 and a vegetarian lasagne on visit 2. <br><br>The taste was BIG but the portions were SMALL and the price, somewhere in the middle of EXPENSIVE. I can&#39;t fault service though as it was attentive and sitting out on the veranda in the evening sun of August was relaxing. Sitting by the window in the winter, less satisfying but a lot warmer!<br><br>All in all it works out to be around €50 a head plus wine, which isn&#39;t exactly cheap, but then when in Germany there are wurst (ahem) places to eat!",

"reviewcomment":"My coworker and I were going to head out after we checked into our respective rooms to work off the jet lag.  After we unpacked, both of us decided to take a little nap.  That little nap ended up being a 3 hour snooze.  It was around dinner time, and I called my coworker on plans for dinner.<br><br>Met at the lobby of our hotel.  Asked the concierge if there were any places within walking distance for dinner.  He suggested walking towards this one neighborhood with a good variety of restaurants.<br><br>The snow stopped falling, and the streets were covered with snow.  It was cold, not windy, and there were a lot of people walking about the neighborhood heading out from their work places.<br><br>There are lots of restaurants around Leipziger Strasse, and the surrounding streets.  We walked down one of the side streets and found this place.  It looked warm, cozy, and very welcoming inside.  We figured we&#39;re going to have lots of good German food for the next few days, so we decided to give this place a try.<br><br>At 6PM, this place wasn&#39;t full yet, so we were able get a table.  Our server spoke little English, and we spoke little German or Italian.  Fortunately, he gave a set of menus in English.<br><br>Bread arrived at the table, and our server came back to take our orders.  I can&#39;t remember what my coworker ordered, but here&#39;s mine (Sorry few pics, too hungry to stop and snap away):<br><br>-Insalata Mista:  a mixed green salad, cucumber, tomato, carrots, red peppers.  Everything was very fresh, nice vinaigrette.<br><br>-Pork loin with Gorgonzola:  the pork loin was very moist.  Gorgonzola nicely covered the pork loin.  Nice balance of flavors.  Gorgonzola didn&#39;t over power.<br><br>-Panna cotta (<a href='http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/0im6GA2LCkkH5Js3Gkq_2A?select=CSHAY8bW9jgIJF4V7LTjjw'>yelp.com/biz_photos/0im6…</a>):  Nicely presented.  Panna cotta was on top of a pool of zambione, with sliced strawberries.  Sweet, dense, and smooth.  Nice.<br><br>Everything was well prepared and tasty.<br><br>The servers were very friendly and welcoming.  They checked on us every so often to make sure we were OK.  By the time we were about to leave, the restaurant was very full and bustling.<br><br>Nice little find!",

"reviewcomment":"In 5 days of drinking around Frankfurt the Black Fox Bitter was by far the best beverage I had. That is not to diss the other drinks, it is just really really tasty. I said so many complimentary things about it I actually received a complimentary pint of the stuff! The Amber Ale they serve was quite good too.<br><br>This was my second visit to the pub, almost exactly 10 years after my first. It still looked quite familiar.<br><br>I could have done with eating here but didn&#39;t want to because a local friend had a recent horror story about a meal gone wrong here. They do beer better than food I guess.",

"reviewcomment":"A trusted little Frankfurt Fellow recommended me this place as my better half and I looked for a good spot to spend the evening with some family &amp; relative members of his, the group originaly consisted of 5 adults (one pax  cancelled) with age range between 30 to 60 and 3 children under 12 yo,  during our short gateway in Frankfurt City. To make it even more complicated, it was the at the Final Night where Munich played Chelsea London at the Champhion Leaque.<br>-<br>As we didnt want to push our luck, we followed his advice and booked the table rite away.<br>-<br>It was empty at the restaurant area as we approached the venue, but well it was the big demonstration day (Blockuppy Frankfurt) where most of the streets and roads in and around Frankfurt City Center were closed and filled with tanks and police cars. (  But to ease your worry,  it was around 30 cheerfull pax having a very good time by 830 PM ).<br>-<br>The male staff guarded us to our table and nicely turned down the volume of the screen for our convinience. I grabbed the stylish silver menu card which looks like a bulletin (what a creative thoughts of having the menu n newsletter in one!!!)  and tried to find a cool start up.<br>-<br>Later on as we studied the card the staff said due to the Football Match they only served a selected menu with exceptional Pasta for the kids.<br>-<br>After putting my first cocktail order (hey, its happy hour from 5-8 PM : 5 bucks for any cocktails) I spelled my wish to get the Entrecote with Salad which turned to be hmm... nice! (that lil Frankfurt guy I mentioned at the beginning told us that MEAT is a must at this place). Generous size and premium quality, so the sassy missy was quite happy with the juicy Steak I guess. :P<br>-<br>How about the rest of our troop? The Kiddoz were spoiled by the homemade pasta (of course selfmade noodle - presented in front of their very eyes!) and my Folks enjoyed their Roastbeef happily.<br>-<br>As the night was stil very young, one by one, starting from the youngest member, we went to the front room/bar ordering and watching the live show of the most creative ice cream creation in Frankfurt (correct me if Im wrong).<br>-<br>I know you guys started to be bored with my fairy tale, so lemme sum up n end it with this:<br><br>+ Ultra friendly staffs! They just knew how to treat us rite, from the youngest to the most goodlooking. ;-)<br><br>+ Simple but pretty ambiance (minimalist)<br><br>+ Nice food (esp. Steak &amp; Ice Cream) &amp; Fair/Moderate Price<br><br>+ Nom nom Cocktails too<br><br>+ Strategic location<br><br>-<br>How the night ended???<br>As I have never been a fan of Munich, the evening couldnt have turned any better eventhough Chelsea didnt really deserve the cup. ;-) I left the venue hand in hand with my very love, rushed away walking in the pouring rain and jumped up into the cab with a secret wish : &#39;till we meet again&#39; ...",

"reviewcomment":"Osaka is a very nice chinese buffet with sushi and mongolian grill. It&#39;s quite small, but they make the most of the space by using smaller steamer trays on the hot buffet. I actually think this is a good idea because the food seems fresher.<br><br> The sushi was actually very appealing for a buffet. I had many items, and was pleased with the quality. Next to the sushi was a wide range of asian salads such as kimchi and bean sprout salad.<br><br> They also have a mongolian grill with all the ingredients you would expect. However, the grill chef only seems to come out from the kitchen when there are a few plates for him to cook. Once, we waited about 10 minutes for our plates to be prepared.<br><br> Our Japanese waitress was incredibly nice and prompt with service. She had limited English skills, but was very interested in learning from us how to say various words.",

Love the fresh healthy menu, and it has a cosy contemporary feel. I saw it described as &#34;yuppified&#34; and that&#39;s about right except it isn&#39;t a bad thing at all!

"reviewcomment":"This place was awesome. Some background first: I speak and read a bit of German, but am certainly nowhere near fluent. <br><br>I wandered into this place because someone had recommended it, saying the food is really good, akin to home cooking. I walked in and realized I was COMPLETELY out of my element--I didn&#39;t understand a word anyone around me was saying. <br><br>The restaurant was crowded, every seat was taken. I kind of stood by the bar, where two men were running back and forth to the tables, taking orders, bring out food, etc. Finally, one turned to me and asked in German, &#34;How can I help you?&#34; In a small voice, in my broken German, I said hesitatingly, &#34;A table for one, please.&#34; He stared at me, told me, &#34;One moment,&#34; and ran into the kitchen to get his coworker who spoke English. <br><br>I got seated at a communal table--on one side were a group of men in their 50s and on the other, a couple of women. The server handed a handwritten menu. Now, I can read enough German to read a menu, but for some reason couldn&#39;t make out the handwriting. I stared and asked the server (the one who didn&#39;t speak English), &#34;What&#39;s &#39;spargel&#39;?&#34; The women on my right piped up, &#34;That&#39;s asparagus.&#34; I smiled and said thank you, and the server walked off while i perused the menu...<br><br>He came back and asked me what I would like. I asked for some more time, and he looked at me, told me to follow him. So I did...<br><br>And he proceeded to walk me around the entire restaurant, smiling and pointing at other patrons&#39; plates, basically giving me a visual menu: &#34;This is chicken! With potatoes!&#34; &#34;That&#39;s steak! With potatoes!&#34; (There were a lot of potatoes. And asparagus.) The other diners, after looking confused for a few seconds, realized what was going on and sat back with benevolent smiles on their faces, amused at the lost American girl. <br><br>My face turned bright red, I smiled and hastily chose the steak and potatoes and sat back down, where i proceeded to have a great conversation with the group of men on my left, debating whether American or European politics were more messed up. <br><br>All in all, a great night at a place with great food and great people. I would definitely love to go back here if I&#39;m in Frankfurt again.",

"reviewcomment":"Sehr leckeres türkisches Restaurant. Wir waren zum ersten mal hier und obwohl wir mit einem Barometer-Gutschein kamen wurden wir sehr nett bedient. Das Lamm war Super lecker und die Speisen gut gewürzt. Das Baklava war ebenfalls super. Alles in allem ein toller Abend. <br>Great Turkish restaurant. We were here the first time and although we had a barometer-coupon we were treated really nice. The lamb was really good and the meals were spiced generously. The homemade baklava was also really good. All in all a very nice evening.",

"reviewcomment":"French, seafood, expensive, downtown Fft.<br><br>It belongs to the Mook Group which means people either love it or hate it.  As with other restaurants in the group it&#39;s a statement kind of place... see and be seen, and not cheap.<br><br>On to it though.  The decor and ambiance is perhaps just a tad more Las Vegas than real French.  Lovely old building they brought back to life (they deserve some credit).  Was there with the oenophile, Mrs, S.  Foie Gras app was outstanding.  Boudin burger was a clever id.Just the plain Boudin Noir would have been better though.<br><br>Wines were good.   Neither over or under priced.  Selection as befit the price of entry.<br><br>Mains:  Mrs S had veal cutlet with roquefort and I had lambs leg with ratatouille.  Food was well prepared, no complaints.<br><br>Our tab was around €155. We had  a cremant, a  sazerac, and a bottle of wine from the mid range.  Nice experience but not the best experience I&#39;ve had for that money.",

"reviewcomment":"Went here for dinner last night and was not disappointed. They have a small permanent menu and an innovative weekly changing menu to reflect ingredients that are in season. We tried the Conchiglie pasta with scallops, asparagus, and bufallo cheese and the duck breast with carrots, cherries and feta cheese. Both came with deliciously creamy sauces. The buffalo and feta chesses gave the dishses a rich flavor. Total damage was EUR 40 for two entrees and two non-alcoholic drinks. That&#39;s not cheap, but not overly pricey for Frankfurt either.<br><br>The interior decor was so-so. They have some kind of chair-theme going on, and you can even buy the chairs that are listed on their menu. Ironically, I didn&#39;t find their seating very comfortable. We also didn&#39;t like that they don&#39;t have an English menu on hand. That would be an easy thing to fix, if they wanted to...<br><br>Reservations for this place are recommended as it gets quite packed on weekends and eve of public holidays.",

"reviewcomment":"My husband and I stayed at the Mövenpick last Saturday. We got a really good rate on the room. For a king size bed on the 4th floor we only paid 65EUR. What a deal!! The daily week price is about 200+ Euros due the hotel&#39;s close proximity to the Messe.<br><br> The best part is that they have FREE, fast WLAN in the entire building. I wish other European hotels would catch on to that concept. Once you check in you will receive a pass code and are then free to surf away.<br><br> The hotel&#39;s location is perfect. You walk 4 minutes to the Strassenbahn and with the #16 are in Sachsenhausen in about 15 minutes.<br><br> The hotel lobby is very clean, open, and inviting. I love the splash of color across the hotel. The staff was also very friendly and helpful.<br><br> There is a parking lot under the hotel but on the weekend there are a few free parking spots directly in front of the hotel.<br><br> Our room was clean and since the hotel is a couple of years old, everything was new and not worn down. The rooms look just like the pictures on the hotel website and the ones that are displayed in Qype.<br><br> We didn&#39;t eat breakfast at the hotel because I find 22EUR for a breakfast buffet a bit high. We did enjoy a drink at the bar and were greeted by a really friendly bar tender,<br><br> I highly recommend this hotel for business or leisure travel. If you book in advance (7 or 14 days) and pay in advance you receive a slight discount.",

"reviewcomment":"It was the logo&#39;s font that caught my eye. Yeah, I&#39;m kind of a font freak.<br><br> Actually, in Toronto, there is a famous dessert franchise called Just Desserts and for some reason, I had almost thought that Cafe Diesseits was just that. I guess I was hallucinating, that, and probably still jet-lagged and homesick.<br><br> It was the first al fresco cafe I&#39;ve been to after landing in Frankfurt. It was also in my neighbourhood. I was there just after the lunch crowd so I could imagine it had died down quite a bit. At this point, I was still in search of a German Pancake dessert that could beat Plazz Cafe&#39;s but unfortunately, Plazz Cafe still reigns supreme with their Palaschinken. Cafe Diesseit&#39;s palaschinken was too thin for my liking but besides that, it was plated really pretty-like on a bubbled glazed blue plate.<br><br> I pass this place every now and then in the evenings and after work and the place is teaming with people all having a great time.<br><br> They have a well stocked bar so I imagine that having a great time and alcohol seem to go hand in hand. :-)<br><br> The funny thing is, the place is diagonally right across from StattCafe and the two venues are completely different, bringing in two completely different crowds.",

The yaki mandu (korean dumplings) were heavenly....crispy and savory. The chicken bulgogi is spicy which is just the way I like it among Korean dishes. The bibimbap was a rainbow of cucumber, carrots, scrambled egg, spinach, bean sprouts, onion and beef bulgogi. Mixed with the Korean chili sauce, it offered several different but pleasant flavors with each bite. And, the kimchi, my utmost favorite part of Korean cuisine, oh it had to be 100% made for me. =) It was wonderfully fermented, just the way I like it.",

I chose only to eat the cooked items.<br><br> The mongolian grill had a wide array of raw vegetables, meat, and seafood to build your perfect plate. For those unfamiliar with how mongolian grill works in Germany, your table has clothespins on it that you attach to your plate of raw ingredients. This is how the grill chef knows which plate belongs to you because the clothespin has your table number written on it. If the grill is backed-up with orders, you can just leave your plate behind and a waitress will bring it to you when it&#39;s cooked.",

"reviewcomment":"What a really disappointing experience this was. A couple of people have told me that the CCG had good, authentic food. Maybe, I have no idea about Spanish food, but the few times I&#39;ve been to Spain, even the worst places I&#39;ve been to were better than this. Why? The Tortilla Jamon was nothing more than scrambled eggs with Jamon. For all I know, a Spanish Tortilla has potatos, obviously not so at the CCG. Then the potatos  French Fries. Excuse me, but what is Spanish about these? Every mediocre Tapas Bar has Batatas Bravas in the menu  sometimes mediocre-tasting as well. The French Fries at the CCG were great, but I don&#39;t need to go to a Tapas Bar for that. Admittedly, the Gambas a la Plancha and the plate with Jamon, chorizo and Manchego were good, but at this hit rate, I am sorry, I am not coming back.<br>And then the wine  yesterday was a hot summer night. They have a wonderful Rioja house wine and when it came to the table, it was warm like a Gluehwein. OK, normally red wine is served at room temperature, but if the room temperature hits 30C you&#39;d better do sth. to get the red wine chilled as well. I had to do sth. which I normally totally distaste: ask for an icecube to put it in the wine. Otherwise, it was unbearable, this way, I could at least enjoy the wine.<br>To end on a good note, the service was friendly and the place itself has a down-to-earth look, but I can not recommend coming here.",

Decor OK, service very friendly, location good, cocktails tasty.<br><br> The only thing we ate was a shared Nachos with Sour Cream, Salsa, and Guacamole.

Salsa seemed like it was also out of a jar.<br><br> Frankly the Nachos gave me no reason whatsoever to want to explore the menu further. That being said, this is a really nice place to hang out and drink. Give it 3 stars as a bar and probably only one star as a restaurant.",

No wonder, the place is a true original, wooden wine boxes as seats, the service (at the counter only, no service on the tables) always friendly, the wine recommendations good, as are the wines themselves.<br>Small snacks do not compete with a restaurant - but are yummy ;-) Bread with Salami or Cheese (decorated with salt sticks, chips and olives), a plate with cheese cubes (and olives), peanuts, such small dishes.<br><br> In summer, you can sit outside, which is on sublevel, but thanks to wonderful natural twines cover it&#39;s really cosy.

The service may be average and the tables may not be emptied as often as they should have been, but we liked the place.<br>However,the last time we went to Dulce the cafe was very full, this caused the staff to empty the tables very rarely. The toilets were also left to become very unclean. Furthermore my wifes green tea was warm and not hot and although they made us a new tea it was still just warm. She replaced the second tea with a coffee as she wanted a hot drink. The service during this visit was average and the cakes we had were ok.<br>For less money you get better food, drinks and service at World Coffee nearby and thats where we will go to",

The waiter is a real gentleman and he always kept the door open for customers, who are all German. The food and apple wine are good and we paid 20 EUR for 2 persons. That was so cheap that we decided to hang out in a expensive cocktail bar after the dinner;-).",

"reviewcomment":"Our first experience at Andalucia was not a good one.  We made a reservation for 4 at 7:30pm, and when we got there, we were told that our reservation was at 7pm.  The restaurant was full, and there were no tables available.  Nevertheless, what shocked us was the attitude of the hostess/waitress who was completely indifferent to our predicament, and when we tried to explain and question whether there may have been a mishap, she simply replied, &#34;We don&#39;t have to discuss this.&#34; ... so much for German hospitality.<br><br>However, we were glad that we did not take her belligerence personally and decided to go back because the food was absolutely delicious, and although Andalucia is known for their wonderful tapas, what I liked most was their grilled calamari steak marinated in flavorful lemon butter sauce!<br><br>Also, the cantankerous hostess we&#39;d encountered was nowhere to be found, and instead, we were waited on by a delightful waitress who was very friendly and attentive throughout the meal.  <br><br>Lesson learned, don&#39;t be deterred by bad first impression!",

When there is sports event make sure you reserve a place cuz they get full quite fast. The food is quite good especially the burger, which tastes as if homemade and it comes with fried potatoes, and the portions are quite big. They offer a lot of different types of beer and cocktails. make sure you order the long island as it is very delicious. It costs 9 EUR, thus much more expensive than at other places, but it is quite good. You can watch sports inside on a huge beamer screen or outside on a flat screen tv. either way pure entertainment is guaranteed. On the weekends it turns out into a discotheque so you can dance inside.<br>cheers",

The bar is 5 minutes walk from Frankfurt train station. You have the possibility to eat outside which is very enjoyable during the summer.<br>While eating you can watch bystanders going to the many bars and nightclubs located downtown. Since you are in the red light district area don&#39;t be amazed to see some nice ladies/dudes walking around.<br><br>The bar is nice, staff is cool. Restrooms are clean and you do have a cigarettes machine at the back (pretty common in Germany as I saw during my trip).<br><br>If you&#39;re staying around the train station for a couple of nights it is definitely a good place to eat.",

And it is within walking distance of the Schweizer Strasse, making it an ideal spot to recover from a spot of shopping.<br><br> The café offers a selection of cakes and delicatessen salads (and sometimes a soup or two), which you order and collect from the counter. Oh and you also are expected to take your used cutlery and crockery to a trolly, this place is not for the lazy!<br><br> If the weather is nice you can sit outside in the lovely garden area - seat cushions and blankets are provided in said trolleys should it be chilly.<br><br> If the weather is too dismal to sit outside, you can sit in the Liebighaus&#39;s former kitchen and hunting trophy rooms. The atmosphere is intellectual and relaxed. The café is closed on Mondays, see the provided link for opening times, and it is table service only on Sundays. Don&#39;t get there too late or else the yummy mummies will descend upon this lovely spot, screaming kids in tow.",

I think there was 7 different types of pork in this dish. <br>It was excellent and I sure was stuffed when all was said and done.<br>Funniest part was when our friends from china asked the waiter what is what in the dish and his reply was, this is pork and this is pork and this is pork and he went on saying this 7 times!! lol....",

"reviewcomment":"PLAZZ CAFÉ is one of those sidewalk venues whose atmosphere reigns &#39;European&#39;. Located at a bend on Kirchplatz and surrounded by beautiful historic buildings where flowers frame the window sills, one can tell that this is a famous spot for locals and visitors of other districts. They have plates from various cultures -Tacos Gauchos Siesta, Art Stroganoff Geschnetzeltes, and Madras-Curry are just a few of their palatable delicacies.<br><br> One of their best desserts, frankly speaking, is their Palatschinken.<br><br> This Central European Pancake is as much a feast for the eyes as it is for the tummy.<br><br> According to Wiki, the name is derived from the Latin word Placenta (a cake)! Hmmmm, not sure about the actual Latin word and I&#39;m not even going to ponder on how the word Placenta had evolved over the years.<br><br> The prices are very reasonable and they are also handicap friendly.<br><br> The place is owned by two brothers with plenty of help from family. The serving sizes of the meals are large (practically American size) and you&#39;ll always get good service.<br><br> The best thing is that they not only accept credit cards but debit cards as well, i.e. EC and Maestro.<br><br> They also have a large seating in the winter time at the side for smokers.",

"reviewcomment":"I have Turkish friends who work in the banking district who only eat here, &#39;nuf said?<br><br> The place is a little chaotic, always full of people of many nationalities. The sit down area is more stools with high tables. This makes it less a sit-down place and more transient, but also it&#39;s not uppity and you feel compelled to spend a long time there. Basically, the atmosphere is workman-like, blue-collar where lots of white-collar types come for their döner.<br><br> The meat is fresh, but the bread is made on the spot, as fresh as in an Anatolian village! They don&#39;t bake your bread until you order your meal. Wow.<br> There is also an Ayran bar, basically a tub of Ayran where the liquid is pumped out of a fountain to aerate it and create light bubbles. No store bought Ayran here, this is outstanding, homemade, and fresh the best I&#39;ve had outside Turkey but still bought in a Döner-shop.<br><br> I recommend everything on the menu, especially the soup and hot-plate items.<br><br> This is fast-food, but the only complaint I have is that they are so busy all the time, your order, if freshly baked, can take more than 15 minutes, and I&#39;ve had to remind them of döner-shops in the Ffm area, this is the only one I will specifically walk or take the subway for if I&#39;m not in the area.<br><br> SUPER Secret tip: If you&#39;re in the Hauptbahnhof area and need to use the restroom, this is the place to come. It&#39;s not eat-off-the floor restroom clean, but it&#39;s always clean and you can sneak in and out without being hassled.",

Eher zufällig war es daher auch, dass wir vor ca. 2 Jahren das erste Mal zum Frühstücken unseren Weg hierhin fanden.<br>Gleich auffällig war die etwas ungewöhnliche Kombination einiger Gerichte (z.B. Rührei mit Sucuk) sowie die nette Beratung bei der Bestellung durch den Besitzer.<br>War das Platz im Herzen dann in letzter Zeit etwas in Vergessenheit geraten, so hat es jetzt wieder an Aktualität gewonnen, da wir praktisch direkt in die Nachbarschaft gezogen sind. So kam es auch, dass wir unlängst wieder häufiger dort waren und was soll ich sagen? Immer super!<br>Sowohl die normale Karte mit Penne Platz im Herzen oder den Salaten als auch der Neujahrsbrunch waren echt toll und preislich fair.<br>Der Inhaber ist stets aufmerksam und sehr flexibel!

"reviewcomment":"Near the docks, this (man-made?) lake has a decked patio area for drinks and food and members can take a dip or canoe around the water. It&#39;s a cash only venue first and foremost. No cards or cheques (if they even have cheques these days in Germany). My friends favoured the cocktails, so the mojitos are the one to go for. But we were tempted by the smell of the grill ( after 6PM) but the kitchen was pretty disorganised and they were backed up and stopped taking orders for 30 minutes (in reality closer to an hour) to clear the backlog. <br><br>When it eventually arrived my Halloumi burger was grilled to perfection on the outside, stone cold in the middle. But I ate it and rapidly because of the flies (get some tealights with mosquito repellant and electric fly killers if you&#39;re reading this venue), that seem to be attracted to our tables (11, 12, 13 - thus proving it really is a number unlucky for some). Some fans would have been good too as the temperature was around 30 degrees. Tables to go for are the ones overlooking the lake, but we didn&#39;t realise you could reserve  tables in advance. <br><br>It&#39;s a nice escape from the usual bars in the centre of Frankfurt but I wouldn&#39;t have a clue how to get there by public transport. Parking on the Hanauer Landstr.bzw Schwedlerstrasse is free but limited. There is ample parking on Lindleystraße BUT it&#39;s pay and display 24 HOURS a DAY because of the nature of what happens around the area.",

"reviewcomment":"One of the nice places on the Bergerstrasse and unlike it&#39;s brother from the Innenstadt (behind the stock exchange), this Yours Bar is much smaller. however, what it does not have in sice makes up with entertainment. It has 2 floors, whereas the downstairs level is quite small and has 2 tables. This is because downstairs they have a Darts board and a Fusball table (Kicker table), so fans head on downstairs.<br>The upper level is one big room with some high tables, bar and then some smaller tables with soft sofalike chairs. The cool thing is that you can actually play Wii :) so Sportsbar here you go. We usually play bowling as this is the best game for a lot of people at one time and also one of the most entertaining. <br>The cocktails are OK at a standard price starting at 6 EURs.<br>check it out for yourselves.",

"reviewcomment":"I went to Mosebach for the first time in a mixed group of Frankfurt residents and foreigners. We were brought to the restaurant by a person who grew up in Frankfurt and who wanted to introduce the foreigners to a very good instantiation of the city&#39;s famous green sauce. She made a great choice! I liked Mosebach so much that, over the next week and a half, I came back twice more, bringing other people with me. Each time, I had something different and differently good: Green sauce with eggs, dumplings in a creamy sauce, and even their wild boar (I&#39;m not a strict vegetarian, apparently). The last time I was there, the waitress recommended a riesling that I enjoyed. <br><br>I found the atmosphere relaxing and inviting. The restaurant is usually lively, which gives it a warmth, but it is not overcrowded or loud. The decor has traditional elements, such as animal heads on walls and ceramic pitchers, but also amusing eccentricities of the owners. <br><br>I speak hardly any German, and this did not pose much of a problem. The waitstaff speak English and they provide English menus to those who ask. There is a lengthy list of specials written in German only, but the waitress kindly translated them for us.",

The restaurant is in the basement, so no windows. But it remembers me feel from &#39;home&#39;. This makes it so authentic. Not only the food but also the whole atmosphere makes you feel you are in China. Definitely not a place for romantic candle light dinners but for everyone who wants to taste real good Chinese hotpot. ^^<br>Price is more than acceptable for what they offer. Drinks are cheap in the new concept. Say: All you can eat and all you can drink soft drinks.",

"reviewcomment":"Perfect lunch every time. For 3.80 Euros or 5 Euros for premium dishes. You can have delicious Chinese that is cooked fresh. If you are in a hurry for lunch I highly recommend getting your meal for take away. It always looks busy and is always busy, but they work quick to get your food to you. Even at the busiest times you can usually be in and out under 7 minutes. If you have more time to spare you can wait on a table. The staff is helpful and friendly but they work fast and in such a small place you can feel &#34;in the way&#34;. The fried rice is a must try as well as the curry dishes. I recommend the Duck with Cha Sha sauce as my favorite. I have been to other Chinese take aways in town and this place cannot be beat on price and value for what you get.",

Generous portions served relatively quickly<br>2.) Off the beaten path<br>3.) Extensive menu makes multiple visits a must",

"reviewcomment":"I had an excellent business dinner here in November.  Service was top notch.  Food was excellent.  I had the monkfish.  It was superbly prepared!  The wine selection was also extensive and my French guest found a very nice Sicilian red wine quite to his liking.  This was a really nice dinner. <br><br>The only bummer was that I left my black wool coat at the restaurant by accident.  I called and spoke with the owner who confirmed that he found it in the restaurant.  I gave him the address of my German partners and he said he would make arrangements to send it to them.  One month or so passed and when my German partners followed up on the whereabouts of my coat they now say they don&#39;t have it and never had it.  This is despite the owner identifying it to me as a Ralph Lauren black wool coat.  So, what gives??!!!<br><br>Before I left the restaurant I was introduced to the owner and I showed him the Yelp app and explained that it was through his excellent reviews that I selected his restaurant.  This is my first Yelp review.  I just don&#39;t do review, but do enjoy reading others in my selection process.  This experience was really disappointing and has nothing to do with the excellent service, ambiance, and food one can enjoy at the restaurant.  It has more so with doing the right thing.  I guess my bad for forgetting my coat, but a 5-star restaurant always does the right thing by its customers.  Hence, I give this restaurant a 2-star.   Still pretty generous considering I had to go out an but a new winter coat!!!  Real bummer.",

It is mixed up with national and international franchise restaurants, which offer modern and clean dining experiences. You can get traditional  German food as well as a Burger King but also Indian food. As with many other food locations in Frankfurt, it also represents narrow space in general so it becomes easily crowded especially at here. If you have some spare time during your commute or travel and want to get something quick to eat or drink except for McDonald&#39;s, then this place is recommendable to visit.",

"reviewcomment":"My husband, 2 year old son and I decided on this restaurant for Mother&#39;s Day as a second choice. Our first choice Quattro, their sister restaurant was closed and they mentioned Il Rustico. We walked in with no reservations at about 6pm on Sunday. We were sat promptly at a little table by the window where our large jog stroller could fit easily. No high chairs, but our son is more well behaved in his stroller anyhow. The decor was rustic and casual and the atmosphere was relaxed. It never got too loud even when the place filled up.<br><br>It took awhile for someone to come over to greet us after we sat and our order to be taken, probably because our menus were still open as we took awhile to peruse our choices. Or maybe because it was early and only one server was on the opening shift. After we noticed the second server arrive, he came and took our order promptly. I ordered a glass of their house Róse, which was only €3.50, score! It was slightly fruity and delicious! Hubby had a cola. I ordered as a starter the arugula salad with thin shaved Parmesan and Parma ham. It was served With a couple slices of tomatoes and cucumbers and the arugula was drizzled with a nice light balsamic vinaigrette. My husband ordered the cheese and tomato pizza. Their dough is freshly made in house and the crust was thin, crisp and flavorful. He shared that with our son. We ordered a small side of butter penne which was served with a small container of parmesan cheese for our son but he wanted the pizza instead. My husband and I picked on the pasta which was delightful and perfectly al dente. <br><br>For our entrees, we shared the Butter  linguine tossed with freshly shaved Parmesan cheese right IN a huge cheese wheel and then topped with fresh shaved black truffle. They drizzled an oil on it, I couldn&#39;t tell if it was olive oil or truffle oil. Either way, it was the best pasta either of us had ever eaten. You MUST try it if you go here. We also shared the Truffle butter filet served with a side of roasted potatoes, steamed broccoli and steamed haricovert green beans. Half the filet was med rare and tender which is how we ordered it, the other half was medium. The medium rare part was perfect, the medium side was not as tender but still flavorful. <br><br>I didn&#39;t finish my half so we wrapped that up to go. No room for dessert so we stopped into Starbucks at the end of the street after we left and had some caramel macchiatos while we strolled around a bit. A little ways down we encountered a Dunkin&#39; Donuts and grabbed a couple. I&#39;m sure the tiramisu or any other dessert would have been fabulous! Next time perhaps. Our total bill came out to €75 and totally worth it for a special occasion. We will definitely be back. Bravo Il Rustico!",

I tried the chirashi sushi, it came with miso soup and all i can say is that the food was really good, authentic Japanese, sushi was made fresh by a real Japanese chef, the sushi rice was warm, with the right amount of vinegar and the seafood were all fresh! I would definitely take my visitors here when they are in Japanese food mode :)",

Several schnitzels, sausages, and white asparagus dishes were ordered. All were very yummy. The young girls serving had attitude and were not native German speakers. They made unprofessional comments About people at the establishment. While the food was great, the servers were ill mannered. I would go back for the food only.",

They cook extremely good and are located on Konstablerwache, thus it is 10 mins from the city and 3 mins from Roemer and the river. The location is perfect - very quiet in a small street with view on the big square in front. In summer it is extremely nice to sit outside and dine. The portions that one gets are huge (my girlfriend cannot eat it, so we usually end up taking home 1/2 of her food :)). very friendly and clean. They are open until 12am so one can go there eat and then move on to the parties around the city, I mean everything is anyway in a walking distance.",

"reviewcomment":"I&#39;ve become somewhat of a Döner skeptic. So many have told me this is the best in FFM. Come on, the BEST? Döner&#39;s pretty hard to screw up but also not hard to put out a decent, albeit average product. So on a cold, cloudy Thursday lunch, I braved it with complete hope of scoffing at all I know who praise this place.<br>Damn if they weren&#39;t right. This was the BEST Döner I&#39;ve had in a long time.<br>Why? 4 reasons.<br>1. The meat  normally, to make Döner meat flavorful, I find a large dose of salt or the sauce neccessary. Otherwise, I often find the meat somewhat bland at many other places. Here? Wow! I tried the meat without salt and sauce and damn if it was spicy, juicy and savory. You can also see the meat was hand-loaded on the spit, or at least didn&#39;t come from those Döner factories. The meat is layered haphazardly, it curls round the edges and just doesn&#39;t look like normal places. If you go there in mid-afternoon, you can see them packing/stacking meat on the Döner spit and cutting away at the sides to trim the excess meat in order to make a cone-shaped form.<br>2. The sauces  They have 3: Yogurt, Garlic and Chili. Whichever one you choose, you can&#39;t go wrong. What I love best is that all three aren&#39;t hidden behind the counter; rather, they sit in food trays on the front counter for all customers to help themselves load up as little or as much as desired. Oh, and I reloaded the sauce 3 times before I was done!<br>Also, they provide dried oregano for you to sprinkle on your food, either in a bowl that you sprinkle on with a spoon or a holed, glass dispenser.<br>3. Free pepperonis and Cigar-Börek (long rolled, deep-fried dough) sitting on the counter to munch on while you wait for your order. There is NO sign to tell you that they&#39;re free to take, but only those who go there often are told of this secret, I think. They are sitting on top of the counter with tongs very alluringly, and it seems to me they told me they were complimentary only after I had been there a few times. (Oops, maybe I shouldn&#39;t have told their secret?) They said I should take as many pepperoni and Cigar-Böreks as I wanted, but with the amount of meat they pile on the Döners, I didn&#39;t want to be overstuff myself. <br>4. Finally, the guys who work there are fun and talk a lot with their customers. They joke and make you feel welcome at all times, whether for lunch, dinner or a late night snack after an evening of drinking in Alt-Sachsenhausen. Overall, it&#39;s a tiny place, barely 4 people fit inside. No seats, not even a stool or two, so don&#39;t expect comfort. The owner was really nice and seemed to enjoy talking to me as much as his regulars. Ignore the other 2 or 3 Döners across the street; they&#39;re pale imitations, and enjoy!",

"reviewcomment":"Despite restaurant being located in the heart of Frankfurt&#39;s sleazy red light district this is a wonderful place. The food is absolutely delicious and portions are large. Yelp calls this place a German restaurant but the food here is more like California Cuisine with it&#39;s emphasis on fresh, in season ingredients. I had the traditional French dish of mussels and fries and it was the best I have ever eaten any place in the world. The eggplant salad was exceptional. Other highlights on the menu was the sweet potato salad. On my next trip to Frankfurt I will definitely eat here again. My only complaint about the restaurant is that it got loud as the evening progressed.",

"reviewcomment":"The place is fancy and not only from the location. It is dark but really welcoming. If you compare it with Maredo, well, it is a couple of classes above. However, if you compare the food well I could not find any difference, I could even say some things were a bit tasteless. The prices are astronomical. It is easy to give out about 80 to 100 EURs per person and what you get in return is definitely not that much worth. One more negative thing is that if you go with a lot of people there the chances that you gonna get a couple of hundred EURs on top of the bill a quite big. So make sure you take a look at the bill before you pay it. If I were you I would keep away from that place.",

The noodles were really good as it was hand-made and therefore authentic but the rest of the ingredients were rather disappointing. Why do they have to put the lemongrass into it? It totally messes up the whole taste of the noodles#$@! Also the service was not good either, we had to wait quite long and after we paid, they didn&#39;t even say goodbye to us. Perhaps because they know the Korean version tastes much better? It was worth the try but never ever again..adios!",

"reviewcomment":"Disappointed. Mid to high-end restaurant, beautiful building, decent food, bad service, over-priced drinks.<br>Firstly, the building truly is beautifully done and there aren&#39;t too many restaurants out there which can compete with the visiuals. Kudos to the architect. Unfortunately the rest didn&#39;t rate as well. Without going into detail there were five or six things the server did to make clear he/she was not a real professional. Unforgivable given the price points of this place.<br>The food itself was mixed. A Tuna Tartar was OK, A tomato consomme also OK. My Filet steak with Shrimp risotto was good (at EUR31) but not spectacular. Problem was my date&#39;s dish. A veal chop (incorrectly translated into English as a lamb carre) was advertised as rosa gebraten. Half of the chop was raw. Not literally raw. Not figuratively raw. It was, in fact, just raw. Like eat a raw piece of meat from the fridge raw.<br>Drinks: The wine list was interesting and we felt the markup on wine was fair. Problem zone = cocktails. My date had the suggested cocktail special.. a Champagne cocktail with Moet. EUR16 for a glass of ice, mineral water, and presumably a splash of champagne with a sprig of mint. A joke for that price. I (perhaps foolishly?) ordered a Bellini in the hopes that a restaurant of this supposed caliber would actually know what a Bellini is. I was wrong. EUR14 for a VERY smalll concoction of sparkling wine and an unknown flavoring. Again, this is a BAD JOKE. Those are London/Paris/New York prices for poorly made drinks and frankly I can&#39;t think of a better description than rip-off. I might note that a real Bellini in Harrry&#39;s Bar in Venice costs less. Think about that.<br>Poor value for a EUR140 bill for two diners (before tip).",

Far off the usual visitors paths so you can expect a quiet coffee with a great cake (my favourite: Linzer Torte....) - can be too crowded a peak times on weekends - best time to come is for a quiet breakfast during the week, sitting in the backyard",

"reviewcomment":"I don&#39;t like hippie bars. But it was 09:00 a.m. on a holiday and they were open for breakfast (they get an extra star just for that). Anyway, it&#39;s one of those sort of bohemian hippie jointshalf cafe, half restaurant. You can dine al fresco on some multi-colored psychodelic tables out on the sidewalk. The inside is a mish-mash of used restaurant furniture that doesn&#39;t match itself in any particular way. The walls are dominated by someone&#39;s artwork..average price per painting was around EUR200. I&#39;m sure they&#39;d be glad to lose a couple of those Daddies.<br><br> Anyway, There I was hungover and planted against my inclinations in a hippie joint. Coffee was strong and very good. I ordered three scrambled eggs with some kind of organic herbs and some other sort of Peruvian ham or some such. It was all well cooked but looked suspiciously like two big eggs to me. I like to cook and I&#39;m pretty well aware of the difference between two big eggs and three small ones. I&#39;m also just anal retentive enough to hold an internal debate about such things when I should be eating the damned food. Anyway, it tasted good and was accompanied by three slices of white bread, probably baked by the local collective.<br><br> Since I had to wait a bit for the lady to bring my check, I couldn&#39;t help but check out the hanndbills pasted on the wall outside. It was mostly for a bunch of hippie happenings in Bornheim. Handicapable/lesbian/pygmie theatre and that sort of thing. Then some chick came in with her freakin two year old dressed like a hippie. Hemp skullcap, pipi-longstocking style longstockings, and some sort of canvas trousers. I bet that kid hates her when he grows up.<br><br> Anyway, there you go. I&#39;ll probably never go back simply because I don&#39;t often hang out in Bornheim. Too many people there giving me the old jaundiced eye since I don&#39;t carry a hemp bag or wear any Rasta-inspired clothing. Food was OK, couldn&#39;t tell you about the artwork.",

"reviewcomment":"Not easy to find a fair rating for this place. If you&#39;ve been to Chipotle in the U.S., you already know the ordering process. Basically, you decide whether you want a burrito or a burrito bowl and then tell the server which ingredients you want. There are a lot of bean variations, so if you&#39;re not a big fan of beans, this might not be your place. I loved the food, but there are several cons which make it an average location.<br><br>[Pro]<br>+ Food does taste great. Very tasty kinds of meat. Also mostly very healthy.<br>+ Very hip designed, industrial looking location<br>+ It&#39;s in a mall so when you&#39;re tired from lifting your girlfriend&#39;s shopping bags, this is a convenient location<br><br>[Con]<br>- Very, very overpriced! 9€ for an average taco bowl? Not only the main dish but they do charge you about 3€ for a small container of (very tasty) guac. Also very overpriced drinks. Not a big fan of their fancy lemonade choices.<br>- Nice location but easily crowded and then uncomfortable<br>- Somewhat limited food choices.<br><br>Basically a place I enthusiastically went to because I was craving U.S. / Mexican food. Loved the taste, but the con&#39;s are preventing me from going here regularly.",

Four of us shared a perfectly roasted goose, which arrived at out table beautifully burnished and golden-brown, then taken away to be carved. The meat was perfectly cooked and unbelievably flavorful. Everyone had a second portion. The goose skin was such a treat. Loved this place. Great service, as well. Highly recommend it.",

"reviewcomment":"The food at Muku is excellent. Really, really good. I&#39;ve visited four times in two weeks, and actions should speak louder than words. <br><br>You want more details? Okay, fine, I&#39;ll oblige. Perhaps it&#39;s the season, with plummeting temperatures heralded by bitter winds and freezing rain, but after a tough day at the office there&#39;s nothing better than a bowl of hot ramen to cheer the soul. The thick noodles are cooked just right, served in a delicious broth and garnished with marinated eggs and leaves of spinach. There&#39;s starters too, but you shouldn&#39;t need more than a couple of gyoza dumplings to whet the appetite.<br><br>The price is right considering the quality of the food -- not too expensive, not too cheap -- and if you enjoy your meal as much as I have, you&#39;ll definitely be planning a return visit. Weekends will require making a reservation, but weeknights should be okay to just turn up.<br><br>SPOILER ALERT: the staff are *very* enthusiastic. Both entrance and exit from the premises are greeted by hollers of welcome and goodbye from each and every member of staff. I thought I&#39;d spare you the shock.",

Nur leider war meine Wurst lauwarm. Die Pommes waren knackig, rausgerissen hat es die Käsesauce (generell gute Saucenauswahl). Well, it was not great. A menu with a currywurst, French fries and a soda for 5,90 is not cheap. My sausage was warm, but the French fries were crisp and the cheese sauce on the fries just made them really yummy (the many different kind of sauces made it good)",

We shared a bottle of prosecco for 24 Euros. Public was dressed a bit more stylish than in most places. There were some guys in suits, but mostly long sleeved shirts and chinos or trendy jeans. There were a few guys in t-shirts. Women were mostly stylish and some a little over the top. People were having fun doing traditional Greek zorba line dancing. Music ranged from traditional Greek to house and pop. Parking garage is right next door. Smoking area was partly inclosed near entry. Was a bit loud for holding a conversation. Will visit again for dinner next time.",

Place was completely booked out the night we were there so we sat at the sushi bar. All the chefs are Japanese as far as I could tell. This is hopefully a good sign. Nevertheless, none of the service is. Fairly young staff and I found that they could have been a bit more attentive. Were polite but a bit disorganised and slow. I&#39;d come back as the quality of food was high and I enjoyed the ambiance. Hopefully service steps it up a notch though to match the price-point.",

"reviewcomment":"Inside the Martim hotel, you can expect to pay quite a bit for your meal. However, even at EUR22, I found my lunch to be a decent value. I ordered the lunchbox #X03. It comes with miso soup, and has a very good variety of different food. You get some fried chicken, salmon, dumplings, sushi, oshinko, and salad.<br><br> I prefer that my sushi fish is cut from a large piece of fish when ordered. Here, everything seemed to be pre-cut. Especially for the price, I think this is unfortunate. The EUR9.50 large bottle of water was also upsetting.<br><br> Service was prompt and friendly even if the servers didn&#39;t have a good understanding of English.<br><br> If you&#39;re in Messe Frankfurt for a trade fair, I think it&#39;s worth walking just outside the fair to eat here. Compared to what you get for the cost in the exhibit hall, this place is no-brainer.",

Tried to explain to the waiter that it was undercooked but I believe he thought I was talking about it being cold since it had been sitting out for 19 mins since he took it out of the over. It was way too late to argues about soggy pizza, especially since we wasted an hour and a half going to a French place that closed early because they had no traffic that night",

"reviewcomment":"I knew this trad. Pizzeria since ages. One said it had the best Macaroni - Cheese Germany, so I def. gave it a try - couldnt get enuf of it since then!<br><br>Pizza n other Pastas taste excellent as well. But as its usualy packed due to the small room, reservation is highly recommended or like I always did, give them a call and pick my order for taking away.<br><br>Situated at the main street of Neu Isenburg and on your left if you come from Frankfurt, you wont miss it as its always plenty of cars parked n packed around the resto plus dont get confused if you see people lining up to the pathway waiting for their &#39;away&#39; orders. Well, to me its A good sign :)",

All I know is...I saw hearts, stars, blue clovers and green diamonds! Then I looked back down at my plate and the cheesecake was gone. The service was great despite our slight language barrier of me being a little rusty speaking German. The space was very nice and really clean even though it was very busy.  I would definitely try this place again if I had the chance.",

"reviewcomment":"I had a single night in Frankfurt this past week to catch a flight home the next morning. I am fairly familiar with Frankfurt going there at least once or twice a year. This Conrad&#39;s place is just off the Hauptwache pedestrian zone full of retail shops. They happen to have Scandinavian week going on while I was there will lots of beer and food tents plus a live band. So needing dinner, I found this Conrad&#39;s just off a side street. It was nice enough inside, good service and TV&#39;s showing a local football game. The menu was large and their specialty was schnitzel. There must have been 15 different schnitzel types on the menu. I ordered the jaeger schnitzel being one of my favorite. It seemed that every one of these many schnitzels started the same way. A single large piece of pork breaded and fried and then it had some different type of topping poured over it. Not overly inspiring. I am used to jaeger schnitzel being more of individual pieces of veal or pork that would be more tender. It wasn&#39;t bad, just not overly exciting. The Binding Romer beer was cold and served quickly. I was not wowed by this place but it was OK.",

The wine carafe was severely chipped and sharp to the touch. There was absolutely no ambiance. The staff were very peculiar. Food was edible however it thoroughly lacked and quality or character. The basket of bread was so stale that it could have been served as croutons. The entertainment my friend and I got for the place being so bad was actually memorable.

"reviewcomment":"As sad as it seems, the german critique were not very positive I agree, that the interior design is a bit lacking but again what are people expectig from a small business. I must say the price is definitely fair, for an average portion you get some pretty good stuff. Its pretty sad I that didnt write this is in german (Im working on my german skills!) but I want to say many of the people have ordered the wrong dishes. Most hilarious of all, most of the customers compared this CHINESE restaurant to a thai restaurant and ordered thai dishes what more can I say? . Even more unblievable is that they claim that Monkey bar served better. First, Monkey bar has seriously some first class dishes but doesnt it turn you off that it is cooked by a non asian chef? Where is the Authenticity?! I really hope the restaurant would soon offer some really good authentic food besides their great options of dim sum. I would categorize this a small, comfortable restaurant with family friendly atmosphere. Here, you are not rushed into eating and you all the time you need to enjoy some really good delicacies. Did I mention the prices? Seriously, cheap and good :D <br>Come by if you are looking for place where your friends and you can share a deep conversation, along with some dimsum.",

"reviewcomment":"Starbucks usually has mediocre coffee at high price, and many of them have poor furniture. The outside area is smokey and without a hint of separators, the inside not inspiring. The bartenders are even below-average Starbucks: Busy, unhappy, understaffed, committing errors, so in comparison with Meyerbeer or Fellows they lose. Even to the other local Starbucks, this is not a great place. Plus, the glass doors suck, esp. if your hands are full and you would like to get in or out. To be fair, the whole part of the shopping center is a crowded smoked mess with too many chairs and noise that echoes in a non-pleasant manner.<br>Starbucks coffee shops often are overheated, but this one is a sauna, and they keep those glass doors closed, probably to keep the smoke out. Why bother to change when u visit the near-by swimming pool? They would do well to prohibit smoking in the outside area, it&#39;s supposed to be an indoor mall, after all.",

For the same price i would rather eat else where (and get food of better quality, too...)<br><br> The waiter was very smiley and friendly.

The quality of sushi is from the best in Germany. Of course in Germany there is no Tsukiji(worlds biggest fishmarked in Tokyo) but the taste, cleanliness and service is Japanese standard. Also the simple sushi(maki) taste well because the rice has very good quality. Recomandable are also their own special Soya souces (double fermented) which habe a very delicuous taste. <br>For good quality sushi in Germany a secure place. <br>If they would also ofer delivery it would be a big plus!<br>Its a sushi place but it would be great if they could extend their restaurants/menu with hot dishes like katsudon, tonkatsu, unagidon, gyodon, tempura etc.",

"reviewcomment":"La Bella is absolutely my favorite pizza anywhere in the world.<br>I started going during College (graduated in 2001) and even now that I live in the US (Texas y&#39;all) I make sure to come back every time I&#39;m in Germany. Even my wife and my two kids are nuts for the pizza here.<br><br>Probably because the pizza is absolutely perfect. Thin, tasty dough with delicious tomato sauce and generous, high-quality toppings. I wish they&#39;d be able to ship their pizza here (we really need to invent teleportation!).<br><br>--------------------------------------------------­-------------------------------------------<br><br>La Bella ist meine absolute Lieblingspizzeria.<br>Waehrend meiner Studienzeit (ugh. Abschluss 2001) kam ich regelmaessig hierher und selbst jetzt wo ich in den USA lebe stelle ich sicher, dass ich bei jedem Besuch nach Deutschland auch mal bei La Bella vorbeischaue. Sowohl meine Frau als auch meine beiden Kinder sind inzwischen genauso verrueckt auf die Pizza wie ich.<br><br>Die Pizza ist einfach perfekt, leckerer, duenner Teig, gute Tomatensosse und gut belegt.

The only good thing about them is their location and that you can take the lift to get up, otherwise well The view from up there is really amazing and it is worth to go up there and make a few flix (just going there does not cost a penny, thus it is an alternative to the Main Tower). <br>The negatives: one should normally wait a while before finding a table; even after you have a table it takes a while to bring you the menu (god forbid if you don&#39;t know what you want to drink or eat); then some more time to bring you the stuff; and even longer to bring you the bill In addition, some of the things are not really of good quality or at I least I have eaten better ice-cream cakes, and the high prices are not comparable to the low quality.<br>Bottom line: go once, see for yourself but beware: pay as they bring you the things just in case you want to leave early.",

"reviewcomment":"Okay, this review is strictly based on the Sunday Lunch Buffet of which I thought was pathetic. Why, because the selection sucked.<br><br> Mind you, I&#39;m the Buffet Queen so I KNOW Buffets, especially Chinese Buffets. I grew up in Toronto for goodness sakes and my last 11 years was spent in Texas, Houston and BELIEVE YOU ME, Toronto and Houston surely know how to do Chinese/Mongolian or whatever else Asian Buffet.<br><br> So, I tried the Mongolian fare. I slapped on some pieces of lachs (Salmon), shrimp, etc .. and carefully chose the sauce and vegetables. When I got my plate it was just one big brown mash. They did not even plate it well. My green vegetables were unrecognizable too. I was really disappointed. On the positive side, most of the people that I was there with ordered the single serving meals and WOW, I should&#39;ve gotten that instead. The portions were big and the way they plated the food was really beautiful. Everyone that did NOT have the buffet were really satisfied.<br><br> The place in itself is pretty big and the large tables have a lazy susan so you can put the food on the platform and twirl away.<br><br> I must say though, that they DID have a large selection of fresh meats and seafood for Mongolian Grilling, the sad thing is, it would all turn out brown and no matter what sauce you put, they still add whatever sauce they used for grilling :-(",

What has happened ?, they have changed their style and bocome snooty, put up their prices, and even when the restaurant is relitively empty you need a lot of time before actually getting something to eat, I hope they will revoke to their old ways again and become again an easy crispy restaurant.<br>The Truffel Nudels had a very feint tast of Truffel but at EUR18.50 it is not worth ordering, The Duck breast in fig sauce was good meat but undercooked (Bloody) and the skin was very slopy, at EUR19.90 a bit steep,<br>The Rose wine at EUR3.50 the glass was wonderful, perhaps I should have drunk more in the almost 2 hours I was there.",

So, whatever he &#34;sells&#34; what he has taken out of the kitchen at whatever exorbitant price is his extra profit.<br>I have been to this place for many years and always took the charges for granted until it started to get quite expensive...<br><br>PLEASE SCRUTINIZE the check/bill and COMPARE against the menu prices!!!<br>They are very frequently &#34;mistakenly&#34; wrong!",

With a reservation a short time in advance, they have so far always been able to accomodate a small group (6-10) for lunch without any problem. The prices are okay (a bit high for a bargain lunch), but they usually have some reasonably priced lunch specials (salad+main dish) if you want a full meal.<br><br> In my experience, the food has always been good. The service can be hit or miss.<br><br> If you are alone or a group less than 4, check out the cafe next door. It offers the same pizza and pasta for 1 or 2EUR less.",

"reviewcomment":"Relative to Manhattan, London, Berlin, or Istanbul, weekends in Frankfurt ain&#39;t happening. <br><br>My sister and her family lived in downtown Frankfurt for a few years and now moved to the yuppie neighborhood of Kronberg.  Whenever I visit Frankfurt, my expectation is simple - quality and cuddle time with my most favorite (and only) hapa niece and my little baby nephew.  I usually schedule my stay for Sunday through Thursday, so that I can fly to the next bubbly European city for a truly fun weekend adventure.<br><br>However, Tuesday nights is party night in downtown Frankfurt.  I still don&#39;t understand why the bankers prefer it that way, but that&#39;s how they roll.  During one summer visit, my sister and I met up with friends at Euro Deli - supposedly the hot happy hour spot to convene, drink and mingle with friends and strangers of Tuesday night.  The vibe was chill at the beginning of happy hour and thereafter the music and energy gradually escalated as the people poured into the bar then overflowed into the patio area.<br><br>The crowd is very international and banker&#39;s scene.  I breathe of refreshing fresh air from the dot-boom/bust, hipster, grunge and ecc scene of San Francisco and its neighboring quarters.<br><br>If you&#39;re in town for business or pleasure and you find yourself bored on a Tuesday night - do stop by forfor a drink or two and to explore what the evening has in store for you at the heart of downtown Frankfurt.",

Menu is not huge, but what they make, they make well. You get a plate of Gambas, meatballs, calimaris, etc for around EUR8 served with white bread. They have Bitburger for beer drinkers and a decent lineup of Spanish Reds that aren&#39;t awfully expensive. I&#39;ve heard they have a white sangria wich is supposed to be quite good although I&#39;ve not tried it.<br><br> Service is relaxed and super friendly in a Spanish kind of way. I give it four stars not because it&#39;s haute cuisine, but because it&#39;s got good food reasonably priced and has a fun atmosphere. Will definitely be back.",

Also offers a selection of thalis (combo platters), which are great for those who like variety, and don&#39;t want to order multiple entrees to get more than one type of meat or vegetables. The quality is quite good, with great spices and flavour. I highly recommend it!",

Sometimes in the evening I want a smaller snack. I ordered their Junior Döner. The man working there gave me a nasty look and said &#34;that is for kids!&#34; They shouldn&#39;t list something on their menu that they don&#39;t want to sell. With all the döner options in Frankfurt, there&#39;s definitely no reason to return to this one.",

"reviewcomment":"Great Ambience, Fantastic Food, Excellent Wines!<br><br>I went here on a Yelp recommendation.  We did not stop exclaiming all evening, &#34;wow, what a great meal!&#34;  The ambience gets a 9/10.  It is a cellar (a wine cellar), complete with brick walls and wooden tables (a la picnic tables), but thank God, there&#39;s no musty/moldy ancient basement smell.  It seems newly constructed with an old or classic feel--but not Disney.  Location is great:  it&#39;s a short walk up an alley just off the main pedestrian street of the Hauptwache.  <br><br>My dining partner and I shared 2 apps: the Liver Pate with Green Peppercorns and the (regional delicacy) Sour Milk Cheese.  Neither of these are for the timid of palate, but boy did they offer great, unique, local flavors all dancing in the mouth.  Very good choice.  <br><br>We ordered a mid-to-high-priced bottle of Riesling to share (relative to their menu, but quite inexpensive for a New York wine list) that paired well with the meal.  My friend&#39;s entree was a seasonal special (October): venison goulash with red cabbage.  I ordered one of the two house-made bratwursts they have on the regular menu; they were out of the one I asked for (it was somewhat late on a Tuesday night, and since they&#39;re house-made I don&#39;t blame them), so I agreed to the other one.  I could absolutely tell the sausage was homemade and not bought from their supplier. Delicious!  As you would expect in Germany, the sauerkraut was way more subtle than we get in the States (not stinky). <br><br>We were in the mood for &#34;classic&#34; German, but the menu has a decent variety of more contemporary dishes as well.  The entree salads (at other tables) seemed quite hefty, but I don&#39;t fly 8 hours to eat a salad.  <br><br>A quick caveat: for those needing somewhere handicapped-accessible, this place is not!  You have to descend 2 flights of stairs to get in, and then climb them on a full stomach at the end of the meal to reach street level.  No big deal, but my friend who needs a knee operation when we get home was taking it kinda slow.<br><br>Definitely recommend!<br><br>Addendum:  I went back alone on my last night in Frankfurt. Again: fantastic. My goal was to eat light but sample a couple of nice German wines. Second goal, achieved! Not sure how light I ate. <br><br>First, let me say that at 8:45 pm on a Monday night in mid-October, the Hauptwache looked like a ghost town: many places closed because it was Monday, others getting ready to close. Vinum was hopping. <br><br>I had the warm goat cheese appetizer, paired with some seasonal white German wines-- they always have a seasonal wine menu to augment the standard one.   Perfect meal!  They served 2 large slices of goat cheese that had been broiled (the dish was hot) in a honey sauce with black olives and--of all things--peppercinis. Great combo of flavors: sweet &amp; savoy &amp; spicy.  I had 2 different wines from their seasonal menu which were exquisite. Ask your server, they know the wines.",

"reviewcomment":"I&#39;ve eaten quite a few sushi meals in Frankfurt and this is probably the best. In particular, the tuna was the most tender and fresh I&#39;ve had since leaving New York. Unlike the numerous conveyor belt places in the city, the sushi here has a good fish-to-rice ratio.<br><br> I opted for the Sushi am Main Boat for dinner. It costs EUR38 and comes with a small portion of seaweed salad, a green salad, choice of soup, sushi boat, and dessert. Everything was very good. The boat comes with 6 pieces of nigiri sushi, 3 pieces of salmon roll, a california hand roll with salmon, and some sashimi pieces. It also comes with tempura. I think this is a good value. The a la carte prices for sushi were also very reasonable.",

Not only the system of paying plate by plate, that has already been mentioned in prior comments, but also the different sushi creations are worth being mentioned.<br><br> Sure you get the classics (makis and nigiris), but the team at Kamon invent new, exotic creations.<br><br> Value for money is very good. It might not be the best sushi restaurant in the city, but still a very good choice.",

"reviewcomment":"After quite a long sushi break, my husband and I had a craving again.<br>I cracked the whip and the googeling machine presented me with this gem: Sushi Bagan.<br>It is a small place just around the corner of the Allianz building in Sachsenhausen, but easy enough to find.<br>They offer a sushi buffet for lunch and dinner, but do a la carte sushi as well.<br>So far we have been there twice for the lunch buffet and 10,90 € will get you a wide selection of  sushi goodness.<br>I love the variety they offer.<br>They have all kinds of rolls, maki and nigiri with raw seafood, cooked tuna and veggies. There is something for everybody.<br>In addition, they also offer a small warm buffet with miso soup, steamed rice, fried rice, noodles, curry chicken, spicy chicken, some kind of beef dish, and shrimps.<br>3 types of ice cream will satisfy your sweet tooth at the end of your meal.<br><br>Their service is good too. <br>Very friendly people serve your drinks within 5 minutes.<br>You pay on your way out directly at the cash register which suits me just fine.<br>(I hate to wait for the bill anyways.)<br><br>In conclusion: <br>If you can do without sashimi, this is the place to go for good sushi at a great price.",

They also off a junior döner, and they don&#39;t get upset with you when you order it (like some of the other döner shops in town.) The veggies are all very fresh. The sauces are excellent. The other Turkish foods they sell are also great, and everything is reasonably priced. Top it off with super friendly service, and what you have is simply the best döner laden in FFM.",

Besides the main attraction which is sold in many variations also crepes, salads, muffins and many other sweets are offered for affordable prices.<br><br> We had the Turkey Bagel (2,95 EUR) with turkey, salad, tomato, mayonnaise, curry sauce which was replaced with honey-mustard sauce and cress and the Veggie French Bagel (2,70 EUR) with camembert, rocket, cream cheese and honey-mustard sauce. We chose Flavored Shot Water (1,90 EUR for 1 pint) with raspberry flavor as drink. The Bagels were very fresh and heavily topped.<br><br> Starlight bagels is always worth the visit.

"reviewcomment":"I would say just dont go. I was so excited and really wanted to like it because i love sushi boats concept, but this is a no go for me. I think everyone goes because it is all you can eat and people loves a bargain. The rice is the worst sushi rice i have ever had, so what else is there to say? Drinks and staff are nice but the sushi is not good, it is difficult to find a real sushi place in Frankfurt and after leaving in asia and visiting japan several times i am always on the look for a good japanesse place. Sushi cyrcle is not it.",

"reviewcomment":"It was our last night in Germany and we were staying near the Frankfurt Hauptbahnof to catch a train to the airport the next morning. The area had only greasy looking tourist traps for restaurants. Thanks to Yelp , we found Zur Reifenburg - only 10 minutes away by cab. We had excellent schnitzels and bratwursts with frosty cold Weissbier - huge portions - and only € 50 for the 3 of us. The Croatian owner was very friendly and surprised to see non - locals - the restaurant is in a residential neighborhood. Danke Yelp - for showing us this great little place and saving us from eating Burger King or kebap in the train station,",

For beginners I recommend taking the Afro Mix, a good overview over the restaurants specialties, incl. varieties of side dishes.<br>Prices are very adequate and rather on the low side. <br>Service is very friendly.<br>The interior, though, is rather basic, non-chalant and you ask yourself where the African style begins and the German Neighbourhood watering hole style ends. That&#39;s worth one star off the top rating. You wouldn&#39;t want to come here on a first date. Unless your date loves African food!<br>But other than that - will come here again.",

I spent my vacation in June in Catalonia, and Ponte could still be one of the best choices in any city in Costa Brava. <br><br>You can find all the traditional dishes, such as &#39;patatas bravas&#39; and &#39;chorizo&#39;. But don&#39;t forget to check the great seafood options, such as the octopus and the scallops (some of the highlights of the night).<br><br>I wish I could find a larger selection of Spanish wines to keep my illusion of being in the Spanish coast, but there&#39;s a reasonable selection by the glass or bottle. I highly recommend Ponte for a nice Spanish experience in Frankfurt. I&#39;d say it&#39;s particularly great if you go with a few friends - that way you can order lots of different tapas and have a little taste of everything!",

Basically it&#39;s a no-frills place with excellent cooking at very reasonable prices. Normally I&#39;m picky about the ambience but I knew going in it wouldn&#39;t be fancy. They&#39;ve made an effort in the dining rom with white tablecloths and candles. Outside is basic biergarten and the servers are about like you&#39;d find in any average schnitzel joint..casually dressed and very casual service. But the food is something different altogether as they seem to have nabbed a very good chef.<br><br> As it was Spargelzeit I had scallops with asparagus as a starter. Being hard on them I&#39;d say the scallops were missing a hint more garlic and the vinaigrette for the asparagus had chopped onions in it such as you might find on handkäs. I found it an odd pairing but it was delish anyway. Scallops were definitely not frozen.<br><br> For a main I had Red Mullet with ratatouille and parsley potatoes. It was brilliantly cooked. My colleague, known affectionately as Sideboards, had veal liver with baked apples which he declared fabu. Another had a filetsteak and our French visitor had Wiener Schnizel. All in all five of us had starters, mains, two san pelligrinos, and two bottles of St Emillion (EUR40 apiece but we were on expenses). The final tally was EUR240 before tip. If we had skipped the expensive wine and stuck to beers it would have been lower. Still, for the money it was food like you&#39;d find in many an upscale white tablecloth joint for prolly 30-40% cheaper. I&#39;m not deducting points for lack of ambience simply because the food was a strong outperformer.<br><br> Definitely would go back.",

"reviewcomment":"Tiny little hole in the wall Thai kitchen near the Hbf run by Thai people, and also a lot of Thai customers, which is a good sign. We tried the Panang (red curry) chicken and satay. Both were fine, but definitely not authentic. The panang sauce was very milky. It&#39;s the same problem at most Thai restaurants in Germany (except for Udon in Sachsenhausen) so I guess they just assume that westerners like it that way. It&#39;s not the cheapest place in town but not expensive either (mostly 6-9 Euro per dish). I noticed they serve Thai noodle soup in the afternoons which is hard to find outside of Thailand. I&#39;ll check that out next time.",

The food was always good and I ate many dinners there with friends who also lived in the area. You could sit outside and relax on warm, sunny days yet it was just as comfortable inside. I recently stopped by when on business in Frankfurt and not much has changed. Still super service, quality food and drinks and a great addition to the area. This place must at this point be over 10 years old if not older. Quality has remained as I started going there literally 10 years ago. It&#39;s no longer necessarily the same people but the mood of service and the ambiance of the place have not changed. Well done and highly recommended by me.",

"reviewcomment":"Nice Italian restaurant with great, friendly staff. The two waiters spoke a mixture of German, Italian, and English and seemed a little chaotic - but in a charming Italian way! Upon entry we were warmly greeted and offered an aperitif drink on the house. They were then a tad pushy on having us order the recommended appetizer (mixed platter of meats), but in the end I was glad we ordered it. The main courses were good, but not excellent. Hence, only 4 stars.<br><br>I recommend you call them beforehand to make a reservation for dinner. This place does seem to fill up!",

Nun aber zum<br>wesentlichen, das Essen: Die Suppe ist ein schöner Appetizer und schmeckt gut,<br>das Hauptgericht z.B. Chicken Tempura + Reis und Süß Saurer Sauce schmeckt TOP,<br>frisch zubereitet und geschmacklich sehr gut. Das ganze kostet 7,50 und ist<br>absolut gerechtfertigt.

It was extremely slow - which I can handle if the server is friendly. <br><br>I waited nearly 30 minutes for a latte macchiato - and if the server hadn&#39;t snapped at me when I asked if it was coming I probably wouldn&#39;t have minded the wait. <br><br>They also left our plates in front of us the whole time - it was uncomfortable because we were outside so bees and flies kept showing up! We arrived at noon for bunch and left at 13:45... Our plates there the WHOLE time! <br><br>I can be understanding when it is quite busy and the place is short-staffed, but it wasn&#39;t even half full and there was more than one server.",

The apfelwein was the best one I&#39;ve had so far, but it was also my first time having it so maybe the others just don&#39;t compare to my first experience. It was very crowded and busy in this restaurant so trying to get the waitresses attention for our check was difficult, although that seems pretty normal for most German restaurants. It has some odd decor, like a tree in the middle of the place. There is also outside seating which would have been nice if it wasn&#39;t so cold. They don&#39;t speak much English in here, but it wasn&#39;t difficult to order. They serve alcohol until 2am.",

You will find Tafelspitz (boiled beef with a cold cold herbal sauce, Sauerbraten, pork knuckle dishes, and of course a few schnitzel dishes. I had Rouladen, which is not on the regular menu so I don&#39;t know whether they&#39;d have it every day. It&#39;s made with thinly sliced flank steak, rolled up with bacon, onions, pickles and mustard in the middle, and served with a wine/beer sauce. The beef itself is slightly dry, but eat it with the caramelized bacon-vegetable fillings and the wine sauce remedies the problem. The red cabbage side dish was wonderfully flavourful. <br><br>Apple strudel for dessert, not bad, not great. <br><br>Good services. They seem to handle large groups (there was a 15+ tour group) and small tables equally well.",

They strive for the &#34;not so usual&#34;, with delicious local fare with a modern touch, over 100 brandies (Louie&#39;s passion) and a  concert series during the summer months.

Only had macchiatos so far, so I can&#39;t speak for their drip coffee.<br><br>Also had a delicious sandwich there - a bit soggy by the end of the day (I was there in the evening), but still healthy and tasty with dark grainy bread, arugula, tomatoes and camembert.<br><br>I know there are some good, classy cafes in Frankfurt with tiny tables and straightbacked chairs, but I would much rather be reading a book in a dimly lit place that feels homey. And I&#39;m glad to avoid the packed-to-the-gills conglomerates like Coffee Brothers and Starbucks!",

"reviewcomment":"We visit the Christmas Market in Frankfurt most years, always staying close to Zeil area and this has become our default breakfast stop off.<br><br>The staff are friendly and most speak good English. English menus are on offer but at this stage we kinda know the menu so don&#39;t both bother.<br><br>My usual is Zwei Eier Im Tasse, which translates to 2 Eggs in a cup, or in this case a glass. They  come with either brotchen (crispy roll) or toast. I usually get the roll.<br><br>The eggs are medium soft boiled, shelled and served in a glass with the bread on the side, and an enormous packet of butter. If you&#39;re used to the tiny individual sized packets you get here you;l be pleasantly surprised, it&#39;s more than enough. Coffee is also good quality.<br><br>They do a good selection of sweet and savoury baked goods as well, although we haven&#39;t really sampled them much. <br><br>This is a nice place to start a busy day&#39;s marketing, and provides enough for breakfast without being overfull for all the tasty meat and potato related treats that the market vendors have on offer.",

"reviewcomment":"Als native Los Angeles Dude, habe ich richtiges Mexikanisches Essen in Deutschland sehr sehr vermisst. (Bestes sofern gefunden: Dolores&#39; Burritos in Berlin.) So habe ich mich gefreut zu lernen, dass ein Burrito Laden in Frankfurt kommt. Und ich habe es heute besucht.<br>Fazit: Ganz OK. Positiv war: Gut gewüztes Fleisch, ziemlich leckere und scharfe Salsas, und schwarze Bohnen (sehr wichtig). Negativ: relativ geringe Auswahl von Zutaten, kein Mexikanischer Reis (nur limette-weiß Reis), und vor allem, die Tortillas sehr weich und langweilig. Wenn der Burrito kurz gegrillt würde, dass er leicht knusprig wäre, oder wenn es eine Option für vollkorne Tortillas gäbe, wäre es deutlich besser.<br>Ich gehe gern wieder hin. Beste Burritos in Frankfurt :) Aber keiner Vergleich mit Kalifornishem Essen. So, ich gebe das Essen vielleicht 3 Sterne, und dann noch eins für sehr freundliches Personal :)",

"reviewcomment":"A solid choice for Chinese food in the city and within convenient reach of the Hbf (not necessarily a selling point as it is a less than salubrious area, but convenient if you pass through daily as a commuter to the city). The buffet is not such an appetising option and I would instead recommend one of the traditional hot-pots towards the back of the menu.<br><br> There are two entrances not easily located but persevere and you&#39;ll find them. Each leads to the restaurant on the upper floor.<br><br> Originally recommended to me via a Chinese member of the Toytown online community of English speakers in Germany, it was flagged as unusually authentic among Chinese restaurants in Frankfurt. The food is however somewhat greasy, particularly the deep friend spring rolls etc which do not appear to have been sufficiently drained and ooze oil as soon as you bite into them.<br><br> Stick to the hot pots and you&#39;ll have a good meal here.",

Also the staff seem to have been re-trained because they were much more professionally mannered than they have been before. So McDonald&#39;s is making steady progress everywhere in Germany where you even had to order sauces separately back in the 90&#39;s.. Now the food quality and service has become so much better than anytime before. When I visited this time, the staff even brought the burger to the table as soon as it was done. Despite the new trend towards higher-priced burger restaurants it&#39;s still not only my favorite location for a burger crave, but perhaps for most people around the globe.",

"reviewcomment":"No one spoke English here, but that is because it&#39;s off the beaten path. Despite the language gap, the servers were super friendly and patient. I started with a salad which had fresh, crisp greens, corn, peppers, tomatoes, and cucumbers. It was all very fresh and delicious. For the main I had the schnitzel with a green peppercorn gravy. It was tender, rich, flavorful, and had a nice kick from the peppercorns. I also had a few German beers and wines with my meal which were all very satisfying. Overall, delicious food and drinks at very fair prices. Prost!",

Mostly have been on business and eating European food, which is fantastic. But I got a craving so here I am. And it&#39;s really not bad. Better than most AYCE Chinese in Los Angeles. Not better than the sit down places but hey, it&#39;s AYCE. It&#39;s at the top floor of the mall in the food court area. There is an express escalator all the way to the top. I would come back. It&#39;s a good place for lunch or dinner.<br><br>Oh, and they have sweet and sour chicken (all white meat), Kim chee and SAUERKRAUT!! This place rocks !!!",

"reviewcomment":"It was only through pure chance that I first visited Tapas Locas and I am ever thankful to the other nearby tapas restaurant who, after booking a table two hours in advance, told us that we hadn&#39;t called, eventually conceded that we did call but had given our table away and then told us to leave as they were too busy to seat us. Many thanks to them for their inefficiency as we then found this real gem of a restaurant instead. The menu provides a good selection of tapas to choose from without being too extensive as to compromise the freshness of the food, the portions are a good size and are fairly priced, the food is absolutely delicious and the drinks are also very fairly priced, with a glass of the dry red house wine (which for me works perfect with most tapas) costing EUR3.60 for 0.2l. Personal highlights of the menu for me are the &#39;Pimentos de Padrón&#39; (fried baby green peppers with sea salt), Mejillón en Vinegreta de Pimientos (cold green lipped mussels in a pepper vinaigrette) and the Pan y Allioli, which although simple to do, is made with the perfect balance of garlic. Tapas Locas is only a small restaurant so reservations are recommended but this adds to the cosy feel of the place and also ensures that you feel looked after by the staff for the duration of your visit. The staff are attentive without being overbearing and are happy to recommend dishes to you, which have proven to me to be well worth taking. Although the restaurant can get busy at times I have never felt rushed to leave to seat more people in our seats, in fact one time I even had to convince the waiters that we were just about to pay the bill to stop them from turning away more customers. This was my third visit to Tapas Locas, where once again I have felt welcome, enjoyed everything I ate and left feeling very satisfied indeed. Highly recommended.",

"reviewcomment":"That this place does great business in an area of town (Nordend and Nordwestend) where if you swung a cat, you&#39;d hit a pizza restaurant in any direction, is no wonder. <br>Another wonder is how small and cozy this place is. If you can fit 6 customers at 1 time, you will rubbing elbows. Yet the pizza is good, cheap and the place looks like a shrine to it&#39;s owner, Pepe, with all his idiosyncrasies and knick-knacks on shelves. The atmosphere is what makes this place so much fun to visit, for you feel more like you stepped into Pepe&#39;s house more than a professional, impersonal restaurant. Pepe is also disappointed if you don&#39;t drink a glass of wine or beer, either.<br>The pizza isn&#39;t the best in the world, but it&#39;s more than above average. It&#39;s an experience for all the senses, not just your tongue.",

"reviewcomment":"Was short on time in Frankfurt and a few friends recommended this place for an awesome authentic German meal. It was a fairly quick walk from my hotel and is close to the center of town. It was an interesting walk as there was a huge demonstration against the European Central Bank. <br><br>The restaurant is cute and the staff was very inviting. The menu has all your typical German fare and at the time White Asparagus was in season. I was tempted but I passed. I ended up getting Jager Schnitzel with fried potatoes. Lets just say that this Jager Schnitzel has now ruined all other Jager Schnitzel for me. It was crispy yet tender and cooked to perfection. The Jager sauce was creamy and the perfect accompaniment. The portion size was ginormous and I ended up taking half of it with me to eat later.<br><br>The staff was very friendly and accommodating.  Our German was limited but we were able to communicate our requests easily. If you&#39;er ever in the Frankfurt area go buy Romer and try their Schnitzel. I promise you won&#39;t be disappointed!!",

I got the wurst platter, hot wine and a cool beer.  Good for couple of friends or family to have a little lunch gathering.  The interior look very like and the stair long and around, go around before reach tot he bottom of the restroom.",

"reviewcomment":"(Disclaimer: I am not a vegan, though I support bakeries such as the Edelkiosk that sell excruciatingly scrumptious vegan baked goodies at reasonable prices!)<br><br>Edelkiosk is a cozy bakery/café in a quiet neighborhood in Frankfurt that serves some of the best cake and baked goods I&#39;ve tasted so far in this city (though I&#39;ve been here only five months, I have visited many - okay, probably too many! - bakeries here so far). And, here&#39;s the kicker: it&#39;s vegan! And another: it is powered by 100% renewable energy from Naturstrom (at least that&#39;s what the certificate in the bathroom says). Thirdly: the prices are normal (2-3 euro for a moist piece of cake or a huge cookie), despite the fact that it is vegan and not heated by dirty coal/oil. <br><br>The cakes and cookies are all made in-house in the normal-sized oven behind the counter. When the cakes sell out, they are out. The lemon cake was so moist and flavorful, the frosting just the right amount of sweet.  The second time I was there, about five pm on a Sunday, the cake had just sold out, and I snagged the last cookie (with dark chocolate chunks), which was really good for a cookie, especially in Germany.<br><br>The drinks are also made with love, and the customer can choose from soy milk or almond milk (whether they give rice milk as an option, I can&#39;t remember). There&#39;s also whipped &#34;cream,&#34; which is super good. <br><br>The people who work behind the counter (where one orders) are patient, friendly, and not interested in rushing you in and out. A much different type than one finds at some chain coffee shops in the city. The place also has a different vibe (more laid-back, socially-focused/responsible, and human-centered) than most other cafés in the city. Sitting there one feels like she&#39;s at a friend&#39;s house. Nothing better on a Sunday afternoon.",

Don&#39;t be shy, tell Dominica hello, let him know what you feel like and he will make a recommendation.  Tell him Speed says hello and you are a Yelper!",

"reviewcomment":"I have stayed at this hotel at least 4-5 times over the past 6-7 years out of convenience mostly. I have a yearly trade show where this hotel provides a short walking distance which makes a huge difference versus fighting the masses getting on trains. The prices have surely gone up significantly over the years. The rooms are small, you need to accept the glass box shower in the room that leaves no privacy if you are sharing a room with someone. The beds are wrapped in plastic bags which make you sweat at night even with the window open in January. The elevator is of course very small as most are in Europe. But there are several good things like the service which has been absolutely top notch every time I am here. The girls at the front desk seem to be the same faces every year and they are very helpful and speak perfect English. The bar tenders, especially my pal from Brazil are excellent and helpful regarding questions about the city. They have a nice breakfast in the morning and a restaurant with a limited but decent menu. There are several decent places to eat very close by. One thing though, get a room that does not face the main intersection in front of the hotel as the fire department must be right down the street and you will hear them all night long rushing off to emergencies bee-dow, bee-dow, bee-dow. You get the idea.",

The food was excellent, especially the pimiento padron nach saison.  The menu had options for vegetarians and meat eaters, so everyone was happy.  I had a hankering for some tapas, and they certainly delivered. Check! The wait staff was courteous, and the food came out quickly. We went through three pitchers of sangria, which were absolutely delicious. We were enjoying ourselves so much, we didn&#39;t notice the time and stayed until closing. However, they didn&#39;t give us a hard time and remained very friendly and courteous.  We highly recommend this place and will be back for sure. :)",

I could feel her knee and ellbow quite a few times in my back (in an admittedly packed restaurant, however, she could have taken a bit more care - the other guests who needed to pass managed to do so without leaving bruises).<br>Any query she treated as criticism of her person.

"reviewcomment":"An Art Cuisine is the perfect concept for combining everything that part takes of life - art, food, music and people. The interaction of all these ingredients makes for a truly one of a kind experience. Oliver&#39;s Art Cuisine is a charming venue Bockenheim&#39;s. Opened in May of 2007, its&#39; walls are graced with delightful and thoughtful works from the artist community in Germany, some whose works are from the Mensing Gallery in Frankfurt.<br><br> The space is optimal for creating a warm ambiance where people can come together over delicately created tastes for the discerning palate while sitting back and engaging in good conversation. Oliver changes the menu every two weeks and each page of the Blue Velvet Menu &#39;album&#39; is treated as a snapshot - a photograph made of words, capturing the menu fare at a particular time. Everything that can be found in the menu is an item that Oliver himself loves to eat or drink. The menu then becomes an invitation from the chef to his guests. A sharing of taste experience that Oliver himself has acquired from his travels. And because everything that is served has a special connection to the chef, Oliver is able to prepare each dish and serve each beverage with such personal attention that the result is really a special treat.<br><br> When asked to define what cooking means to him Oliver simply replied with a knowing smile, Meditation. The more I work the more I come into myself. He says that focusing on the preparation from start to finish leaves no room for distraction, being completely aware and being completely there in every step of the process. For the health conscious, every ingredient that goes into Oliver&#39;s creations are organic - hand picked from his garden! Absolutely no preservatives or additives are used for his dishes. Oliver believes in respecting the mind, body and soul by giving them the gift of nature - as it was intended. Guests of Oliver&#39;s Art Cuisine will also enjoy a calm and soothing auditory experience of ambiant sounds personally created for the restaurant.<br><br> The restaurant also offers a medley of unique cooking courses that are unlike any other here in Frankfurt. These courses cater to a wide range, from the beginner cook to the professional chef looking for new concepts to introduce to their repertoire. Companies are also encouraged to use these courses as a &#39;team building&#39; program for their employees. The classes are offered on Saturday&#39;s between 4:30 pm - 10:00 pm for small groups so please reserve your spots early. Oliver&#39;s Art Cuisine also lends itself to small gatherings for intimate celebrations of for business meetings. The maximum seating capacity is for 27 people - perfect for giving each guest the attention they deserve.<br><br> Oliver&#39;s menu not only presents a selection of fine delectable plates but its&#39; list of select cocktails, wines and specialty beverages are sure to please a wide variety of tastes.<br><br> Oliver&#39;s Art Cuisine is a wonderful concept that truly combines the best experience for the senses - sight, smell, taste and sound all coordinated lovingly by Oliver himself. Treat yourself and your loved ones to an unforgettable time!",

We asked for wine paring with each course and took a bottle of water. All in all it cost us 95€as we had the barometer coupon. Without coupon it would have been 150€ for 2.<br>The waiter was smiling all the time and was really nice but seemed new and as much at ease as i was;) and despite making efforts to speak english, he had difficulties so i ended up speaking German with him and translating.<br><br>Good experience, i will probably not go back but only because these classy places are not my scene ;)",

I had the twin taste, cheese fries and lemonade. The twin taste has a portobello mushroom on top of the burger. Excellent. Cheese fries were hot and delicious. Lemonade (tried both types) was very refreshing.<br><br>Prices are a bit high but you get good value for your money. It&#39;s odd for me to see the lemonade more expensive than any of the beers available.<br><br>Great place, will be back soon. Thanks to my local Frankfurt Yelp friends for recommending this place to me.",

Our room rate came with an expansive breakfast that included hard-boiled eggs, a meat/cheese spread, croissants and delicious German yogurt. Our room was small, like most in Europe, but it was very clean and updated. There is free WiFi at the hotel. The staff is all very nice and helpful, letting us borrow their iPhone charger for the entire trip because our plug wouldn&#39;t fit into the outlet&#39;s cover.",

"reviewcomment":"Haus Wertheym sits in the Old Town, right in the middle of all the tourists, so expect for prices to be on the higher side.  It&#39;s been around awhile (the House anyways, since the 1400s).  If you sit outside, go and sit down, the staff will bring you a menu and you can order, as long as you get their attention.  It was fairly empty when I went on a Saturday night (not a whole lot of people inside or out).  Food was decent- the pork scnitzel was good, probably enough for 2 people and the fries were good.  The side salad had too much dressing, which made it not that appetizing.  <br><br>Besides being pricey (4 euro for a .4L fanta), they only take cash.  Don&#39;t be like me and assume they take credit cards before ordering and eating",

For instance, in Germany:<br><br>Everyone is two feet taller than me.<br>All the cabs are Benzes. <br>Everyone speaks German.<br><br>I can&#39;t really think of any more right now, but the point is, that many things are different. One thing that remains true everywhere I&#39;ve ever been, is that everyone gets down to Billie Jean. <br><br>We sat at the First In for quite some time, drinking very decent albeit small martinis. There were 80s music videos on the entire time, the unintentional hilarity of which was unjustly being ignored by everyone in the bar other than us. However, as soon as Michael Jackson came on, people started to dance (or at least bob their heads awkwardly).<br><br>This is a nice little cocktail bar in a country that&#39;s all about beer. My Manhattan wasn&#39;t fantastic, but the aforementioned martinis went down quite easily, and the service was friendly. I&#39;d do it again.",

All the dishes we have ordered have been generous portions and taste excellent and the staff is friendly. It&#39;s not a place I would go out of my way to visit; however, if you are in the area, it&#39;s definitely a place I would recommend.<br><br> In summer time, the terrace or beer garden area in front of the restaurant is a pleasant place to spend to an afternoon or evening. It is centrally located in the heart of Old Rödelheim, but it is off the main road so there isn&#39;t a lot of traffic. There is plenty of space indoors and out so you shouldn&#39;t have any trouble finding space even if you go in a group.",

"reviewcomment":"This is our new &#34;go to&#34; place in Frankfurt for a delicious meal and attentive service. We stumbled across this restaurant on the Internet. While we&#39;ve never been there when it&#39;s crowded, it&#39;s good to know that they take OpenTable reservations. We walked in for dinner and were promptly welcomed by Swen, our waiter. Having just arrived from the US, are German language abilities were non-existent. He patiently explained the menu and seemed passionate (for a German) about the food they featured. I personally enjoy hearing about where ingredients are sourced and appreciate good wine paring recommendations.<br><br>Our food arrived rather quickly. The meals were prepared with care and judiciously seasoned. We&#39;ve tried everything ranging from scallops, mussels, chicken, and pasta. There were no complaints from our finicky palates.",

The waiters sometimes don&#39;t know which they are but will speak both languages. I wouldn&#39;t describe it as a high-end place but the cooking is very, very good for the price. Atmosphere is sort of retro 50&#39;s and 60&#39;s. You could just about imagine that Belmondo guy dropping in for a snack and a glass of red.<br><br> You could definitely take a date or a business associate here without being embarrassed.

I have to admit that I&#39;ve only been here twice, it&#39;s a very small &amp; cozy place, great service &amp; the food so far never has been a disappointment. During the week they have great lunch specials too. I think you have the option between 1 &amp; 2 &#34;new&#34; meals daily. You&#39;ll get a small complementary bowl with olives, bread &amp; if you choose the menu, you&#39;ll get the soup of the day &amp; your main course for like 7,50 € - which is not bad at all!<br><br>Yesterday I choose 43, which are fettuccine with fresh champignons in a cream sauce, delicious!!

My Korean friends told me that while restaurants in seoul kept evolving, this one remained traditional. <br>The service is excellent, they don&#39;t hesitate to advise you or explain to you how to eat things.<br>I took friends and collegues there, and even the ones that didn&#39;t know much about real Korean food liked it!",

It was quite hopping.dancing on tables, etc. Since then I&#39;ve heard that the Quali-Eck is apparently a very popular Stammkneipe in Sachsenhausen. Peering past the Fasching decorations it looked as if the place was rather plain. Colleagues tell me they also have a great St Martin&#39;s Gans Menu and are generally known for having Gutbürgerlich food and also as a Footie hangout.<br><br> Pretty far off the beaten path for me. Not sure I&#39;ll be headed back anytime soon but gave them 3 stars out of fear that my Altfrankfurter colleagues would give me some grief.",

Yet the food tastes better than at most sit-down places with menus and waiters. Half the customers are from the Indo/Pak region, the other half are often travelers passing through, for it&#39;s only a few blocks from the Ffm Hbf or businesspeople who know where to find the hidden, authentic stuff.",

"reviewcomment":"One of the few proper smoking venues left in Frankfurt after the attempt by the barbarians to outlaw smoking completely, I hope that this gem remains intact for many years to come.<br>Situated in the backyard-basement of one of the houses adjacent to the old opera of Frankfurt, the lounge seems at first unassuming and a bit dark.<br>However the selection of drinks and the walk-in-humidor offer an ecclectic mix for the smoking-minded palate. The bartender is exceedinly competent and knowledgeable in spite of his young age and the cocktails meet a very high standard.<br>I thouroughly recommend this place to anyone looking for a quiet cosy cigar lounge in Frankfurt.<br>An added plus is the low mobile reception due to the lounge being in the basement, sparing one the louts that sometimes frequent the other notable cigar bar the Cigarrum in the Frankfurter Hof.",

"reviewcomment":"Despite the odd statues at the entrance, and the seemingly erratic custom (sometimes packed and sometimes totally empty, without any apparent reason) this restaurant delivers a great service and great food.<br><br> We started with the carpaccio di manzo which was served beautifully thinly with lemon on the side to &#34;cook&#34; the meat with the traditional accompaniment of rocket and parmesan and also some sliced raw mushrooms which were a nice addition we had this together with a tasty caprese salad. We followed this with gnocchi in a gorgonzola sauce which was simply presented and creamily richly delicious and spaghettini with vongole biancho which though slightly over oily was very delicious and the olive oil itself was of a high quality so the taste wasn&#39;t spoilt. Finally we shared the panna cotta which was delicious, though the red sauce that it was served with was slightly over sweet and we had our suspicions that it was from a squeezy bottle of strawberry ice cream sauce.<br><br> All in all, a restaurant not to be over-looked. We&#39;ll certainly be coming back.",

The extraordinaray friendly owner has a strong affinity for jazz, as you can tell. ;) Excellent coffee, one of the best in town!<br>Also, try the hot chocolate specialities, especially during autumn/winter. There is a separate tea and hot chocolate menue! You can have, for instance, dark hot chocalate with pistaccio or white hot chocolate. This is so yummie!<br>The cakes are delicios too, delivered every day freshly from a local bakerey and pastry shop. <br>There is a decent wine list to while away a lazy afternoon or evening. The Crémant d&#39;Alsace is my favourite (sparkling) wine, but the Gewurztraminer is worth a try, too.<br>Overall, an excellent café  as real cafés should be!",

Cold soup which should be served hot. The sushi was not impressive and one piece tasted like it had gone bad. They claim to take EC card but do not indicate upfront that it you must have a bill of 12 euros or more. Lastly I think the food is kept at an unsafe temperature which can lead to a food-bourne illness. Sorry but I would never go back.",

"reviewcomment":"&#34;The Michael&#34;, as we lovingly call it ,-), is one of my favourite venues in the Gutleutviertel. It may be true that the bartender, Ludwig, sometimes seems a bit grumpy, but if you smile and joke with him hat usually dissolves within seconds and he is the most loveable person you can imagine! So is Loni, the owner, who sometimes also comes to take care of the guests. Guests are a wide mixture between those true &#34;Gutleutviertel&#34;-people, lawyers or bankers from the Westhafen or visitors from far far away. They are all welcome and mix well...<br><br> Food is &#34;honest&#34; German fare. Try what is on the weekly menu, the stuff is homemade, fresh and good. From the standard menu, the Schnitzels or Currywurst are a good choice. If you are lucky enough to be there on Gyros day, try it, it&#39;s crisp and tasty ... love it. As for drinks, &#34;The Michael&#34; is a place to drink Apfelwein, for sure, and I am not qualified to comment on the quality of the beer serve since I don&#39;t drink it anyway. All drinks are sold at very fair prices.<br><br> For the soccer lovers: you can watch Sky here, and even though the place is &#34;Eintracht-owned&#34;, fans of other teams can expect friendly tolerance if they behave well ;-)",

"reviewcomment":"New York Times claims that Frankfurt is becoming hipper due to (for one reason) its latest culinary establishments, Lamoraga being one of them. So we checked this place out ourselves to see how reliable NYT is.<br><br>Situated near Goetheplatz, this Spanish bistro is modern and hip with its open-faced kitchen to give us a feeling of spaciousness, cool concept of using pots of herbs as table decoration, and long wooden tables to promote communal dining. We came for weekday lunch, and even though I made a reservation, it didn&#39;t seem necessary.<br><br>Service was one of the best I&#39;ve experienced in Germany. Our server was friendly and always smiling, attentive, and helpful. <br><br>We shared some tapas: croquetas de choco (squid ink croquets), berenjenas a la brasa con Katsuobushi (honey grilled eggplant with boniko flakes), bull and lobster slider burgers, chorizo y huevo focaccia (baked chorizo and egg focaccia), and arroz con leche (Spanish rice pudding with orange zest and cinnamon) as dessert. I appreciate the chef&#39;s innovative take on Spanish tapas, and most of them were more or less palatable. I was disappointed with the lobster slider as the lobster meat was grounded and didn&#39;t have as much flavor as I expected. Our favorite was the berenjenas; it was simply scrumptious. The arroz con leche was a highlight too, but it was quite dense (best to share among others). It was no cheap lunch, but we left the place as satiated diners. I could easily come back here again to try the other dishes.<br><br>Thanks NYT for the recommendation!",

They have a good selection of beer and the patio is very nice. Try to avoid a hot day in summer since the patio fills up quickly and you will be stuck inside where there is no AC or air blowing in, its basically a hot sauna.",

A dear old friend who wasnt actualy a fan of such pricey FastFood introduced Chaang Thai to me ages ago as I was still at JWG Univ.<br><br>Yupe, love at the very first bite ;) No wonder the Q is always miles long during lunch time. At first I couldnt believe my eyes that even the Big Potatoes from the &#39;Börse&#39; nearby and bankers as well as the locals and tourists joining our line.<br><br>I got used to hot and spicy food ever since I was a little girl, so I always check the &#39;Sambal&#39; or Spicy Corner! Yupe, excellent as the rest of the dishes. As I dont consume such fast food daily, I pay less attention if the add some Glutamates or not.<br><br>-<br>As I&#39;ve been there quite often, I think I have to share one but simple bad experience from my latest visit.<br><br>They hardly had stuffs in the pots and my fave #4 was Sold Out... I hope the things in our tasteless cups (even 3 spoons Sambal didnt help) were because it was already very late afternoon and they just simple gave us their best rest! :)",

"reviewcomment":"Germans seem to love their gelato. You&#39;ll find a lot of little gelato places dotting the Frankfurt core. This place is just up from the &#34;old town&#34; historical district. It&#39;s a nice respite from a day of museums on the south bank of the Main river. Runs about one euro a scoop (try finding that kind of decent price in the tourist areas of Toronto). The Engelblua flavor was the real stand out.
