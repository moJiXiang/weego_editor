"reviewcomment":"I think it&#39;s funny to read other reviews refer to the alley as sketchy. Come visit me in Los Angeles LOL! It&#39;s off the beaten path, possibly on the outskirts of the 11th but it&#39;s still a wonderful area. The restaurant isn&#39;t fancy, it looks like a swiss tavern but the food and the people are wonderful. The menu changes constantly, it&#39;s all small plates so bring friends so you can try everything. Or just be a pig like me and over-order :) <br><br>It was this restaurant where I first noticed the difference between French dining and American dining. First of all, reservations are hard to get. The tables don&#39;t turn over as quickly as they do here in the US. The whole experience is more relaxed, there&#39;s no pressure to eat quick and get out. Good food takes time. And the extra time between courses is spent chatting, laughing, ordering more wine. Dining in Paris is on par with going to a museum, food is art. And just like art you may get something that isn&#39;t necessarily your taste but you&#39;re better for having had the opportunity to appreciate it.",

"reviewcomment":"Wow, one of the best meals I have ever had. <br><br>We showed up at 12:15 for 12:30 reservations. We lucked out there. We were the first in the restaurant and were seated immediately. After us the restaurant filled over the next hour and those without reservations were turned away. Not sure if there were gaps between the courses at other tables, but ours transitions were prompt, except for dessert, because by then every other table was on their main courses.<br><br>Service was pleasant and attentive. The restaurant was comfortable. <br><br>My lack of French was no problem.<br><br>For 60 euros you get a 4 course meal, or for 100 you get a 6 courses tasting meal. We got the 4 course, which was a comfortable amount. For an extra 20 we also got the tea pairing.<br><br>The &#34;welcome&#34; beverage was a chilled jasmine tea.<br><br>The starter was an almost bite sized crab spring roll. It was crispy and tasty. I wanted more.<br><br>The first course was a cold dish. Smoked tofu and cucumber. It reminds me of the pickled, sweet cucumber you would get a Chinese restaurant, but the smoked tofu kicked it up a notch and it tasted amazing.<br><br>The second course was a summer truffle, lobster, mushrooms, and almonds, paired with a black tea. Very savory.<br><br>Either the third or the fourth course was my favorite. <br><br>The third course was tuna, tomatoes, squid, and xo sauce with steamed Chinese bread. The Xo sauce had some spice to it. The steamed bread was extremely airy and fluffy (we were wondering what they do differently in France) but it was awesome. It was paired with &#34;Four years tea&#34;... which was the only thing I did not finish at the meal. <br><br>The fourth course was a steamed pollock, clams, black rice, and chicken broth. Also another savory combination. Paired with white tea. <br><br>For the last course you have the options of dessert or cheese. We got the dessert of course. The dessert was two separate dishes, a perfectly done apricot and blueberry tart and a sorbet in a fruity sauce. This was paired with &#34;southwest&#34; Chinese tea. <br><br>Amazing meal. My only suggestion is if you have had a lot of Chinese tea in the past, the tea pairing may not blow you away, but I thought it was worth it. Would visit again, without question.",

Nice biz model. <br><br>Okay, so the selection of choices are very much the same as one in NYC or CDG airport location, except they had this new box with fruty taste which were flying out of shelf, thanks to Japanese tourists once again. I tried a piece, didn&#39;t thing it was that good, so I went with traditional (boring) dark chocolate collection. <br><br>Oh, and last note, they had ice cream stand outside, and dark chocolate ice cream was out of this world.

When I first came to Paris 15 years ago I searched from the top of the Eiffel Tower to the shores of the Seine for the very best the city has to offer, and it&#39;s still the best after all these years later. The decor is classic French, chocolate colored chic and understated luxury with the focus on their chocolate displays which line the shop. White gloved salespersons with sincere smiles and an in depth knowledge of every piece stand by to help you make your decision. The dark pralines are my favorite. You can ask for a small book explaining each piece and you can keep it as a souvenir. During the summer they make the most perfect ice cream to compliment your Parisian stroll. I recommend cerise and dark chocolate. During the winter they offer true hot chocolate to warm your hands and delight your mouth. Regardless of when you make it to the city of Lights be sure to visit this place, offering the city&#39;s very best chocolate.",

"reviewcomment":"I think it&#39;s funny to read other reviews refer to the alley as sketchy. Come visit me in Los Angeles LOL! It&#39;s off the beaten path, possibly on the outskirts of the 11th but it&#39;s still a wonderful area. The restaurant isn&#39;t fancy, it looks like a swiss tavern but the food and the people are wonderful. The menu changes constantly, it&#39;s all small plates so bring friends so you can try everything. Or just be a pig like me and over-order :) <br><br>It was this restaurant where I first noticed the difference between French dining and American dining. First of all, reservations are hard to get. The tables don&#39;t turn over as quickly as they do here in the US. The whole experience is more relaxed, there&#39;s no pressure to eat quick and get out. Good food takes time. And the extra time between courses is spent chatting, laughing, ordering more wine. Dining in Paris is on par with going to a museum, food is art. And just like art you may get something that isn&#39;t necessarily your taste but you&#39;re better for having had the opportunity to appreciate it.",

I wound up picking out a chocolate mousse and caramel confection which, I must say, was absolutely delicious - and looked as good as it tasted. The staff were accommodating and helpful and even added a gold chocolate Birthday plaque to my cake when I told them it was for a birthday. Arnaud Larher was awarded &#34;meilleur ouvrier de France&#34; - a very prestigious award essentially guaranteeing that no matter what pastry or cake you select, it will be delicious. Furthermore, if you happen to be even somewhat close to the area you would be crazy to not get something here. Superb. I wanted to try everything - the artistry of the pastries was as impressive as the taste. Not cheap, but after that cake I found myself hoping another special event - any event - would come up and give me an excuse to go back again!",

"reviewcomment":"After hearing only good things about Colorova I decided to take my family here when they came to visit. It was such a pleasant experience that I plan on bringing all future visitors here for breakfast! <br><br>The decor is really quirky and unlike any other place in Paris. It is so original to see something different in Paris and to see bright and colourful art covering the walls. <br><br>What I was most surprised at was how reasonably priced the breakfast menu here was. I would even be tempted to say it is one of the most reasonable breakfasts I&#39;ve come across. For 12 euro you&#39;ll receive a selection jams and chocolate spread with bread, a fruit compote with fromage frais, French toast, a hot drink and a glass of freshly squeezed orange juice. Everything which we tried was delicious and I was thankful for a refreshingly different breakfast menu which forced me to try things which I might not ordinarily have chosen. <br><br>The service was wonderful and the experience was ever so happy.<br><br>The patisseries in the cabinet looked divine, whilst we didn&#39;t get the chance to try them I&#39;m sure they would taste as good as they look. Another thing which always pleases me is being able to see a chef at work and here you&#39;re able to see through to the kitchen where the pastry chef was carefully putting together her beautiful creations.",

"reviewcomment":"Without a doubt my favourite foodie shop in all of Paris.  I haven&#39;t had a chance to visit Pierre Hermé and I&#39;ve been told they have the best macarons...but if I were to compare Ladurée and Fauchon, I prefer the macarons from La Grande Epicerie hands down.  My fav is the pistachio macarons which has the most delectable creaming filling.  I&#39;ve bought these numerous times for friends, even mailed boxes to Ireland and it arrived with just as much flavour.<br><br>I also enjoy just perusing the isles and indulging in purchasing some fine olive oil or getting lost in their rows of butter -- you must try Beurre d&#39;Echire -- takes butter to the next level. <br><br>the pre-made savouries were not as incredible but I&#39;ll keep coming back just for the experience and pleasure of taking in all that a Sunday afternoon grocery shopping in Paris could offer!",

"reviewcomment":"Best crepes I&#39;ve ever had. Period.<br><br>I went to an event at a bar across the street, and my friend told me to stop here for a quick bite beforehand, so I went in and ordered the complet: ham (or turkey, but I picked ham), cheese, an egg, and a veggie of choice (I picked onions. Best choice ever). Good lord. Each bite was as perfect as it gets. I wish I hadn&#39;t eaten it so fast because when it was over, all I could do was cry. Seriously, best crepe ever. Hands down.<br><br>So later, after the event, my friend got hungry and she decided to get a crepe too, so I went with her, and ended up getting a sweet crepe with sugar, strawberries, and cinnamon. Oh my god! Heaven on earth exists only in that crepe, and that&#39;s a fact.<br><br>So, if me telling you that one crepe at this place was the best crepe ever isn&#39;t enough to convince you, then perhaps the knowledge that I had 2 of them in a 2 hour period, and both were the best thing I&#39;ve ever put in my mouth, should be enough to prove that there is no other crepe in this world.

"reviewcomment":"Beautiful fusion of Japanese flavors and French style desserts. The look of the place is really minimalist in design with clean white counters. Contradicts the historically exquisite streets that Paris is known for but not unlike a lot of newer/hipster-y shops popping up all over the city. <br><br>Lady behind the counter was a little snobbish but after tasting my eclair and macarons I felt like she had the right to be. The yuzu macaron is something I will remember for the rest of my life and the matcha eclair still gives me the chills now.<br><br>Also the giant glass front door to get inside looks confusing at first but don&#39;t worry it&#39;s not that hard.<br><br>Do not, whatsoever, leave the 6ème without paying a visit here. Take your goodies and snack on them in the Luxembourg Gardens while people-watching on a nice day. It&#39;ll be another of many reasons to fall in love with Paris.",

"reviewcomment":"The best macarons in Paris, bar none. While I highly encourage everyone to try the different places that offer macarons, our taste test experiment (and subsequent podast of it on my website) had Pierre Herme macarons as the winner, hands down!<br><br>While they are slightly more expensive, you actually feel like you are indulging. The flavor combinations are nothing short of decadent and brilliant and the fair amount of filling made you feel like it was a perfect little treat. (The other macarons we tried were lacking filling, pet peeve of mine.) <br><br>I&#39;ll be going back next time I&#39;m in Paris!",

Ah, the last one!&#34;  <br><br>Seems everyone there speaks perfect English (one of those places where you don&#39;t dare try to muddle through in poor French!)  They also carry some interesting single malts NOT from Scotland, including a real barn burner we enjoy from Sweden - in fact, they had seven or eight variations of that one alone, none of which can be found in the United States.<br><br>Here&#39;s a bizarre tip!  The duty-free store in the Charles de Gaulle airport (Terminal 1) has a duty-free store with an excellent selection of single malts, and in fact, we&#39;ve made some very good finds there as well.  Turns out that if you are purchasing for travel within Europe, the prices are very much comparable to those of Le Maison du Whiskey, but... if you&#39;re LEAVING THE EU, about 20% LESS, as of course, the taxes are deducted from the price.   Of course, you never know what you will find there until you&#39;re leaving the country.  <br><br>C&#39;est la vie",

"reviewcomment":"Pierre Hermé has THE best macarons ever. Without a doubt, it is better than Ladurée. <br><br>Those little suckers will cost you a pretty penny, but they&#39;re worth every cent. The pairing of flavors for their macarons meld well and are usually unexpected. If you don&#39;t care for more unique or exotic flavors, then perhaps Ladurée and the others will do. But even then, just based on texture alone, PH wins- it&#39;s chewy and not flakey, which I think makes it more consistent than Ladurée. <br><br>I tried as many as I could when I was in France, and I particularly liked this one macaron with olive oil. I also like how there&#39;s a nice fruity center for some of them. What makes Pierre Hermé different is that it always comes up with cool flavors- they brought out the yogurt line, which really did taste like that tart froyo you get at those ubiquitous stores. <br><br>I also tried their sorbet- the lychee, rose, and raspberry combination, which is quite a popular trio of both Pierre Hermé and Ladurée. That was good and refreshing, and big enough to be shared. On the other hand, their ice cream sandwiches were just so-so and a mess to eat. Sadly, I don&#39;t think I tried their other goodies... maybe a croissant, but no recollection of it if so. <br><br>I tried as many pâtisseries in Paris as I could, from those local ones in the various arrondissements to the more popular and well-known ones, and I can confidently say Pierre Hermé has the best and innovative macarons.",

Thankfully this wasn&#39;t the case. Whilst there wasn&#39;t an enormous selection, there was the choice of four patisseries which was ample for us. We opted for the magnificent vanilla millefeuille. It was out of this world - I thought that the one at Cafe Pouchkine was incredible but I must admit that I fear this one is even better.<br><br>Not only was the service impeccable but they also gave us a few complimentary chocolates to try which I thought was such a lovely touch.<br><br>Whilst some people argue that its very expensive at 8 euro a hot chocolate, I would have to disagree - it is no more expensive than any of the other chocolate specialists in Paris and the quality which you&#39;re paying for is worth every penny.",

This is THE dish. THE dessert. It&#39;s a candied &#34;glass ball&#34; and inside there is a Souffle with oozing caramel, cream, and ice cream, and dessert of the gods.  Yes, I wish I was a liar and no I am not freaking kidding you.  This place does not allow you to &#34;not have and/or share dessert&#34; Mais non!  In front of my appeared Le café expresso en sabayon, ganache gouette, crème glacee brelee amandres ecrasses...a tower of coffee sabayon, chocolate mouse, ganache creme brulee contraption that was oh so delicious.  And platters and platters of assortment of chocolates, pastries, marshmellows, cookies, macaroons.  Put a fork in me, I was done what I thought was a while ago but I cannot.stop.eating. and I&#39;m not even sorry.<br><br>This is more than just food, more than just dinner, this is an experience that will change your life.  This will open your mind and perception to how food should be plated, presented, served. It&#39;s a once in a lifetime opportunity to experience first class customer service and eat delectable food that is fine crafted artwork that tastes out of this world and unlike anything you&#39;ve ever had before.<br><br>Keep an eye out for the &#34;ladies of the night&#34; eying their prey outside the grounds and along the road back to Paris.",

I have been seriously missing out.. <br><br>The decor is that of a quintessentially French bakery with a beautiful tiled ceiling, big antique mirrors and adorned frescoes. It&#39;s probably one of the most romantic bakeries I&#39;ve ever entered and its exterior is equally as pretty. <br><br>I&#39;m not over exaggerating when I say that the whole street smells of the sweet smell of freshly baked croissants. I did a spot of shopping in the outlet stores along the road before I went to the bakery and my mouth was literally watering at the heavenly smell!<br><br>I got one of their famous escargot as I heard that was the done thing and it was super - although everything in there looked and as I mentioned smelt incredible! Next time i plan on getting the chausson aux pommes - made with fresh apples and one of the savoury stuffed bread rolls which looked amazing!<br><br>The only downside is the long queue - bu hey you know it&#39;s got to be good when Parisians are willing to wait for it ;)",

"reviewcomment":"Wow, one of the best meals I have ever had. <br><br>We showed up at 12:15 for 12:30 reservations. We lucked out there. We were the first in the restaurant and were seated immediately. After us the restaurant filled over the next hour and those without reservations were turned away. Not sure if there were gaps between the courses at other tables, but ours transitions were prompt, except for dessert, because by then every other table was on their main courses.<br><br>Service was pleasant and attentive. The restaurant was comfortable. <br><br>My lack of French was no problem.<br><br>For 60 euros you get a 4 course meal, or for 100 you get a 6 courses tasting meal. We got the 4 course, which was a comfortable amount. For an extra 20 we also got the tea pairing.<br><br>The &#34;welcome&#34; beverage was a chilled jasmine tea.<br><br>The starter was an almost bite sized crab spring roll. It was crispy and tasty. I wanted more.<br><br>The first course was a cold dish. Smoked tofu and cucumber. It reminds me of the pickled, sweet cucumber you would get a Chinese restaurant, but the smoked tofu kicked it up a notch and it tasted amazing.<br><br>The second course was a summer truffle, lobster, mushrooms, and almonds, paired with a black tea. Very savory.<br><br>Either the third or the fourth course was my favorite. <br><br>The third course was tuna, tomatoes, squid, and xo sauce with steamed Chinese bread. The Xo sauce had some spice to it. The steamed bread was extremely airy and fluffy (we were wondering what they do differently in France) but it was awesome. It was paired with &#34;Four years tea&#34;... which was the only thing I did not finish at the meal. <br><br>The fourth course was a steamed pollock, clams, black rice, and chicken broth. Also another savory combination. Paired with white tea. <br><br>For the last course you have the options of dessert or cheese. We got the dessert of course. The dessert was two separate dishes, a perfectly done apricot and blueberry tart and a sorbet in a fruity sauce. This was paired with &#34;southwest&#34; Chinese tea. <br><br>Amazing meal. My only suggestion is if you have had a lot of Chinese tea in the past, the tea pairing may not blow you away, but I thought it was worth it. Would visit again, without question.",

We all ended up getting seconds after our first double scoop- we couldn&#39;t resist .. And that has never happened.  We went back every day for the rest of our stay in Paris..",

You can tell that an enormous amount of expertise has gone into each of his creations simply by looking at them. On top of that they taste incredible! <br><br>The Marie-Antoinette is similar to Pierre Herme&#39;s famous Ispahan except it tastes so much better. Every single one of his patisseries is perfect. I&#39;ve tried a fair few of them by now and haven&#39;t ever been disappointed.<br><br>I only wish his patisserie were a tiny bit more central so that it could be frequented by more people and celebrated as it deserves.",

Oh the coffee!! Delicious!! Frothed perfectly and rich in flavor! Yum yum yum!<br><br>Only problem was there wasn&#39;t enough!! I slowly sipped at my cappuccino and tried so hard to make it last.. If the cup was a little bigger I think I&#39;d be back here every week, but 4€ for what&#39;s considered a &#34;small&#34; in Australia is a little out of my weekly budget... Guess this will be the &#34;treat&#34; coffee for when I need some espresso-y goodness!! <br><br>The vibe of the cafe is trendy and bright, and the staff didn&#39;t make us feel unwelcome, just left us to ourselves - even a little after the cafe had closed!",

ON. TAP.<br><br>For those that are very inexperienced with mustard, like myself, the staff at the counter is very helpful to discuss what intensity or flavors you are interested in. After deciding that the truffle was a bit too mild for us, we settle on the Chablis mustard.  How did we know this? They have tastings right there for you. It is all very customer friendly.<br><br>They also have two gigantic walls filled with flavor infused mustard that you can get lost in, if that&#39;s your type of thing.<br><br>In addition to getting fantastic mustard for a relatively affordable price, we were told that our container is refillable upon return to the store, similar to how the American beer growler system works.  That pushes it down to very affordable for the mustard lover.<br><br>9/10",

"reviewcomment":"When the wife and I look for travel gifts, a bag of local roasted coffee oft comes to mind. Thus we went on the Googlenets, and it handily pointed us towards Café Lomi on the outskirts of Paris. It helped that Café Lomi was walking distance from our already booked event at Cook&#39;n with Class (<a href='http://www.yelp.com/biz/cook-n-with-class-paris-2#hrid:oFILMW2iZBuZGdUhyYhrlw'>yelp.com/biz/cook-n-with…</a>), making it a hop &amp; skip away rather than the jump it would normally take from Paris&#39; center.<br><br>Another funny thing about the Google results.

"reviewcomment":"The Paris I met while traveling alone in late-October was exhilarating, rainy, more romantic than I had dreamt, and quite challenging - as it turns out, 4 years of high school+ 5 semesters of college French don&#39;t get you very far if you&#39;ve done little to maintain it. Still, a fearless me struck up conversations anywhere I could - at numerous cafés, the cemetery (there&#39;s a story there: <a href='http://www.yelp.com/biz/cimetiere-du-p%C3%A8re-lachaise-paris-2#hrid:zo3yaP_sgpJ1ptxNzM2n_Q'>yelp.com/biz/cimetiere-d…</a>), and at the charming Le Petit Fer à Cheval.<br><br>Walking by this bar on a lively stretch near my rental flat in the Marais, I caught a glimpse of a picture I wanted to be in - a little horseshoe-shaped bar surrounded by Parisians in their effortlessly cool ensembles, drinking and laughing and reading. Seating is scarce so don&#39;t be surprised when you spy the impossibly handsome well-sweatered stranger standing toward the bar intently reading his book whilst drinking a glass of red wine. 1.5 hours later? Still standing; still reading.<br><br>I didn&#39;t chat up the stranger, but I made several new friends that cold, rainy night... we drank champagne, spoke more English than French, and talked about the upcoming election (ours). Le Petit Fer à Cheval is where you&#39;ll find the real Paris, along with the people who know her and love her. <br><br>A+.",

"reviewcomment":"Le Supercoin est l&#39;oasis de biere artisanale en Paris! (Pardon, ce clavier americain ici n&#39;a pas des accents). Haha, mais je ne parle pas francais, vraiment. En Anglais:<br><br>&#34;As good as it gets!&#34; is literally true, in this case! When I visited Paris in mid-April, I was impressed with the pervasiveness of the wine culture - that is, ALL IS WINE. Had I been there with a willing accompaniment, and for more than two nights, I would have certainly dug in with a vengeance. From the looks of the labels (and I have experience judging wine by the label, since I work in a wine shop), plenty of delicious wine can be had for 4-5 euros a bottle.<br><br>But I was not there to learn what everybody knows! I was there to find the craft beer...and unless I was lied to, Le Supercoin is approximately the THIRD craft beer bar in the whole city. And it had just opened two weeks before!<br><br>So 5 stars is requisite. Digging deeper...by American standards, the tap selection (3) is small. But these taps produce high-quality, interesting French beer. And the bottle selection is fairly diverse and interesting. I had La Franche Galle (good witbier) and Agent Provocateur Blonde Artisanal (good Belgian-style blonde) on tap, and Brasserie du Mont Saleve Sorachi Ace Bitter (2.5% alc, nominally malted and lusciously single-hopped with Sorachi Ace hops) and Agent Provocateur Cuvee d&#39;Oscar (some kind of vintage ale: intense cherry/plum/fig dried fruit notes morphing into a surprisingly dry wheat-y finish).<br><br>Those bottled beers were a) marvelous and b) quite distinct from anything I&#39;ve had in America/Britain. But that&#39;s secondary; what matters is Le Supercoin is at the very forefront of Parisian craft beer, working in a MUCH less beer-appreciation-conditioned environment than ours. The environment is casual. The young woman working behind the bar was jovial and spoke pretty good English, which combined with my awful French (I&#39;ve had plenty of school credits; I should be better) was a lot of fun. Craft beer and jolliness seem to go hand in hand, you know? Biere artisanale, une langue universel!<br><br>Ah, important note: Le Supercoin was recommended to me by Simon, the owner of La Cave a Bulles <a href='http://www.yelp.com/biz/la-cave-%C3%A0-bulles-paris-2'>yelp.com/biz/la-cave-à-b…</a>.

I knew it was a good place when the croissants are good, buttery, flaky with a little powdered sugar on top. <br>2. Almond pastry - also yummy. Almond paste inside.<br>3. Sandwich with tomato and goat cheese - they toast your sandwich warm. Very good!  Really good for lunch.<br>4. Cherry coke - seems to taste more &#34;cherrier&#34; in France. Yum. <br>PRICES: Very cheap! E1 for croissant and E1.50 for the almond pastry, E3.80 for the sandwich. CASH ONLY.<br>CONLCUSION: Want to come back again!

"reviewcomment":"I was recently in Paris for the first time. After eating here, I was surprised to see how few reviews this place has on Yelp. As a US native, I took a risk by ordering the classic American specialty, a cheeseburger and fries (I know, I&#39;m a typical American, but I couldn&#39;t help myself).<br><br>Needless to say, I was blown away. I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s because I haven&#39;t had a cheeseburger and fries in over a year, but this was hands down a way better cheeseburger than I&#39;ve ever had here in America. I informed the waiter of this, and he asked me if he could have that in writing. But I&#39;m serious. It&#39;s probably because the French tend to use a lot less poison in their food and a little more love than a typical American meal.<br><br>I also had my first ever Creme Brulee - and it was incredible!<br><br>Also, the waiter didn&#39;t throw me through a glass window when I announced that I was not familiar with French like I expected him to.

"reviewcomment":"When you think of Paris and its food, pastries and breads and cheeses easily come to mind.  But when I think of Paris, I can&#39;t help but to think of saucisson, pâté, and terrines, and for those, Gilles Verot definitely does them right.  But you don&#39;t have to just take my word for it, just look at the lines of people constantly flocking their counters and you know they must be doing something right.  I highly recommend this place for their charcuterie and their quiches...everything that they pump out is delicious.  And being conveniently located right outside the metro stop, they are a perfect place to grab some food for an afternoon picnic.",

Because they do frozen coconut bubble tea with both tapioca pearls and coconut jelly (of which they have three flavors) and it is AMAZING. Perfectly blended, creamy, a good balance of tea and milk flavors. <br><br>There are tons of options for teas, so take your time and choose carefully.

The 1-star loss is due to the fact that you have to get to Berko earlier in the day because they run out of cheesecake fast.

"reviewcomment":"This is fast food Parisian style and I loved it!  <br><br>We had just finished a grueling 5 hour walking tour and the eight of us were STARVING and just dying to sit down.  We walked in to Boco to check it out.  I&#39;ll be honest, I saw a bunch of jars in a refrigerator case and I wanted to turn right back around and leave but I&#39;m glad we didn&#39;t.<br><br>We were all looking around a little (okay, maybe a lot) confused when a woman approached us to welcome us and explain the concept of the place.  They have seasonal menus that change every few months.  All of their recipes are developed by Michelin rated chefs (their pictures and rating above the fridge), they use fresh organic ingredients and everything is cooked there and then put in small jars to be reheated.<br><br>You pick what you want, the dishes are separated into appetizers, entrees and desserts, you take it to the register and pay.  They take the jars and heat them up (in the jar) and you get it a few minutes later.  I wasn&#39;t convinced until my first bite.<br><br>I tried the quinoa salad with citrus which was served cold and was very refreshing.  I also tried a bite of the bfs tomato stuffed with goat cheese, also served cold, which sounded so simple and boring but was really amazing.  <br><br>For my entree I had the vegetable quiche which was more like a vegetable and egg souffle or pudding.  It was smooth and luscious and the vegetables had a nice crunch and you could taste the freshness.  The pollack with black rice risotto was absolutely insane!  I was afraid to get it because the idea of reheated fish in a jar was just a little too much for me to handle but I couldn&#39;t stop stealing bites of it.  The fish was moist and flaky and I still find it hard to believe that it was reheated in a jar.  It just doesn&#39;t seem possible!!!!<br><br>Dessert was the ultimate happy ending.  I had the chocolate and caramel pudding with caramelized walnuts.  It was so silky and decadent and the walnuts were a great touch, adding texture and earthiness.  I also tried the summer berry pudding which was sweet and tart and very satisfying.  <br><br>Exhausted from our 5 hour walk and full from a terrific meal, we spoke some more to the woman who I think is the owner or manager.  We tried convincing her to come home with us and open a Boco in Los Angeles.  She invited us back for another meal because it was the last day of the current menu and we wish we had been able to find the time to make it back.  It was THAT good.<br><br>If you are in Paris and want something fast and casual but still of high quality and freshness do NOT be taken aback by the jars in the refrigerator case.  The food here is the real deal!!!",

So legitimate that my boyfriend, who is used to drinking non-legit syrupy crap bubble tea, ended up _not_ liking it because having actual tea in the bubble tea is too bitter for him. For your reference, he was drinking the passion fruit green tea with tapioca (5.50), which was surprisingly not overly sweet like the usual crappy bubble tea shops that have popped up everywhere, lowering the overall marketability of bubble tea..but I digress.<br><br>I had the coconut milk tea with tapioca and it was great. The tapioca is del dente and the tea was not overdosed with coconut milk. The price is high, but normal for Paris at 4-5.50EUR per bubble tea. All the owner and workers are Taiwanese, so you know you&#39;re in the right place. I&#39;m a fan.",

Six of them, please.<br><br>They also sell a bunch of gluten-free baking goods from the UK, like Dove baking mix.<br><br>In the bakery, they also sell pizza, which is pretty good.<br><br>Gluten free notes: see above.

"reviewcomment":"He has a chess set in white and dark chocolate, kouign amann, mendiants, caramels, and of course chocolates. His shop is more casual than any MOF establishment I&#39;ve ever entered, with bins of self service varieties so you can pick as many or few of his creations as you would like and items are weighed at the counter. His designs are literally works of art, recreating eggs, mussels, and truffles but made with chocolate!<br>Everything tastes as good as it looks. <br><br>My favorites are the truffle with crispy bits inside, the salted caramel, and the seashells made with dark chocolate. My friends loved he mussels with a hazelnut milk chocolate filling and I can&#39;t wait to go back and try the kouign amann.",

They like to feature rose in them, so do try their éclairs and macarons. :) I&#39;ve had their cheesecake and Paris-Brest. I can&#39;t say how the Paris-Brest compares to other ones because it was my first one ever, but it was deliciously hazelnutty and light. Love it! :) <br><br>Dominique Saibron is a little far out, so I&#39;m not sure if I would make a trip there JUST for their pastries, but if you&#39;re in the area, definitely check it out.

"reviewcomment":"Le Supercoin est l&#39;oasis de biere artisanale en Paris! (Pardon, ce clavier americain ici n&#39;a pas des accents). Haha, mais je ne parle pas francais, vraiment. En Anglais:<br><br>&#34;As good as it gets!&#34; is literally true, in this case! When I visited Paris in mid-April, I was impressed with the pervasiveness of the wine culture - that is, ALL IS WINE. Had I been there with a willing accompaniment, and for more than two nights, I would have certainly dug in with a vengeance. From the looks of the labels (and I have experience judging wine by the label, since I work in a wine shop), plenty of delicious wine can be had for 4-5 euros a bottle.<br><br>But I was not there to learn what everybody knows! I was there to find the craft beer...and unless I was lied to, Le Supercoin is approximately the THIRD craft beer bar in the whole city. And it had just opened two weeks before!<br><br>So 5 stars is requisite. Digging deeper...by American standards, the tap selection (3) is small. But these taps produce high-quality, interesting French beer. And the bottle selection is fairly diverse and interesting. I had La Franche Galle (good witbier) and Agent Provocateur Blonde Artisanal (good Belgian-style blonde) on tap, and Brasserie du Mont Saleve Sorachi Ace Bitter (2.5% alc, nominally malted and lusciously single-hopped with Sorachi Ace hops) and Agent Provocateur Cuvee d&#39;Oscar (some kind of vintage ale: intense cherry/plum/fig dried fruit notes morphing into a surprisingly dry wheat-y finish).<br><br>Those bottled beers were a) marvelous and b) quite distinct from anything I&#39;ve had in America/Britain. But that&#39;s secondary; what matters is Le Supercoin is at the very forefront of Parisian craft beer, working in a MUCH less beer-appreciation-conditioned environment than ours. The environment is casual. The young woman working behind the bar was jovial and spoke pretty good English, which combined with my awful French (I&#39;ve had plenty of school credits; I should be better) was a lot of fun. Craft beer and jolliness seem to go hand in hand, you know? Biere artisanale, une langue universel!<br><br>Ah, important note: Le Supercoin was recommended to me by Simon, the owner of La Cave a Bulles <a href='http://www.yelp.com/biz/la-cave-%C3%A0-bulles-paris-2'>yelp.com/biz/la-cave-à-b…</a>.

His shop is more casual than any MOF establishment I&#39;ve ever entered, with bins of self service varieties so you can pick as many or few of his creations as you would like and items are weighed at the counter. His designs are literally works of art, recreating eggs, mussels, and truffles but made with chocolate!<br>Everything tastes as good as it looks. <br><br>My favorites are the truffle with crispy bits inside, the salted caramel, and the seashells made with dark chocolate.

The staff at both locations I&#39;ve been to is friendly, despite some reviews to the contrary. The only downsides are the price and the fact that they hold back on some flavors. The macha macaron barely tastes like anything. Maybe it&#39;s in anticipation of the fact that the French can&#39;t handle a lot of intense flavors and spices.

"reviewcomment":"I was recently in Paris for the first time. After eating here, I was surprised to see how few reviews this place has on Yelp. As a US native, I took a risk by ordering the classic American specialty, a cheeseburger and fries (I know, I&#39;m a typical American, but I couldn&#39;t help myself).<br><br>Needless to say, I was blown away. I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s because I haven&#39;t had a cheeseburger and fries in over a year, but this was hands down a way better cheeseburger than I&#39;ve ever had here in America. I informed the waiter of this, and he asked me if he could have that in writing. But I&#39;m serious. It&#39;s probably because the French tend to use a lot less poison in their food and a little more love than a typical American meal.<br><br>I also had my first ever Creme Brulee - and it was incredible!<br><br>Also, the waiter didn&#39;t throw me through a glass window when I announced that I was not familiar with French like I expected him to.

I had read about Apicius on a blog that noted it as one of the &#34;trendiest&#34; spots in Paris. I don&#39;t know if Trendy is a word I would use to describe it... (fancy, upscale are more suiting) <br><br>It gets a 5 because it was an EPIC meal and an experience that will never be forgotten. It was the perfect place for an event like this as the setting could not be more spectacular. The restaurant is in a beautiful chateau which a huge courtyard that is decorated with lights and sculptures right at the end of the Champs Elyes. <br><br>When you first are greeted they direct you over to the bar to have a drink (please note they are doing this as a gesture and not to &#34;make sure your table is ready&#39;) (we found this out after almost an hour of sitting at the bar). <br><br>Also be warned that there is no English menu and if you don&#39;t speak french they will have a translator come by. The Translator will ask you what you want, but not translate the whole menu (this was an experience to say the least). <br><br>I had the Crab and Vegetable salad, my boyfriend - the duck. Shared ice cream for dessert and had a bottle of champagne. <br><br>Food was wonderful, service was excellent, ambience epic. <br><br>Would we ever go back..? probably not.

"reviewcomment":"Cruise along the Seine River and find Paris like never before.<br>The only annoying things are the tourists though, who stand up all the time and try to record the whole cruise, blocking sights. You just have to find a great seat.<br>Excellent trip for EUR8 onwards, and extremely romantic at night. It is freezing in the winter though, but if you&#39;re strong, you can sit outside (everyone fled inside) and have a clear view of everything.<br>My suggestion: go around 6.30. You&#39;ll get a glimpse of sunset, a nice view of the right bank and in the return trip, you get a clear night shot of the exploding Eiffel.",

Even after being stuffed in a carry on bag, flown in an airplane, discarded on my kitchen table for two days, and then delivered to my mom&#39;s house these eclairs are unbelievable. But take it from me, you want to eat them fresh so if you are in the area, please indulge in these treats.<br><br>For those who really want to try a nibble of everything, this is the only pastry shop I visited that had mini chocolate croissants, beignets and cookies so you cold dole out your calories accordingly. <br><br>A historic shop with delicious sweet and savory treats.

The amount of time and effort they put into making these are astounding.  The eclaire is perfectly cool inside and outside tasted so fresh!  We also tried some premade sandwiches for our quick lunch and they were all very delicious and fresh!<br><br>I also picked up some stuff from the gift store, i got a rose and litchi tea, glazed chestnut set, fruit preserves and milk jam and a mushroom truffle spread.  I didnt want to buy too much as I thought they are probably just pretty to look at but probably wont taste anything special, boy was I wrong!! The tea has such a fragrant rose flavor and the fruit preserves (especially the milk jam) taste so delicate!! I am really kicking myself for not bringing more of these home.<br><br>If you are in paris please make sure to check fauchon out.  It is really easy to find and you wont be disappointed!!",

"reviewcomment":"This is fast food Parisian style and I loved it!  <br><br>We had just finished a grueling 5 hour walking tour and the eight of us were STARVING and just dying to sit down.  We walked in to Boco to check it out.  I&#39;ll be honest, I saw a bunch of jars in a refrigerator case and I wanted to turn right back around and leave but I&#39;m glad we didn&#39;t.<br><br>We were all looking around a little (okay, maybe a lot) confused when a woman approached us to welcome us and explain the concept of the place.  They have seasonal menus that change every few months.  All of their recipes are developed by Michelin rated chefs (their pictures and rating above the fridge), they use fresh organic ingredients and everything is cooked there and then put in small jars to be reheated.<br><br>You pick what you want, the dishes are separated into appetizers, entrees and desserts, you take it to the register and pay.  They take the jars and heat them up (in the jar) and you get it a few minutes later.  I wasn&#39;t convinced until my first bite.<br><br>I tried the quinoa salad with citrus which was served cold and was very refreshing.  I also tried a bite of the bfs tomato stuffed with goat cheese, also served cold, which sounded so simple and boring but was really amazing.  <br><br>For my entree I had the vegetable quiche which was more like a vegetable and egg souffle or pudding.  It was smooth and luscious and the vegetables had a nice crunch and you could taste the freshness.  The pollack with black rice risotto was absolutely insane!  I was afraid to get it because the idea of reheated fish in a jar was just a little too much for me to handle but I couldn&#39;t stop stealing bites of it.  The fish was moist and flaky and I still find it hard to believe that it was reheated in a jar.  It just doesn&#39;t seem possible!!!!<br><br>Dessert was the ultimate happy ending.  I had the chocolate and caramel pudding with caramelized walnuts.  It was so silky and decadent and the walnuts were a great touch, adding texture and earthiness.  I also tried the summer berry pudding which was sweet and tart and very satisfying.  <br><br>Exhausted from our 5 hour walk and full from a terrific meal, we spoke some more to the woman who I think is the owner or manager.  We tried convincing her to come home with us and open a Boco in Los Angeles.  She invited us back for another meal because it was the last day of the current menu and we wish we had been able to find the time to make it back.  It was THAT good.<br><br>If you are in Paris and want something fast and casual but still of high quality and freshness do NOT be taken aback by the jars in the refrigerator case.  The food here is the real deal!!!",

We also stopped by a few cafe&#39;s en route and everyone was really nice. <br><br>If you are worried about the &#34;rude frenchman&#34;, try this skeleton-key phrase that will let them know you are no &#34;ugly american tourist.&#34; You smile and say, &#34;je parle un pue francais parce que je suis stupide american touriste&#34;, which translates to &#34;I only speak a little french because i am a stupid american tourist.&#34; It&#39;s tried and true people! Be a little self-deprecating, leave your khakis, white tennis shoes and fanny pack in the hotel, and Paris will embrace you.",

"reviewcomment":"I was so happy to discover that this Aoki Sadaharu shop was just down the street from my vacation apartment. The store isn&#39;t large but it&#39;s sleek and modern and beautiful and everything is perfectly placed. I also love their packaging - you feel like you bought something special (and you did) when you walk out of there. The croissants were lovely, though they are on the sweeter side than some, but that makes sense since it&#39;s a pastry shop.<br><br>I&#39;d love to say that I tried a bunch of their desserts but I had been dreaming about their salted caramel tart for months before I came to Paris and was happy to discover that it more than lived up to my expectations so I got it every time I came by. I did try a bite of the lemon tart, and that was delicious as well, you&#39;ve gotta be a fan of tart lemon desserts for that one though - no mild lemon flavors there.",

"reviewcomment":"Not Your Average Pre-Packaged Ice Cream Cones<br><br>Visit: July 28<br><br>My husband and I were strolling down Bd Saint-Germain and the police had blocked off the street including the sidewalk so we took a side street detour and found Pierre Marcolini just 1 block off of Bd Saint-Germain. It was a hot summer day and we saw a sign outside the chocolatier advertising ice cream cones...what a perfect combination of divine chocolate and ice cream. The very classy storefront looks like you are walking into a high end, fine jewelers. The small interior was very cool and smelled redolent of dark chocolate. What a joy to breathe deeply! The sales person immediately came out from a back room when we walked in and smiled and gave us a warm welcome. I said we were interested in the ice cream cones and she showed us a list of 3 different flavors. I went with the basic flavors of chocolate and vanilla and my husband selected the caramel paired with vanilla. After she handed us the pre-packed ice cream cones which looked like any low cost, standard ice cream cone, she offered us a sample of dark chocolate covered ginger. Wowser! This little sample was a confectionary marvel. The dark chocolate was strong and sharp and melted away to sweetness followed by pure hot and brilliant ginger spiciness. My husband and I unwrapped our cool treats after exiting the store. There was a layer of crispy meringue covering the top of the ice cream with a drizzle of fudge. Half of the ice cream was milk chocolate and the other half was vanilla. The ice cream was good with a lovely creamy and smooth texture. I was enjoying my treat and happy with the ice cream but when I finished the ice cream on top of the cone, things changed from good to something special. It was like discovering a secret treasure trove of world class chocolate. The interior of the cone was coated with a thick layer of solid dark chocolate with only chocolate ice cream stuffed in the middle....chocolate and more chocolate...yes! It was delicious. My husband said his ice cream was delicious and the cone contained the solid dark chocolate too. Hey, with the dark chocolate plugging the bottom of the cone, one doesn&#39;t have to worry about ice cream dripping out the bottom. Double bonus! So if you need a treat to help cool you off, I recommend one of the ice cream cones from Pierre Marcolini.",

"reviewcomment":"Yum, I don&#39;t know whether to be happy or sad that I only discovered this place near the end of my trip to Paris. My mom and I were staying very near the bottom of the Mouffetard, but we had never really ventured up past the market area as the street turns into more of a touristy restaurant and shop area until we started searching for souvenirs. <br><br>While shopping I was feeling hungry so we stopped in for some gelato. Luckily both times we visited there was no line, though we passed it a few more times before leaving and the place was packed, so beware. The prices are really reasonable and a small cone gets you two flavors. They don&#39;t just slap the gelato into a cone, they shape it into the design of a flower - really beautiful <br><br>Over the course of trying out a few of the awesome flavors, my favorite was Macaron - almondy without being overpowering. <br><br>If you find yourself on this street, stop in and try some!",

"reviewcomment":"OK, I admit it. I&#39;m so over cupcakes. So when my cupcake loving friend dragged us down the semi sketchy sex-show filled streets of Pigalle to find this cupcake shop, I definitely obliged her begrudgingly.<br><br>We walked in a few minutes before closing, but the delightful vintage pink and green rockabilly atmosphere immediately perked me up. The two shop girls are seriously cool and were excited to show us their Marilyn Monroe statue in the back as well as explain (in English, woo!) their beautifully decorated cupcakes of the day.<br><br>I honestly could have done without, but everything was so cute I could not resist. I ended up taking home three cupcakes that night. Blueberry and white chocolate, Raspberry and white chocolate, and something I could not understand due to language barriers.<br><br>They were just my style: not too sweet. In fact they were more like fruit muffins with white chocolate drizzles and fresh fruit, and edible glitter on top. It was so beautiful, it looked like a cupcake straight out of a fairy tale. <br><br>Definitely worth a stop if you&#39;re in the area to see a topless show and then craving some sweets.",

What could be more delicious than patisserie goods, apricot conficture and various cheeses for a continental and indulgent start to the day? Pretty much nothing. <br><br>The bread here is insane! I know that can be said for a lot of places in paris, but seriously...this has the upper hand on the insane ratio! I come to paris quite often, and I feel like I turn into a bread stick when visiting due to all the bread I eat, so declaring this as my favourite is quite a statement.

"reviewcomment":"Sometimes you just need to eat out - and when you do, sometimes all you really need are super foods. <br>The concept here is not that simple. Sol Semilla is a South American vegan restaurant which uses almost exclusively super foods in its concoctions. And not just any super food (there were no chia seeds in sight) - expect some maca, guaraná, açaí, spirulina and other ingredients that make my Brazilian heart skip a beat with joy.<br>But that&#39;s not all - if you happen to fall in love with the almost-instant benefits of these miracle fruits, roots and seeds, you can walk away with some of your own. The grocery shop part of Sol Semilla is sure to make one drool. Oh yeah, and they also host workshops and cooking classes. As I said, heaven on earth. <br>Now as for the price: c&#39;est pas donné, as the French say. 14,50 euros for the assiette du jour makes my wallet cringe a little bit, but 22,50 euros for the menu (drink or soup + main dish + dessert) is a justified price. I chose to drink the hot xocolatl (raw cocoa, urucum, pepper, agave, cinnamon), which I highly recommend. The assiette du jour included açaí caviar, grains with spirulina, a bunch of veggies cooked with cocoa... and so much more I can&#39;t even name. For dessert, I picked raw cocoa truffles which were simple to die for. I was the happiest camper by the time we left, not to say I was very tempted to just turn around and experience Sol Semilla all over again.",

"reviewcomment":"this place was special.  it sits across the place de vosges which is pretty and offers an old french feeling to it with the historic apartments on site.  it is kind of fancy shmancy with their silver kettle pots serving delicious thick hot chocolate.  it is pricey but the 12 euro express breakfast is a better deal  - expresso/cafe/chocolat + pain de chocolat/croissant/brioche. the chocolate croissant was good. <br><br>the macarons were amazing and memorable.  they were so moist.  the lemon basil and strawberry were my favorite.  slightly better than  ladurée&#39;s.  it is worth the visit to come here and admire the plaza and le marais.  also, if you buy the macarons to go, they are slightly cheaper (8 euros/5 vs 10 euros/5 at the cafe).",

"reviewcomment":"I had a lovely little lunch here with two girlfriends.  <br><br>You choose one of four or five dishes of the day (nothing massive, mostly several tartes (8,50€), a salad, and maybe one bigger dish to choose from), which in our case came with a little green salad and shredded carrots on the side.  Then choose from one of a whole bunch of desserts (5 € each; today&#39;s choices that I remember were a pear-hazelnut tarte and a walnut maple syrup tart, but there were also a bunch of others) that are just divine.  I have had a lot of desserts in Paris and these number among the best.  Just really great flavors without being too overwhelming or heavy.  Still, I wouldn&#39;t say this place is all that light... I would certainly need a bit of an appetite to have lunch here.<br><br>We got there around 11:30 and there wasn&#39;t anyone there yet, but an hour later it was pretty full.<br><br>The waitstaff was quite friendly.  We asked to come look at the desserts because we couldn&#39;t remember them all when they listed them, and they didn&#39;t seem to mind, which was nice.<br><br>I wouldn&#39;t hesitate to come back here.",

"reviewcomment":"Yum, I don&#39;t know whether to be happy or sad that I only discovered this place near the end of my trip to Paris. My mom and I were staying very near the bottom of the Mouffetard, but we had never really ventured up past the market area as the street turns into more of a touristy restaurant and shop area until we started searching for souvenirs. <br><br>While shopping I was feeling hungry so we stopped in for some gelato. Luckily both times we visited there was no line, though we passed it a few more times before leaving and the place was packed, so beware. The prices are really reasonable and a small cone gets you two flavors. They don&#39;t just slap the gelato into a cone, they shape it into the design of a flower - really beautiful <br><br>Over the course of trying out a few of the awesome flavors, my favorite was Macaron - almondy without being overpowering. <br><br>If you find yourself on this street, stop in and try some!",

"reviewcomment":"Remaining in the 7th, this time for a late breakfast after finally sleeping in one day, our stop at La Patisserie des Reves was perhaps the best breakfast of the trip - largely because there was really nothing breakfast about it.  With an elegant collection presented under glass domes and the pastries still warm from the oven the store purporting the best Paris Brest in the city delivered on its promise - unless of course you take into account the version at Le Pre Catalan that costs nearly 4x as much.  Flawless choux - crisp on the outside and nearly hollow within - thick praline cream, and a touch of confectioner&#39;s sugar - lovely, balanced, and not overly sweet.<br><br>Additional selections from La Patisserie des Reves included a densely packed apple croissant, a light and flaky pain au Valrhona chocolate, an enormous lemon accented Madeline, and a uniquely presented St. Honore with Chantilly Cream atop one finger of Vanilla Custard and Coffee Custard laden balls of Caramelized Choux resting atop a second - it was beautiful, it was delicious, and while such generalizations are always hard to make it might have been my favorite non-restaurant item of the entire trip.",

"reviewcomment":"Thanks yelp for this find!  There are lots of cute restaurants and cafes in the St. Germaine area and looked to yelp to help us find a place for lunch and looked around for it.  We accidentally went into Le Bistro d&#39;Henri as the Yelp app map was a bit wonky.. they rubbed us a bit the wrong way as we stepped out, they locked the door behind us... and it wasn&#39;t even that late into lunch time.  <br><br>We were about to go to this other restaurant and this place caught our eye and only later realised we ended up at the place we originally wanted to go to in the first place. It&#39;s a small cozy place where they have the menus listed on a black chalk board.  Luckily my friends knew a little bit of French but with things like Google Translate, we easily picked out courses.  <br><br>I had the terrine of courgette to start.  It was egg with courgette and a side of cold tomato sauce.  It tasted fresh and delicious.  Needed a tad bit of salt but I prefer it this way as opposed to things being too salty.  For my main I had the onglet of veal and this was amazing.  At first glance, the sauce looked a bit too creamy but it was perfect in the end.  It came with a side of creamy potatoes which topped it off really well.  The place isn&#39;t too great for vegetarians as the only main option was to pull together a plate of veggies (tomato, green beans, cabbage).  <br><br>One thing I love about France is ordering the table wine.  It was only about 9 euros for a bottle and it was great.  Quite a young wine but easy drinking.  Alternatively, they had a good selection of wine if you fancy something else.  <br><br>Service was great and would definitely come back for some more.",

It was my only day in the so-called &#34;arts&#34; district, so I figured all the fancy presentation on these goods would have the flavor to back them up. <br><br>I ordered the plain cake because the other option was Oreo (lol that&#39;s trashy for an expensive place), and grinned with delight as it was put in a box AND then a decorated bag, like I&#39;d just gone shopping for something that would last more than five minutes. It was delicious, with a very hard, dry consistency that was not very sweet. A bit on the tart side, indicating they are liberal with the sour cream, while conservative with the sugar. Definitely a great base for a more complex cake, but even though simple is good, the flavor just wasn&#39;t appealing enough for me to give it a full five stars. <br><br>If you want a taste that&#39;s a bit more complex, totally go for the cupcakes. Especially tiramisu!",

"reviewcomment":"I&#39;m in love. I might be biased - les pâtisseries orientales have always been some of my favorite desserts. But they have to be well made - well balanced, sweet but not too sweet, with the right amount of honey, pistachio, almond, and whatnot. This bakery has it DOWN. The window display is stunning - and can seem overwhelming - how on earth are you suppposed to pick what you want with so many choices and no description? The salespeople are very helpful, although at times I have found them to be a bit too quick (kind of like &#34;ok, I&#39;ll make an assortment that should be good enough for you, here you go&#34;). But most of the time they&#39;re really friendly. I&#39;ve also sampled a lot of their salted goods (sort of like Algerian pizzas), which I really love because they have stuffed pâte feuilletée with spicy veggies inside (I&#39;m a vegetarian). Yum. Yum. Oh yum. The bakery is to go and but there&#39;s a spot next door where you can sit down and place your order. A wonderful little spot in the 11th to either pick up dessert or stop for a snack.",

"reviewcomment":"This little wine shop is on kind of an obscure off-street and we wouldn&#39;t have gone in if it weren&#39;t for the fact that were were heading home the next day and wanted to bring back some bottles. (For the record, words cannot describe how good and CHEAP wine is in France.) <br><br>When we walked in we were immediately welcomed and offered a taste. They were sampling four different kinds that day and when we had trouble picking one, the person working there just said, &#34;how about all four?&#34; So all together, we probably had a whole glass of free wine while the worker educated us about where it was from and how it was made. A little after that we noticed one of the people working spoke English with an American accent. We got to talking with him and discovered he&#39;s from the US and went to college in our home region of the northwest. We bought a bottle, and went on our way. <br><br>I was compelled to write this review because I was very impressed with the service, the samples, and the fact that an American works there. Don&#39;t get me wrong, all the French people we met were lovely, but sometimes it can feel a little isolating surrounded by people who live so far from you; it&#39;s comforting to talk with someone who can relate. Also, the same owners own a couple restaurants nearby, Cosi, Semilla, and Fish. We didn&#39;t get a chance to go to any of them but I have heard good things.",

The interior design of the bakery is modern and simple. We were there in the early morning, which gave us the opportunity to observe the staff prepare the pastries from behind the counter. It was a treat. Now, onto the food:<br><br>-Maple Muffin was good. Crunchy on the exterior and moist on the inside. It was not too sweet and had enough chocolate. <br><br>-The Lemon Cake was surprisingly good as it was filled with an powerful lemon favor, balanced by the sweetness of the iced frosting.  <br><br>We saw the Carrot Cake being prepared and if they were ready, we would have ordered that too!",

Delicious. Deliriously divine. Whether it&#39;s the vivid and colorful animals that you&#39;re into or rippled musculature delicious even to the eyes (le torse, a sculpture made of dark chocolate, is a big attraction here and completely kinky in its implications), nothing here could possibly disappoint on the tongue. <br><br>Look around for a bit and then ask for a taste of the amazing ganache cubes. It&#39;s the most unassuming item here in the middle of this lush cacao-enrobed menagerie. Tiny cubes of cocoa-dusted ganache no bigger than my pinky fingertip line small boxes corner-to-corner, shamefully standing in their dull, terra cotta-hued selves. Surrounded by all the figurines with their buttery sheen finish, it definitely stands out in its austerity. If you&#39;re permitted a taste, as I was, as soon as you pop it into your mouth the silky ganache yields any semblance of structure it had and flows into your mouth like a river. I think I went blind for a second when this happened; it was so good. And this is how you become a slave to a tiny cube of chocolate.<br><br>The confection is finicky. As they are just chocolate and a high concentration of cream, they need to be refrigerated and eaten in about a week. But I can&#39;t think of anyone who would ever be able to keep this in their fridge for more than a day and a half without it all... disappearing. Shame spirals never tasted so good.",

"reviewcomment":"OK, I admit it. I&#39;m so over cupcakes. So when my cupcake loving friend dragged us down the semi sketchy sex-show filled streets of Pigalle to find this cupcake shop, I definitely obliged her begrudgingly.<br><br>We walked in a few minutes before closing, but the delightful vintage pink and green rockabilly atmosphere immediately perked me up. The two shop girls are seriously cool and were excited to show us their Marilyn Monroe statue in the back as well as explain (in English, woo!) their beautifully decorated cupcakes of the day.<br><br>I honestly could have done without, but everything was so cute I could not resist. I ended up taking home three cupcakes that night. Blueberry and white chocolate, Raspberry and white chocolate, and something I could not understand due to language barriers.<br><br>They were just my style: not too sweet. In fact they were more like fruit muffins with white chocolate drizzles and fresh fruit, and edible glitter on top. It was so beautiful, it looked like a cupcake straight out of a fairy tale. <br><br>Definitely worth a stop if you&#39;re in the area to see a topless show and then craving some sweets.",

"reviewcomment":"Amazing little place! So glad we tried here. On a quite yet vibrant street it&#39;s not far from the Bastille area we were drawn to Cafe Moderne because we saw they served Brooklyn beer when passing during the day. <br><br>This place is mainly a restaurant, however we didn&#39;t eat here. We came back in the evening before going to dinner and we loved it.  <br><br>My boyfriend had a pint of Brooklyn which was 7 EUR and I had an absolutely wonderful cocktail. It was 10 EUR and worth every cent. The cocktail menu is extremely creative and well thought out. I went for the Caribbean Shepard being a rum fan. The rum is mixed with lemon and sugar, and then a froth was made from amaretto with a small electric whisk and served in a Martini glass with angastura vapour. The bartender explained to sip the foam and then the drink - sublime. Like a rum sour with a wonderful amaretto foam coming through. <br><br>The service was amazing. The bartender was wonderful. He was making some cocktails for another group at the bar, so anticipated that we might have a small wait before he could make our drinks. He took our order whilst making the other groups cocktails, gave us water (decanted in a Makers bottle :) ) and some complementary bar snacks. He held conversation with us and before we knew it we had our drinks. His service made our wait pleasant and barely noticeable. He was clearly passionate about his job and was wonderful with everyone who came to the bar. <br><br>The atmosphere is great, the place definitely has inspiration from NYC but still has a French charm and excellent soul and jazz playing in the background. <br><br>I cannot recommend this place highly enough, and I can&#39;t compare it to anywhere else. The food looked great and very well priced. It&#39;s worth heading to Bastille simply for this bar.",

What could be more delicious than patisserie goods, apricot conficture and various cheeses for a continental and indulgent start to the day? Pretty much nothing. <br><br>The bread here is insane! I know that can be said for a lot of places in paris, but seriously...this has the upper hand on the insane ratio! I come to paris quite often, and I feel like I turn into a bread stick when visiting due to all the bread I eat, so declaring this as my favourite is quite a statement.

"reviewcomment":"My girl friend and I were walking around one night looking for a place to eat. Our hotel was right around the corner. It was late, we were hungry and cold (it was winter &#39;12). We passed places that looked like bars.. finally, we stumbled in here. The place was crowded, loud, warm and the smell of food called us from the cold Parisian streets. We waited by the door along with the other prospective patrons. One of the waiters came over and asked how many, I replied back in English &#34;two&#34; then he asked another couple nearby. He then led all four of us (yes the other couple we found out were fellow Americans) into the restaurant. Lo and behold, he sat all four of us together in a booth! Go figure, put all the Americans in one table. <br><br>Surprisingly, it was one of the funnest and most awkward dinners I&#39;ve had in my life! It was awkward because we found out that we were sitting across a couple who were on their honeymoon. It was fun because they were great company! The food at this place was amazing! We had a bottle of wine and dessert. I believe the bill wasn&#39;t too expensive. William, our server, was so lively, entertaining and made really great recommendations for food. Fond memories about the food at this place will fuel my dreams until I come back.",

"reviewcomment":"What a wonderful dining experience! We were actually looking for another place, but became frustrated with the addresses in the passage and, drawn in by the ambience and intriguing menu, decided to chance it. Very glad we did.<br><br>Their menu is handwritten on a large blackboard that happened to be right next to us, so we had plenty of time to look it over. We settled on a half-bottle of rose and a selection of small plates: our total was 77 Euros, very reasonable for two people and multiple courses.<br><br>We started with a plate of hard sausage with fresh butter, arugula and cornichons. With their fresh-baked whole grain sourdough, this could have been dinner in itself! The sausage was salty, smoky and chewy, and the butter wonderfully decadent, but the crunchy, peppery arugula really pulled it all together. We paired this with a 1000-day Gouda, which was so mellow and crumbly it resembled a Parmesan. Bliss.<br><br>After this we moved on to two pork dishes: a roasted medallion served with a lentil salad and red-wine sauce and thinly-sliced cured ham with fresh melon in a maple-sesame glaze. The melon dish was our favorite of the evening -- a perfect combination.<br><br>Finally, we chose a chocolate ganache with figs, which was really interesting. I just assumed it would be melted ganache with figs for dipping, but instead the figs were chopped up and added to the ganache, which was allowed to cool and harden and then sliced thinly. So we had a couple of slivers on a plate, topped with crumbled biscuits d&#39;epices. A really great summer dessert!<br><br>Our waitress was charming and sociable, and there were three tiny, curious poodles at the next table who kept wandering over to say hello. It was a magical evening. We regularly stay across the street at the Ronceray Opera, so I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll be back!",

"reviewcomment":"I&#39;m in love. I might be biased - les pâtisseries orientales have always been some of my favorite desserts. But they have to be well made - well balanced, sweet but not too sweet, with the right amount of honey, pistachio, almond, and whatnot. This bakery has it DOWN. The window display is stunning - and can seem overwhelming - how on earth are you suppposed to pick what you want with so many choices and no description? The salespeople are very helpful, although at times I have found them to be a bit too quick (kind of like &#34;ok, I&#39;ll make an assortment that should be good enough for you, here you go&#34;). But most of the time they&#39;re really friendly. I&#39;ve also sampled a lot of their salted goods (sort of like Algerian pizzas), which I really love because they have stuffed pâte feuilletée with spicy veggies inside (I&#39;m a vegetarian). Yum. Yum. Oh yum. The bakery is to go and but there&#39;s a spot next door where you can sit down and place your order. A wonderful little spot in the 11th to either pick up dessert or stop for a snack.",

This little building, tucked away in a residential courtyard, is incredibly charming and gives you a neat little glimpse into Kusmi&#39;s traditional manufacturing techniques. It smells great, too :)<br><br>When you first enter there&#39;s some tea for sale along the hallway. Everything is pretty tasty, but Kusmi really excels at the sweet, citrusy blends - Anastasia, Troika (black or green, they&#39;re both good), Prince Wladimir, and especially the Earl Grey Gout Polonais. The new Label Imperial is also a great find. Be sure to snoop around a bit and ask questions as you&#39;re buying your tea, it&#39;s a really fascinating place with a ton of history behind it. <br><br>I love Kusmi!",

There is nothing wrong with having a beer at noon on a day off right? Plus, with the time change, it&#39;s probably beer o&#39;clock anyways.<br>Choose from over a thousand bottles to take with you to a pique-nique or just to enjoy at home. Or choose a bottle and have it chilled in a matter of minutes and enjoy at the store. Sit at the communal table and chat with the owner and the locals. <br>My French is minimal. Very. But this is the type of place where you don&#39;t get the attitude and you can just relax and enjoy some really good beer. <br>Don&#39;t forget to take a moment to take in the interior design. The details and thought put into the shop is oh so cool.<br><br>Just a tip: ( I found out the hard way ) If you&#39;re getting off at Abbesses do take the elevator instead of the stairs.

"reviewcomment":"What a wonderful dining experience! We were actually looking for another place, but became frustrated with the addresses in the passage and, drawn in by the ambience and intriguing menu, decided to chance it. Very glad we did.<br><br>Their menu is handwritten on a large blackboard that happened to be right next to us, so we had plenty of time to look it over. We settled on a half-bottle of rose and a selection of small plates: our total was 77 Euros, very reasonable for two people and multiple courses.<br><br>We started with a plate of hard sausage with fresh butter, arugula and cornichons. With their fresh-baked whole grain sourdough, this could have been dinner in itself! The sausage was salty, smoky and chewy, and the butter wonderfully decadent, but the crunchy, peppery arugula really pulled it all together. We paired this with a 1000-day Gouda, which was so mellow and crumbly it resembled a Parmesan. Bliss.<br><br>After this we moved on to two pork dishes: a roasted medallion served with a lentil salad and red-wine sauce and thinly-sliced cured ham with fresh melon in a maple-sesame glaze. The melon dish was our favorite of the evening -- a perfect combination.<br><br>Finally, we chose a chocolate ganache with figs, which was really interesting. I just assumed it would be melted ganache with figs for dipping, but instead the figs were chopped up and added to the ganache, which was allowed to cool and harden and then sliced thinly. So we had a couple of slivers on a plate, topped with crumbled biscuits d&#39;epices. A really great summer dessert!<br><br>Our waitress was charming and sociable, and there were three tiny, curious poodles at the next table who kept wandering over to say hello. It was a magical evening. We regularly stay across the street at the Ronceray Opera, so I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll be back!",

"reviewcomment":"Hediard is a treasure trove of spices, cookies, candies, mustards, jams, wines, pates, coffee, tea, etc... and is a wonderful olfactory experience. This location is the mothership although there are branches around Paris. It is an excellent place to find little gifts for friends back home as all of Hediard&#39;s offerings are decked out in their signature chic red and black packaging. So much more stylish and authentically Parisian than Fauchon!  Hediard also has a cafe/restaurant on the 2nd floor with fabulous food and a quietly luxurious atmosphere.<br><br>If you love French Colonial decor, you will be very happy sniffing and generally browsing your way through Hediard!",

"reviewcomment":"This little wine shop is on kind of an obscure off-street and we wouldn&#39;t have gone in if it weren&#39;t for the fact that were were heading home the next day and wanted to bring back some bottles. (For the record, words cannot describe how good and CHEAP wine is in France.) <br><br>When we walked in we were immediately welcomed and offered a taste. They were sampling four different kinds that day and when we had trouble picking one, the person working there just said, &#34;how about all four?&#34; So all together, we probably had a whole glass of free wine while the worker educated us about where it was from and how it was made. A little after that we noticed one of the people working spoke English with an American accent. We got to talking with him and discovered he&#39;s from the US and went to college in our home region of the northwest. We bought a bottle, and went on our way. <br><br>I was compelled to write this review because I was very impressed with the service, the samples, and the fact that an American works there. Don&#39;t get me wrong, all the French people we met were lovely, but sometimes it can feel a little isolating surrounded by people who live so far from you; it&#39;s comforting to talk with someone who can relate. Also, the same owners own a couple restaurants nearby, Cosi, Semilla, and Fish. We didn&#39;t get a chance to go to any of them but I have heard good things.",

This little building, tucked away in a residential courtyard, is incredibly charming and gives you a neat little glimpse into Kusmi&#39;s traditional manufacturing techniques. It smells great, too :)<br><br>When you first enter there&#39;s some tea for sale along the hallway. Everything is pretty tasty, but Kusmi really excels at the sweet, citrusy blends - Anastasia, Troika (black or green, they&#39;re both good), Prince Wladimir, and especially the Earl Grey Gout Polonais. The new Label Imperial is also a great find. Be sure to snoop around a bit and ask questions as you&#39;re buying your tea, it&#39;s a really fascinating place with a ton of history behind it. <br><br>I love Kusmi!",

"reviewcomment":"Everywhere you go in Paris, you will find a wine store or wine bar on any street corner. I love my wine and it&#39;s oh so convenient but damn it I love my beer. I have found my beer haven at last. <br>A couple of minutes from Abbesses station, this store is open from noon until late. Everyday! There is nothing wrong with having a beer at noon on a day off right? Plus, with the time change, it&#39;s probably beer o&#39;clock anyways.<br>Choose from over a thousand bottles to take with you to a pique-nique or just to enjoy at home. Or choose a bottle and have it chilled in a matter of minutes and enjoy at the store. Sit at the communal table and chat with the owner and the locals. <br>My French is minimal. Very. But this is the type of place where you don&#39;t get the attitude and you can just relax and enjoy some really good beer. <br>Don&#39;t forget to take a moment to take in the interior design. The details and thought put into the shop is oh so cool.<br><br>Just a tip: ( I found out the hard way ) If you&#39;re getting off at Abbesses do take the elevator instead of the stairs. You&#39;ll thank me later.<br><br>8/100",

When I visited Paris, I knew I wanted to go to Laduree but we had a visit to artsy Montmartre. I was pleased to discover the Biscuiterie de Montmartre. It&#39;s a small shop with lots of sweets, treats, and macarons. They speak English, though it&#39;s polite to ask if they do. They were so nice too! I ordered 12 macarons (Coconut to Raspberry) and bought a small box to hold them in. Macarons are not inexpensive, however, I didn&#39;t pay an exorbitant amount like I would at Laduree. I still dream of the soft, perfect texture of these tiny treats. If Paris weren&#39;t so far...<br><br>This is my new Macaron spot when I visit the City of Lights.

You can easily spend a half hour looking at all of the different types of salt and spices from all over the world. they even sell a 24-euro cast iron tortilla press.

I spend ages, just absorbing all the new products I&#39;ve never seen before. Their fresh produce is truly exotic, coming in a wide array of unseen shapes and colors. The prices are fantastic. I once bought a massive slab of pumpkin for 50cents. <br>If you&#39;re frugal and not lazy, you should do all your weekly produce shopping here. You&#39;ll save heaps, and eat interestingly.",

We were just going to grab-and-go but after seeing the interior decor of this place, we had to stay and enjoy it a little bit. <br><br>It is so pretty inside; it felt like we were having afternoon tea at the palace. It is actually quite big, but it was incredibly busy and loud. People were waiting in different areas, trying to spot where others were about to get up and leave (similar to eating at a busy food court). <br><br>This was our first time visiting Starbucks in Europe. The pastries are a little different from Toronto, but we did not try them (considering there are so many better patisseries in Paris!). With regards to the costs, we notice the pricing system was quite similar to others stores in Paris that we have in Canada as well. Basically the numbers were quite the same but in euros; i.e. a tall coffee costs $2 with change in Toronto, while it costs 2€ in Paris.",

"reviewcomment":"This is something else. My wife and I went there to celebrate her 65th. We went for three days and I told her that we would be going to the station cafe at the Garde de Lyons for her birthday meal. Did she get a surprise, so did I as the bill came to £250, but you can do things for a little over half that.<br><br> We had a four course meal, and the nice thing was, all the better wines on the menu were also available in half bottles. So we had half a bottle of a top marque champagne with our first course and half a bottle of a fantastic Burgundy, the best I have ever supped.<br><br> The food just can&#39;t be described and all I can say is that it was everything they say about French gourmet cooking!<br><br> The service was as one would expect, impeccable, and the waiters were as aoof as one would expect with English speaking customers. However when I have them a special card I have written in French, the gist being &#34;Alas, I speak three languages, English, Afrikaans and Zulu, but am too old to now learn a fourth one. French is not used in South Africa and, alas, Zulu is not very useful in France&#34;. This usually creates a little smile and we got on much better after that.<br><br> I might go back, but at the price, and looking at my pension, it would have to be a very special occasion.<br><br>UPDATE: Somebody, either at Qype or Yelp changed the name and address. The restaurant is called &#34;Le Trein Bleu&#34; and it is inside the Gare de Lyon.",

"reviewcomment":"Went here for lunch one day. First of all, everybody was extremely friendly at this place (despite the group of us not having reservations and coming in for a late lunch and being the last to leave). <br><br>We started off with great bread, excellent butter, sea salt and a fish spread. <br><br>My friend and I got the fish - surprisingly very light (go figure for French food!). Other friend got the beef tartare and it came with fantastic French fries that we concluded must have been bathed in duck fat. Other friend got the steak which was cooked perfectly. <br><br>Now the desserts. There is one that still holds a place in my heart. It was the creme caramel served in a mason jar. The liquid caramel on bottom with thousands of little black dots from the vanilla beans with perfectly smooth custard on top. And the creme de la creme (pardon the pun) was the burnt layer on top that you see on creme brulee. Some places don&#39;t get this layer right but here it was exceptionally crunchy. The other dessert was great, too - a very light almost-whipped yogurt studded with vanilla beans and served with fruit. <br><br>Top this off with some rose and it was the perfect leisurely Parisian lunch.",

There is a book store so I could find a Michelin map of Paris.<br><br>There are clothes, electronics, CDs, beauty, and most pharmacy goods. Most importantly though is downstairs. The supermarket is gigantic and packs everything one could ever want. They stock more than simply French goods, but foreign and other European goods. I could possibly spend a day in there looking over brand after brand.<br><br>What I ended up gathering though, butter (which is basically edible by itself in France), creme fraiche (a better version of sour cream), fresh baguette, eggs (which have richer colored yolks), fresh goat cheese, and tomatoes (which pack so much more flavor and sweetness).

"reviewcomment":"By no stretch of the imagination dare I say that this is among the best places in Paris. Here is why:<br><br>-Located right inside of the Louvre&#39;s center, one can enjoy lunch with breath-taking view. The acclaimed and beautiful pyramid can be seen from various seating areas in the restaurant. Go into the back seating area inside the restaurant and look into one of the Lourve&#39;s most extraordinary sculpture exhibitions. <br><br>-The Ravioli a la Truffle was divine; simply among the best I have had. <br>-The Fouetté d&#39;avocats king crab (crab on top of avocado): A+. The dish had a splendid twist of lime and lemon juice that make the dish flare with a zest. <br><br>-The bread and butter were delicious. <br><br>-The servers were easy on the eyes.<br><br>Perhaps the negative is that you are paying a premium to eat here because of the view. But if you are going to splurge on a place, this place is worth it.",

"reviewcomment":"Amazing little place! So glad we tried here. On a quite yet vibrant street it&#39;s not far from the Bastille area we were drawn to Cafe Moderne because we saw they served Brooklyn beer when passing during the day. <br><br>This place is mainly a restaurant, however we didn&#39;t eat here. We came back in the evening before going to dinner and we loved it.  <br><br>My boyfriend had a pint of Brooklyn which was 7 EUR and I had an absolutely wonderful cocktail. It was 10 EUR and worth every cent. The cocktail menu is extremely creative and well thought out. I went for the Caribbean Shepard being a rum fan. The rum is mixed with lemon and sugar, and then a froth was made from amaretto with a small electric whisk and served in a Martini glass with angastura vapour. The bartender explained to sip the foam and then the drink - sublime. Like a rum sour with a wonderful amaretto foam coming through. <br><br>The service was amazing. The bartender was wonderful. He was making some cocktails for another group at the bar, so anticipated that we might have a small wait before he could make our drinks. He took our order whilst making the other groups cocktails, gave us water (decanted in a Makers bottle :) ) and some complementary bar snacks. He held conversation with us and before we knew it we had our drinks. His service made our wait pleasant and barely noticeable. He was clearly passionate about his job and was wonderful with everyone who came to the bar. <br><br>The atmosphere is great, the place definitely has inspiration from NYC but still has a French charm and excellent soul and jazz playing in the background. <br><br>I cannot recommend this place highly enough, and I can&#39;t compare it to anywhere else. The food looked great and very well priced. It&#39;s worth heading to Bastille simply for this bar.",

The pictures show items such as Cholula (sp?), canned beans, chipotle peppers in adobo etc. They have none of this anymore.  I didn&#39;t eat there, went specfically looking for Topatio hot sauce.  You can find Cholula &amp; Valentino hot sauce at Izrael Epicirie near the Marais, but better take a loan out.  A small bottle of Cholula is $9 Euros and a small Cholula is I think $12.  That makes the liter size bottle about $100 euros if they had it.  Bring it with you if you need it.  That said, Izrael had a ton of spices &amp; dry black beans.  Mexi and Co. looked like the food may have been good though, I will try it next time I&#39;m in Paris.",

The idea doesn&#39;t seem like it&#39;d be novel, just a chocolate cake made with tons of tiny layers on layers. But the cake is just stunning from the first bite to the last. Those layers really do make all the difference in the whole experience of devouring it (which happened pretty fast). I wish I had tried other things here because, judging by the taste of this cake, I&#39;m sure they would have been delicious. It is a little pricey though with the one slice at 5 euros. It was a fairly thin slice too but very rich and smooth. <br><br>This place also actually has a pretty interesting history too. I ended up including it in a school assignment and it turns out that the founder of this patisserie was part of the court at Versailles...! It&#39;s crazy to think since it&#39;s now a chain and you can walk by one of these shops all over Paris without even knowing about the wealth of history behind it.

"reviewcomment":"Any cook, professional or otherwise, should make a trip to amazing Mora for your kitchen tool needs. <br><br>A very clean, well lighted store, with the items neatly arranged by little rooms. They have spatulas, piping tips, baking pans, pots, silpats, cutting boards, cake boards, chocolate work tools, chocolate molds, knives, copper cannele molds in varying sizes, cookbooks etc. They have just about everything that a cooking professional would want. And it&#39;s not just stuff that I could buy at a Williams Sonoma back in the States. There&#39;s a huge difference in terms of variety and quality and price. Especially when it comes to cannele molds. Buying them in the States from a vendor who had them shipped in from France is surely going to cost more (almost 2X more) than for what I could pay to purchase them on my own in Paris. Next time you are in Paris remember to pack light, you might find something at Mora worth taking home.",

"reviewcomment":"In the well-heeled area where high fashion and style rule in the 1st arrondissement area of Paris, one can still find an old-school 1930s dining and drinking establishment to absorb oneself in the yesteryears of old Paris. Just off rue Saint-Honoré is Le Rubis that does not feel outshined by its neighbors and it does not have to. Parisians come here on a workday or after shopping in the area. <br><br>On the first floor is a standing-only bar with no more than 5 small tables. Men dressed in suits are standing at the bar with a glass of wine and a plate of cheese, perfect for a lunch break on a weekday. The owner who is working behind the bar greets us, opens a very narrow white door next to the bar, ushers us through and say, &#34;Allons-y.&#34; We walk up the narrow stairs that lead us into an even smaller dining room with tables huddled close together. <br><br>No English is spoken here and perhaps that&#39;s a good thing because I get to put into practice my French 101 and 102 back from college. C&#39;est la vie. A friendly female server comes over to tell us their three specials of the day. The menu at Le Rubis is written on a blackboard and hung on the wall.  As we have been doing at each meal in Paris, we order wine to go with lunch. We get une carafe de vin rouge and at Le Rubis, a carafe of house wine is served in a full-sized bottle, but half filled.<br><br>Probably one of the most classic French items, we order the oeufs mayonnaise. Two eggs, each of them halved, and then covered with mustard sauce that tastes a little tart. Who would have thought hard boiled eggs could be this comforting? Another traditional French item the filets de hareng (herring fish fillets) is cured and served with boiled potatoes and pickled carrots. I don&#39;t recall eating as much lentils as I did in the last year as when the plate of saucisse lentilles are brought to our table. I&#39;m not very much a lentil person but Le Rubis&#39; lentilles are really kind of good in a comforting way. The saucisse (sausage) is cooked in wine and the fragrance from the wine is evident in the sausage. After we are finished, the server comes over and asks if we want cheese. Non, merci, we are full. She offers us tarte aux poires (pear tart) for dessert to which I can&#39;t say no to. A slice of the tart, nothing fancy, and just served as it is on a plate. It&#39;s homemade and that&#39;s all that counts.<br><br>Hot meals are only served during lunchtime. At other times, Le Rubis serves wine, charcuterie, and cheese are served. <br><br>Credit cards are accepted here but their machine reader had problems reading our US non-chip credit cards which lead us to believe that they are not equipped with upgraded software to process non-chip credit cards. Cash is of course accepted. If anyone wants a true experience of what old school is, end your visit with a trip to the toilet. It&#39;s clean and it&#39;s tiny. The fun part is figuring out the toilet flush and  faucet at the sink.",

The menus came down and were only in French (no English option here) but it was ok, we were really there for the quiche (which I believe they called tartes.) <br><br>The waitress put a board filled with quiche options next to our table. I went with the chorizo and cheese and it was amazing. Giant and filled to the brim with flavour. Every bite - awesome.<br><br>The place is such a relaxing spot as well.

"reviewcomment":"I&#39;ve seen so many films in this theather, many of them with the presence of the director (including Asia Argento mind you) or famous critics (Jean Douchet is a regular) that this is almost like the church of cinema. Every seat has the name of a director who has contributed to film history, the theather is just big enough for its audience and there are many parallel events going on besides the sneak previews (a Russ Meyer night for instance). Now, the regular crowd tends to be on the older side or composed by confirmed film lovers. It would be nice to see a few younger faces here and there, specially considering the wonderful dinner space they have on top which is hard to discover if you don&#39;t know it&#39;s there (it took me at least 5 years to realise it existed), and it&#39;s the perfect place to discuss the love of film.",

All sorts of muesli, seeds, nuts, grains, oats, and baked goods for very reasonable prices. I came away with cashew, flax seeds, goji berries, courgette (pumpkin-ish) seeds, and a few others and as I mentioned Kale. Oh, and some very delicious and beautifully presented dark chocolate with whole almonds. <br><br>4 stars? Really I could give it 5, but I save them for places that couldn&#39;t improve.

"reviewcomment":"Best duck breast we had on our short Paris days. It really looked like a steak, and i have never seen duck cut this way. The scallope potato is tres bien! Smooth and creamy. We had the best server, ever in Paris! He took back the pate that was a mistake and miscommunication. Had the best ice cream by Bhertillion (spell?), chocolate noir, tasted like a melted truffle ice cream, so smooth, rich and you can tell the chocolate is very high quality cocoa. Im very pleased with this place, food and service. Cest magnifique!",

"reviewcomment":"Pretty fantastic stuff Chef Cherrier makes. I was intrigued. I Googled the place before coming to Paris, &amp; saw a ton of pics of Chef Cherrier. I kind of wanted to see him there - the master in action - but fat chance, he wasn&#39;t there. I still feel bad for what I did, but um, I did something bad when I went in there: I asked for directions to the Moulin Rouge (which, btw, was a big disappointment).<br><br>They did give us directions, &amp; the guy that helped us had a somewhat annoyed look on his face. I would&#39;ve been annoyed, too, but my maps app stopped working &amp; I wanted to justify the trip to the boulangerie to my cousin. lol. But oui, The Moulin Rouge was the side trip - not the boulangerie ;) I pulled this off smoothly by saying something like &#34;Oh look, Gontran Cherrier. We might as well go in &amp; ask for directions.&#34; As if I just happened to wander over to the area.<br><br>Inside, I asked the girl, &#34;Parlez-vous Anglais?&#34; She said no. Oh noes. In my broken French I asked her what was &#34;bon&#34; (I may have asked tres bon, or something, &amp; pointed at the desserts) &amp; she said her favorite was the citron thingy. I got that, plus this thing with like cream cheese, in the form of a mousse, with dots of what looked like tiny shavings of lime (after some Googling, I now know that was the &#34;Tarte au fromage blanc&#34;, which I think translates to white cheese tart, &amp; it cost €4,30).<br><br>The citron 1 that was the favorite of the pretty French girl from Gontran Cherrier turned out to be a bit too sour for me, but the 1 with the moussey cheese or cheesy mousse with lime shavings - the Tarte au fromage blanc - was ah-may-zinnng :]]",

The floral and fruit flavored teas are outstanding- rich, clean flavors with perfect aromas. I was very surprised there were no chemical or unusual tastes, which is a rarity with flavored teas, as the flavoring tends to be overpowering and distracting much of the time. Even Ka Da We doesn&#39;t have tea of this quality. <br><br>I was given a gift a couple years ago, and I loved it so much that I went out of my way to visit this shop on my next Paris trip.

Did you have a long day walking around the Louvre? Come in for a refreshment to fuel the rest of your night. Looking for a bottle to take home with you or to a party? Ask for tips and recommendations because the people here are very helpful and enthusiastic about their wines.

It seemed to be equivalent to a mini WholeFoods with fresh, ready-made meals, an incredible cheese selection, rows and rows of all types of chocolates and a truly impressive wine section.<br><br> Despite being located in a convention center, the number of locals doing their weekly shop in here indicated that this is a place for the foodie. The prices were reasonable and the selection was varied and very fresh. I managed to pick up a bottle of 1990 Brut for a very reasonable price.<br><br> If you&#39;re anywhere near the Hotel Concorde Lafayette (or Porte Maillot metro station) I urge you to drop in.",

I might stop in again tomorrow since I will be in the area again and buy some tea to take back home.

This can be seen in their vast mountains of goodies that don&#39;t appear to be too French, but with a hint of ingredients that are commonly used in Turkey, Lebanon, and other nations.<br><br>The first thing I tried is a pastry with formage. It was perfectly flaky, very tasty on the inside with a sweet cheese flavor, almost like the sweet cheese flavor on Russian danishes. We also had something that resembles the famous Turkish kanafeh, a vermicelli-like pastry. Not too sweet and a great texture overall. <br><br>The employees here are very friendly. Even if their English is limited, they try their best to explain everything with a smile on their face. They have a policy where eating in the bakery costs more, which we didn&#39;t know at first. My dad sat down with our to go bags, and only then did we remember this policy that is quite common in France. The ladies were completely fine with it, and even took our goodies and plated them for us free of charge. We couldn&#39;t just leave without a tip for such thoughtful service.",

Sweetly situation in the shadow of Napoleon&#39;s tomb, on the east side of Avenue Breteuil, it is the 7th arrondissement&#39;s new secret.<br><br>I discovered this little gem as I do most places these days... zipping by on my trottinette. &#34;What was that?&#34; *brakes screeching*<br><br>Suddenly, I&#39;m carefully walking my trottinette home with a full box of pâtisseries to try... (gratefully I had roommates to help with the arduous task of eating them all. And by arduous I mean fantastic.  )<br><br>In a city where gaudy, ancient decor and decoration reigns (and we love it), Mori Yoshida&#39;s clean and utilitarian shop offers our eyes a stark and zen retreat, and showcases their delicious chocolates, cakes, pastries, and viennoiseries with aplomb. Every confection is an artistic feat.<br><br>...Plus they have a silver tray of chocolate truffle samples. La classe !<br><br>The mastermind behind this unique and creative bakery is Morihide Yoshida, a young, award-winning Japanese pastry chef in his mid-thirties. After winning the grand prize twice on a Japanese television show, and opening a bakery in Shizuoka, Japan, Morihide decided that Parisians would be the next to benefit from the fruits of his genius. (And we&#39;re happy about that, trust me.)<br><br>My favorite of the bunch was the pistachio saint honoré. It was incredibly decadent-the cream puffs were filled with a raspberry-ish custard, and the pistachio cream? Holy cream balls.",

"reviewcomment":"OK so my teaser for this place was &#39;if there is only one place you should go in Paris it is this place&#34;. I guess I owe you some explanations. First this place is about cheese (Fromages). Yes it is a cliche to associate France and cheese and like a lot of cliche, it is true. You cannot understand France without understanding cheese and while you may enjoy your time in France without cheese you will never enjoy cheese as much as you could if you had it in France. And especially in Paris. And especially in Fromages et Ramage. Because what is important is not only the cheese, it is also what come with the cheese. Good cheese must come with good bread, good wine and good conversation (Ramage). Christian and Jean-Da, the amazingly good looking duet who run the place will not only find you the exact kind of cheese you are looking for (even if you never heard of it before and were not even aware that you were looking for a cheese in particular) but they will also give you the time of your trip. The boutique is filled with the lattest book they read, with the lattest Art that is all the rage in the neighborhood and with the lattest music they or their friends composed. Christian is a former musician who loves politics and Jean-Da is a former TV journalist who loves music. Needless to say the conversations between the two of them are passionate and endless. Don&#39;t hesitate to remind them from time to time that while you are also anxious to discover whether or not Murat is the best french artist ever, you would also like to taste this cheese that looks like a creamy dream and smells like heaven or at least like le Maquis in Corsica, how does it go with this little producer organic wine that they allowed you to taste on their charming little patio and how its taste in your mouth will make you climb the slopes and the stairs of the neighbouring Butte Montmartre with a smile, a song and the impression that it is exactly what you were looking for in Paris.",

"reviewcomment":"We ate here on accident, and it turned out to be one of the best breakfasts I had while in Paris!<br><br>After several days of pastry + coffee breakfasts, this girl was getting a little tired of the same ol&#39; same ol&#39;.  I like a little protein in the AM, because I need a hefty breakfast so I&#39;m not hungry all day. And as much as I hate to admit it, you can only eat so many croissant before you get sick of the buttery pastry!<br><br>I ordered the &#34;American breakfast&#34;, which consisted of a pastry, coffee, two eggs with ham, bread, and orange juice.  I selected a regular croissant which was pretty good but not the best.  The eggs and ham came with a small salad which was interesting, considering I don&#39;t usually eat greens at 9AM, but the flavors went so well together.  The highlight of this meal however was the orange juice! When it arrived at our table I thought our waitress had made a mistake because it looked like pink grapefruit juice.  I drank it anyways and after the first sip it was definitely orange juice but 10000x better than any orange juice you&#39;ll ever have in the states. It was light, sweet, almost fragrant, but still citrusy. I wonder what oranges they used because it was out of this world! (Wouldn&#39;t it be funny if it ended up being some artificial Tang-like crap? But somehow I doubt it. Or at least I hope it&#39;s not true!)<br><br>I&#39;d definitely come back for breakfast! It&#39;s easily accessibly by the Madeline metro station.",

This boutique, specializing in beers from around the world, is the perfect place to pick up a special bottle for a friend, to find something creative to serve at your next party or just to open your eyes (and tastebuds) to something new. <br>There must be over 500 different beers clearly labeled with country of origin and type of beer to make finding what you&#39;re looking for a little easier. The man who runs the shop is obviously quite knowledgeable and happy to share his expertise.<br>You can also find the perfect glass to go with your beer or pick up a mini-keg for your next soirée.<br>I only gave the place four stars because I find some of the prices a bit outrageous.

"reviewcomment":"An Middle Eastern-Jewish restaurant on the Jewish quarter with great falafel.  There are different sections, including sit down and take out. <br><br>We ate inside at the far end. We had some difficulty figuring out what to order as the waitress did not speak English nor was there English on the menu. (This was our difficulty, not the restaurant&#39;s responsibility. If you are traveling to a foreign county you can not expect that they should cater to your language needs). You can order platters and pay by the amount of items you pick from on the lower half of the menu. We ordered platters with five items each. Falafel and hummus luckily was easy to recognize on the menu, and for the most part, we got lucky with the other items we guessed about. One was pastry-like fried triangle with meat inside and was amazing. The only thing on the plate I did not like was eggplant dish (but then I generally do not like eggplant) but my cousin enjoyed it. The falafel and hummus were the best I have had outside of Israel. The platter had a good size portion, more than we could finish.",

"reviewcomment":"Just steps away from our hotel, this was the first restaurant we stumbled across as we valiantly attempted to stay awake the rest of the day after an overnight flight from California. I am blessing our incredible luck even today! The proprietor and his son (or grandson?) made us feel so welcome, and fed us the most amazing meal. We were starved and bleary-eyed, and they made us feel like family, seating us in a cozy corner by the window and attending to us sweetly, and in English (our French was so obviously poor, sigh). <br><br>I had the duck, and it was, for lack of a better word, divine! I almost never eat my whole lunch, but I couldn&#39;t bear to leave any of that tender, perfectly cooked duck breast on my plate. My husband had the blue cheese penne pasta, which he also praised as &#34;absolutely delish!&#34; My sides of potatoes and a salad perfectly complemented the duck, and with a little baguette, made our meal complete. <br><br>Overall, reasonably priced, delicious, and among the most welcoming places I have ever visited for a meal. Highly recommended -- I&#39;d move in permanently if they&#39;d have me!",

On a particularly nippy day a few weeks ago my friend and I wandered in with hopes of finding something to warm us from within. We were welcomed by a charming woman who sparkled with enthusiasm as she encouraged us to explore their enormous tea selection with our noses. We delved into the beautiful rainbow colored boxes and explored the aromas of mango, coconut, ginger, cinnamon, orange, almonds, cloves, vanilla, apple, etc. The &#34;pina colada&#34; tea was so convincing I got a hankering for some goslings! We smelled as our hostess excitedly told us a little about the place.<br><br>She explained that the owner and tea connosieur Arnaud Dhénin, after extensive travels throughout India, Asia, and Africa, decided to open a tea business in Paris in order to educate his compatriots about his favorite libation. His teas feature organic ingredients from around the world, blended according to his well trained palate.<br><br>Today you can order bags or colorful canisters of tea online or stop by the boutique/salon in the 11th and have a sniff before you make a selection. Since my friend prefers black teas and I prefer green, we opted for an assortment of Christmas blends to cover our bases. For a black tea we picked Noël à Paris, a blend of three Chinese black teas with vanilla, almonds, apple, cinnamon, cloves, and rose petals. For a green we picked Noël à Moscou which was a more delicate, soothing version of the Noël à Paris.",

"reviewcomment":"A friend and I stayed in the neighborhood, in a hotel just a block away. When searching for a good dinner spot within walking distance, this listing popped up, so we dropped in for our first meal in Paris - and what an awesome meal it was.<br><br>An adorable cafe with outside seating. It was raining that day, so we sat inside. The waitress seated us and was absolutely the most gracious and inviting person in France. Soon after we arrived, it seems the dinner rush started and the restaurant was full in no time at all. We were lucky we arrived when it was empty and the waitress could take her time to help us.<br><br>The cafe seats a decent amount of people and had a larger round table for larger families. The ambiance is French chic with some vintage mid-century mod posters and diners were dressed very casually.<br><br>So to the most important part... The Food!<br><br>Canard Confit (duck), L&#39;Agneau (lamb) and a Mixed Charcuterie plate, along with a half bottle of wine - all of which were enormous in size.<br><br>The duck was accompanied by fried potato slices with chimichurri sauce and a small salad. The lamb was accompanied by mashed potatoes with some magical gravy that can only be described as what baby angel wings probably taste like.<br><br>Everything was magnificent, but overall, I&#39;d definitely say the duck won over everything else. The skin was perfectly crisp and the meat tender and packed with flavor. I myself am not the biggest fan of duck - I tend to lean toward beef and chicken, but with one bite, I converted. I think everything should have duck in it. Duck steak, duck soup, duck cake...<br><br>The lamb was tender, flavorful and huge. As I mentioned, the sauce it was covered in was delicious.<br><br>The charcuterie plate was ample - so much, that we couldn&#39;t eat everything and ended up wasting the wonderful meat and cheeses piled upon each other. :(<br><br>In total, we spent about $80 US Dollars or 52 Euros. In my opinion, every penny well worth it.<br><br>Service charges are apart of the meal, so no tipping is really necessary.",

"reviewcomment":"This quaint cantina is located right off the canal and serves an  amazingly delicious lunch menu.  Only a handful of tables and friendly staff,  with shelves full of french, gourmet groceries - if it was anymore charming my head would explode.  Lunch options feature a delicious vegetarian ravioli filled with mysterious flavor rich cheeses, traditional grilled duck, beef tartare - and other things I look forward to tasting.  Start will the super tasty fresh burrata mozzarella and heirloom tomato salad.  Yes, the tomatoes are peeled.  Compliment with one of natural juices or wines.  Finish with some coffee and creme burle.  On your way out you can score some unique mustard or a tin of candy.  au revoir!",

I was walking around the neighborhood to see what was available as I am about to move within the neighborhood...<br>And literally around the corner, right there was sitting a heaven spot. <br><br>Vegan while in the USA, I manage to only be mostly vegan in France. The offers here are just not convenient to fulfill my culinary lifestyle while keeping me satisfied. This place, however, just made me love the apartment I was looking at even more.<br><br>Many options for vegetarians along with a few vegan options, freshly to order made juices, great staff, and pretty cool and simple setting. So here I go sitting there trying their different juices, and waiting for a vegetarian Maki... And let me tell you this maki was just plain delicious... <br><br>Most definitely a place I will return to often, especially if I commit to live literally around the corner. Another little thing that quite stroked me was the cool music they play. Once I heard Blood Orange airing, well I was sold on the spot.",

"reviewcomment":"This is my favorite boulangerie in Paris and the first one I went to. It is located in Place d&#39;Italie (metro lines 5, 6, and 7) so you&#39;re sure to find people buying at all times of the day. <br><br>In all reality everything here is mouthwatering good. Their sandwiches are always fresh and the bread they make is so good. The quiches which sell out rather quickly are great as well and ask them to heat it up (&#34;chauffer&#34;) so you can eat it right away. Another thing I absolutely love from Huré are their PALMIERS! They are without a doubt the best palmiers in all Paris and I&#39;ve tried my fair share of them. They are HUGE! They&#39;re almost the size of my head and are just perfect. Whenever I see the palmiers sitting by the window I hear them call my name and I have to go in to buy one. The other pastries that they make are great as well. <br><br>The staff is always lovely as well. I remember the first times I went there with my parents who don&#39;t speak a word of French (and were often holding up the line) the staff was extremely nice and helpful. I always leave this place with a smile thanks to their great quality bread, pastries, and service.",

"reviewcomment":"Sunday brunch, the restaurant offers a prix-fixe menu for 24 euros. It starts with a fruit smoothy (delicious), followed by your choice of hot beverage served with some mini viennoiseries, your choice between 3 entrees and a dessert! <br>For my main dish, I picked the oeufs brouillés with saumon fumé. It was very good (a bit watery but scrambled eggs are often like that), served in a small jar with a multi grain toast. Dessert was a pana cotta with raspberry coulis. All was very good, home-made, healthy which made our visit a fantastic sunday brunch. The decor is very home-y with books, couches and they even have a floor downstairs and a outside patio! Go there next sunday!",

It was kind of hard to find, but we finally found it after getting lost on a cold windy night.<br><br>The staff was so accommodating &amp; kind, really very warm to us even though they knew we were tourists. I guess maybe it&#39;s also because we spoke to them in French instead of English when we walked in.<br><br>I really liked it here, it was spacious &amp; open &amp; airy, with high ceilings. There was maybe 1 other large group in the back when we walked in, but that&#39;s about it. We didn&#39;t realize until later that they let us in even though they were preparing to close for the evening. But they didn&#39;t rush us out at all &amp; were very patient to let us relax &amp; enjoy a nice dinner.<br><br>Very lovely find!",

"reviewcomment":"During my 12 month stay in Paris, this was a boulangerie I would treat myself to every once in a while. The coffee, and the pastries are absolutely delicious! Like most patisseries in Paris, there is just so much choice, I remember once I couldn&#39;t help myself but indulge in a Pain Aux Pistache, and a Pain aux Framboise. It&#39;s slightly more expensive in comparison to other boulangerie&#39;s but you&#39;re getting a quality food, and an authentic French experience. The location is great being in the 16th Arrondissement, so it&#39;s near to the Eiffel Tower and the Arc de Triomphe. So savour you&#39;re café creme, enjoy your pastry, and feast your eyes on the beautiful decor, and the beautiful Parisians that sip their coffee, smoke their cigars, and stroll down the street.",

I do not know why there is so much hype around these boutique eclair shops in the Marais, nothing can compete with the chocolate, pistachio or coffee eclairs I have had here. I cant even begin to write about the apricot torte or the rhubarb cake, both of which are the perfect balance of tart and sweet, crumbly crust and melting filling. <br><br> The rustic fig bread or walnut and fruit bread are both incredible; often, breads with dried fruits skimp on the proportion but here, every bite is filled with flavor and generous chunks of fruit. The goat cheese walnut quiche or the three vegetable (eggplant, tomato, zucchini) quiche both have a fantastic balance of flavor and texture. Combined with a little something sweet, you have the perfect picnic in the Parc right next door. <br><br>A friend of mine lives close to this shop and had some of the chocolate eclairs specially made for a party and all three of the giant eclairs disappeared withing two minutes of them being brought out. The dark chocolate flowed out of the perfect dough and everybody was licking their fingers after devouring their slice of the eclair-cake. Whenever anybody visits me in Paris now,  I insist that this bakery is a *must* on their tourist itinerary. While visiting the US for Christmas, I keep thinking that the first thing I plan on doing as soon as I get back to Paris is to buy some sweet treat and take a stroll in the Parc; nothing could be a more perfect homecoming.",

"reviewcomment":"I had lunch at this bar/restaurant about 4 years ago on the recommendation of a Time Out guide and liked it so much that I went back this weekend to see if it had changed at all. It&#39;s supposed to be one of the &#39;hippest&#39; places in Paris apparently, although I really only went back for the salad, as it was probably one of the most beautiful things I have ever seen. Covered in all kinds of berries and colourful fruits, it was a delicous monster of a salad, completely not what I was expecting when I ordered it. <br>Unfortunately, on this occasion, it was far too cold for salad, so I went for soup instead. It was very tasty - a chestnutty concoction - but well overpriced. The service on this occasion was rather sharp too (I know, I know - it was Paris - but I have to say that the service was better last time, so maybe in their &#39;hip-ness&#39; they&#39;ve become a little complacent?<br>All in all, I think their reputation of being &#39;trendy&#39; pretty much outweighs the quality of the place these days. I came away rather disappointed, whereas last time I was blown away.",

"reviewcomment":"I heart you Paul!<br><br>While in Paris with my friend we were walking up and down different streets and my friend spotted this place while we were on the bus or in a taxi so the hunt was on.  <br><br>I didn&#39;t see it and all she knew was the approximate location and around where we were.  So we are walking and walking and just when we were about the throw in the towel she saw it.  Boy was I happy!  She had seen other Paul&#39;s but she liked the look and feel of this one for some reason.<br><br>So we go in and of course everything looks good.  I didn&#39;t just want bread but some yummy pastry to sink my teeth into.  I choose some chocolate delight from the frig and some little tart thingy which were both DELICIOUS!  I don&#39;t even like chocolate so why I thought it would taste any different here I just don&#39;t know.  I just loved the little boxes the package the pastries in.  Why we do not put more effort into presentation of to-go items in America is beyond me!<br><br>Both were very good even the chocolate one.  Before we even left for Paris we had a system to use so we could taste almost everything.  We buy one of everything and split it.  It worked like a dream and not even half way through my holiday I was over the Paris pastry thing.  <br><br>The bottom line is they are all good no matter where you get them from!  I know if I had grown up in France I could probably tell the different but I didn&#39;t so I can&#39;t.  All the bread was fresh and yummy.  All the pastries are made so delicate and are also yummy.<br><br>So while what I bought from Paul&#39;s was GREAT...every baked good I had was GREAT!<br><br>No wonder people from around the world go to train in France!  SO go to a Paul&#39;s while you&#39;re there.  You won&#39;t be disappointed, except when you have to return and you realize you don&#39;t have it at your fingertips any more.<br><br>In French...<br>J&#39;ai le cœur vous Paul !<br><br>Alors qu&#39;à Paris avec mon ami, nous nous promenions dans différentes rues et mon ami repéré cet endroit alors que nous étions dans le bus ou en taxi jusqu&#39;à la chasse était sur. <br><br>Je ne vois pas elle et tout ce qu&#39;elle savait était l&#39;emplacement de la spirante et près de là où nous étions. Donc nous sommes à pied et marche et juste quand nous étions sur le jet de l&#39;éponge elle a vu. Garçon j&#39;étais heureux ! Elle avait vu d&#39;autre Paul mais elle aimait l&#39;apparence de celui-ci pour une raison quelconque.<br><br>Donc, nous allons et bien sûr, tout semble bon. Je ne voulais juste pain mais des délicieux pâtisserie s&#39;enfoncer mes dents dans. Je choisissez quelques délice au chocolat dans le réfrigérateur et quelques petite grue bidule qui étaient les deux DELICIOUS ! Je n&#39;aime même pas chocolat alors pourquoi j&#39;ai pensé qu&#39;il aurait un goût différent ici je ne sais pas. J&#39;ai juste aimé les petites boîtes le paquet les pâtisseries dans. Pourquoi nous ne mettons pas plus d&#39;efforts dans la présentation des éléments à aller en Amérique, c&#39;est au-delà de moi !<br><br>Tous deux étaient très bonnes même celui au chocolat. Avant notre départ même pour Paris, nous avions un système à utiliser donc nous pouvions déguster presque tout. Nous en acheter un tout et le diviser. Il a travaillé comme un rêve et même pas à mi-chemin à travers de mes vacances, que je n&#39;étais plus la chose de pâtisserie de Paris. <br><br>L&#39;essentiel est qu&#39;ils sont tous bons, peu importe où vous les obtenir de ! Je sais que si j&#39;avais grandi en France, je pourrais probablement dire les différents mais je n&#39;ai pas donc je ne peux pas. Tout le pain était frais et délicieux. Toutes les pâtisseries sont faites si délicates et sont également délicieux.<br><br>Ainsi alors que ce que j&#39;ai acheté de Paul était grand... chaque bon cuit au four, que j&#39;ai eu était grande !<br><br>Aucuns étonnant que les gens de partout dans le monde ne vont se pour entraîner en France ! ALORS allez à un Paul pendant que vous êtes là. Vous ne serez pas déçu, sauf quand il faut retourner et vous réalisez que vous n&#39;avez pas il au bout des doigts plus.",

They have a pastry case full of delicious pastries. They had loafs of chocolate, banana, and carrot cakes as well as cheesecakes, macarons, and muffins. I opted for the carrot and boy was I happy.

I might stop in again tomorrow since I will be in the area again and buy some tea to take back home.

When you only make cheesecake, it has to be perfect, innovative and daring. Though online it appears that they have some creative flavors, the ones left by the time we got there were pretty standard. It was a harder choice what to pick, than what not to pick like it normally is for me in patisseries. But in the end we chose Lion, Tagada, and Carmel pecan. The Carmel pecan was my least favorite, though the prettiest. I really really liked Tagada ( strawberry candy flavored) and the Lion was good though needed a bit more caramel or something. This place is still relatively new, but I think a little innovation could go a long way. If you live here and love making dessert pilgrimages, definitely go but I&#39;d pass if you have a limited amount of time in the city.",

"reviewcomment":"3.25 stars<br>Bonus points: diaper changing area, stroller parking<br><br>A tiny, but cute, makes you say &#34;awwwww&#34; kind of parent-children café and activity space. You know, one of those places that uses the Curlz font on all of their publicity. Upstairs is the café, which has drinks and small nibbles. They&#39;ve got stroller parking in the back (hard to navigate to with all the tables, though) and even a changing room. Downstairs is the space for the ateliers. They host numerous different events for both children and parents to be. The activities aren&#39;t cheap, but not as expensive as some of the other kids events in Paris. My biggest issue with Le Poussette is that they only have 1 type of beer on the menu. That&#39;s it. No.other.alcohol. I&#39;m not sure how other people mentally manage toddlers. Me, I need a bit more than tea and cake. But, at least I could put my kid down in the very small (probably 6m2) play area in the café and look on while other people&#39;s children entertain mine for a while. They have a wall full of unnecessary and over-priced children items for sale in the café as well. And, all of these things are within arms reach of the children. Wise plan for increasing their sales. I think when most of the kids grab stuff, their parents feel obligated to buy it. When my kid started pulling things down (and, shhhh, don&#39;t tell anyone - pulled the head off a doll that I secretly replaced and put back on the shelf), I glance at the staff with a &#34;you know, this is your fault&#34; look on my face and they feel responsible. I&#39;m picking up on the French technique of never taking the blame for anything that goes wrong. It&#39;s a nice stop if you&#39;re in the area and need to do a fast diaper change or a break during a day out with the stroller.",

First of all, everybody was extremely friendly at this place (despite the group of us not having reservations and coming in for a late lunch and being the last to leave). <br><br>We started off with great bread, excellent butter, sea salt and a fish spread. <br><br>My friend and I got the fish - surprisingly very light (go figure for French food!). Other friend got the beef tartare and it came with fantastic French fries that we concluded must have been bathed in duck fat. Other friend got the steak which was cooked perfectly. <br><br>Now the desserts. There is one that still holds a place in my heart. It was the creme caramel served in a mason jar. The liquid caramel on bottom with thousands of little black dots from the vanilla beans with perfectly smooth custard on top. And the creme de la creme (pardon the pun) was the burnt layer on top that you see on creme brulee. Some places don&#39;t get this layer right but here it was exceptionally crunchy. The other dessert was great, too - a very light almost-whipped yogurt studded with vanilla beans and served with fruit. <br><br>Top this off with some rose and it was the perfect leisurely Parisian lunch.",

"reviewcomment":"The friendliest man we met in Paris works here! He (and his co-workers) put together gelato in the shape of flowers so quickly we barely had time to take pictures. He was kind and walked through the menu with us, translating as he went. A small cone can handle 1-2 flavors, so I got speculoos and stracciatella. <br><br>Cool neighborhood with narrow streets that reminded me of Tokyo. Just a few steps away from the Denfert-Rochereau metro station.",

"reviewcomment":"The selection of chocolate is not huge, but the quality is unbeatable.  I am a big fan of dark chocolate ganache ( I don&#39;t eat milk chocolate and don&#39;t like praline, because they tend to be far too sweet) and I had the best jasmine one ever;  the wonderful flavour of Jasmine lasted for a very long time after I savoured it and it was definitely not too sweet.  I also tried Earl Grey and it was fine as well.  Their chocolate costs 50% more than Patrick Roger&#39;s, but it&#39;s worth it.  I can clearly taste the big difference in the quality of conching and of the chocolate they use.  The size of the chocolate is small, so you can select more varieties for the weight.  We didn&#39;t try the pastry, so we cannot comment on that.",

"reviewcomment":"I loved this place. I stayed in Paris for four weeks and must&#39;ve come about eight times. There is a lot of Vietnamese influence in Paris, and the result of that is amazingly yummy Vietnamese food. Kim Ly is quite small-- the restaurant itself seats only about 15 people. Most people take-out. In peak times, namely noon during lunch, the wait for your food even with a take-out order.<br><br>With that said, definitely come here for a taste of Vietnamese food in Paris. Basically everyone gets &#39;Bo Bum&#39;, which is the local version of an Vietnamese-American vermicelli. The salad part is still there, the sweet and sour dressing too, as well as the vermicelli of course. The only difference is the French version substitutes beef instead of pork (dietary preference differences between the two cultures). The Bo Bum is 8 euros, quite filling. Served in a plastic bowl.",

Absolutely fresh bread, perfect snails, steak and Tartare  this was only topped by the perfect service, who was explaining everything while we all mixed French and English talking. Only at the end the waiter was disappointed by a service charge mounting to about 10%, which was a little bit confusing. Anyway, definitely a recommendation!<br>Expect to spent 20 EUR on a menu per person (but absolutely worth it!), for 2 with drinks and some wine and service the sum will reach 65 EUR easily.",

"reviewcomment":"My girl friend and I were walking around one night looking for a place to eat. Our hotel was right around the corner. It was late, we were hungry and cold (it was winter &#39;12). We passed places that looked like bars.. finally, we stumbled in here. The place was crowded, loud, warm and the smell of food called us from the cold Parisian streets. We waited by the door along with the other prospective patrons. One of the waiters came over and asked how many, I replied back in English &#34;two&#34; then he asked another couple nearby. He then led all four of us (yes the other couple we found out were fellow Americans) into the restaurant. Lo and behold, he sat all four of us together in a booth! Go figure, put all the Americans in one table. <br><br>Surprisingly, it was one of the funnest and most awkward dinners I&#39;ve had in my life! It was awkward because we found out that we were sitting across a couple who were on their honeymoon. It was fun because they were great company! The food at this place was amazing! We had a bottle of wine and dessert. I believe the bill wasn&#39;t too expensive. William, our server, was so lively, entertaining and made really great recommendations for food. Fond memories about the food at this place will fuel my dreams until I come back.",

"reviewcomment":"We finally got the chance to go here on our last day in Paris.  The design of this bakery is stunning.  The entrance is a glass structure and the light radiating from the inside gives the place an evanescence glow as you stand outside looking in. The interior design of the bakery is modern and simple. We were there in the early morning, which gave us the opportunity to observe the staff prepare the pastries from behind the counter. It was a treat. Now, onto the food:<br><br>-Maple Muffin was good. Crunchy on the exterior and moist on the inside. It was not too sweet and had enough chocolate. <br><br>-The Lemon Cake was surprisingly good as it was filled with an powerful lemon favor, balanced by the sweetness of the iced frosting.  <br><br>We saw the Carrot Cake being prepared and if they were ready, we would have ordered that too!",

"reviewcomment":"Great Butcher!<br><br>I went to this butcher one Saturday while in Paris on holiday.  I stayed an in apartment just up the street so this was really convenient to stop here and get something for dinner for Sunday since the city practically closes down.<br><br>The line was really long as I suppose many people go and get fresh cuts of meat almost every day.  The kitchens and frigs aren&#39;t like in America.  I like that aspect of going to get fresh meat every day or so.  If you have a weak stomach you should probably steer clear as it is pretty bloody.<br><br>My French is horrible but I did try and probably failed miserably.  So I was a little nervous standing in line.  But I notice that they had chicken that was already cooked and on a broiler rotisserie with cooked some baby potatoes at the bottom.  The guy working the chicken stand (for lack of a better word), had a cart just outside the butcher store and was able to help me. <br><br>I was so happy because I knew how to say the number &#34;1&#34; and the word &#34;chicken&#34; and between that and hello, thank you and a few charades and pointing in the right direction,  I was able to get my rotisserie chicken and cooked baby potatoes for my Sunday dinner and be on my way.<br><br>I did end up going inside the butcher shop and getting a pound of prosciutto.  But I got to the front and the lady asked what I wanted and so I used my broken French for the number and sad &#34;Prosciutto&#34;.  I didn&#39;t know there were some many different kinds.  So I just got what the lady before me got.  I don&#39;t think I would notice the difference.<br><br>They were super nice and could see I was at the very least trying to use the little bit of French I knew.  I&#39;m sure it was pretty funny listening to me.  But they were super gracious and kind and helpful!<br>I hope to go back again!<br><br>In French...<br><br>Grande boucherie !<br><br>Je suis allé à cette boucherie un samedi alors qu&#39;à Paris en vacances. Je suis resté un appartement en haut de la rue, donc c&#39;était vraiment pratique pour s&#39;arrêter là et obtenir quelque chose pour le dîner de dimanche puisque la ville pratiquement ferme ses portes.<br><br>La ligne était vraiment longue, comme je suppose que beaucoup de gens aller et obtenir des morceaux de viande fraîches presque tous les jours. Les cuisines et branle ne sont pas comme en Amérique. J&#39;aime cet aspect d&#39;aller pour obtenir des viandes fraîches tous les jours ou presque. Si vous avez un estomac fragile vous devriez probablement éloignez-vous comme c&#39;est assez sanglant.<br><br>Mon français est horrible, mais j&#39;ai essayé et probablement a lamentablement échoué. Si j&#39;étais un peu nerveux queue. Mais j&#39;ai remarqué qu&#39;ils avaient de poulet qui a été déjà cuits et sur une rôtisserie de poulets de chair avec cuites quelques petites pommes de terre au fond. Le gars du stand de poulet (faute d&#39;un meilleur mot), de travail avait un panier juste à l&#39;extérieur du magasin Boucher et a été capable de m&#39;aider. <br><br>J&#39;étais tellement heureuse parce que je savais comment dire le chiffre &#34; 1 &#34; et le mot &#34; poulet &#34; et entre ça et Bonjour, je vous remercie et quelques charades et pointent dans la bonne direction, j&#39;ai pu obtenir ma rotisserie poulet et cuit de petites pommes de terre pour mon dîner de dimanche et être sur mon chemin.<br><br>Je ne finissent pas aller à l&#39;intérieur de la boucherie et d&#39;obtenir un livre de prosciutto. Mais je suis arrivé à l&#39;avant et la Dame a demandé ce que je voulais et j&#39;ai donc utilisé mon français cassé pour le nombre et la triste &#34; Prosciutto &#34;. Je ne savais pas qu&#39;il y avait quelques beaucoup de différents genres. Donc, je viens de recevoir ce que la dame qui m&#39;as. Je ne pense pas que je voudrais un avis la différence.<br><br>Ils étaient super gentils et pouvaient voir que j&#39;étais à la très moins essayer d&#39;utiliser le peu de français, j&#39;ai su. Je ne sais pas que c&#39;était assez drôle m&#39;écoute. Mais ils étaient super gracieux et aimable et serviable !<br><br>J&#39;espère pouvoir y retourner !",

Two hours later I was still there, seated at one of the two tables enjoying some laughs with the affable manager while nibbling one of the best sandwiches I have had in Paris!<br><br>To call this hidden shop a treasure is an understatement  -- it is a culinary revelation. Part specialty food store, part café, part deli it is one of the rare places in Paris where you can shop, sit and snack all in the same place. Abruzze reminds me of the meat stores in the Italian neighborhood where I grew up in Brooklyn, where marvelous meats are sliced thin as paper and wrapped into packets to go, or folded and stuffed into hearty sandwiches.<br><br>At the advice of the man behind the counter I ordered a rostello pork sandwich with arugula, balsamic vinegar and slow-roasted tomatoes on a baguette from Djibril Bodian&#39;s Le Grenier à Pain Abbesses (voted the best baguette in Paris in 2010!). Succulent, salty, crunchy with a tangy bite, it is the best sandwich in Paris. <br><br>At lunchtime you can order a sandwich for 5,80E made with one of the fine imported meats (Mortadella, Rostello, Salami with Fennel, etc) on display, and for 7,50E you can have it with a drink and one of the amazing homemade desserts (get the Sfogliatelle with cream). <br><br>While the sandwiches are definitely the main attraction, the epicerie is chock-full of fabulous items, like Corsican Whiskey, Labrusco, Porcini mushroom bouillon cubes and risotto. As if you needed more incentive to go!",

"reviewcomment":"Sunday brunch, the restaurant offers a prix-fixe menu for 24 euros. It starts with a fruit smoothy (delicious), followed by your choice of hot beverage served with some mini viennoiseries, your choice between 3 entrees and a dessert! <br>For my main dish, I picked the oeufs brouillés with saumon fumé. It was very good (a bit watery but scrambled eggs are often like that), served in a small jar with a multi grain toast. Dessert was a pana cotta with raspberry coulis. All was very good, home-made, healthy which made our visit a fantastic sunday brunch. The decor is very home-y with books, couches and they even have a floor downstairs and a outside patio! Go there next sunday!",

"reviewcomment":"How to decide where to eat in Paris when alone.. Opens up Google and types in &#34;oldest restaurant in Paris&#34;. Viola, I find myself in this small and elegant restaurant, Le Procope Est. 1686. <br><br>The restaurant has a lot of paintings of important dead people of the past. Ben Franklin was among the notable people who has dined here. In fact.. I think I sat in the very spot he did... just a gut feeling.. <br><br>I ordered the famous steak tartare (minched raw beef). I had to think twice about ordering this dish since I&#39;m accustomed to eating my beef cooked, but it&#39;s popular around Paris and since I was there, I better give it a go. 10 minutes later, I was all smiles. The dish was delicious, especially with how they marinated it! There was a definite punch to the flavor. I wasn&#39;t too crazy about their french fries (go figure) though. <br><br>For dessert I had their tiramisu and I can say that it was the BEST I&#39;ve ever had in my time on planet earth! I felt like I was getting a taste of heaven after each bite. Too bad heaven only lasted three bites. <br><br>Service is not great. For a restaurant in France I would say it&#39;s average, but if it were in LA, it would be considered terrible. It took them 7 minutes to retrieve a menu for me, and 10 minutes to get me water. The waitress also gave me an attitude after I politely asked for the WiFi password. She had to remind me that getting me the password wasn&#39;t her top priority. <br><br>But, aside from their &#34;average&#34; service, their delicious food makes it a solid 4 star restaurant in my book. Here&#39;s to the next 327 years!",

"reviewcomment":"If you&#39;re fed of heavy chou pastry or rich chocolate pastries then Patisserie Ciel is the spot to come for something a little lighter. These Japanese angel cakes provide a welcome respite from French patisseries.<br><br>It such a lovely experience mainly due to the gracious and smiley servers who are attentive to your every request. From the moment you sit down they place a compressed hand towel in front of you which expands when water touches it, they then bring over your delightful cake accompanied with your drink and let you enjoy the space without ever rushing you. <br><br>The sponge cake was light and fluffy with a creamy mousse center and the litchi juice which I hesitated to order was indeed surprisingly delicious.<br><br>It costs 12 euro for an angel cake and a drink of your juice which include tea or an Allain Milliat juice. I would say that it is slightly expensive for such a light cake with little patisserie genius yet for the whole experience it is well worth the money.",

The place is really small and cozy and always busy but thats what gives it the awesome vibe. I finally ventured in here a sunday evening just before dinner and at first there wasnt a table, but the server was really helpful and asked if we could share a table with two other people.<br><br>Me and my friend ordered 3 cups of wine (2.90€-3.30€ each) and then a &#34;apéritif mixe&#34; with sliced sausage and cantal cheese. It was a good portion and it was only 3.50€ -- it also came with a basket of bread. The wine was good, the cheese was amazing and it was great experience. Definitely coming back here more often!",

"reviewcomment":"Yes, the service is a little bit rushed. The waitresses are running around like mad trying to serve the customers so they can turn the tables for the folks waiting in line. (But they won&#39;t rush *you*. In France, you can sit as long as you want, in my experience, until you&#39;re ready to ask the server for the &#34;l&#39;addition&#34; (the check).<br><br>So why the 5 stars?<br><br>1) You&#39;re eating in a palatial room.<br><br>2) The prices are more than reasonable for Paris. I had a very filling large slice of quiche, a wonderfully fresh and light mixed salad and a heavenly framboise (raspberry) tart for ~17 Euro. That&#39;s a steal by Parisian standards. My wife raved about her salad with smoked salmon and salmon mousse, with boiled potatoes on the side. Sounds simple, but the difference between the French and everyone else is that they can do simple and have it come out ethereal.<br><br>Note that you must get here before 3 p.m. if you want lunch, after that it becomes a tea and cake place. Not that there&#39;s anything wrong with going here for tea and cake. I&#39;d probably like to do that myself at some point.<br><br>They also have a covered terrace overlooking the mansion&#39;s courtyard, but I think you&#39;d be mad to pass up a chance to have lunch in the Jacquemart-Andre cafe dining room.<br><br>Oh and most of the other diners looked and sounded like locals, which is always good news, especially in a city as heavily touristed as Paris. <br><br>If you like art, consider visiting the Jacquemart-Andre museum before or after your lunch at the cafe. (You can attend the cafe with or without paying the 11 Euro for entrance to the museum.) The entrance fee may seem a little steep and it&#39;s not included in the Paris Museum Pass, but you do get a free audioguide included with your admission price and the museum does have some great 18th century artwork in a much more intimate and charming setting than you&#39;ll find at the Louvre.<br><br>Amusez-vous bien et bon appetit!",

"reviewcomment":"Chapeau Melon is unlike any restaurant I&#39;ve been to in Paris in that you really feel like you&#39;re dining in someone&#39;s home. The dining room consists of large, wooden communal tables that look like they&#39;ve been acquired from a retired farmer, walls of wine that operate as open pantries, vintage sewing machines converted into cozy tables, and a lone chalkboard with the daily menu that makes it way from table to table as guests arrive. <br><br>No need to get fancy here, the guests, like the hosts, are as laid-back as you get in Paris (shorts, flip flops, t-shirts), and at times it&#39;s hard to tell which people belong to which camp. <br><br>A super friendly guy dining on the terrasse seemed to sort of work there, but never actually did anything more than hang out in the kitchen after his meal and chat up the chef. And while we were leaving our short-clad waiter had pulled up a chair at one of the tables and was sampling wines with a group of women..<br><br>The same, relaxed unfussy attitude was found in the cooking too. The three course (sans dessert) meal at 32E/person was light and lovely. My marinated makerel in a slightly sweet Japanese vinegar was heavenly, as well as the thin slice of veal served cool with a tangy tuna sauce. Our main, a light beef brisket in a vegetable broth with roasted spring vegetables was great too, but a little bland. <br><br>Overall the whole experience was great, and the wine was just divine, but there was no &#34;OMG!&#34; moment to the meal (hence the four instead of five stars). But I would totally go back in a flash!",

I may take up making my own macarons and apricotinis in hopes that I can approximate the deliciousness.<br><br>These cafes also make coffee and chocolate chaud.

Although Iberian ham is from Spain it can be found all over Paris. <br><br>You may be asking yourself why I want to go to Paris and try ham? It is an experience that should not miss. The ham does not taste like the ham we are used to in America. The flavors are so much better and its cut paper thin and just melts away in your mouth. Pair it with a local red wine and you are good to go.<br><br>It can get pricey especially for the black footed ham but you should try it. You can really taste the grasses and the acorns in the meat which gives off a pleasant flavor and aroma. <br><br>Melt in your mouth goodness!",

I would agree that Monoprix is similar to a Target in the States. <br><br>We did buy some clothes for our god daughter here as a gift to bring back. While in Target, you&#39;d probably see in the toddler section a bright pink shirt with a cutesy phrase written in very large glittered font splashed in front. I&#39;ve noticed in this country there are smarter and muted sartorial options for kids while still managing to look adorable without the hefty price. We picked up the following for her: a navy/white striped tank, a grey cardigan sweater with elbow patches (it was from the boy&#39;s section but looked very stylish on her!) and a chambray dress. They were all things we see for probably 4x the cost in toddler boutique stores but were reasonably priced here.<br><br>For us we picked up some bottles of water and snacks to take home to our flat. <br><br>We&#39;ll be heading back to Paris again next month and I imagine we&#39;ll probably make a couple trips to Monoprix.",

Fantastic selection of flavors from creamy goodness (dark chocolate, chocolate hazletnut [MY FAVE], mint chocolate) to light and sweet fruity flavors. You can choose from a cup or a cone in small, medium, or large. You can choose multiple flavors AND they make cones into pretty little flowers if you choose multiple flavors.<br><br>I&#39;m in love with the chocolate hazletnut but the dark chocolate and mint chocolate were great as well. Fortunately and to my demise, this place is right by where I&#39;m staying so I&#39;ve already gone twice! My travel companions also vouch for the fruity flavors as well as the macaroons (particularly the pink - possibly raspberry - one). it&#39;s definitely a place to stop in - here or at another location - evidently there&#39;s a bunch all over the city!",

Both were sublime. Nothing beats this place on a hot summer day. <br><br>The only thing I would note is that this place is kinda pricey, but it&#39;s expected for a place that specializes in fruit dishes in Paris, right?<br><br>Also, the service is pretty slow most of the time. The second time I came here, there was an American family waiting to be served. After 10 minutes of having no one come to their table they just got up and left. Take note! so you don&#39;t end up making us Americans look even worse in the eyes of every other country out there...",

We left a handsome tip and multiple merci beaucoups for him :)",

It&#39;s money well spent in my opinion :-))<br><br>If you have never had a macaron in Paris then you should add this to your list of things to do.

I asked for a falafel sandwich in my broken French, which seemed like a safe bet at a middle eastern restaurant where it&#39;s one of only 6 or 7 things on the big menu on the wall. But when I asked for it (and pointed - she knew what I was saying), the waitress had to consult her peers to see if my outlandish request was possible to fulfill. It was, but she wasn&#39;t too happy about it. She said it would be 5 minutes, which is a lot in this fast paced, high-turnover deli where, I now understand, most people just point to the deli items they want in the case.<br><br>15 minutes later and after several targeted, forcefully annoyed glances back at the waitress with whom I had placed my order, I had my falafel sandwich. My expectations were pretty low at this point, but the sandwich was actually very good. Not the best falafel I&#39;ve ever had, but one of the better incarnations I&#39;ve had in Paris.",

"reviewcomment":"Marcel is a great place to grab lunch, as I discovered from my last visit to Paris. Indian food generally has a lot of good vegetarian items, but this is where Marcel really shines, in my opinion. I had some curried soup bean dish thing, and it was completely filling and perfect for refueling. The mint tea was fresh, with beautiful leaves in the pot. Cool ambiance, large windows, parlor like and dark but still really cosy. For me, this is a place that invites you to linger and really savor the meal. I recommend! Great location in a place where it can be hard to pick where to have a meal...I know that Marcel will always be a wonderful place.",

"reviewcomment":"I tried to Yelp this place back in October 2009 but could not figure out how to enter restaurants that were in Paris, France. Looks like we CAN Yelp Europe now so here is my 1.5-year-old review.<br><br>Every night this place was packed with a crowd of people around the entrance.  We ate at Chez Andre which is across the street twice.  We came early, intent on getting in.  30 minutes before they opened, there was already a crowd forming. When my wife and I were seated we soon found out why.  There is a single menu posted outside in the window. It is typed-up, and I think it varies day-to-day.  You don&#39;at get to choose. Everyone gets the same foods. When you are seated, they bring you your drinks, water, soft dringks, sparkling water, or wines. Then without asking you at all what you want, they bring out the salad.  One choice for all.  It is an all-you-can-eat salad, and bottom-less bread basket.  Then, when you have had enough salad, out comes the push cart with the main entree. This night it was a lightly-breaded steak in a very rich, cream sauce.  Also, a mountain of fried potatoes.  When you plate is empty, the waiter returns and fills your plate with more steak and more potatoes. This is a French, gourmet, All-you-can-eat place.  At the end they have a dessert cart too.  The desserts were indescribable. I never thought I would have gourmet food served AYCE.  LOL  I nearly exploded, and was definitely drunk from all the wine afterwards.  Loved it.  No wonder it is always packed with people. Good quality, and a good deal.",

It has become a meeting spot for fashion lovers who enjoy sipping on very reasonably priced wine surrounded by the bar&#39;s  shabby-chic decor. I&#39;m giving it 4 stars because of the cheap drinks but I was tempted to give it only 3 because of the poorly maintained restrooms.

"reviewcomment":"Okay I&#39;ve officially entered &#34;hibernation mode&#34; in Paris. I know it&#39;s only October but for a Texan, this feels like the icy depths of hell and I want to bury under the covers and not come up until April. Seeing as how that&#39;s not an option, I decided I can at least have a happy medium by holing up in cozy cafes for hours with good friends and hot drinks. Enter L&#39;Oisivethe. <br><br>A delicious combination of tea house and knitting store, this place screams &#34;I am girlie and I like tea caddies and kittens and reading fashion magazines and knitting hats for my dad.&#34; I knew places like this existed in Portland, Oregon, but I didn&#39;t expect them in Paris. I&#39;m not sure the whole &#34;hipster knitting&#34; has caught on here. Nevertheless, it is alive and well near the Place d&#39;Italie metro. The neighborhood was filled with cute shops and restaurants, but the tea shop is my favorite. Not only do they serve a fixed price brunch on weekends, but they appeared to have a daily special going as well: 5.50 for a tiny coffee, your choice of cookie/pain d&#39;epice/citrus cake, some fruit, and a teeny bowl of spiced ice cream--make that 7.50 for a pot of tea. <br><br>And the tea options are overwhelming. In fact I was so overwhelmed I got the coffee. Lame, I know. But I&#39;ll be back. Seeing as how the place is quite small, I would show up at an &#34;off&#34; time, as it was absolutely packed on a Saturday night, and god knows I wasn&#39;t going to sit outside. Plus, they close early--around 7pm.<br><br>Bring your best girlfriend or mum when it&#39;s absolutely nasty outside. My only complaint: no comfy, squashy armchairs to lounge in and knit for hours....",

The walls were packed with colourful displays of a mix of both chocolates and candies. A giant fountain of chocolate sprang to life as we entered the shop. After filling our bags with any and every kind of truffle we could find we found ourselves eyeing the pot of hot chocolate by the cash register. Although we had to wait about 5 minutes or so for it to heat up it was well worth the wait. It ended up possibly being the best hot chocolate I have ever tasted in my LIFE....imagine what the chocolate river in Charlie and The Chocolate Factory would taste like and multiply it by about 100..... Sweet but not too sweet, thick but not too thick, hot but not too hot! After arriving back at the hotel we were pleasantly surprised by the same kind of deliciousness in our truffles....so much so that we ate them all in one sitting and will most likely have to pay another visit to the shop before we leave on Friday! I highly recommend that if you find yourself in the area you should stop by and enjoy all that deNeuville has to offer, particularly the hot chocolate!",

"reviewcomment":"I&#39;ve lived in the 11th, 17th, 10th and now 2nd arrondisments and visited at least two butchers per neighborhood as well as the meat cases of innumerable Monoprixes, Casinos, Marché Us, and Franprixes.<br><br> After all this experience, Tribolet is my go to butcher.<br><br> First and foremost, the quality of the meat is excellent. I live down the street and see the daily delivery of whole carcasses. My husband is constantly saying things like, Where&#39;d you get the lamb chops? They&#39;re fantastic! and This bacon is so gooooood!<br><br> Secondly, they have a broad, comprehensive selection. Whole carcasses means that I can get the cut of meat for which I&#39;m searching. Beef brisket for making corned beef? No problem! Wild game in season - rabbit, pig, pheasants, ducks, quail, etc. Charcuterie - poitrine fumée (bacon to Americans), boudin noir, saucisson sec, merguez, jamon, etc.<br><br> Third, the service is patient, courteous and personable. I don&#39;t speak much French and they don&#39;t speak any English beyond chicken (I suppose due to all of the tourists who buy the poulet roti?), but even if it&#39;s painful and takes 3x as long, they&#39;ll patiently ask questions and pantomine until they understand what it is I&#39;d like and how I&#39;d like it. I also get complimented profusely for every new French word I use (talk about incentive!)<br><br> I also appreciate that I can come in and tell them that I have no idea what to cook and they&#39;ll make suggestions of what to cook (often low cost options) AND give tips on how they&#39;d prepare it. In other words, recipes! I&#39;ve even gotten recommendations on what sides to serve. It&#39;s like taking a mini French cooking class.<br><br> They&#39;re also quite skilled, so your meat is trimmed properly (no little bone chunks and enough fat for braising meats to really get tender). The fact that I can get really specific about how and how much I want something prepped saves me time in the kitchen.<br><br> Finally, while some cuts are on the expensive side, some items can be cheaper than the lesser quality version at Monoprix. They also have a EUR4.80 roasted chicken that is just the right size for two people (quite small) with enough left over to make soup. That&#39;s the cheapest price I&#39;ve seen for poulet roti on Montorgueil.<br><br> Of special note: They stock specialty items for holidays - for example, turkeys &amp; chapon at Christmas.",

"reviewcomment":"While cruising through for an afternoon wine, my boyfriend forced me into this out-doorsy, hipster orientated, nature shop. When a French man swears his legience to anything organic and vegetarian- it deserves investigation. <br><br>Think the au naturale version of Brooks Brothers- sitting in a tree house contemplating a gadget that makes watering your betterave plant a whole lot easier. This is Nature et Decouvertes.<br><br>The best part about this store is its location- Cour Saint-Emilion. This courtyard is a must-see and dodges a lot of the typical touristy type. It is just lit up with lights, day or night, and the casual-chic atmosphere makes you want to buy something from Nature et Decouvertes just to play with it in the courtyard for hours. Grab some wine, sit and dine; this is what Paris is all about.<br><br>Tips: Be sure to head across the street (towards the Metro stop) to check out the botanical garden that is just amazing, quaint- refreshing contrast to the vastness of the Luxembourg.",

All the grandeur of the Champs-Élysées with the intimate personal service you&#39;d expect of your local cheese shop. While staying in Montmartre Fromagerie Quatrehomme became a part of my daily routine. <br><br>The moment you walk in the door you will notice the permeating smell. There is a key difference between good bad smelling cheese and bad bad smelling cheese. Everything that this Fromagerie has to offer is good, bad smelling cheese. The attentive staff is quick to assist you in your every need and careful cut, slice of spread a sampling of their amazing cheeses for you to try. Pay attention to how delicately they handle the cheese and serve even the smallest sample on a piece of parchment paper; every last bit of cheese is handled with care. <br><br>Visiting Paris? Taking a leisurely stroll with Montmartre? Stop in Fromagerie Quatrehomme. You&#39;ll thank me later....",

"reviewcomment":"3.25 stars<br>Bonus points: diaper changing area, stroller parking<br><br>A tiny, but cute, makes you say &#34;awwwww&#34; kind of parent-children café and activity space. You know, one of those places that uses the Curlz font on all of their publicity. Upstairs is the café, which has drinks and small nibbles. They&#39;ve got stroller parking in the back (hard to navigate to with all the tables, though) and even a changing room. Downstairs is the space for the ateliers. They host numerous different events for both children and parents to be. The activities aren&#39;t cheap, but not as expensive as some of the other kids events in Paris. My biggest issue with Le Poussette is that they only have 1 type of beer on the menu. That&#39;s it. No.other.alcohol. I&#39;m not sure how other people mentally manage toddlers. Me, I need a bit more than tea and cake. But, at least I could put my kid down in the very small (probably 6m2) play area in the café and look on while other people&#39;s children entertain mine for a while. They have a wall full of unnecessary and over-priced children items for sale in the café as well. And, all of these things are within arms reach of the children. Wise plan for increasing their sales. I think when most of the kids grab stuff, their parents feel obligated to buy it. When my kid started pulling things down (and, shhhh, don&#39;t tell anyone - pulled the head off a doll that I secretly replaced and put back on the shelf), I glance at the staff with a &#34;you know, this is your fault&#34; look on my face and they feel responsible. I&#39;m picking up on the French technique of never taking the blame for anything that goes wrong. It&#39;s a nice stop if you&#39;re in the area and need to do a fast diaper change or a break during a day out with the stroller.",

"reviewcomment":"First of all, this is the fanciest Starbucks I have ever visited. <br><br>We were on our way to Galeries Lafayette when we stumbled upon this location. We were just going to grab-and-go but after seeing the interior decor of this place, we had to stay and enjoy it a little bit. <br><br>It is so pretty inside; it felt like we were having afternoon tea at the palace. It is actually quite big, but it was incredibly busy and loud. People were waiting in different areas, trying to spot where others were about to get up and leave (similar to eating at a busy food court). <br><br>This was our first time visiting Starbucks in Europe. The pastries are a little different from Toronto, but we did not try them (considering there are so many better patisseries in Paris!). With regards to the costs, we notice the pricing system was quite similar to others stores in Paris that we have in Canada as well. Basically the numbers were quite the same but in euros; i.e. a tall coffee costs $2 with change in Toronto, while it costs 2€ in Paris.",

"reviewcomment":"Lovely little lunch spot in Paris, serving a great menu of French country classics. I had a salad gourmond, fois gras, geziers du canard, and magret fumee on a bad of delicious leaves. Wash it down with the red of the day, and tuck in a tarte aux figes for dessert, you can&#39;t really go wrong with this place.<br><br> It&#39;s also just round the corner from Partech - one of Europe&#39;s best VC houses, so if you happen to have a great business idea whilst wolfing your lunch down, you can get funding for it straight afterwards.

Just the other day one of the staff caught himself cooing and my kid and sprung into place to ring up my order. Now if only they&#39;d open a location closer to where I live so I can take advantage of their fabulous 2E coffee + daily newspaper morning menu!",

The pictures show items such as Cholula (sp?), canned beans, chipotle peppers in adobo etc. They have none of this anymore.  I didn&#39;t eat there, went specfically looking for Topatio hot sauce.  You can find Cholula &amp; Valentino hot sauce at Izrael Epicirie near the Marais, but better take a loan out.  A small bottle of Cholula is $9 Euros and a small Cholula is I think $12.  That makes the liter size bottle about $100 euros if they had it.  Bring it with you if you need it.  That said, Izrael had a ton of spices &amp; dry black beans.  Mexi and Co. looked like the food may have been good though, I will try it next time I&#39;m in Paris.",

While in Target, you&#39;d probably see in the toddler section a bright pink shirt with a cutesy phrase written in very large glittered font splashed in front. I&#39;ve noticed in this country there are smarter and muted sartorial options for kids while still managing to look adorable without the hefty price. We picked up the following for her: a navy/white striped tank, a grey cardigan sweater with elbow patches (it was from the boy&#39;s section but looked very stylish on her!) and a chambray dress. They were all things we see for probably 4x the cost in toddler boutique stores but were reasonably priced here.<br><br>For us we picked up some bottles of water and snacks to take home to our flat. <br><br>We&#39;ll be heading back to Paris again next month and I imagine we&#39;ll probably make a couple trips to Monoprix.",

Although Iberian ham is from Spain it can be found all over Paris. <br><br>You may be asking yourself why I want to go to Paris and try ham? It is an experience that should not miss. The ham does not taste like the ham we are used to in America. The flavors are so much better and its cut paper thin and just melts away in your mouth. Pair it with a local red wine and you are good to go.<br><br>It can get pricey especially for the black footed ham but you should try it. You can really taste the grasses and the acorns in the meat which gives off a pleasant flavor and aroma. <br><br>Melt in your mouth goodness!",

Fantastic selection of flavors from creamy goodness (dark chocolate, chocolate hazletnut [MY FAVE], mint chocolate) to light and sweet fruity flavors. You can choose from a cup or a cone in small, medium, or large. You can choose multiple flavors AND they make cones into pretty little flowers if you choose multiple flavors.<br><br>I&#39;m in love with the chocolate hazletnut but the dark chocolate and mint chocolate were great as well. Fortunately and to my demise, this place is right by where I&#39;m staying so I&#39;ve already gone twice! My travel companions also vouch for the fruity flavors as well as the macaroons (particularly the pink - possibly raspberry - one). it&#39;s definitely a place to stop in - here or at another location - evidently there&#39;s a bunch all over the city!",

The walls were packed with colourful displays of a mix of both chocolates and candies. A giant fountain of chocolate sprang to life as we entered the shop. After filling our bags with any and every kind of truffle we could find we found ourselves eyeing the pot of hot chocolate by the cash register. Although we had to wait about 5 minutes or so for it to heat up it was well worth the wait. It ended up possibly being the best hot chocolate I have ever tasted in my LIFE....imagine what the chocolate river in Charlie and The Chocolate Factory would taste like and multiply it by about 100..... Sweet but not too sweet, thick but not too thick, hot but not too hot! After arriving back at the hotel we were pleasantly surprised by the same kind of deliciousness in our truffles....so much so that we ate them all in one sitting and will most likely have to pay another visit to the shop before we leave on Friday! I highly recommend that if you find yourself in the area you should stop by and enjoy all that deNeuville has to offer, particularly the hot chocolate!",

This is Nature et Decouvertes.<br><br>The best part about this store is its location- Cour Saint-Emilion. This courtyard is a must-see and dodges a lot of the typical touristy type. It is just lit up with lights, day or night, and the casual-chic atmosphere makes you want to buy something from Nature et Decouvertes just to play with it in the courtyard for hours. Grab some wine, sit and dine; this is what Paris is all about.<br><br>Tips: Be sure to head across the street (towards the Metro stop) to check out the botanical garden that is just amazing, quaint- refreshing contrast to the vastness of the Luxembourg.",

Very limited menu that is written each night on a blackboard but everything we had (4 meals) was very good! The entree assortments looked wonderful although we didn&#39;t have that - and the desserts were fantastic and made in house! Service was good - we had a young man who explained everything in English for us and was very charming.  Tables both inside and on the sidewalk - it was quite busy the night we were there.",

"reviewcomment":"This is a great little bakery that&#39;s conveniently located right outside of the Cambronne exit of the Paris Metro.<br><br>We had just arrived in Paris and I was totally spent after a long day of traveling, but the minute I exited the Metro and caught a whiff of Boulangerie Weiland I instantly started floating across the street like Tucan Sam following his nose to a bowl of Fruit Loops.<br><br>Upon entering it&#39;s not a very big bakery at all, but it was packed with all sorts of sweet and savory items. I got a tartine with chorizo which is kind of like a French bread pizza and it was just amazing. I also got a croissant which was perfectly flaky, buttery and soft. The next morning I got a couple pan au chocolates and was hooked like a crack junkie for the rest of our stay...seriously, I think I ate over a dozen of them over the span of three days. We tried some other things as well and everything blew the socks off of the crappy bakeries here in the United States.<br><br>Also, the service here was fantastic and I was always greeted with a warm smile by everyone. They didn&#39;t speak English by the way, but I am extremely proficient in smiling and pointing so it wasn&#39;t much of an issue for me.<br><br>All in all I should thank the Food Gods for having this place so close to our hotel in Paris and I really wish that I had one of their delicious pan au chocolates right now....yum!",

"reviewcomment":"On our first night in Paris, we stumbled into this quiet little bistro with few expectations. Most restaurants were closed on Mondays so it was hard enough to find one that was open at 9 pm for dinner. <br><br>The only other patron in the restaurant was an elderly woman. She was slowly eating her dinner, taking small sips of her wine, and enjoying a good book. Upon closer inspection, her dinner was a huge bowl of salad with grated carrots, cucumbers, and ham topped off with two big pieces of toast covered with goat cheese. It looked good enough for my girlfriend to order the same salad. <br><br>I&#39;m a carnivore and have laughed at the prospect of ever ordering a salad at a restaurant. What a waste of money I always thought. I became a salad convert at Le Gay Lussac. I ended up ordering the Gourmande, which had tomatoes, curried potatoes, duck gizzards, smoked duck breast, topped with duck foie gras. My duck inspired salad was dressed well and was so much more than what I expected a salad could be. The portions of duck were generous and each bite was filled with flavors that complemented one another. I didn&#39;t think I would have a liking for duck gizzard, but it was similar to the familiar taste and texture of beef tongue. The frog legs we had as an appetizer was also good. They were lightly fried and full of garlic flavor. The meal was complete with a nice white wine pairing recommended by our server. <br><br>The prices were also reasonable, with our total being less than €20 per person. The big salads ranged from €9-12 each, but the portions were as large as any typical entree. The dinner made a lasting impression on me as my first real meal in Paris and changed my perception of salads.",

"reviewcomment":"I&#39;ve lived in the 11th, 17th, 10th and now 2nd arrondisments and visited at least two butchers per neighborhood as well as the meat cases of innumerable Monoprixes, Casinos, Marché Us, and Franprixes.<br><br> After all this experience, Tribolet is my go to butcher.<br><br> First and foremost, the quality of the meat is excellent. I live down the street and see the daily delivery of whole carcasses. My husband is constantly saying things like, Where&#39;d you get the lamb chops? They&#39;re fantastic! and This bacon is so gooooood!<br><br> Secondly, they have a broad, comprehensive selection. Whole carcasses means that I can get the cut of meat for which I&#39;m searching. Beef brisket for making corned beef? No problem! Wild game in season - rabbit, pig, pheasants, ducks, quail, etc. Charcuterie - poitrine fumée (bacon to Americans), boudin noir, saucisson sec, merguez, jamon, etc.<br><br> Third, the service is patient, courteous and personable. I don&#39;t speak much French and they don&#39;t speak any English beyond chicken (I suppose due to all of the tourists who buy the poulet roti?), but even if it&#39;s painful and takes 3x as long, they&#39;ll patiently ask questions and pantomine until they understand what it is I&#39;d like and how I&#39;d like it. I also get complimented profusely for every new French word I use (talk about incentive!)<br><br> I also appreciate that I can come in and tell them that I have no idea what to cook and they&#39;ll make suggestions of what to cook (often low cost options) AND give tips on how they&#39;d prepare it. In other words, recipes! I&#39;ve even gotten recommendations on what sides to serve. It&#39;s like taking a mini French cooking class.<br><br> They&#39;re also quite skilled, so your meat is trimmed properly (no little bone chunks and enough fat for braising meats to really get tender). The fact that I can get really specific about how and how much I want something prepped saves me time in the kitchen.<br><br> Finally, while some cuts are on the expensive side, some items can be cheaper than the lesser quality version at Monoprix. They also have a EUR4.80 roasted chicken that is just the right size for two people (quite small) with enough left over to make soup. That&#39;s the cheapest price I&#39;ve seen for poulet roti on Montorgueil.<br><br> Of special note: They stock specialty items for holidays - for example, turkeys &amp; chapon at Christmas.",

"reviewcomment":"This was an awesome find! We had stopped here for coffee on the way back to our apartment near the Bastille. We came back here another day for lunch after seeing the yummy dishes that other customers were having.<br>Food: Wonderful! My husband had a burger served with fries and it was delicious. So were the frogs legs that I had, served on a bed of rice with salad. It had a great creamy sauce that I completely devoured.<br>Ambiance: the inside is small like most Parisian brasseries and was warm and cozy. Looked slightly more upscale than others in the area. We sat outside enjoying the street scene and the unseasonably warm weather.<br>Service: The service was great. The waitstaff spoke english and was friendly and helpful. There was a slight mishap with my frogs legs. The dish toppled off the small table and was saved but some of the contents had spilled (fortunately I was not at the table at that time) onto the table and my chair. Staff leaped into action cleaning up the mess and was very apologetic. The host offered us some Champagne on the house which was a really nice gesture!<br>I highly reccomend  this restaurant and look forward to our next visit!",

All the grandeur of the Champs-Élysées with the intimate personal service you&#39;d expect of your local cheese shop. While staying in Montmartre Fromagerie Quatrehomme became a part of my daily routine. <br><br>The moment you walk in the door you will notice the permeating smell. There is a key difference between good bad smelling cheese and bad bad smelling cheese. Everything that this Fromagerie has to offer is good, bad smelling cheese. The attentive staff is quick to assist you in your every need and careful cut, slice of spread a sampling of their amazing cheeses for you to try. Pay attention to how delicately they handle the cheese and serve even the smallest sample on a piece of parchment paper; every last bit of cheese is handled with care. <br><br>Visiting Paris? Taking a leisurely stroll with Montmartre? Stop in Fromagerie Quatrehomme. You&#39;ll thank me later....",

"reviewcomment":"Absolutely adore this little shop that specializes in all things Sicilian. For 23.37 euros or $30.67 U.S., we were able to pick up such a delightful range of quality items. In fact, we found ourselves preferring to eat in -- much cheaper and consistently tastier than eating out. The selection of olives is first rate -- be sure to try the ones stuffed with anchovies. We also liked the home-made, cheese-stuffed ravioli, the calamari selection and more. I bought a can of Sicilian olive oil that is delicious too. <br><br>We hope to get back and shop there at least once more before we head back home to the States.",

"reviewcomment":"While the outdoor seating offers a nice view of the area, the food was not the best. Had just arrived with the family from the US and were extremely exhausted and looking for an inexpensive place to eat. We probably would not have gone here if we had realized it was considered &#34;fast food&#34; or we would not have ordered main courses and stuck to something more simple. <br><br>I tried the &#34;coq que bin&#34; which is considered a French specialty... the piece of chicken used was what I believe was the rib cage, so I was constantly picking out bones as I attempted to figure out what I was eating. Perhaps I&#39;m just not accustomed to the dish but it had a peculiar flavor. My other family members tried the steak and the salmon pasta. The steak was not tender but the potatoes au gratin were evidently deadly. The salmon pasta was creamy pasta with some pieces of salmon - good, not great. Nothing was worth writing home about.<br><br>It&#39;s cheap though... so I guess that&#39;s good if that&#39;s what you&#39;re looking for. Also, it took about half an hour to track down our waiter to get the bill. Evidently you need to assertively request the check in order to get it. If this shit ever went down in New York, people would likely just walk out..",

"reviewcomment":"If you&#39;re fed of heavy chou pastry or rich chocolate pastries then Patisserie Ciel is the spot to come for something a little lighter. These Japanese angel cakes provide a welcome respite from French patisseries.<br><br>It such a lovely experience mainly due to the gracious and smiley servers who are attentive to your every request. From the moment you sit down they place a compressed hand towel in front of you which expands when water touches it, they then bring over your delightful cake accompanied with your drink and let you enjoy the space without ever rushing you. <br><br>The sponge cake was light and fluffy with a creamy mousse center and the litchi juice which I hesitated to order was indeed surprisingly delicious.<br><br>It costs 12 euro for an angel cake and a drink of your juice which include tea or an Allain Milliat juice. I would say that it is slightly expensive for such a light cake with little patisserie genius yet for the whole experience it is well worth the money.",

"reviewcomment":"Ended up here on a recommendation on my visit to Paris. The restaurant is small and intimate with a bar at one end. <br><br>We were seated right away and the waitress brought the menu (chalkboard with only few items on it) over to our table. The menu is small and from what I understand it changes weekly. I decided to get the appetizer + main + desert for 29 Euro plus a bottle of wine. Cheap? No. Cheap for Paris? Oui.<br><br>I got my first course which was squid with sauteed carrots. I would have never thought that those two combination would be so great together. For the main I picked scallops in kind of sauce. This was the best scallop dish I have ever had! That sauce was amazing. Finished the meal with a cheese cake. This was not like the dense and heavy cheese cake we have in the US. It was very light and full of flavor. <br><br>If you happen to be in Paris definitely give this place a try.",

I ordered the HAZELNUT and the PISTACHIO flavored eclairs. Each bite was a little bit of heaven, and I wish I had more time in Paris, I would have loved to come back and enjoy more flavors. If you are ever in Paris, this is a stop that needs to be included when you travel. ENJOY!",

"reviewcomment":"There are many good cellar/restaurants in Paris but few great ones. Le Chat Ivre is one of those gems. Hidden in an angle street of rue de la roquette, this place has a dozen wooden tables and benches. It is fully decorated by its wine bottles so you know what you step into. The owners are extremely friendly and passionate about the wines they serve, which they know perfectly. They go mostly for organic wines and have a preference for Languedoc reds which they find have a better quality/price ratio. There are a few wines from the other regions as well. In total, you&#39;ll find probably 50-80 wines on the menu, all deliberately chosen by the owner who will be happy to talk about them.<br>This place is a mix between a wine shop and a restaurant: you can buy the bottles to go or drink it in the restaurant for an additional premium (6 or 8 euros, can&#39;t remember). The food is simple but good: charcuterie or cheese plates to share, some grilled meat or fish. Try the calamari and the burrata as appetizers, they&#39;re pretty good.<br>All in all, you spend a great time in this place: you discover new wines and you eat some good food. This is a great place to bring a group of friends!",

You are also welcome to taste the oils before you buy them.  My favorite is the pinenut oil.  These oils taste like you are actually eating the nut.  I could almost drink the bottle.  My other favs are walnut, hazelnut and pistachio !  They taste delicious drizzled on finished dishes especially on grain salads.  I can&#39;t get enough of this place .  One other item I saw today which was VERY UNIQUE were bottles of alcohol sprays:  cognac, scotch, kirsch to name a few.  They look like perfume bottles but are actual alcohols you spray onto your dishes!!!!

They&#39;re usually accompanied by champagne and are a great way to start a vacation.<br><br>So after searching online, I found Bertie&#39;s. They had great reviews and were near our hotel. After many emails back and forth with Bobbie figuring out what I wanted (she was soooo patient with me!) the order was placed, with two days to spare. <br><br>So here we are, the day of our arrival, jet lagged and exhausted. Bobbie delivers the cupcakes herself, it was so nice to meet her! After taking a nap, we open a bottle of champagne and break out the cupcakes. I ended up going with a dozen assorted, with a few featuring a sugar version of the Eiffel Tower. <br><br>They were AMAZING!!!! I had the Oreo cookie one.

Ever since I moved into the neighborhood I have tried the various bakeries in the area at least a dozen times each. <br><br>L&#39;Atelier des Pain was poised to become the neighborhood star, the breads looked more interesting (e.g. cacao bread), the pastries had a more refined flair to them (e.g. violette éclaire), but each experience failed to live up to my expectations. The bread is good, but nothing spectacular, the pastries the same. <br><br>I even brought a croissant aux amandes back because the inside frangipane was raw, which is something I never usually do, but it was the second time that had happened! The owner was very sweet and replaced it with a much better galette des rois, but still, how can something like that happen -- twice? <br><br>Needless to say I rarely frequent this bakery, preferring to get my bread and viennoiseries from Crazy Cake closer to the Canal.",

They do give priority to hotel guests but if you get lucky and go on a slow season, you will get seated promptly as we did. Great service and amazing atmosphere but not the place to go if you are unwilling to spend a lot more than usual for a plate of dessert and tea/coffee. Other than that, great place to people watch (what the Parisians have excelled in).",

"reviewcomment":"Delicious Macarons!  They&#39;re small, so you need 2 to 4 for a real dessert, but that just means you get to choose many of the different flavors. My favorite so far is the Caramel, but I also enjoyed the Creme to Cassis, Chocolat Noir, and Cafe (coffee) flavored macarons. I&#39;ll be back for more!<br><br>They also sell Canelés, which is their primary product, but I haven&#39;t tried those yet at this shop. I&#39;ve had them elsewhere though, and they&#39;re definitely worth a try if you&#39;re just visiting Paris; I haven&#39;t seen them outside France.",

"reviewcomment":"During April of this year, my mother and I visited Paris for my 23rd birthday. Luckily for us, our hotel and this shop were aligned. I&#39;d walk past it every day and just fawn over their gold and chocolate eggs in the window (being around Easter and all). I wanted one! Finally on my birthday, my mother brought me inside and allowed me to pick a few goodies, since I was unable to have a traditional birthday cake. I chose a chocolate mousse dessert and it was the best dessert I have ever had in my life! It was so amazingly delicious. We also purchased a baguette, some wine and some mozzarella/tomato salad. The shop clerk was a sweetheart, as well. Since it was just before the shop was scheduled to close for the day, he even threw in a few free goodies for us. Even just walking past the shop is a sight, such a beautiful window display... Pleasant experience!",

In fact, we found ourselves preferring to eat in -- much cheaper and consistently tastier than eating out. The selection of olives is first rate -- be sure to try the ones stuffed with anchovies. We also liked the home-made, cheese-stuffed ravioli, the calamari selection and more. I bought a can of Sicilian olive oil that is delicious too. <br><br>We hope to get back and shop there at least once more before we head back home to the States.",

They don&#39;t really speak English here, but if you point out the things you want, they will give it to you. They have gotten awards for the baguette and it&#39;s pretty standard for the type of baguettes you can find all over Paris (a little less than a Euro). What is absolutely AMAZING...times five hundred thousand!! is their palmier. It&#39;s humongous, a little bit pricy (but what isn&#39;t in Paris, right?), and absolutely delectable. I probably had at least one a day while I was there (yes, I know the butter content in that...but I was on vacation!!). I still dream about that Palmier...le sigh. MUST TRY!!",

"reviewcomment":"I don&#39;t understand how I can possibly be the first to review this quirky little café! My sweetheart and I popped in one afternoon during our recent holiday in Paris - just walking down the street, taking it all in, when the name caught my eye - I&#39;ve always associated the word &#34;crepuscular&#34; with something foreboding and Lovecraftian! A hankering for crêpes ensued, and so.<br><br>The interior is very lo-fi, a little odd, a little artsy, with posters for plays and so on - the sort of thing I&#39;m used to in hole-in-the-walls in Oakland and Berkeley but didn&#39;t necessarily expect to see in Paris, so it was a little funnily familiar. The windows afford a nice view of the street, perfect for people watching on a mellow afternoon.<br><br>The proprietor and chef was so, so nice! I love that he asked us if we wanted &#34;salt or sweet.&#34; I got the vegetarian crêpe (salt), and I cannot express how happy I am that it was prepared on the spot,* crêpe, veggies and all. It was perfectly crisped on the exterior, wonderfully savory and generously portioned. <br><br>My omnivorous sweetheart ordered an andouille crêpe (also salt), and was warned it was &#34;very traditional.&#34; I&#39;m not entirely sure what that meant, but while I will never call my sweetheart unadventurous I have perhaps never been so glad to be a vegetarian. <br><br>We split a dessert crêpe (sweet) afterwards, and it was amazing.<br><br>To sum up: there was nothing foreboding about it! The service was kind and honest, the food was delicious, and it was an enjoyable time. And now I&#39;ve eaten crêpes in Paris!<br><br>*Is the proper phrase &#34;a la minute?&#34;**<br><br>** It is &#34;fraîchement préparé!&#34; Merci, Elodie!",

"reviewcomment":"Such a cute little place. Has the comfortable feel of a neighborhood pub with a small bar area with seating at the bar as well as high tops and a seating area. We got a little booth in the corner which was delightful. Unfortunately we didn&#39;t get there until 10pm and they were out of several main courses (the chicken and the duck which we were looking forward to) and they don&#39;t get fish in until the end of the week because its fresh and wild caught. However, they did have a nice selection of steaks, salads, cheeses, and appetizers.<br><br>Dad tried the beef ecote with home fries and salad. As we&#39;ve found in many French restaurants, they wouldn&#39;t cook it any more than medium rare which is scary to some Americans (my parents included) but he enjoyed it greatly. I tried the blue salad (bleu cheese, goat cheese, ham/bacon, red onion, tomatoes, lettuce and a poached egg on top served with a light vinaigrette) which was delicious. Probably the least healthy salad I&#39;ve had in a while! But it was particularly great accompanied by a complimentary French baguette. My mother and sister tried the chèvre salad (Brie on toast, green apple walnuts, tomatoes, and lettuce also with a light dressing) which tasted as good as it looked. I wish I took a picture!<br><br>They had a limited beer selection (just kourenbourg and 1664) - Dad and I tried both, mm. However they had a decent amount of wines and liqueurs. Enough to find something you like but I wouldn&#39;t go there for it.<br><br>The prices were great. The small (25cl) beers were only 3.5-4e and the bottles of wine were very reasonable as well (20-30e for most). The main courses were in the teens and salads 10e and change.<br><br>Additionally, the server, a single waitress, covered the entire place but was absolutely great. The restaurant only had a menu in French but she was so accommodating and went over all of the apps and mains with us in English. She apologized many times about not having many of the mains because it was so late at night. I wish I had been able to try some of them or come back but unfortunately we are leaving Paris tomorrow.",

"reviewcomment":"Les Saveurs de L&#39;Orient serves both Moroccan and Lebanese food, meaning you can choose to go for the traditional hot and cold mezzo dishes, or a platter of meats, or opt for a very substantial tangine or couscous dish Or, if in a large group, combine and share! Personally, I&#39;d recommend the Moroccan menu as the tangines and couscous dishes are both substantial and incredibly tasty. In terms of drinks, the restaurant serves wines and beers from Lebanon and Morocco. I have not tried the beer but can say that the red wine is surprisingly not too bad. This place tends to be quite popular with tourists given its location in a beautifully historic shopping arcade, as well as its operating hours, as this is also open on Sundays.",

"reviewcomment":"Seeing this place again made me bipolar in an instant. I&#39;m very happy for Madame Michelle and Monsieur Philippe that they have renovated their restaurant and so must be doing well. But I&#39;m also very sad that the days of 19 Euro 3-course prix-fixe menus are gone forever. <br><br>This place is a hidden gem of the 7th district and used to be the best value around. My first time going was in 2005 and have gone back to it every time I&#39;m in Paris. There were only 2 times that I was disappointed when I went to L&#39;Auberge: one time was because they were closing and the other time was because they were closed. <br><br>Every food that my friends and I have tasted here has been delicious! The escargot, served in a 6 indented plate complete with snail tongs and snail fork, are a perfect blend of buttery and garlicky goodness. I&#39;d wipe my escargot plate clean with the provided bread if there weren&#39;t people in the restaurant. Their foie gras is so flavorful that it&#39;s making me drool just remembering it and makes you forget how this controversial dish is made. The creme brulee gives a satisfying crack when you break through the caramelized top and reveal the scrumptious rich vanilla custard underneath. I can go on and on about the food but why are you still reading this?! Go in there and try it! The menu has changed but I&#39;m sure the quality has not budged a millimeter.<br><br>In case you&#39;re still interested, Madame Michelle serves in front and her English has been steadily improving and expanding over the years. Monsieur Philippe speaks much better English and is the master chef who creates the masterpieces that you&#39;re going to savor. Both are very friendly and I&#39;ve even been able to engage M. Philippe in a conversation after dinner service was finished. Remember that this is a hidden gem but definitely worth the effort to find it. Each time I try to find it I feel like I&#39;m in an episode of Amazing Race trying to find a checkpoint. Bon appetit!",

"reviewcomment":"So it was decided that while in paris I would do at least one over the top french meal.  The french bistros were amazing and the truth is I would still be hooked on french cuisine had I not done Helene Darroze, but when in Paris...<br><br>Four of us showed up to HD around 7:30 on a Thursday, it filled up but was not crowded by any means.  The waitstaff is extremely attentive, the decor somewhat modern and kind of bright.  The menu is a prix fixed and thats probably the way to go in most circumstances like these, because chances are the chefs know a little more about what they do best than you.  <br><br>The champagne and wine was wonderful.  All four bottles....The bread was incredible and right away they brought us some ham and butter that was made with chill powder.  The first course was three small bites that included fois gras and some type of chutney and jelly thing.  I am not a fan of fois gras, (unless its made like a creme brûlée like they do at Sage in Las Vegas) but the fois gras lovers at the table found it to be good.  The second course was a seafood soup type of thing which really just seemed like a piece of sushi that they poured a cream sauce over once it got to the table.  The most exciting thing about this dish was the sauce to dip the bread in and the fact you could use an actual SPORK!  The next course was a lobster tail that was so amazing and indeed my favorite course of the day if not my favorite thing I ate while in paris.  The actual entree was terrible.  It was pigeon.  Now, once I could get images of San Francisco pigeons out of my mind I really feel like I was open to the experience.  It tasted raw and if you can believe it, tasted like pigeon.  Not like chicken...but actual pigeon.  How on earth is that a delicacy? <br><br>The cheese plate was great, and now that I consider myself somewhat of an expert on San Francisco cheese plates I will say that the french don&#39;t mess around with the other things on the plate...its just cheese.  No honeycomb, chutney, fruit or bread.  I will say I like the extra things ;)  There was also not a brie option...huh?<br><br>The dessert, not memorable.  Some type of macaroons that were just over the top sweet.  All in all a wonderful evening.  I love three hour dinners...great company, tons of different tastes to try...but with all of the restaurants to try in france, it is unlikely I would go back.",

"reviewcomment":"After going to Sephora next door and taking a romantic stroll down Champs Elysee, we decided to come here on one of our last nights in Paris. I love that the manager here wears plain clothes, carries a man purse as his mobile office, and wears converse. I came here to buy some chocolate bars and Agnes B makeup because it&#39;s no longer carried in the US. Yes, the prices are a tad bit high but who cares? If I am in Paris, I am not constrained by a budget! I also bought some Rouge Baiser nail polish that was teeny tiny and pricey at $10 for less than 1/3oz but it was worth it because it has a very nice finish and tons of colors. Look for coffee and such downstairs while makeup is on the street level. If you&#39;re a makeup junkie like me, there&#39;s a lot of GWPs to light the French economy on fire!",

"reviewcomment":"This place was super close to getting 4 stars, but it all depends what time you get here. <br>I got here at 9:30pm on a Friday night and it was packed. All the tables were taken (you have to go and find your own table, no waiter waitress kinda thing). It being packed was not the problem, it was getting a drink that took over 25mins.<br><br>There was only one bartender until about 10:30pm. This just really turned me off. Waiting 25mins for a drink is ridiculous. <br><br>On the positive side, I loved the ambiance of this place. The open bricks, radio station inside setting. Loved that there was a DJ and open dance floor. The style here is laid back and young professionals. Really hip place. <br><br>I have to say this place is just OK for me. I would come back here if there was more than one bartender on a busy Friday night. I&#39;ve heard this place is great for the summer time (again, get here early if you want a table outside). That&#39;s something I&#39;m looking forward to trying in the summer!<br><br>Drinks were average good and the food looked tasty. Loved the music here! Nova radio.",

It&#39;s well-prepared, modern, seasonal, and delicious. The owner, Joe, is very kind. <br><br>I highly recommend stopping at the Clown Bar when you&#39;re in Paris.

And a lot of other European ones. Sheep, cow.... Any type of!! Good choice of wines. They speak only French .... but fromage is an easy word :) <br><br>Not too expensive.

Aaaand....I work 3 minutes away walking. <br><br>The prices are a little steep for the desserts - but they are really yummy. I would say that they need to step up their bagel quality (they are a little bit small/thin and they could be less dense - plus they should start serving everything bagels) and they could put a little more meat in the sandwich (but the pastrami is pretty good - but imagine if it was hot!!). If they make even some of these changes, they will be good to go. They serve Root Beer and Dr. Pepper (which is awesome) but they are super expensive (2.90 euros for a can so like 4 bucks!). <br><br>Pour les françaises, ce n&#39;est pas NYC (et ce n&#39;est surtout pas Bergen Bagels de Brooklyn) mais bon, a Paris, on ne trouve pas beaucoup mieux...

None the less I am glad I brought here. I didn&#39;t order, it was done for me. I had duck, escargo, and cheese with wine oh and some duck liver. The duck liver has an acquired taste as does the cheese.  The duck was scrumptious!! We had the escargo aji and it was very tasty. I would recommend this place and our waiter was a sweet heart.",

"reviewcomment":"There are many good cellar/restaurants in Paris but few great ones. Le Chat Ivre is one of those gems. Hidden in an angle street of rue de la roquette, this place has a dozen wooden tables and benches. It is fully decorated by its wine bottles so you know what you step into. The owners are extremely friendly and passionate about the wines they serve, which they know perfectly. They go mostly for organic wines and have a preference for Languedoc reds which they find have a better quality/price ratio. There are a few wines from the other regions as well. In total, you&#39;ll find probably 50-80 wines on the menu, all deliberately chosen by the owner who will be happy to talk about them.<br>This place is a mix between a wine shop and a restaurant: you can buy the bottles to go or drink it in the restaurant for an additional premium (6 or 8 euros, can&#39;t remember). The food is simple but good: charcuterie or cheese plates to share, some grilled meat or fish. Try the calamari and the burrata as appetizers, they&#39;re pretty good.<br>All in all, you spend a great time in this place: you discover new wines and you eat some good food. This is a great place to bring a group of friends!",

You are also welcome to taste the oils before you buy them.  My favorite is the pinenut oil.  These oils taste like you are actually eating the nut.  I could almost drink the bottle.  My other favs are walnut, hazelnut and pistachio !  They taste delicious drizzled on finished dishes especially on grain salads.  I can&#39;t get enough of this place .  One other item I saw today which was VERY UNIQUE were bottles of alcohol sprays:  cognac, scotch, kirsch to name a few.  They look like perfume bottles but are actual alcohols you spray onto your dishes!!!! NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS BEFORE!!! You can&#39;t miss this place if you&#39;re a Foodie!! You will LOVE IT!!!!!!",

Some of the harder varieties of cheese on display have bits you can sample. I understand they will vacuum seal for you if you want to transport it home. The people who work here (I understand it is a parents and daughter-run operation) are very pleasant though sometimes there is a slight language barrier if you are not so good with French like me.  Pointing seems to do the trick, and like I said, I haven&#39;t gone wrong yet.",

"reviewcomment":"What a great shop, with the friendliest proprieter in France.  (Jerome Huard) Discovered this place in 2003 when I stayed in an apartment around the corner on Avenue des Ternes and try to visit every year.    Loves wine, loves to talk about wine and can do so in four languages.  Can spend anywhere from 7 to 700 euros depending on what you are looking for, and I&#39;ve never had a bottle of wine I didn&#39;t like.  He even makes suggestions for wine I thought I would not care for, but did, so come with an open mind about wine.  He also seems to have eaten in every single restaurant in Paris, so ask for recommendations.  This block of rue Poncelet has a number of delicious shops, so after you buy your wine you might want to buy some cheese, or coffee, or smoked fish.  Only a couple of blocks from the Arc de Triomphe.",

The sweet lady, with her broken English, our terrible French and horrible hand gestures somehow figured out what type of cheese we may like, and she was spot on! We had two types of cheeses, one was creamy and not too pungent, and the other was fresh cheese, we then grabbed a fresh baguette, and enjoyed our lunch. <br><br>A wonderful cheese shop, go there!

"reviewcomment":"With over 500 references sourced from all over the world this shop is the rum lover&#39;s answer to the Maison du Whiskey. And if the friendliness and openness of the staff is any indication I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if rum drinkers weren&#39;t the happiest spirit drinkers in the world. Seriously, you know how afficionados can be super snobs, especially when you have no clue what their talking about? Well at A Rhûm, the attitude is as warm, soothing and inviting as the spirits being served. <br><br>When we walked in we were a bit overwhelmed with the endless options at first. It was a Saturday evening and the place was packed. Just as we were about to turn around and head out someone from the far corner of the boutique called to us and asked what we&#39;d like to try. We told him we were looking for a disgetive at around 30E, and he poured us four different types at the little tasting station they have set up in the shop. His first choice, a Botran Reserve, was right on the money and at the right price. <br><br>To say it&#39;s been a hit at our place is an understatement. Everyone who tastes it oohs and ahhs and can&#39;t believe how smooth and subtle the spirit is, not at all sweet and cloying as you would expect. No surprise that we&#39;re making a trip to A Rhum this weekend to replenish!",

"reviewcomment":"It is great pleasure to find little gems while strolling around Paris. The beautifully arranged pralines in the yellow-faced storefront window lured us in to this little store. A family tradition, this store has been operating in Montargis since 1903 before moving around and settling in its current location. <br><br>Along with pralines and chocolates, which are made fresh daily, the confiserie&#39;s specialties include Amandas and Mirabos (chocolate covered nougatine), Kaloudjas (grilled almonds coated with gianduja, or hazelnut paste), Givrettes and Grêlons (caramelized roasted almonds and hazelnuts), and 18 different chocolate bars, including flavors such as orange-clove, bitter sesame, salted caramel and, of course, the famous praline. <br><br>I have to say, we did not buy any pralines or chocolates here. So, why am I writing a review? You see, at the back of store is a four top. It goes unnoticed unless you focus on it. There is a chocolate fondue menu, which is based on the different types of chocolate sold here. The four of us decided to take the table and order different kinds of fondue. What followed was a a lot of &#34;ooooh&#34; and &#34;aaaahhh&#34; from all four of us. A shot glass of the chocolate you choose from the menu is served with biscotti, an assortment of French cookies, and fruit, followed by your choice of coffee or espresso. See attached picture for the fondue serving.<br><br>I am fairly positive the pralines are excellent. However, the chocolate fondue serving  is something you don&#39;t want to miss if you are in the area.",

"reviewcomment":"There are a lot of famous chocolate houses in Paris (Patrick Roger, Maison du Chocolate, Pierre Marcolini...to name a few) but Fouquet is one of the oldest (est. 1853). It is also one of the best. <br><br>Bizarrely very few people know about it, making it one of the most delicious, unknown master brands in Paris. I had first heard about it through David Lebovitz&#39;s blog after he wrote glowingly about a tasting tour he had taken of the brand&#39;s Parisian laboratory where everything from peanut shelling, chocolates and candies are done by hand using artisanal techniques passed along from one generation to the other. <br><br>I noticed a year later that the brand had opened a swanky new shop with an updated look near the Marche St Honoré and was excited when I was invited for a private tasting/visit to really get to know the brand. The owner was on hand to talk about the history of the brand, explain how the chocolates and candies were fabricated, and let us taste some of the key products in the collection, all presented in gorgeous boxes, tins and glass jars.<br><br>Everything was OUT OF THIS WORLD! From the molten marshmallows and chocolate-covered roasted almonds, to the prailines, mendiants and pate de fruit I have never tasted such an all-around phenomenal range of sweets. <br><br>How this place remains a secret is beyond me!",

Some of the harder varieties of cheese on display have bits you can sample. I understand they will vacuum seal for you if you want to transport it home. The people who work here (I understand it is a parents and daughter-run operation) are very pleasant though sometimes there is a slight language barrier if you are not so good with French like me.  Pointing seems to do the trick, and like I said, I haven&#39;t gone wrong yet.",

The sweet lady, with her broken English, our terrible French and horrible hand gestures somehow figured out what type of cheese we may like, and she was spot on! We had two types of cheeses, one was creamy and not too pungent, and the other was fresh cheese, we then grabbed a fresh baguette, and enjoyed our lunch. <br><br>A wonderful cheese shop, go there!

"reviewcomment":"This bakery is amazing.  We came here almost everyday for breakfast and to grab lunch to go when we went to Versailles for a day trip.  I tried a lot of things here and I think the best ones were the goat cheese/salmon petit bread, the five small breads for 2 Euro (only in the morning) and their framboise and custard beignets.  <br><br>Their tart pie slice is not good and it&#39;s too heavy.  Their croissants are excellent.  Their quiche lorraine is ok.<br><br>The guy that works here is really friendly.  They offer to toast or warm up your goods, which is a nice touch.  It&#39;s really easy to spend $10 on food here.  They have ready to eat salad and sandwiches too.<br><br>TIP:  There is a Starbucks down the street!",

"reviewcomment":"I arrived the day there was a big protest in the city at the end of March and our hotel happened to be right by it. I won&#39;t say what it was about but most who watched the news will probably know of it. I wanted to get out of that area tout de suite. What bettter way to spend a Sunday afternoon than strolling the streets of The Marais, which also happens to be the gay quarter?<br> My colleague and I spent browsing the shops and came across this bustling store. I peer in and notice this small store jam packed (pun intended) with jars upon jars of jams and jellies. <br>The jars were organized by ingredient, season, purpose, and colour. The best part? That you can sample them! I saw that they had my favourite morello cherry (cerise griotte) jam. <br>We had been walking for a good hour so sampling all the sweet preserves gave us a boost for the rest of our day. <br>As soon as I came home, I cut up some French bread, sliced a few pieces of brie and smothered them with the cherry jam. I was in heaven.<br>It was quite busy in the store but the sales reps were very helpful and politely reminded us to not double dip. There were a few patrons in there that looked suspicious...<br><br>6/100",

"reviewcomment":"Ended up here on a recommendation on my visit to Paris. The restaurant is small and intimate with a bar at one end. <br><br>We were seated right away and the waitress brought the menu (chalkboard with only few items on it) over to our table. The menu is small and from what I understand it changes weekly. I decided to get the appetizer + main + desert for 29 Euro plus a bottle of wine. Cheap? No. Cheap for Paris? Oui.<br><br>I got my first course which was squid with sauteed carrots. I would have never thought that those two combination would be so great together. For the main I picked scallops in kind of sauce. This was the best scallop dish I have ever had! That sauce was amazing. Finished the meal with a cheese cake. This was not like the dense and heavy cheese cake we have in the US. It was very light and full of flavor. <br><br>If you happen to be in Paris definitely give this place a try.",

It is also one of the best. <br><br>Bizarrely very few people know about it, making it one of the most delicious, unknown master brands in Paris. I had first heard about it through David Lebovitz&#39;s blog after he wrote glowingly about a tasting tour he had taken of the brand&#39;s Parisian laboratory where everything from peanut shelling, chocolates and candies are done by hand using artisanal techniques passed along from one generation to the other. <br><br>I noticed a year later that the brand had opened a swanky new shop with an updated look near the Marche St Honoré and was excited when I was invited for a private tasting/visit to really get to know the brand. The owner was on hand to talk about the history of the brand, explain how the chocolates and candies were fabricated, and let us taste some of the key products in the collection, all presented in gorgeous boxes, tins and glass jars.<br><br>Everything was OUT OF THIS WORLD! From the molten marshmallows and chocolate-covered roasted almonds, to the prailines, mendiants and pate de fruit I have never tasted such an all-around phenomenal range of sweets. <br><br>How this place remains a secret is beyond me!",

We spent a long time relaxing, drinking and discussing various tea related topics with Carol. It was pretty educational even when we learned about the tea pots and how they are not used as we in Europe might think.<br><br>The shop looked a bit messy with lots of card board boxes. My initial feeling was that it was not very original. After settling in though, taking off my shoes and relaxing in the tea room I started to think that sitting amidst the boxes and tea equipment might make this experience very original. There was no cliché, no show and no pretending around. Carol just worked there and brought the tea perfectly brewed. <br><br>Before leaving I bought two 100g bags of the best (and most expensive) tea I have ever had: Gyokuro kyoto. This shop is perfect for a refreshing tea break. You won&#39;t get any Irish breakfast tea with milk and sugar though ;)",

There&#39;s a nice selection of breads and pastries inside - fantastic croissants and pain au chocolat - and an outdoor kiosk with savory stuff like quiches and croque-monsieur. A few seats under the awning outside, if you want to eat there. Good prices, too: €1 for a croissant seems pretty fair to me!<br><br>Very friendly service. They don&#39;t speak much English, but we always managed to figure it all out, even when making sure my girlfriend&#39;s tree nut allergy wouldn&#39;t be a problem.

"reviewcomment":"What a great shop, with the friendliest proprieter in France.  (Jerome Huard) Discovered this place in 2003 when I stayed in an apartment around the corner on Avenue des Ternes and try to visit every year.    Loves wine, loves to talk about wine and can do so in four languages.  Can spend anywhere from 7 to 700 euros depending on what you are looking for, and I&#39;ve never had a bottle of wine I didn&#39;t like.  He even makes suggestions for wine I thought I would not care for, but did, so come with an open mind about wine.  He also seems to have eaten in every single restaurant in Paris, so ask for recommendations.  This block of rue Poncelet has a number of delicious shops, so after you buy your wine you might want to buy some cheese, or coffee, or smoked fish.  Only a couple of blocks from the Arc de Triomphe.",

"reviewcomment":"With over 500 references sourced from all over the world this shop is the rum lover&#39;s answer to the Maison du Whiskey. And if the friendliness and openness of the staff is any indication I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if rum drinkers weren&#39;t the happiest spirit drinkers in the world. Seriously, you know how afficionados can be super snobs, especially when you have no clue what their talking about? Well at A Rhûm, the attitude is as warm, soothing and inviting as the spirits being served. <br><br>When we walked in we were a bit overwhelmed with the endless options at first. It was a Saturday evening and the place was packed. Just as we were about to turn around and head out someone from the far corner of the boutique called to us and asked what we&#39;d like to try. We told him we were looking for a disgetive at around 30E, and he poured us four different types at the little tasting station they have set up in the shop. His first choice, a Botran Reserve, was right on the money and at the right price. <br><br>To say it&#39;s been a hit at our place is an understatement. Everyone who tastes it oohs and ahhs and can&#39;t believe how smooth and subtle the spirit is, not at all sweet and cloying as you would expect. No surprise that we&#39;re making a trip to A Rhum this weekend to replenish!",

Sorry, it&#39;s way too suit-filled, too clean, and too pricey to have any semblance to a real one.<br><br>I&#39;ve eaten here many times for lunch, mostly for convenience, moshing on huge salads and bagels so I think I tried most of the options here. They&#39;re all yummy, but hardly &#34;authentic&#34;.<br><br>First of all, the bagels are fresh, but a little too soft and doughy for my taste. I like firmer crusts on my bagels. Also, the bagel here is more like a cleverly named bagel sandwich filled with stuff. The bagel itself is hardly the star. <br><br>Second of all, where my cream cheese at? I&#39;m talking about vegetable, chive and blueberry cream cheese, not too mention, the missing tofutti for the vegans.  I think there are only two &#34;bagel sandwiches&#34; that offer cream cheese...and one is paired with apples. Yeah....<br><br>That said, if you&#39;re looking for a quick, healthy lunch in the 13th that&#39;s kind of American, this is the first place I would go.

Haven&#39;t got a chance to eat there (yet) but certainly will do as the food smells delicious (home-made french fries !). check out the program and book before you go as they have salsa nights whith live music.",

"reviewcomment":"Excellent spot in the 10th for a quick-ish lunch or a more leisurely dinner. Friendly service supports deliciously hearty meals that are a bit more raffiné than one might otherwise expect from such an establishment. The hefty salads won&#39;t let you down; the Italienne features the requisite tomato stuffed with burrata, melon, prosciutto, and lightly-dressed arugula on the side, while the Océane is a large bed of lettuce tossed with a variety of seafood and smoked fish. Spring for the café gourmand, and a glass of the Petit Chablis--though perhaps not together. <br><br>At dinner, the tartare de saumon with a salad and thickly-cut French-fried potatoes is a comforting plate sure to satisfy. All in all, a lovely dinner and a perfect low-key night out among friends. Well worth it!",

"reviewcomment":"I have no negative thing to say about this place.<br><br>On my visit to Paris to spend time with friends and family at Chritmas we arrange to meet up with a couple of friends for lunch near where one of them works (I know, I know, super dooper posh around there). So she booked us a table at Bistro Volnay where she&#39;d been once before.<br><br>The decor is very classy and sober but not old or boring. The service is without comparison to anything I have experienced in the UK. The closer it got was Mr Coopers House and Garden in Manchester and I&#39;m sure higher end locations are doing fine too. But the trust is, Bistro Volnay, despite it lcation in one of Paris richest place (2 minutes walk from Place Vendome), is actually not that pricey at all: 38€ for a 3 course lunch meal. <br><br>And the quality of the dishes was simply outstanding. Classics made perfect. A lovely moist terrine with home made butter and fresh crusty bread, duck magret, pommes boulangere, pork belly, Lobster soup with celery... hell I forgot what everyone had bu my three dishes were amazing and everybody was super chuffed with everything. The French gang showed it less, typical, probably more used to good restaurant food than I am.<br><br>My partner had a glass of Burgundy Pinot Noir and I had a Pomerol Bordeaux. Both great wines at 8 and 11€... you&#39;d never find these types of wines available by the glass in Manchester.<br><br>For the desert I had the classic Paris Brest for the first time, a praline indulgence like no other.<br><br>Looking forward to see what other similar places there are on my next visit !",

"reviewcomment":"The Official Chocolate Maker to the Kings of France<br><br>Visit: July 28<br><br>In researching my recent trip to Paris, I came across a self-guided chocolate tour (<a href='/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.chocoparis.com%2Fchocolate-walks%2F&amp;s=c9fad35f18a431868bae98a6f7d81f582b479931a55b35ece692a96056f0e857' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>chocoparis.com/chocolate…</a>) in the 6th arrondissement of Paris, the neighborhood of Saint Germain, which is next to the quartier my husband and I were staying. The tour includes a visit to Debauve &amp; Gallais and states this is the oldest chocolate shop in Paris...over 200 hundred years in business. Well, I&#39;m not a betting woman but I would bet a $1,000,000 that the chocolate would be nothing short of amazing. And I would be a million dollars richer because the chocolate at Debauve &amp; Gallias was absolutely delicious...fit for a king or in my case a queen. First of all, the shop is incredibly ornate and stately....a very old fashioned elegance. The chocolates receive the royal treatment being displayed on silver platters on a curved dark wood, glass topped counter. I did notice that they offer a selection of teas but I was too fascinated with the chocolate marvels to pay much attention to the tea.<br><br>My husband and I tried several chocolate gems starting with the truffle ball made from bittersweet chocolate and shaped like a meatball or a round rough-hewn stone. The ball was coated with cocoa powder. This was the best pure dark chocolate truffle I have ever had. Pure heaven with a touch of wickedness blended in because something this good can&#39;t be saintly. This truffle is not for milk chocolate lovers but for those with penchant for the dark side of chocolate. It&#39;s very intense. With it&#39;s incredibly smooth texture, the truffle slowly melted in my mouth allowing all the robust, sinfully potent, unadulterated cocoa flavor to be tasted and immensely enjoyed. We tried the caramel truffle, which had a sweet, milky rich, lovely gooey caramel center highlighted with dark chocolate. The last truffle we selected was based on its unique shape and creativity. It looked like a mushroom...different! The bottom stem of the mushroom was filled with caramel coated with a layer of white chocolate and another layer of dark chocolate. The white chocolate added additional creamy milkiness to the caramel. Crowning the top of the stem, the mushroom cap consisted of a chocolate covered nougat that tasted like peanut brittle...a fabulicious combination of flavors.<br><br>The sales associate was reserved but still friendly and offered us a free sample of solid dark chocolate, which was delicious. The Kings of France were very fortunate in their chocolate makers and you may feast on these famous chocolates even if you can&#39;t make it to Paris, you can place an order online.",

"reviewcomment":"This probably the only place I have ever encountered the mythical poor service in Paris. It was unfortunately delivered by a young teenager who was apparently annoyed by my basic french and gave some attitude. This was quickly resolved when I asked him if he spoke English, Spanish or German, to which he answered no on all counts.<br>So I reminded him in Spanish that I spoke 3 languages, which was 2 more than his single tongue and so he needed to chill out, since I was the paying customer. After going through several shades of red, rage I pressume, he quickly realized that in the western world, the paying customer should be treated with respect.... The same respect, I may add that I had been treating him with, until he decided to be snot nose.<br>I must give him credit for his quick turnaround since from that moment on, he became the helpful, polite young man, that his parents no doubt raised him to be.<br>The manager also smoothed things over, by promptly getting involved and speaking to us in pretty good Spanish and also gave us a card good for 1 hour of Wi FI access so cheers for making it right.<br>Coffee, baguettes, sandwiches and OJ and we were ready to tackle the frigid Parisian morning.",

"reviewcomment":"Fantastic find, opened in early 2012. Works with amazing producers from different French regions and are able to source the best local products. Their hours are great (definitely not 35h workweek here!) and include holidays. They have free wifi (haven&#39;t tried it yet).<br>Had lunch there today: basque pâté plate (a full pâté, not just a few slices, served with a few leaves of heart of lettuce), excellent. Bread is absolutely fabulous from Poujauran. Dish of the day was hachis parmentier with salad, excellent beef and mash with properly gratiné&#39;d cheese on top. The ability to serve such a simple dish in this neighbourhood showcases their (justified) confidence in the quality of their products and is a refreshing lack of bs in Montparnasse.<br>Suggested Languedoc red was perfect match, and not too raspy for a vin de pays. <br>Café gourmand underlined their consistency with quality of desserts. Everything exceedingly fresh, biscuit à la cuillère crispy on outside, soft and melting on inside, hadn&#39;t had a non-industrial one in years. <br>Epicerie next door stored with very fine and surprising products, mostly demonstrated through the restaurant&#39;s menu. <br>They also have a bar and seem to be well stocked in liqueurs. <br>Service was what traditional French should be: relaxed, not pushy in any way, excellent advice and humour. <br>The atmosphere would work well for a cosy romantic dinner. <br>This place restores my long-lost faith in the quality of French gastronomy!",

Indian food generally has a lot of good vegetarian items, but this is where Marcel really shines, in my opinion. I had some curried soup bean dish thing, and it was completely filling and perfect for refueling. The mint tea was fresh, with beautiful leaves in the pot. Cool ambiance, large windows, parlor like and dark but still really cosy. For me, this is a place that invites you to linger and really savor the meal. I recommend! Great location in a place where it can be hard to pick where to have a meal...I know that Marcel will always be a wonderful place.",

The entree was smoky, slices of raw fish on an oily bed of mashed olives. YUCK!  Dessert was a flavorless Peach Melba. I will say the atomosphere is cozy and the service great.

I tried to avoid places like this at all costs however- seeing how packed it was on a daily basis I felt obliged to check it out. Indiana offers a wide variety of menu options. American food with a French touch. I tried the chicken curry which was so yummy! Came with steamed veggies. Friends ordered burgers, taco salad, quesadillas.. Everyone seemed uber satisfied with their orders! Can get a little crowded at peak hours but it&#39;s all included with the experience. Wear your yoga pants because portions are quite large!",

"reviewcomment":"An Middle Eastern-Jewish restaurant on the Jewish quarter with great falafel.  There are different sections, including sit down and take out. <br><br>We ate inside at the far end. We had some difficulty figuring out what to order as the waitress did not speak English nor was there English on the menu. (This was our difficulty, not the restaurant&#39;s responsibility. If you are traveling to a foreign county you can not expect that they should cater to your language needs). You can order platters and pay by the amount of items you pick from on the lower half of the menu. We ordered platters with five items each. Falafel and hummus luckily was easy to recognize on the menu, and for the most part, we got lucky with the other items we guessed about. One was pastry-like fried triangle with meat inside and was amazing. The only thing on the plate I did not like was eggplant dish (but then I generally do not like eggplant) but my cousin enjoyed it. The falafel and hummus were the best I have had outside of Israel. The platter had a good size portion, more than we could finish.",

"reviewcomment":"For my last day in Paris, I planned to make daytime visits to the Arc de Triomphe and Eiffel Tower, having visited both in the evening hours. Waking up bright and early on a Sunday morning could have been problematic since it seemed like many patisseries and boulangeries were either closed or opened later on Sundays, but thankfully, the well-regarded Arnaud Delmontel boulangerie and patisserie is open early even on Sundays, and conveniently enough, there was one location just a couple of blocks away from my hostel. Arriving once again to a just-opened bakery and greeted with warm baked goods, I walked out with a Pain au Chocolat, a Croissant aux Amandes, and a baguette. Their award-winning baguette was perfect: a crisp, light crust with an airy, pocket-filled interior. Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;m not fat enough to eat a whole baguette in one sitting along with a bunch of other pastries; I only ate half of it. See, self-control.<br><br>The gigantic Croissant aux Amandes was a bit sweeter and much more dense than Ladurée&#39;s, though I really enjoyed the fantastic outer layer covering the top, as it was entirely reminiscent of the topping you would find on a Chinese Bo Lo Bao (pineapple bun). I think I preferred this version of the Croissant aux Amandes, namely because it was so much more dessert-like and luxurious. The Pain au Chocolat was right up there with Julien&#39;s in terms of sheer amazingness, though I think Julien&#39;s benefited from being a bit warmer at the time of consumption. <br><br>All in all, everything was delicious, but the Croissant aux Amandes will be what I remember most fondly. Arnaud Delmontel is a great place to pick up a baguette or some baked goods, and I highly recommend it.",

"reviewcomment":"Move over macarons, I&#39;ve found my new favorite Parisian pastries. Eclair&#39;s&#39; have always been my favorite, but L&#39;Atelier puts an elegant spin on the classic.<br><br>During my visit, I went wild and ordered 10 mini eclairs. 5 savory 5 sweet.<br><br>Yes, they make savory eclairs. I ordered the foie gras eclair, jambon comte, catalante and baltique. The eclairs are basically split in half and stuffed with a savory delicacy of your choice. The exterier bread had a soft sweetness to it which complimented the saltiness of the interior contents. Everything was amazing, but the foie gras and salmon were definately my favorites. Oh, and the jambon. Oh, dangit. nevermind. they were all equally amazing and delicious.<br><br>For the sweets, I ordered a wide variety of basically most of the display case. Nutella, Cafe, Caramel, Chocolate, green tea..YUM!<br><br>Each eclair is made with love, the presentation was beautiful, and the taste was amazing. YUMMMMMMMY!",

There isn&#39;t much in the way of seating but it rarely gets crowded anyway. They sell Starbucks &#39;Paris&#39; mugs, which are a must have and faintly ironic souvenir of your visit!

They have a wide selection of tarts (although I couldn&#39;t find the amazing egg tarts the 2nd time I visited months later) that are quite tasty. There are also macarons and many breads behind the counter as well. The nice lady even put all our pastries in a nice little box!<br><br> And while the prices may be a bit high (not quite sure since I&#39;m not a local), the pastries are quite big.<br><br> This is probably not the best bakery in Paris, but the pastries are good and it shouldn&#39;t leave you unhappy.",

I have been here several times.  The staff is noticeably rude to tourists (of which I am one). Tonight was an exception. The waiter was friendly and attentive,  but it&#39;s the off season. I keep coming back though. I guess I&#39;m a glutton for punishment. Nevertheless a good place to hang out if you are in the neighborhood.",

The quiche is made ahead of time and is heated up once ordered. I ordered the Lorraine and it was pretty good, generous portion of ham and cheese.
