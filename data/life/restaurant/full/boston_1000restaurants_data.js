"reviewcomment":"I waited 2 hours.  <br>Yes, I was one of those crazy people that waited in that line.  <br>Yes, the line that wrapped across the 1800Flowers store and around the corner.  <br>Yes, I am still rating this place 5 stars because it is that good.<br><br>Mind you, I went on a Sunday of Memorial Weekend at 6pm.  We were finally seated by 8pm.  I had no choice.  I&#39;m visiting from the West Coast and I&#39;m going to go to the best restaurant in Boston.  Even though Mike&#39;s Pastry is just down the street, I wanted to save my stomach for this place.  I am a sucker for hype and when I saw the amount of reviews PLUS the ridiculously high rating- I had to give it a try.  Luckily, nowadays I have my smartphone to entertain me.  Seriously, what did people do before this?  Actually have conversations with the people around them?? Psh yeah right ;)<br><br>Anyway, I went here with my best friend and we ordered the whole shabang.  Literally after we ordered, the waitress said &#34;I hope you girls didn&#39;t eat lunch&#34;  Just to give you a picture we&#39;re two small asian girls about 5&#39;2&#39;&#39; and 5&#39;4&#39;&#39; weighing around 115lbs.  We ordered the House Special Zuppa Di Pesce for 2 (in Giacomo sauce), broccoli appetizer (because you know, vegetables are good for you), and a bottle of wine (because wine is good for your soul).  It was enough to feed a party of 4.  The broccoli should just be called mini trees drenched in butter sauce.  The Zuppa Di Pesce was ridiculously huge.  Like Shaq size.  I think it was twice as big as my face.  I will upload photos soon to show a comparison.  And we finished it all.  Every tree, ocean critters, and drop of alcohol.  The waitress has been there for years and all she could say was &#34;Wow!&#34; and nodded her head as a sign of respect.  YEAH!  The seafood was ridiculously fresh.  I got annoyed with the lobster because it was slowing me down but it was worth it and fresh. No frozen stuff here!  I think it is definitely worth it for the price. Btw CASH ONLY!!!!!!<br><br>My only advice - just do it.  Don&#39;t hesitate.  Don&#39;t think.  Wait in that line.  Order that ridiculous meal.  Just do it.  I&#39;m glad I did!",

They are mostly a take-out type place - the atmosphere is not particularly romantic. But the food more than makes up for it. I had some dish of crispy jumbo shrimp in an orange sauce. Oh. my.

"reviewcomment":"Hands down best place for oysters and lobster roll on the east coast!  My husband and I took a trip to the New England states for one week.  We traveled from Boston to Maine by car.  We tried oysters and lobster roll in every state, at famous eateries showcased on TV.  However, our favorite place was a recommendation by my husband&#39;s coworkers, Neptune Oyster.  Not only do they have an impressive selection of delicious oysters from both coasts, the lobster roll beat out everything we tried in Maine.  What made this place better than the rest was temperature.  The lobster roll was actually warm - both the buttered lobster meat and the bun!  I like raw seafood cold but I HATE cooked seafood served tepid or worse, cold (e.g. shrimp cocktail).  So if you&#39;re in the mood for great seafood, skip Maine and go straight to Boston!  <br><br>Warning: there will be a long wait (like 1.5 to 2 hours) but they give you a pager so you can leave and go do other things (like nap, grab drinks elsewhere or take a pre-dinner stroll).",

My wife ordered the St Louis style ribs. We&#39;re from St Louis. We thought we&#39;d give it a try.<br><br>I was completely won over with the first bite. Delicious! Best ribs I&#39;ve had in many years. We traded ribs and couldn&#39;t decide which was better. All I could think was &#34;I can&#39;t wait to write a Yelp review&#34;. <br><br>The cornbread was right out of the oven - fabulous. The black beans were wonderful. The coleslaw was nothing to write home about, but I&#39;m not complaining.<br><br>Our waitress asked if we wanted dessert and we both declined,  not wanting to risk anything that might detract from the best ribs we&#39;ve had in many years. <br><br>Great location, wonderful service, cool ambience....I highly recommend Redbones.",

Who doesn&#39;t love deliciously warm chips &amp; salsa paired with a margarita while awaiting their dinner? No, it isn&#39;t the most authentic place.

"reviewcomment":"Pink Sangria was just about the best cocktail I&#39;ve ever had. It&#39;s definitely on the sweeter end, but if you don&#39;t really like the strong alcohol taste in your sangria, this is DEFINITELY the way to go. It tasted like juice and I know a lot of people might not want that because that just makes it seem like diluted but I would&#39;ve drank it just for the taste alone and not the alcohol itself. <br><br>The bread that they served was actually amazing. I think it&#39;s the same bread they use for their bread bowls so that was really amazing. The bread is so soft on the outside, but is crispy on the outside. It&#39;s the best. I loved the fact that they had crab cakes as an entree option. I LOVE crab and they had it as an entree but also an appetizer. My friends all ordered a different plate and they were definitely satisfied afterwards. <br><br>In terms of service, the service was absolutely incredible overall. We mentioned it was a friend&#39;s birthday, and the waiter had already prepared a surprise peppermint ice-cream cake for her, free of charge!! They also switched out all the knives and forks after it was dirtied from the butter for bread or from an appetizer. The waiter ended up mixing up a side order, but he fixed it and brought it out immediately and let him keep the wrong side order on top of the new one, free of charge again. What I also REALLY appreciated was that he didn&#39;t include the tip into the check, even though it was kind of a hassle, we came in with a party of 8 and usually restaurants automatically charge you 18% gratuity and the fact that they didn&#39;t just goes to show how great their service really is!<br><br>I would definitely recommend this as a place to go for special occasions or as a date, or basically pretty much any occasion! I&#39;m definitely hooked and will be returning.",

Came around 5pm on a Tuesday and we were seated at the bar since the kitchen opened at 5:30 (I would suggest coming around this time because after it gets super packed). We were able to grab a table once it turned 5:30. <br><br>Corn: like everyone else says, a MUST HAVE. Idk what they put in the sauce but it&#39;s so delicious, dip your bread in the leftover sauce also! <br><br>Bone marrow: usually I hate things with a fat consistency but I could eat this for days. The flavoring they have on the bone marrow is so good and it also comes with some greens and super flavorful shredded beef on the side. <br><br>Tuna tartar: Ugh this was so good, a nice dish to have cause it&#39;s so refreshing. the bread that came with it was also delicious. <br><br>Churros: these were okay, the chocolate sauce that came with it was a bit too rich IMO and didn&#39;t go too well with the churro, I would&#39;ve liked maybe a condensed milk sauce with it or something but it was still good. <br><br>I really have to come back here because I&#39;m sure the rest of the menu is just as delicious.",

The scallops were cooked perfectly but I thought the broth was a bit salty. <br><br>Added a side order of Fiddleheads &amp; Corn with Sriracha Butter. I had to ask our waitress what fiddleheads were (young fern, harvested for use as a vegetable, has a spiral shape to it). She advised it was going to have a bitter aftertaste but the corn and sriracha butter would balance it out. Gave it a go and definitely glad I tried it. The corn was perfect and so sweet. <br><br>Definitely would recommend this place! :)",

"reviewcomment":"This past Friday I was working from home and my roommate had the day off. Since it was the first real spring day we&#39;ve had in Boston we decided to spend my lunch break grabbing a bite to eat at the Barking Crab and taking in the Boston Harbor views.<br><br>The Barking Crab has been a Boston waterfront staple since 1994. Located in Fort Point Channel the restaurant has a coastal clam shack feel while sitting in the heart of an urban city.<br><br>Open year-round, the menu has exactly what you would expect from a clam shack - fresh seafood served grilled, baked or fried.<br><br>The dining room has communal picnic tables and a full bar. The casual, laid-back atmosphere makes it perfect for lunch on a sunny day or a place to grab dinner and drinks with a group before heading into town.<br><br>To start we ordered a &#34;Stuffie&#34; aka a stuffed quahog with chorizo. It was so tasty and not overwhelmed by too many breadcrumbs so you can&#39;t taste the clam.<br><br>I&#39;m ready to blow right past spring and go straight to summer and nothing says summer to me like fried clams. In celebration of this first beautiful Boston day I chose the Fried Whole Belly Clam Roll. Again, the clams were not overwhelmed by breading so the taste really comes through.<br><br>My roommate chose the &#34;Naked&#34; Lobster Roll with drawn butter and not mayo like typical lobster rolls. Both dishes were served with french fries, tartar sauce and a side of coleslaw.<br><br>It was a nice break on a sunny warm day to sit by the water and enjoy some great seafood. The restaurant was packed with people on their lunch break and Boston tourists giving it a really fun and energetic vibe.<br><br>I am looking forward to many more visits to the Barking Crab this spring and summer!",

My friend and I opted for the outside since it was a warm early-afternoon Monday. <br><br>Our rather attractive waitress was quick and sincere upon the greet. She filled our water glasses and offered bread. We placed &#34;Blueberry Thrill&#34; martini orders and checked out the familiar and diverse menu. <br>(The drinks have been off the menu a few months, but they still made them for us anyway - really nice)<br><br>I ordered the Standard burger and my friend ordered the grilled cheese. We sipped our tasty drinks and talked and watched the people walk by. <br><br>For our next drink, we both get cosmos and they were nothing short of delicious. Our food arrived promptly and the plates looked great. My burger was prepared correctly and was juicy and flavorful. The string fries accompaniment looked appetizing, but could&#39;ve used a tad less salt, but otherwise good. <br><br>As our waitress cleared the plates, she asked about dessert. We split the Butterscotch Bread Pudding. OMG. This is so good! I couldn&#39;t stop eating it!<br><br>The summary - great location, great service, great drinks, great food and AWESOME desserts.

"reviewcomment":"Gawwd, that was good!  You&#39;d think waiting for 1.5hrs for a table would build expectations to some kind of holy grail of yelp unattainable level. But what greeted me after the wait was probably the best brunch I&#39;ve  had in the city. Why?  The food is unique. The flavors are packed. The bread is so delicious and the portions are huge. I ordered the Ole Miss and the bread was this cayenne pepper spiced loaf. Big, thick pieces, with a very creative, extremely tasty and complimentary mango sour cream. The hash browns were the right amount of browned crisp and soft. And the eggs that topped the bread were just right -- soft scrambled, not runny, moist. The decor in the place is fun to look at while you eat, and the service was awesome despite how packed they were. My coffee mug was constantly filled and the servers were friendly, patient, attentive ... Despite huge lines. <br><br>A brunch experience not to be missed. Delicious, delicious food that&#39;s creative, really well priced, and way more flavorful than any other restaurant in the city. Loved it.",

"reviewcomment":"Beautiful view of Boston! Once you exit the elevator you can already see the city lights. We came here at night obviously. There is a bar, lounge and restaurant seating. If you want to just come for the view, I suggest sitting at the bar because there isn&#39;t a minimum per person. In the lounge its $24 min/person and there is a live jazz band at 9PM. Very romantic spot ;]<br><br>They don&#39;t take reservations, but we were seated in less than 10 minutes in the lounge (and it was a Friday). There are many tables in the lounge area, so I don&#39;t think the wait is ever that long. To start off, I got a Mango Mojito. Very sweet and tasted like juice, just the way I like it! :] <br><br>Tartare of Yellowfin Tuna: Delicate tuna topped with avocado with a side of ginger and seaweed. Very tasty! The flavors and textures of everything together was perfection! mmm yum<br><br>Grilled Tenderloin of Beef Flatbread: Very delicious!! Chunks of beef with roasted peppers and onions in a cheese on top of a flatbread. SO YUMMY! Great tastes and flavor combination.<br><br>Grilled Angus Burger: The burger came with a side of fries. The burger was just okay. Nothing about this plate stood out to me. The fries also weren&#39;t crispy, more like limp potatoes.<br><br>Perfect place for a date or special occasions :]",

I live this place for what it is :) unfortunately things always change when time passes by :( and usually not for the better :(( double sad...<br>Great beer selection as always!! The food is so so.... The staff needs to learn hospitality skills! I know it&#39;s a college town but you want to make money right?! <br><br>Well Sissy that walk!! <br><br>The bartender is handsome great eye candy but lacks bartending skills Waaahhh  took the beer order disappeared for a bit. Place an order and that&#39;s the last time a spoke to him.... Dint ask me how the food was or how I was doing. A few questions go a long way. Instead he was more interested in the bar regular two seats down from me talking about god knows what. I myself being in the hospitality industry know when to turn it up and make everyone feel somewhat special! But don&#39;t make them feel to special it goes to their heads... <br><br>In overall the staff needs to learn how to speak to all customers and make sure there time there is a good one! <br><br>My rule if thumb the bartender should know three things about each person sitting at the bar :) make that a priority they will happy guest and more $$$$ in their pocket!<br><br>4stars based on beer!",

I walked in after the conference and was seated immediately - they have a nice bar area that looks out onto the street for solo-diners which I find really nice. <br><br>The food, though. Their chowder is damn good. Generally speaking, I&#39;m a fan of creamier clam chowders, but their&#39;s was so fantastically seasoned that I didn&#39;t miss the extra creaminess of some West Coast chowders I&#39;ve had and loved. And the biscuits? Such a great and delicious addition!  <br><br>I also had a crab cake appetizer and white chocolate hazelnut ice cream. The crab cake was tasty - nothing out of the norm. But that ice cream? Blew me away! Super creamy and not too sweet (as white chocolate sometimes is. <br><br>To top off all that excellent food, the service was fantastic. Beyond fantastic, really.

BUT it wasn&#39;t until this visit that I discovered the perfect pancake. The granola pancake with date butter. Ohhhhhhhhh. Never again will I look at a pancake in the same way. The granola and date butter combo transforms your average pancake into something worth raving about.",

"reviewcomment":"An Out-of-the-Ordinary Treat!!<br><br>Hungry Mother is a terrific restaurant offering something truly novel that is hard to come by up here: West Virginian Appalachian fine cuisine.  Located close to the Kendall Sq. Theatre, Hungry Mother validates parking in the adjacent garage making access easy and inexpensive.  Named after Hungry Mother State Park (<a href='/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dcr.virginia.gov%2Fstate-parks%2Fhungry-mother.shtml&amp;s=f0b3460e31dc0e3d8ce0f46ef802b164acca1a973db7506651c22d0d42f9dea5' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>dcr.virginia.gov/state-p…</a>), the cuisine takes advantage of traditional Appalachian favorites with the very freshest ingredients resulting in a real comfort food treat.  The ambiance is cute and the staff helpful.<br><br>To start, we had the skillet baked corn bread with sorghum butter.  Simply the best corn bread I have ever had.  Then we had the boiled peanuts with Maine sea salt.  Nutty and salty with a firm but soft consistency, the peanuts were amazing.  We then had the smoked beef tongue, shaved thinly, over crispy thick toast and topped with Robinson swiss and au jus.  That was our favorite part of the meal.  Totally unique and delicious.  For the main entree, I got the roasted chicken which was succulent and meaty with its own gravy and a parsnip puree, topped with chanterelles and fiddleheads.  It was perfect.  My wife got the corn meal breaded catfish.  I was jealous because it was phenomenal.<br><br>For dessert, we ordered the chocolate rye cake with homemade ice cream and candied pecans.  The mix of slight sweetness with the salt of the nuts was great.  One of the best chocolate cakes I have ever had.<br><br>Their sweet tea was great too.<br><br>Overall, Hungry Mother is fantastic.  A total &#34;find&#34; in Cambridge.  It&#39;s worth mentioning that the food quality is very fine and creativity clearly evident.  Amazing, the value for your money is very very high as I found the prices to be quite reasonable.  We will certainly be back... soon!!",

"reviewcomment":"We were looking for a special place to celebrate our son&#39;s graduation. He specifically wanted Japanese cuisine and more specifically sushi with fresh salmon. The service was very good. Even though the restaurant cannot guarantee a tiny private booth (with shogi screens to maintain a nice private experience), they did their best to advise us as to when to come to improve our chances. And upon arrival, we were seated in the private booth.<br><br>As my husband is very picky about his Japanese  and prefers to order in his native tongue, I was relieved to find the server spoke perfect Japanese. This helped to ensure our evening flowed smoothly and that what we ordered was what we expected.<br><br>The sushi is traditionally prepared and the salmon and hamachi belly just melted in our mouths. All in all, we had a very memorable evening.",

"reviewcomment":"My first time trying Turkish food and I loved it. Every dish was perfectly executed and service was great as well. <br><br>I loved the ambiance at Oleana. There is plenty of seating, both indoors and outdoors, and the interior makes it feel more authentic. We were seated immediately but within 30 minutes the entire restaurant was packed. I definitely suggest that you get reservations before coming here. <br><br>The food was innovative and delicious. I love the mezes because they are perfect to share amongst a group of people. (That way you can try as many dishes as you want) We ordered:<br><br>1. Whipped Feta - a nice cheesy and creamy cheese to compliment the bread. A nice appetizer.<br>2. Sultan&#39;s Delight - Extremely tender/fall off the bone meat and paired with an eggplant puree. One of the favorites of the night.<br>3. Falafels - My favorite dish!! You have to get this. Paired with a tahini sauce and pickles which added a tangy and refreshing finish to the dish <br>4. Some special (I forgot the name) but it was a zucchini pancake served with spinach and shrimp. Amazing. The shrimp was juicy and very flavorful <br>5. Lamb - Tender, juicy, succulent, and delicious lamb. Much different than a Greek style lamb but still cooked to a perfect medium rare and did not taste gamey whatsoever <br>6. Baked Alaska- A huge dessert. Definitely share this with someone. Kind of got sick of this halfway into the dish <br><br>Overall, had a great time at Oleana. I will definitely come back here.",

Note that there are two hosts taking your name for a table; you wanna sit inside, talk to the host inside; outside seating, outside host.<br><br>FOOD: Sandwiches are the game here. Lots of chicken choices, but you&#39;ve options across pork, beef, tuna, and vegetarian. Every sammich is paired with its own salad. You should look to spend low to high teens per sandwich.<br><br>Now I may or may not return. You pay for the experience, but it is yummy too.",

Still, we keep coming back after all this time because it&#39;s just that good. Also, we live up the street (ugh, biased)!<br><br>The wait, yes, will probably be long but not always. And trust me, if it is: STICK AROUND! It&#39;s worth it and there&#39;s really no other place that compares in the area. <br>The menu caters to everyone and though as a vegetarian I keep selecting one of the few options available on the dinner menu (brunch also has fab veggie options), I have no qualms about revisiting because the selections are exceptional. I dream about the house made veggie burger and the kale salad is one of the best I&#39;ve had outside of my own kitchen. <br><br>In short, this place gets two thumbs up, but you probably shouldn&#39;t come here...

I mean you can&#39;t walk down Newbury street and not notice that this place is always crawling with good looking people eating with their sunglasses on!! <br><br>We made the last minute decision to eat here and made reservations without any issues for 5pm for a group of 4 on a Saturday. <br><br>TIP: Reservations are mainly for indoor dining, if you&#39;re looking to sit outside that&#39;s with the outdoor hostess (which I might add was not pleasant at all) but luckily someone switched with her when we had to go back outside to get a seat. We were seated within a minute of asking. We probably made it before the rush. <br><br>My group was highly satisfied with their meals and left us so full!! (we were at a brewery tour earlier that afternoon too :]) We had:<br><br>-- Stephanie&#39;s Lobster salad Roll<br>-- Oversized Stephi burger<br>-- Pulled Chicken Pasta <br>-- Cuban sandwich<br><br>I have to say that my craving for the lobster roll has been SATISFIED and for $27 it was well worth the price. It was overloaded with lobster cuts and there was justtttt enough mayo that I forgot it was there. You get a huge side of fries plus cole slaw and it was the best combo. I really enjoyed it and had no regrets. <br><br>We had the pitcher of white sangria and ehhh maybe we should have gone with the red sangria because it felt watered down. The waiter that we had was suggestive and didn&#39;t miss a T with us. <br><br>Overall it was a great initial experience there and I&#39;m excited to go back on the nicer days so I can wear my sunglasses and sit outside too.",

There are quite a few options for her and they are noted as vegan on the menu. She almost always gets the Shanghai Noodles.<br><br>I&#39;ve had just about everything on the menu. Zero complaints. The porchetta is freaking perfect. The lamb belly stir fry is one of the finest meals I&#39;ve ever had. Pork buns, scallion pancakes, homemade pickled veggies. chicken and waffles... I could go on forever.<br><br>The service has been excellent every time we&#39;ve been.  The waitstaff is always attentive to my girlfriend&#39;s dietary needs and I&#39;ve never had to wait around for someone to come to the table.<br><br>I don&#39;t drink but their homemade sodas are delicious. I highly recommend the cherry ginger and the lychee vanilla sodas. My better half ALWAYS gets the Bloodlust: a blood orange margarita with a sriracha salt rim. She&#39;s pretty picky but I know this is a cocktail she truly looks forward to.<br><br>DON&#39;T SKIP DESSERT. The french press coffee is strong and smooth. I usually get the coconut cream pie with homemade lime whipped cream. I&#39;ve also had the chocolate mousse with sesame brittle and tamarind caramel. it&#39;s vegan. It&#39;s decadent. It&#39;s awesome.<br><br>All in all, I can&#39;t say enough about this place.

They have very fresh bagels, moist and not over toasted. <br>I was able to find a small spot to sit next to the sandwich station.

As I am a healthy eater, this place was just my cup of tea. The have salads, juices, smoothies, and bowls. <br><br>The bowls are the best. They basically have boiled/steamed veggies topped over brown rice or quinoa, and drizzle it with a dressing. It is so delicious and fresh! They mix in toppings like kale, mushrooms, carrots, tofu, and nuts. What I like most about these bowls is that it really feels like a home made meal with fresh, natural, and healthy ingredients rather than processed foods with lots of oil like you would typically find in a restaurant. <br><br>I got the lovers bowl and really liked it. Other popular ones are the goddess and adventure bowl. For a good green juice, get the Jive Alive! Also, it can get pretty crowded on the weekends so Just a heads up!",

"reviewcomment":"We came here on a Saturday night looking for a casual fun place to have a few drinks, and we were not disappointed. If you&#39;re not familiar with the place you might miss it, as it lives up to the &#34;den&#34; part of it&#39;s name with it&#39;s underground location.  There is a big bar area and lots of small tables which can get a little cramped if it gets too busy.  It happened to be a perfect sized crowd for a Saturday night, certainly helped by the fact that it was late May and the college crowd had all ready evacuated for the summer.   Drink prices were phenomenal ($3 for a pint of Cisco Grey Lady) and they had a great selection of beers and mixed drinks. There is a somewhat pretentious sign over the bar pronouncing that they don&#39;t serve any of your standard Coors and Bud lights, but of course no one really needs those beers anyway. I heard someone try to order an Irish Car Bomb and the bartender&#39;s response was &#34;not at this bar.&#34;   Again fairly pretentious, however it&#39;s kind of nice to know they aren&#39;t into the whole blackout college scene.  The bartender was really pleasant and attentive to us as customers, which was much appreciated. <br><br>I would definitely come back !",

Let me take you through the play-by-play.<br><br>Driving to Inman Square on a Saturday night at 7, I was convinced that I would not find a spot but oh wait, ECG has it&#39;s own parking lot across the street for only $5.<br><br>We park and walk in and I&#39;m stunned by the ambiance. The walls are covered with old ship remains and beach pictures. All railings and floors give you that boat dock feel. We get seated in about 2 minutes and immediately order a delicious bottle of wine. The wine selection is not huge but I am not a wine snob at all so it was perfect for me.<br><br>Finally look at the menu for food. We ordered Asian oysters, muscles, and a 14 oz sirloin steak. The oysters had the perfect amount of spice and the muscles were steamed to perfection.  The steak was brought out to us just as we finished our appetizers and it was HUGE. Everything was so good and I highly recommend going.<br><br>Enjoy!!",

"reviewcomment":"Have been a patron of this &#34;hip&#34;  downtown restaurant/bar for many, many years now so this review is a long time coming! I have been to Silvertone over 15 times at least-maybe more- both with a friend or friends and by myself. Wanted to give the place 4 and a half stars but Yelp won&#39;t let me do that.  <br><br>The prices of the meals are inexpensive; the cocktails a little high in comparison however standard for what Boston bars charge. Stand outs here would include the steak tips which are plentiful and yummy. When they have a seafood special, I order that to cut calories. Tried the halibut or sea bass there once (can not remember which one?) -broiled-and it was light and flavorful. The meat loaf is really, really good with whipped potatoes (no lumps even though I kind of like lumps in my potatoes...LOL).  The side specialty greens included with most meals and a homemade dressing are really satisfying. The only disappointment is the macaroni and cheese that everyone raves about?  Find it very dense with little sharpness from the cheese itself. The dish needs a meat or seafood added to offset the heaviness of the entrée itself. A great idea would be a lobster macaroni and cheese or adding chicken or vegetables to it like Fat Cat in Quincy. <br><br>For an appetizer (they have quite a few) the quesadilla and chicken wings are both excellent!   Have had bicardi and diet cokes in addition to cosmopolitans. Good dose of alcohol for the price definitely. The service is mixed; usually get better treatment when with people than by myself. Though it is not professional customer service, I think that is typical in a lot of places .<br><br>Great atmosphere, situated in a basement with red walls and old black and white photos which are cool. The place has a New York feel to it in how it is situated in a basement and the décor itself is a throwback.  I usually go on a Saturday night. Just to let you know, Silvertone opens their doors at 6 PM and usually within a half an hour to 45 minutes, the place gets jam packed so if you do not want to wait forever, get there early! Also, call to make sure they do not open early which they do if there is a popular theatre district show going on.  I made that mistake one night and the hostess told me there would be a ninety minute wait so I am more careful now.<br><br>The only complaint is they do not have dessert which is why it did not get 5 stars but really it gets 4 and a half from this local fan.",

"reviewcomment":"I am going with a 5! The food blew me away and the service was wonderful.<br><br>This was my third time in Boston. I researched and reserved every lunch and dinner for our party of 10. However, as it often happens, there was a change of plans. We found ourselves aimlessly trying to find my closest (backup) Yelp bookmarks when a friend of a friend texted her about Douzo. I was VERY hesitant to take a stranger&#39;s recommendation at the last second. Have they not met me? I have to research everything before I try it! Ha! That said, I am now so happy I didn&#39;t fight it and went along with it! Lesson learned...<br><br>The restaurant is very nice and definitely more than a couple of notches above casual. We were there during lunch, but it seems like an &#34;it&#34; place to go for dinner (more so than lunch).<br><br>It took a while to look over the menu. There was no shortage of options. Once we decided, we placed our orders for everything: drinks, appetizers and all of our different dinner choices. Our waitress listened intently, hands behind her back, as we all listed each item (sometimes going back and forth between some of them). As she walked away I wondered aloud, there is NO way she caught all of that without writing it down. Not only did she get it correctly, but I interrupted her right after and requested a menu before she could go put our orders in. She came back minutes later and confirmed one by one every single thing we had just ordered. I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s the norm at sushi places in Boston. It definitely isn&#39;t in South Florida! Not all at once anyway!<br><br>Everything that we ordered (for our party of 4) was delicious. Everything. <br><br>Lychee Martini (a couple of these)<br><br>Wakatake Onikoroshi Sake Junmai Daiginjo (a couple of these as well)<br><br>Spicy Edamame<br><br>Mushroom Soup<br><br>Ginger Miso Soup<br><br>Miso Yellowtail (my favorite)<br><br>Crunchy Roll<br><br>Seared Toro Sushi with truffle oil and caviar <br><br>Spicy Scallop Hand Roll<br><br>Grilled Duck Bento<br><br>Phoenix Roll<br><br>Smoked Salmon Fried Rice<br><br>Everyone at our table was stuffed when done. I, however, was still craving more sushi. I should have ignored them all and gone with my craving. Because I did not, I am STILL craving another roll. Nothing I can do now that I&#39;m back at home in Florida huh? You bet the next time I am in Boston, this will be my first stop. NO DOUBT ABOUT IT. <br><br>If you are lucky enough to live closer...GO!",

"reviewcomment":"When my good friend first moved to Somerville, I came down to visit for a weekend and after a night of pretty raucous behavior he suggested hitting up Sound Bites for a good post-debauchery breakfast. This was about 4 years ago and ever since this first experience, I have demanded that anytime I visit, we go to Sound Bites. The wait might look intimidating from the street but the amazing staff gets the tables turned over quick without making anyone feel rushed to leave. The menu is INSANE! So many selections and options. The coffee/iced coffee bar is genius and offers up so many different flavors. With a visit this weekend (first one in over a year) I felt compelled to write a review because I met the owner after he overheard me saying how amazing his restaurant is. He was warm and welcoming and even bought my friend and I a mimosa just for being there. I got their corned beef hash omelette. The corned beef hash is the most legit thing I&#39;ve ever eaten. Big chunks of meat, and definitely not the garbage out of a can. Throw in a side of a corn muffin and hash browns, with an amazing dark iced coffee, I&#39;m in heaven. What really sets them apart is the hash browns. Rather than fry up a handful of pre breaded frozen potatoes, or some silly shredded potatoes, they take thickened mashed potatoes and form a cake which they season and grill on the flat top with butter. <br><br>Hands down, my favorite breakfast spot on earth. If you&#39;re in Somerville, check it out. Nothing else compares. Also, the meal I had on Sunday might just be my death row meal.",

I had other Thai restaurants, that probably looked a bit more upscale - but the food wasnt actually as good.<br>I had tried their pad-thai, pat si eu and green curry and they are amazing! I keep on ordering the same dishes without even getting bored. They taste really good. Their delivery service is good and timely, they take credit cards and cash on delivery. In the restaurant, the service is also good.<br>I would definitely recommend this place to any person looking for great thai food in Boston!",

"reviewcomment":"I try not to pick favorites, but the question of &#34;what&#39;s your favorite restaurant?&#34; comes up so often that I felt I needed to choose. And I chose Picco. <br><br>I&#39;ve been here multiple times, consistently had amazing pizza (although varying levels of amazingness, to be sure), inconsistently good service, and generally a nice atmosphere. It does get crowded at peak times and they don&#39;t have a high turnover rate since its the type of restaurant where people linger and enjoy wine and dessert (ice cream!). Nice if you&#39;re at the table enjoying said wine or dessert, not so great when you&#39;ve been &#34;the next on the waitlist&#34; for an hour and no one has left the restaurant. <br><br>I tend to order the pizzas with seasonal toppings. The toppings are delicious, the crust is fantastic. Chewy in all the right places with just enough crisp and char on the outside. Beautiful. I don&#39;t have a favorite because the menu changes fairly often and I generally can&#39;t get the same pizza twice. But no complaints here, I&#39;ve yet to be disappointed. I&#39;ve split a small pizza with a friend and had ice cream after and it was enough, though I could have done with a little more pizza. I&#39;ve also split a large pizza with a friend and finished it, but had no room for ice cream :( <br><br>Get there early. <br>Have some wine or beer at the bar while you wait for your table. <br>Order whatever pizza sounds the most delicious to you.<br>Eat delicious pizza.<br>Eat delicious ice cream.<br>Leave happy.",

This was actually my first time coming here for brunch and it was pretty damn good.<br><br>Instead of having bread and butter, they had a little basket filled with croissants, muffins, and pastries. They all tasted great! We ordered the steak tartare as an appetizer and it came in this huge plate. I&#39;ve never seen this kind of display for tartare before. In addition to the bread and steak, it also came with a salad and a some extra sides such as onions, cheese, mustard, and capers. The tartare itself was good, but I&#39;ve had better.  After that, I had the Crab Cake Benedict. Everything about it was amazing, especially the home fries. <br><br>It also wasn&#39;t too expensive for the amount of food we had. About $60 for two people.

The bartender was great an would chime in in helping us make a decision.<br><br>I went with a calvados cocktail that came in a martini glass, my fiancé had a beer, and our friends ordered sparkling wine and another cocktail. I think we all loved our choices, and they paired well with the desserts.<br><br>I chose the crème brûlée, and my friends had chocolate mousse and tarte tatin. The bartender laid out napkins as placemats for us, and it set the tone nicely. My crème brûlée was beautiful, perfect in every way. I tried my friend&#39;s chocolate mousse, which was thick, dark and delicious. And all of them were around $7...a good price for the quality. It&#39;s such a beautiful restaurant with great service, that I will most certainly be back for dessert and cocktails quite soon!",

When we arrived the Valet ( Tony ) was quick to open my door and escorted us inside the front door quickly ( as it was raining ) with a friendly smile and manner.  The people at the front were all smiles and very pleasant, we were there a little early but were still seated promptly, with the hostess pulling out the chair for my date ( noticed and greatly appreciated )<br><br>The server ( Youssef ) was right there within 1 minute and in a very friendly calm non rushed way welcomed us, and asked if he may get us something from the bar. I actually knew what bottle of wine I wanted and he was happy to take that order and suggested a bottle of sparkling pellegrino which we agreed would be perfect. Before he left he gave us an incredibly detailed synopsis of the specials for the evening, and told us his personal favorites.( well done ) <br><br>He was back in approx 2 minutes presented the wine perfectly and after the taste poured a good amount into each glass. The warm chewy bread was served by a friendly but not familar back server in black who also was the master of the crumber! ( well done ) <br><br>Youssef gave us about 5 minutes asked if we had any questions, to which I said well yes if you had to choose between the sirloin and the tenderloin which one would you choose and why?  He said well if you are looking for a butter smooth soft texture go tenderloin, if you prefer a little more flavor profile, and texture go with the sirloin, ( I went sirloin ) My girl went for suggested Pork Milanese special. Overall we ordered the Foie Gras and duck confit with cranberry brioche, tuna tartare, and a caesar salad to start us off. I got the aforementioned sirloin Med and she the Pork with a side of the mistral fries. <br><br>The apps were out in less than 15 min and they were awesome!! That Foie Gras is worth any amount of PETA grief I will be getting from my Liberal tree hugging friends lol, ( yes you know who you are )  My girls tartare was equally well executed and very fresh!  The Caesar was made with white anchovies, super crisp, and very flavorful!<br><br>At this point we had sipped our way through the original bottle of wine, and being as I was driving decided to go to a wine by the glass instead of risk another bottle. I asked Youssef his recommendation on the wines by the glass selection he gave me two suggestions of red one a french cab from Bordeaux and the other an American  cab from Napa. I went Bordeaux! =) My accomplice went for the Napa chard, Both went perfectly with our entree&#39;s. <br><br>The entrees were actually larger than expected, my sirloin was perfectly cooked to a nice pink medium with an excellent carmelization on the outside! My lady friends Pork Milanese was HUGE lol and crispy with nice roasted tomatoes and a tasty sauce the name of which escapes me at this moment. The Mistral fries were crispy but not over cooked and we enjoyed every bit of them. <br><br>After finishing the entrees, Youssef came over and we were having a bit of a chat, he said so what brought you here tonight ? are you celebrating something? I sheepishly said well if you promise not to make a big deal about it ill tell you, its my 45th birthday!<br><br>Wouldn&#39;t you know it, that crafty so and so quietly brought over a nice little birthday dessert sampler! =) ( again well done!! ) On the way out the front door staff was super helpful with our jackets and umbrellas and there was Tony our valet right there to help us back into our car! <br><br>In closing, this experience really happened, and it was just about as perfect as I have ever encountered anywhere EVER!  So go see Youssef and have yourself a great time!",

"reviewcomment":"I&#39;m compelled to balance my Yelp karma by praising The Helmand with a five star approval. I do not want to suffer the fate of so many yelping yelpers, who use this opportunity to express only dissatisfaction. Instead, I&#39;d prefer to be a silent hand that raises up the services that are doing things right (e.g. The Helmand). <br><br>In the case of The Helmand, the book is much better than the cover. Do not be deterred by the facade and distance from the places where great cuisine prevails. I was overwhelmed by the comfortable ambiance, aromas, pleasant sights and sounds. Accordingly, the flavors followed suit. My inner vegetarian was more than appeased by offerings of eggplant and okra; and the carnivore was satiated by morsels of lamb grilled to perfection. <br><br>This particular evening at The Helmand ranks among the greatest all-around dining experiences I have ever had in Cambridge.",

"reviewcomment":"I read an article that the line for ramen starts at 8 and they only serve 100 bowls of ramen.<br><br>Arrived at 7:30 and there was no one in line so we grabbed some drinks on the side bar. We read  Theo, the host, was so welcoming and gave us the full run down of what to expect. John, the bartender, was sociable and welcoming. <br><br>Around 8:30 they started passing out (Cajun?) popcorn and shrimp chips with seaweed flakes in mini Chinese takeout boxes. John and Theo kept making rounds to make sure everyone in line had a drink or water. <br><br>They explained the flavor of the night and allowed us to try it to gage what spice level we wanted. Tonight&#39;s theme was vegetarian (mushrooms and other veges). The flavor was roasted Thai chili paste. The menu was limited because the normal kitchen hours closed at 9, but they still offered the biscuits and chicken wings as part of the late night ramen menu.<br><br>Sat down 9:07pm! Kenny, the waiter, took our orders. He suggested getting the slow roasted short ribs. Ask for Kenny! He&#39;s awesome. <br><br>Food came quickly.<br><br>vegetarian mushroom ramen - roasted shiitakes, scallion, charred corn, soy-garlic butter, smoked tofu and Thai chile paste. Broth is made from fried mushrooms, charred vegetables, miso, sesame paste and kombu (kelp). The ramen had little broth (unlike places like Sapporo or Totto Ramen) but it was still flavorful and a little on the salty side. <br><br>Buttermilk biscuits - never a let down! But can definitely fill you up quickly!<br><br>Salt and pepper short ribs slow roasted for 14 hours - Yelpers, this is a magical piece of meat. If I had to pick something to eat for the rest of my life...this is probably one of the top contenders. The meat was so tender  and fell right off the bone. It so flavorful and so damn good. <br><br>1989 teriyaki wings - these weren&#39;t pretty good but the short ribs overpowered it. <br><br>Overall so yummy!",

"reviewcomment":"I&#39;ve been here a couple times before but have never gotten their food, before last night. I had a double cheeseburger and a side salad, along with a Smuttynose Bouncy House IPA.<br><br>The burger looked very much like two frozen patties, cooked to oblivion, and slapped on a bun that was too large for the shrunken patties. Plus, a nice slice of processed cheese product on each side. It did taste better than it looked -- basically just a slightly classier fast food burger. <br><br>The side salad was a pretty substandard assembly of iceberg lettuce, sad tomatoes, strangely large chunks of carrot, green bell pepper, and strangely mild white onion. The three dressing options were Ranch, Creamy Peppercorn, and Italian. I had the Italian, which I&#39;m guessing was Kraft or the generic brand from their food supplier. Wasn&#39;t horrible but next time I&#39;ll just sacrifice the healthiness and opt for fries instead.<br><br>All that said, $5.50 for a double cheeseburger and side salad is a pretty damn good deal.<br><br>Their beer selection is pretty good but the waitress wasn&#39;t quite sure of what rotating taps were available that night. There are some great bottles available as well. My IPA was tasty and not too expensive. <br><br>I&#39;ll definitely be back for some cheap food and good beer, especially on a nice summer night on their patio.",

"reviewcomment":"Visiting from Oakland, CA, and while the love of my life is at a conference all day, I get to explore the city. I wake up late and hungry for a good breakfast sandwich. Referring to my trusty yelp app, I find this spot along with several others. I decide to walk the extra blocks to Mike &amp; Patty&#39;s. I encounter this tiny shop on the corner of Church and Fayette St. It&#39;s tiny, but I wouldn&#39;t call it a hole-in-the-wall; too cute for that.  I&#39;m immediately told it&#39;ll be a 40-min wait for a sandwich. Since I have nothing to do, I decide to sit and wait. Boy, was it worth it! First of all, the employees are extremely friendly (I watched as many people rolled through, and responded rudely to the disclaimer of the 40-minute wait and still the employees remained kind...I actually appreciated the disclaimer ahead of time).  Okay, finally on to the sandwich...I ordered the breakfast torta. It was delicious!  The ingredients were fresh, and they were very generous with the avocado. I loved it!  If we weren&#39;t heading home early tomorrow morning, I&#39;d bring my partner back to try the Fancy or one of their other delicious looking sandwiches. <br><br>I would say that if you&#39;re hungry or in a hurry call ahead and order in advance. If you have time on your hands, order here, hang out and enjoy the cheerful ambiance.",

The last time I came, the carnitas tacos were a little dry... but that may have just been an off night.

It is made of white chocolate. You can chose other type of chocolates if you want. <br><br>The salt in salty caramel has definitely boosted the sweetness in the warm drink. <br>It&#39;s just purely awesome. <br><br>The cup is small which is perfect for me that I value the quality more than the quality for a sweet drink like this. <br><br>Services here are ok.

"reviewcomment":"Outsanding restaurant from soup to nuts.  i&#39;ve had a number of dinners here, but recently did the chef&#39;s tasting degustation (pescetarian)  for lunch as well.  Service is tops for the city, and the whole experience, while classy, is super comfortable.  They have some excellent servers and cheese....!<br><br>Here&#39;s a sneak peak into my pescetarian degustation.  Keep in mind this was for lunch; I believe the dinner version includes a few more plates. I also checked out the vegetable tasting menu, but the options didn&#39;t look nearly as enticing.<br><br>- Bread (pretzel and brioche) - very good, although sadly served cold<br>- Arugula-based amuse bouche - I&#39;m not capturing the essence of this starter but it was out of this world.  Imagine the best taste of salad ever rolled into two delectable balls<br>- Oysters - one plain, one with champagne, nice and bright<br>- Fried egg over potato - too heavy for me, weird dish IMO <br>- Scallop and greens - perfectly light dish, succulent scallop in an almost sweet green sauce<br>- Lobster bisque - butter poached lobster bisque. This is a classic of theirs, but too staid for my palette.  Lobster is a bit 2006<br>- Green sorbet &#34;ice cream cone&#34; - intermezzo was wonderfully creative. You have a house-made green sorbet over a crepe-like cone in a flower pot full of brown and black sugar, super fun<br>- Halibut with clam and trumpet mushrooms - sauce made this dish. Everything cooked and presented nicely<br>- Ocean trout with morel mushrooms - highlight of the meal. The most savory dish, but still not overdoing it with maybe a 4-ounce portion of fish<br>- Cheese plate, five types of cheese with sweet bread, honey, and homemade jam - loved this, it went from mild Vermont goat cheese to an aged Italian, an alpine Swiss, Epoisse for the stink, and blue to end on a flavorful note ;)<br>- Berries with custard and ice cream - had this with their chemix decaf coffee. Love it too although I took a couple bites to leave room for dinner!!",

"reviewcomment":"So, I have been living in Boston/Cambridge for over 6 years and never have had a decent meal in the infamous North End--until tonight!!<br><br>We begrudgingly trekked out to N. End at the request of an out of town visiting relative and boy were we surprised.   <br><br>Pomodoro blew away all of my expectations as the food and service were both excellent.<br><br>We got reservations and were seated on time in a nice cozy table next to the kitchen where the wafting of the various meals being prepared really got us excited.<br><br>Got calamari and a bottle of vino to start with followed by some main courses.<br><br>To our surprise and delight the server brought us out a clams and fennel dish, which we thought was being dropped off at the wrong table, but our server informed us that she decided to treat us to the dish--great!! She brought us out more bread to dip in the wonderful sauce/broth and were were stuffed before our main courses even arrived.<br><br>For our mains we got the salmon, veal and chicken pomodoro--all were excellent.<br><br>Now that we were thoroughly stuffed and had stand up to stretch we were treated further by some free dessert--tiramasu!! <br><br>Suffice to say we left not only satisfied and stuffed but very pleased as we had a great meal which was quality at a very fair price.  <br><br>I would highly recommend this establishment as their wonderful service and excellent food will not disappoint.  <br><br>And yes if you are wondering if this review is 5 stars due to the free dishes we got--no as I would recommend this establishment despite those added bonuses.",

"reviewcomment":"My business partner and I ate here before a Red Sox game. We heard great things about this burger joint on Phantom Gourmet so I wanted to check it out.  We found a table right away.  I ordered the Big Tasty with onion rings and my partner ordered the mushroom burger with cheese fries and a chocolate shake. The burgers were juicy and delicious and cooked perfectly.  The fries were crispy and the onion ringer were decent...nothing special there.<br><br>I highly recommend Tasty Burger for an affordable meal before or after a Sox game. It&#39;s a great value with burgers coming in under $6. I would have paid double what I paid inside Fenway Park for half the quality of food. The place is a funky converted gas station which retains some of that old vibe. I saw a pool table in the back.  It&#39;s cool, relaxed and delicious.  Our waitress was attentive, quick and friendly.  Thumbs up for sure!",

Despite their high traffic, Dave&#39;s employees do a phenomenal job keeping the line moving - I have personally never waited longer than 5-6 mins for a sandwich. You can even call in an order if you&#39;re really determined to not wait, and they&#39;ll have it ready for pick-up within 10 mins.<br><br>In addition, the free cheese and sauce samples serve as a great distraction :p   The spinach, arugula, and walnut pesto, as well as the chicken liver pate were particularly memorable. I almost forgot about their amazing black olive tapenade... I&#39;m clearly fond of this place.<br><br>As for the sandwiches, I would recommend the Brazilian Hangover Helper if you like mortadella and ample red onion (hot peppers add a little kick). The Steak and Blue, Cubano, and French Ham are my other favorites. <br><br>This place also has great options for vegetarians and does an exceptional job catering (I recently attended a kickass research symposium that was catered by Dave&#39;s. The event had about 50 attendees, and there seemed to be just the right amount of food). My one critique would be the shortage of space within the shop, and therefore would recommend not eating in if you have more than a person or 2 with you. However, when the weather is nice, they have some very pleasant seating outside.",

(Side Rant: I really, really wish that restaurants would stop charging $10+ for a small plate full of arugula/lettuce. It&#39;s so passé.)<br><br>For entrees we chose braised short ribs with pappardelle (Yummy! But needed more sauce) and the gnocchi, which were super fluffy and the sauce was excellent - always the mark of a good Italian restaurant. We shared those and also a side of broccoli rage, which, like the mussels, were cut up nicely for easy bite-taking pleasure.<br><br>I&#39;ll go back... if someone&#39;s bringing me on a hot date. Can&#39;t afford it myself.",

Chef Davis also gets bonus points for his commitment to farm-to-table fine dining!<br><br>Love it:<br>- Sunday brunch at Henrietta&#39;s is an experience that should be mandatory for all Cambridge foodies. The beautiful display of local goodness is enough reason to go. Highlights include the eggs benedict and amazing dessert options. Come with an empty stomach and a workout scheduled for the next day!<br>- Local cheese selections make for a great start to dinner.  <br><br>Like it:<br>- The entrees (salmon, steak, duck, and crab cakes at our table) were all simple and solid dishes. I just wouldn&#39;t crave any of them enough to die to come back for dinner!<br>- Chocolate bread pudding sundae and sticky toffee desserts were both good and impossible to stop eating, but again they weren&#39;t &#34;out of this world&#34; good. And let&#39;s face it, it&#39;s hard to make a dessert I wouldn&#39;t enjoy (at least a little). <br><br>Hate it:<br>- Service is fine, but not great. The waiters don&#39;t seem to share the same passion for local food as the chef!",

So that created a little commotion.<br><br>But, the server was very nice - a bit hesitant to change my order when I asked - but looked into it and put in my new order.  They were delish, the berries were sweet and tart and the sausage side I got was pretty good as well.  My friend got the Buttery Breakfast and liked it as well.  It was a really wonderful brunch experience, the setting, music, food, service were all really pleasant.  Excellent friend/date local.",

"reviewcomment":"I&#39;ve been coming here for a while now, and have never really been disappointed. If you&#39;re looking for a casual dining experience with an assorted menu ranging from vegetarian friendly to a burger this is always at the top of my list. It&#39;s not fancy, the food isn&#39;t gourmet, but it&#39;s always a good time. <br><br>I generally never order anything except one of their salads or a burger. I usually just get too excited that I&#39;m here and get to have one or the other that I never want to try anything else. I&#39;ve had the boneless wings, nachos, and various other shared plates as well. The spicy artichoke dip is indeed, a bit spicy. <br><br>The wait staff have always been friendly and courteous. There can be times when you&#39;re seated near a big party that it gets far too loud for you to carry on a conversation with your own party, but eh it&#39;s a restaurant. <br><br>One of my favorite features? The bathrooms are one holers.. I hate large restaurant bathrooms. Yea yea.. Weird I know. <br><br>A couple of years ago we brought my girlfriends parents here for her mothers birthday. She loved it and her dad went nuts over the beer selection. <br><br>Overall? Yeah, it&#39;s good stuff.",

Anyways...<br><br>This was our first visit to Xinh Xinh, and we came in for a light early-dinner. The restaurant is small but doesn&#39;t feel as crowded as some of the others in the area. The menu is large with a wide variety of options. Whether you are looking for the standards or are feeling adventurous, there are many options to choose from. We selected the spring rolls and the shrimp hot pot. Both dishes were hot and very flavorful, with the hot pot being the superior of the two. The deep and complex flavors of the sauce worked wonderfully with the shrimp and onions. Portion sizes here, as reported by others, are not huge, but neither of us left feeling hungry. <br><br>Overall, I feel Xinh Xinh is quite deserving of the high ratings others have given it here. I&#39;ll definitely be back on my next Boston trip!",

"reviewcomment":"This is my favorite affordable sushi place to eat at--for what you pay, the quality is excellent. I would ignore the reviews complaining about the rice; sushi rice is supposed to be short grain, and my sister, who&#39;s lived in Japan for years, said Genki Ya has amazing sushi rice. However, if that&#39;s not your personal preference, then Genki Ya isn&#39;t for you.<br>The restaurant&#39;s a cute little nook and emphasizes organic food. My personal favorites are the rich salmon roll/salmon sashimi, and the genki ichiban. Their curry is good too!<br>But, most often, I order delivery. Since we live locally it arrives within an hour (I just plan the meal around that time frame for Brookline deliveries. Not sure about other places), and the sushi and miso soup are always fresh and delicious. Plus, when you order online, after a few orders you get $10 off. Always a great deal for me!",

Our waitress was so nice and attentive, and the food was delicious.<br><br>You have your choice of baked apple or cream of wheat to start. I don&#39;t even like cream of wheat and I ate all of mine.

"reviewcomment":"$33 for a three-course dinner at an intimate,<br>romantic, exposed-bricked, bookshelves-for-wine shelves little Italian restaurant in Beacon Hill? Sounds almost too good to be true, but you gotta believe that it&#39;s true (for as long as restaurant week lasts)! <br><br>Apart from waiting in a cramped little area where the main entrance door swings in instead of out making it difficult for the hungry diners to make space for the content  diners to exit, this place is AMAZING. For starters, the olive oil that came with the complimentary bread was so rich in flavor making me want to ditch the classic bread n butter combo forever. The arugula salad was very light, refreshing, and perfectly seasoned without being drenched in the lemon vinaigrette. It was only slightly lacking in prosciutto, making me forget that that was even there. The beef tenderloin was amazingly grilled, tender, and juicy. The acidity of the red wine sauce perfectly balanced the richness of the reggiano risotto. The consistency of the Panna Cotta was more like that of a cheesecake; it was very dense, creamy and satisfying. The portions were just right, enough for me to savor every bite without feeling too overwhelmed. The Cioccolato and Budino desserts were also both amazing. The caramel ice cream from the Budino was very unique; it wasn&#39;t too sweet and had a slightly burnt aftertaste to it. Wish I could have taken the pastry chef home with me!",

"reviewcomment":"Took a couple of clients to the Capital Grille Boston.  <br><br>Set the stage:  Once you get to this level of restaurant, food quality, ambience and service are a given - it&#39;s going to be (or better be) above average.  Our salads, appetizers, entrees, and desserts were all very, very good.  Service was top notch, ambience was classy, and the wine recommendation was great.<br><br>The real question is whether you prefer a chain or local flavor.<br><br>If you&#39;re someone that wants the consistency of a chain, but want high quality food, it will be hard to beat CG or The Palm.  That said, I do think that in most major cities, you&#39;ll find non-chain high end restaurants that are just as good (if not better) with more of a local feel.<br><br>So what kind of 5 star do you want?",

"reviewcomment":"This is one of my favorite places to go for weekend brunch in Central Square.  The place isn&#39;t too large, so make reservations or show up early if you don&#39;t want to wait.<br><br>To start off we had their delicious honey biscuits, which were buttery and crumbly, with a honey spread. Their eggs benedict is to die for and they dress it up with everything from homemade corn beef hash to fresh lobster.  Their rich hollandaise is also made fresh.  For those who like Blue Bottle coffee from California, they can also get their fix here.<br><br>Finally, to finish everything off we had the Cookie Monster French Toast.  If you have a sweet tooth this dish is for you.  But consider getting a half portion it there&#39;s 1-2 people...it&#39;s quite large.<br><br>Be warned though, their brunch menu isn&#39;t available during the week.  So I&#39;d suggest going on the weekend for the full amazing experience.",

"reviewcomment":"Winsor is my go-to for Boston dim sum when I&#39;m not accompanied by someone who wants the novelty of watching middle-aged Asian women angrily push carts of pre-made food around. (Side note: If you are one of those people, I recommend Hei La Moon!) In terms of dim sum food quality, I think Winsor is the best.<br><br>Winsor serves dim sum all day, err&#39;day - if you&#39;ve got a strange hankering for shu mai at 7 PM on a Tuesday, for example, this is your place. If you come for lunch on the weekends, be prepared to (1) wait 20-30 minutes, and (2) share a table with strangers. You order a la carte, and the food always comes out in a timely manner. Go wild - I&#39;ve never been able to get above $15 per person!<br><br>As with most places in Chinatown, the service at Winsor is never going to be phenomenal. That being said, it&#39;s never been bad either. I&#39;ve actually come to be quite fond of the staff here, from the rosy-cheeked, smiling hostess to the slightly disgruntled busboy who frowns every time I ask for Sriracha (which is every time).<br><br>Go check Winsor out! If you like dim sum for the food, you won&#39;t be disappointed.",

Carnitas tend to be better when they are fresh and steaming, Chicken is my go-to whenever the pork looks like its been there too long.<br><br>You choose what you want on it, I typically forgo the beans but get diced corn, onions, salsa, green chile verde and some sour cream (In addition to the rice and cheese they put on there)<br><br>Help yourself to a Jarrito, a Spanish soda that has like 50g of sugar and is delicious (I usually get the grapefruit)<br><br>A drink and a super burrito with toppings will set you back about $8.25...not bad!",

They can barely fit on the plate. The crust is fluffy but doughy, soft but crunchy...how they achieve that nirvana of pizza-tude is beyond me. They stick your slice in the oven before they hand it off to you for maximum deliciousness. I&#39;m not a risk-taker so I always get the plain slice. <br><br>Open late. <br>Worth it. - New Yorker",

"reviewcomment":"Fajitas and Ritas is not the best Mexican food that you&#39;re going to find in Boston, but I always have a good time when I go so it gets 4 stars. They win me over with the margaritas. This week their special was the bahama mama, which was delicious! I usually get strawberry mango though, because I like the way the colors mix in the caraffe that they serve it in.<br>The fajitas are good and they give you a solid serving size for what you pay. <br>They take your order by having you write out what you want on this huge ordering sheet, and that always tricks me into buying more than my stomach can handle. (my eyes are much bigger than my stomach)<br>It wouldn&#39;t hurt to get some more chips on the nacho plates, they&#39;re often overpowered depending on how many toppings you get.<br>It&#39;s a great place to unwind and grab some drinks with friends.",

This is a good go to place in Central Square for lunch.  They have a selection of tasty breakfast items (I love their omelets - sooooo tasty!) as well as sandwiches and salads.  There is also a pretty nice looking dessert display but I never have gotten around to dessert because the main meal is always so good I&#39;m too stuffed!  As a dedicated carnivore, I&#39;ve even tried their BLT ( with tempeh bacon)-- which isn&#39;t half bad. Sometimes food is a bit greasy, but overall this place is a winner in my book!",

"reviewcomment":"Came here around 8ish on a Monday night for the All You Can Eat Wings and some soul food with my little family. <br>Once we arrived, the host said we can take a seat anywhere we liked. As we sat down, she gave the table another sprits to make sure the table is santized and clean. The waiteress then arrived to asked us what we liked to order. The menu was pretty simple and short. My husband did the all you can eat wings, and I did the &#34;2 meat combo&#34; with BBQ spare ribs and pulled Pork. The combo came with 2 sides, and I wanted Collard greens and Mac n&#39; Cheese with an EXTRA side of baked beans (I was hungry.. And ordering with my eyes haha). It also came with sliced pickles and corn bread. <br>As soon as we ordered,, she put it in right away and the food came out within 10 minutes!! Which is super fast. My plate looked full and I knew I was not able to finish it. There was only 3 spareribs, but they were pretty big.. I was only able to finish 2 ribs and had some of my sides and it filled me up!! <br>The Mac n cheese was a little on the dry side tho, so I might opt that out next time and choose something else. I loved the collard greens, and the baked beans had this sweet taste to it which is a plus! The corn bread was perfect and super soft. <br>The all you can eat wings were delicious! My husband was not able to go for another round once that first one came out. He liked 3 out of 4 flavors of the wings, so the waitress brought out 18 wings for the first round. It was a struggle because the wings were plumped!!! I think he would need to be SUPER starving in order to go for another round haha. <br><br>Overall:<br>Service was great and so was the food. The All you can eat wings are only on Monday nights from 5pm- Closing and it&#39;s $12 (not 8.99)!",

This was a fantastic meal and the waiter was exceptional.<br><br>The appetizers we had were the CONFIT PORK BELLY CORNDOG (so perfect!),  gumbo (mmmm) and CAROL SUE&#39;S PIMENTO CHEESE (I could have eaten 5 servings of this).  Thought we were going to be too full for the main course but that a wasn&#39;t the case because the main course was to die for.<br><br>I had the duck with a strawberry rhubarb compote which was ridiculously good. My husband had the rainbow trout which he said was excellent (I&#39;m not a fish fan).<br><br>Desserts were great too. I loved the strawberry rhubarb pie, my husband loved the brown butter pecan pie, and yes, we also got the Mississippi Mud pie since we figured what the hell and ordered all the options.<br><br>A totally gluttonous meal and worth every penny and the aches we experienced the next day from eating so much. <br><br>Can&#39;t wait to go back. Definitely a new favorite.",

If you&#39;re starting a diet, don&#39;t go because you&#39;ll want to go back all the time!<br><br>The Nutella crepes are delicious and their drinks too - frozen cappuccino and Nutella are great! I prefer the sweet ones to the savory crepes. <br><br>The staff are pretty offish, but the food makes up for it. It can get really busy and the place is a tight squeeze, so avoid busy times like brunch on the weekend.

Everything was superb!!<br><br>It was my first time at Ten Tables-cute cozy atmosphere. Decent street parking. The service was impeccable-truly a team atmosphere as everyone was helpful and friendly, not just our main server. We went for a Western France wine night and all the wines were superb. The pour was incredibly generous-pretty much a full glass each time and each wine very different than the previous one. <br><br>Food tasting was also incredibly delicious bringing out each unique flavor of the wine. We started with a salad with fluffy goat cheese an peppercorn, a dish with rabbit sausage (also surprisingly light and flavorful), duck belly, and finished with a generous portion of cheese and honey walnut cake. <br><br>Quality-every part of this experience and such an incredible deal!!<br><br>Will definitely do this again!",

From what I saw, the servers were really good about getting people their checks fast around that time. <br><br>The nachos were good, and came out within 10 minutes of ordering them. I got the chili loaded nachos in the 1/2 size which was enough for me and the bf to split as an app. The chips under all the toppings were uncheesed, which I thought was weird because everyone I&#39;ve talked to says they have more than one layer of toppings. Maybe that&#39;s just for the big order, or the cooks might have been slightly off their game considering it was hella busy when I went. Either way they were still above average nachos. <br><br>Combine that with the service and the tasty beer and I&#39;d say that rates a square 4 stars.",

"reviewcomment":"Absolutely amazing food, I take all of my out-of-towners here. I spend the day raving about the Italian explosion they&#39;re about to have and they&#39;re never disappointed. The prices are so much better than the restaurants in the area -- think $15-22 max! The portions are gigantic, I always find myself taking home extras so that I can unabashedly enjoy them for lunch the next day. <br><br>I always stay with the Baked Ziti (with fra diavlo sauce) but the boyfriend has tried almost all of the pasta dishes. His favorite has to be the Linguine Pescatore -- I even like it, and I hate seafood. I always caution to eat the amazing Calamari because it really fills you up. The pasta is perfection and every bite is like a taste bud party.<br><br>The wait is always an issue but we try to circumvent this by making reservations (Yelp is your friend), however, even with a reservation, expect to wait at most 15-20 minutes to sit down. (Without a reservation...expect to wait awhile.) The place is extremely small (homey), but everything is worth it! The service is always excellent. I tell everyone that my absolutely favorite Italian food place (in the world) is Panza. (And you can always stare at the hungry Giacomo line across the street over your steaming dish of Baked Ziti.)",

After asking some of my coworkers out here what is a good place to eat that&#39;s inexpensive with good beer I was sent here.<br><br>The food is delicious and portions are huge. I believe they have 30 something different beers on tap at very reasonable prices. And let me tell you about that beer punch. It was about $20 for a pitcher of beer/vodka/lemonade and it definitely packed a punch on all of us. <br><br>They have a very comfortable environment and the servers/hosts were very friendly.

Get a burger that looks good and try it on for size. Might not be your burger but it is a good one. I would suggest half fries/rings. They do take out, but the take out doesn&#39;t really hold up for the two blocks away my parents place is, so we usually have to sprint home. <br><br>There are people that come far and wide for these burgers, I&#39;ve sat next to people who drive in from Quincy.<br><br>Lastly, it&#39;s across from a Star so you could conceivably cross a couple of things off your list while you&#39;re at this spot. <br><br>Happy eating!",

"reviewcomment":"We were aiming for an evening in the South End for my birthday. The plan was a cocktail in one location followed by dinner somewhere else.  We walked into Union for cocktails and soon were marveling at the great aromas coming from the kitchen. The cocktails were all great. I personally tried the Dubbel Down (made with Allagash Dubbel) and El Diablo, which thanks to it being my birthday the barmaid gave me with a floating umbrella. Both were great. Our friend asked for a Kamikaze which not on the menu, she rated as perfect.  So after cocktails we strolled further along Washington Street hoping to have as much luck finding another place. But minimum waits were 45 mins, so we made the easy choice to return to Union.  Glad we did<br><br>The maître d&#39;e welcomed us back and immediately brought us to a great table from where we could see the whole restaurant. Brilliant! So to the food. Though the menu looks great the four of us opted for the prie fixe option. I had the mussel appetizer (small, sweet, well seasoned, great sauce) and sole in parchment ... A great way to serve this fish. Really simple yet maximum flavor from the fish. Thankfully we&#39;d asked for another cornbread so none of the juices from the fish escaped. Everyone loved their meals - my wife went with the beet salad and the gnocchi &amp; loved them both. <br><br>Everyone finished with the banana foster bread pudding. Let that sink in for a while. And know that it was as good as it sounds. What was fantastic was that at the end of this pretty decent sized meal, no one was stuffed. The waitress told us that the portions on the prix fixe menu were designed to ensure you could eat all 3 comfortably and she was spot on.<br><br>Service, from the door, to the bar, to the table was exemplary, friendly and really light hearted. We had a lot of fun, a great meal and a definite addition to the &#39;must return&#39; list.<br><br>Thanks folks",

"reviewcomment":"I walked by No. 9 Park every day during my undergrad years at Suffolk. Back then I never paid any mind to it. Lately, now 30+ and an appreciater of fine dining, I was really itching to go. Foodies friends of ours invited my husband and I to go - I was thrilled. We all partook in the prix fixe menu, also ordering two additional mains to share mid-course. The staff was happy to accommodate and provide recommendations. In fact, for my prix fixe main course I asked our server to have the chef surprise me with whatever vegetarian offering struck his fancy that evening. I was completely impressed when the dish arrived at the table - it was a tasting of 5 mini vegetarian dishes that were all unbelievably delicious. In fact, I think everyone at the table was jealous because there was a lot of ooohhing, ahhhing, and staring. I definitely got the best dish of the night!<br><br>The meal was meandering but perfectly so. The service was seamless and incredible. Prices were high but such a good value for the food, service, and ambiance. No. 9 Park is the real deal. I wouldn&#39;t come here every weekend or anything but this will definitely become our go-to place for a fancy night out or special occasion.",

"reviewcomment":"Lookin lookin lookin for something tasty tasty tasty. And here it is! Sitting right here in the Somerville area. A petite little restaurant sitting on an unassuming road of gas stations and residential spaces. It faces Prospect street so I&#39;ve undoubtedly driven by this place several times wondering what types of surprises are hidden within.<br><br>Sure they have the fancy lights as you drive by at night but isn&#39;t it what&#39;s on the inside that counts? If that&#39;s the case, this place counts... A LOT! As you&#39;ll soon notice that this is somewhat of a &#34;Sushi - Korean&#34; fusion. Let&#39;s not try to confuse our non-Asian friends by suggesting that sushi is a Korea food. You know the real reason why you&#39;re here... it&#39;s for the Korean food. It&#39;s for that stove in the middle of your table. It&#39;s for the bulgolgi that simmers in your presence.<br><br>They have a rather large menu of all your traditional meats. You don&#39;t have to eat off the stove. You can order off the menu from a list of premade foods including bulgolgi and bibimbap. I have not had a chance to experience that just yet but I will definitely the next time! We were feeling like using our hands was the best way to eat tonight so we opted for the actual bbq where they bring you out a plate of marinated meats and you have the fun of cooking it to your open specifications!<br><br>Bulgolgi, kalbi those are you what you need to order. They have different choices. It doesn&#39;t matter what you choose, you&#39;ll love it! I don&#39;t know what they put in that marinade but I swear there&#39;s a sprinkle of crack in it. The beef is tender and flavorful and even the onions that they come with are sweet and nonpungent.<br><br>Parking&#39;s a hassle and the food is a bit expensive, but hey, that&#39;s the price we pay for being foodies!",

The pasta is fresh and excellently prepared, perfectly cooked--I can&#39;t believe this is a chain. I had a ravioli dish with asparagus and a lemony cream sauce--fabulous! <br><br>I went to a benefit here a couple months earlier and there was a buffet set up for that. One of the best buffet&#39;s I&#39;ve ever attended--everything tasted fresh and delicious. The kitchen staff here really does a great job!<br><br>And of course the Tiramisu is awesome.

"reviewcomment":"For the service, giant size of portions, and general quality of food, Al Dente is a solid 4-star joint in the heart of the North End.<br><br>Came here on Memorial Day at prime dinnertime at 7:30p. We didn&#39;t have a reservation, but my party of 2 was seated within 20 minutes. The host first took our name down and as we waited outside, he kept updating us on the table situation and how much longer it would be, which I really appreciated. I&#39;ve found that many restaurants in the North End give the standard &#34;15-20 minute&#34; time estimate, regardless of how much time it will actually take to get a table. But not Al Dente. There is absolutely no room to wait inside the restaurant though, so we were thankful it was nice out.<br><br>We ordered the chicken marsala over fettucini and the cavatappi with vodka sauce. The vodka sauce was really tasty (much better than the kind that comes in a jar, for sure!) and the chicken was very moist in the marsala. My friend also had a healthy glass of wine which brought us to ~$25 each, tax/tip included. We each stuffed ourselves and still had half a meal&#39;s worth of leftovers. Definitely a steal for the North End.<br><br>However, there were a couple of strange things: the bread given in the beginning of the meal was a little old, and the wine we ordered was poured right in front of us from a pre-opened bottle. The place is also pretty tiny (and thus crowded). While the same waitress seemed to be working the entire restaurant and we couldn&#39;t always get her attention right away, she did remarkably well in checking in on us throughout our meal.<br><br>This is definitely a place where I would bring an old friend, as opposed to someone who I&#39;m really trying to impress.",

Its a small joint, on the water (in walking distance to the Harpoon Brewery), they have outside seating and inside seating. It&#39;s really nothing special, not fancy at all. The food is absolutely amazing, which is why I had to give 5 stars. Very fresh fish, the platters are delicious. The employees are a little crude, particularly the one girl that ringing us out but to their defense they were busy and she could have been overwhelmed. They also serve beer here too. But please note they do not accept American Express cards (kind of annoying). <br><br>If I am ever back in the Boston area, I will make sure to stop here again.",

I like to load my plates up with black beans too, for sure a great source of fiber. They have jalapenos and spicy sauces always which is awesome, definitely a great place to go if you like spicy food. Always fills me up, amazing post-gym meal.<br><br>The burritos are fantastic too, and quite large, especially the super. The tacos are phenomenal as a light snack, they definitely load them up.<br><br>Protip: if you show up close to closing time, then they will load you up more than usual, since they probably don&#39;t want to have too much leftover food.",

"reviewcomment":"Great Indian food if you order a la carte instead of the buffet. Not saying that the buffet is bad, it&#39;s just not super memorable. It&#39;s classic Indian buffet with chicken tandori, chicken tikka masala, that spinach puree thing, chutney and stuff, you get the idea.<br><br>The food a la carte is great. Got some garlic naan, can&#39;t go wrong with that here. Got some samosas which were steaming, fresh, and delicious. Got some lamb saag and chicken byriani I think, both come highly recommended by me.<br><br>Also not super pricy which is nice.",

"reviewcomment":"Ok, I&#39;ve been here twice now and feel I can appropriately say this is one of my favorite pizza places in life. (FYI close rivals would likely be Cheeseboard in Berkeley, CA and Lombardi&#39;s in New York) If you are a fan of thin crust pizza, you will not be disappointed. I&#39;ve only ever tried their salads and pizzas so can&#39;t say much about the other menu options. <br><br>My friend and I always do a Greek salad with a 1/2 and 1/2 pizza, and we always end up leaving 2-3 slices behind b/c we are so stuffed! I would highly recommend the Portabello with Truffle Oil (absolutely divine) and the Fig with Prosciutto. Have also tried the Spicy Chicken Sausage as well as the Shredded Chicken with Gruyere. Both are excellent choices if you&#39;re looking for something with a little more protein. The pizzas have a nice crispy crust, but are also piled with toppings. Don&#39;t expect a crispy flatbread-like pizza -- this is the real loaded deal!<br><br>The restaurant is very small with no reservations so make sure you get here early or go on a weekday. Service has always been very attentive, and I always love getting a glass (or two) of the Sangria or red wine. Perfect place to catch up with friends, and who doesn&#39;t love the cute Beacon Hill neighborhood? The delicious tiny garlic bread cubes they serve at the beginning is always a nice plus as well.<br><br>I will definitely be back so I can try alllll the flavors. Must eat them all!!",

"reviewcomment":"SO had previously tried getting in here on a Saturday night and found it to be uber popular and had a long wait. So tried again on a wet, Tuesday evening. No problem getting in, either a seat in the bar area while waiting for a friend, nor moving over to a table for dinner once he arrived.  The selections of beers is modest, certainly not a &#39;Sunset Grill&#39;. But what they have is high quality, a number of local, REALLY local, options and tasty.<br><br>For dinner we elected to go the route of poutine &amp; a series of small plates. We went for the &#39;Out of Control&#39; option - smothered in spicy (mild) lamb stew, cheese curds. Very tasty. Not as unctuous as some others I&#39;ve tried of late. But the most important base - the fries, were crispy and well up to absorbing the flavors of the toppings.  The small plates we then went thru were uniformly great - scotch egg (I swear my friends eyes rolled back in his head when he tried this), tuna tacos (GREAT flavors), spinach salad (waiter recommendation &amp; a perfect foil to the poutine) &amp; the arancini (when my eyes rolled back in my head). I&#39;d love to go back &amp; try the burgers but would happily continue to explore the small plates. We rounded the meal off with another beer vs. the one dessert offering that they have.<br><br>As a quiet mid week spot (I suspect the weather kept many folks in) this was a great location. Would be interested to have a meal here on a Saturday night and sample the atmosphere. The focus here seems to be small menu &amp; do everything well.  It works. Its moderately pricey but I&#39;d confirm that after this meal I was as sated as if I&#39;d eaten a 3 course dinner.  Service was timely &amp; unobtrusive once we got thru the meal - the assistance in ordering was spot on.<br><br>I do have to say that I was a touch nervous about this dinner. Friends had gone here the weekend before after hearing me talk about it and show them the place. They reported a very disappointing meal (fish of the day I guess was quite ordinary). Again expectations may not have been on the right level. I wouldn&#39;t come to The Gallows for a formal 3 course meal I&#39;d be honest. I&#39;d much rather do a smaller, less formally structured meal such as the one I had on this visit. Using something like the poutine or a burger as a central point and having small dish selections around it seems to fit The Gallows menu well.",

SO GOOD. <br><br>Just, eat here. Reasonably priced, good portions, SO delicious, friendly staff. I recommend delivery or to-go.",

"reviewcomment":"I have a tendency to hate a lot of Boston bars.... they&#39;re all normally such a scene, and cater to want to be rich folks. Full of drunken bro&#39;s and trashy girls. NOT Butkowski&#39;s. <br><br>Butkowskis is the best of the best in dive bars. My only complaint is it&#39;s busy on weekends, and I&#39;m a girl who likes to sit down while I have a beer. That&#39;s not even a complaint, because those nights are probably what keeps them open. Even still, a lot of Saturday nights my boyfriend and I are able to get stools at the bar. We generally have the same bartender, I wish I knew his name. He&#39;s there basically every Saturday night and he&#39;s a phenomenal bartender. He can be busy as hell, and we rarely have to wait long for our drinks. <br><br>This is hands down my favorite bar in Boston. The bartenders are good at their jobs but have the right amount of attitude. They&#39;re not over the top friendly obviously trying to get tips from you, but they are not the typical Boston rude and &#34;i can&#39;t believe I have to waste my time talking to you&#34; that some bartenders can be here. <br><br>They have good suggestions when you ask them what they like on tap, or when you give them a slight description of a type of beer you&#39;re shooting for. <br><br>They let you sample beers before you actually commit to one.<br><br>HOT DOGS WITH PEANUT BUTTER PICKLES AND BACON IS THE BEST INVENTION EVER!<br><br>The music doesn&#39;t suck. I was there last Sunday during the day, and they played The Clash for like an hour. It was awesome. A bar with good music in Boston is basically unheard of. <br><br>Long story short. I don&#39;t even want to recommend this place, because I don&#39;t want it to get all crowded and douschey. I have to recommend it though, because it truly is such a hidden gem and I absolutely love this place.",

"reviewcomment":"I&#39;ve been to this neighborhood gem a few times (only for dinner) now and have always had a pleasant experience. The restaurant, which is very small and narrow, is normally packed. You can hover by the bar while waiting for a table but you&#39;re inevitably in someone&#39;s way given the tight quarters. Service is efficient and friendly. The vibe is cozy and warm.<br><br>I always start with the dates. Just a small plate, but they&#39;re served with bacon and blue cheese and are delicious. I also recently had the duck sausage as a starter and found it to be a little dry. For my entree, my last time I ordered the scallop special. It was delicious. The scallops were perfectly cooked and served on a delicious puree. Highly recommend if they offer this again. I&#39;ve also had the bolognese which while good, was nothing remarkable. My friend insisted we also split the mac and cheese (it supposedly has quite the reputation). I would not recommend ordering this as an entree. The portion is large and the dish is so heavy. It had too much truffle oil, and I was fully satisfied after about three bites.<br><br>The beer/wine/liquor selection is great. Full bar, with lots of cool drinks. Overall, this is a really tasty neighborhood spot and perhaps the best in Coolidge Corner. Experiment with the dishes, as some definitely stand out above the rest.",

He brought our beers right away and was super attentive. I ordered the crab cakes and they were freakin delicious. Also their French fries were big and awesome.

"reviewcomment":"Okay, so I don&#39;t really love this place, but it&#39;s conveniently located, and their menu is well labeled for the gluten-free crowd (me!). I went to meet a few friends after work at an odd hour recently (3:30, 4:00) and though we only had snacks, the service was unbeatable. I ordered the nachos, and they had several different things: one had a Ceasar salad, the other had three different side dishes. My nachos are always good, thus I always get them. <br><br>My friend asked if she should complain about her &#34;old-tasting quinoa,&#34; and though we tried to tell her that there were polite ways and rude ways to complain about something, she chose the rude way. &#34;Has it been sitting in the back all day?,&#34; she asked. &#34;This tastes really old.&#34; <br><br>It was an awkward experience, because the server was clearly uncomfortable. My friend tried to make it less uncomfortable by saying she just wanted to let them know because she had been a server before. Minutes later, the manager came out and asked if we wanted dessert-- and my friend said she wasn&#39;t interested. He then said it was on the house and asked if anyone had allergies. He brought dessert out, which my other friend really enjoyed.<br><br>They didn&#39;t charge my bratty friend for her meal, and I left so damn embarrassed for all of us. It sucks.",

Our sakes came out very quick and the food was not far behind. I ordered the  shrimp lemongrass soba noodles which was pretty good but needed a fair helping of soy sauce to liven up the flavor. My fiancé ordered the shrimp firecracker which was awesome. It was very spicey with some scary red chilis and also sweet at the same time.  It got to the point that it was kind of unfair how delicious the flavor was but how much the spice built up over time to an uncomfortable mouth on fire scenario. <br><br>It was the perfect amount of food considering we were looking for something light, but if we had been hungrier we would have needed an appetizer.  And for the casual quick atmosphere, the price was a little steep. <br><br>Given similar circumstances, I would definitely come back here again.",

"reviewcomment":"Came in on a Monday night and it was fairly crowded, but we were able to sit down right away. It&#39;s a classy joint and the drink menu was pages bigger than the actual menu, which is always fun. The lighting was a little too dim for my taste, but it may have just been where we were sitting (my uncle had to pull out his phone&#39;s flashlight on account of his older eyesight). Very neat and clean and classy.<br><br>Everything on the menu sounded delicious, there&#39;s definitely a creative chef in the kitchen. After debating back and forth, I ended up ordering the k.f.c.g.h. (I think that&#39;s what it was called) and it was amazing. The cornish hen was moist and crispy, definitely my favorite part of the dish. The jalepeno mashed potatoes were also delish, just enough of a kick to be enjoyable but not enough to hurt. The Mac and cheese seemed a little random though, kind of wish they had put a veggie there instead. It was delicious, but didn&#39;t really mesh with the other two.<br><br>My aunt enjoyed their thin crust pizza, my uncle said the hanger steak was delish, and my sister enjoyed the chicken and salad. Not many dessert options, but we didn&#39;t mind.<br><br>Overall, everything was absolutely delicious and the place was a very nice spot. I especially liked the beer tap chandelier near the front door. Definitely would recommend it to others!",

"reviewcomment":"I had dinner for the second time at Oishii just last week, and it was truly one of the best dining experiences I have had to date. Both times I&#39;ve been to Oishii have been fantastic, really. Considering the quality of the food and the experience overall, I feel this is one of the most worthwhile places to have a special meal in Boston. The only downside is that afterwards, &#34;normal&#34; sushi just can&#39;t compare...<br><br>For starters, the Salmon on Fire is spectacular purely on presentation, but it is also tasty, perfect if you enjoy salmon sashimi. This time around it was overshadowed slightly by the other appetizers we enjoyed, the Blood Orange Hamachi (yellowtail on top of blood orange sauce, w/candied orange peel, wasabi ponzu) and the Winter Salmon Sashimi (salmon, crispy shallots, sizzling olive oil, soy yuzu zest). I highly recommend the Winter Salmon Sashimi -- there is amazing flavor bundled in from the mixing of the zest and olive oil, and wrapping some of the fresh greens around the slightly warm salmon was incredible. <br><br>For rolls, the Seared Hamachi Truffle Maki (shrimp tempura, spicy mayo, cucumber, topped w/truffle and caviar) was particularly memorable last time. This time, however, the clear winner was the Crispy Salmon (crispy tempura flakes, spicy mayo, tobiko and avocado topped w/salmon and menegi). It now takes the place of best roll I have ever had -- the filling has this great mix of crispiness from the tempura and smoothness from avocado, with an indescribable depth to the overall flavor. I would also recommend The Shrimp Explosion (rock shrimp tempura and avocado rolled in white seaweed w/brown rice chips and Ting&#39;s wasabi flavored lemony sauce) for fans of shrimp. The shrimp tempura is much better than the typical shrimp tempura, with just a little bit of breading and perfectly cooked shrimp that retain their moisture. <br><br>A note about the service: if you don&#39;t know what to order, definitely ask your waiter/waitress for advice! I really loved the waitress who was helping us out, as she offered some great, detailed advice and was genuinely knowledgeable and excited about giving recommendations.<br><br>I definitely recommend sitting at the bar and watching the chefs at work assembling the rolls!<br><br>A final note about cost: the above three appetizers and two rolls were together ~$180 (tax/tip included). For three people with average appetites, it was perfectly satisfying (we also received a complimentary half-roll of Toro Gunkan).",

"reviewcomment":"I&#39;ll admit it, I used to be a Clover non-believer. I used to think that this was just a place for picky eaters and elitists who want overpriced organic food and fancy sodas. There&#39;s already enough elitism in Cambridge, and I wasn&#39;t excited about yet another business that was promoting that culture.<br><br>Slowly but surely though, Clover has won over my heart. The chickpea fritter is fantastic as everybody says, but I think the brussel sprout sandwich is really what sold me. Filled with tender brussels, cabbage, shredded carrots, and peanuts, it really is a one of a kind pita sandwich. Recently when I was there, sipping my fancy Vanilla soda (also delicious), I thought, &#34;if this is what the new fast food revolution is, then I&#39;m very excited to be a part of it.&#34;<br><br>It&#39;s quick, it&#39;s much healthier than any other fast food joint in Harvard Square (or Cambridge, for that matter), and it&#39;s affordable on a student budget. It serves up delicious food, and just so happens to be vegetarian. I also like how they market themselves as a &#34;lab&#34; - constantly trying new dishes out on the customer to see what sticks. I&#39;ve had the pleasure of meeting the owner who is super down-to-earth and has an infectious love for the craft of making healthy fast food.<br><br>Very happy this place exists in Boston, and would always recommend it to locals as well as people from out of town.",

At Legal Test Kitchen, they serve this same crab cake (I asked to make sure) on an open faced sandwich with a fried egg on top--I love when things are served with an egg on top! It sits on a slightly toasted bun and is surrounded by various greens and asparagus and pancetta and the salad is dressed lightly with lemon. (I asked for the lemon aioli on the side). Two thumbs up for a new take on my Legal go-to dish!<br><br>The staff were friendly and helpful and we had such a lovely Mother&#39;s Day lunch here.

"reviewcomment":"With such a large (and growing) number of vegan restaurants in the Boston area, the challenge these days is to find time to patronize them all, which a very nice complaint to have. Add to this the fact that we like to cook, and the result is that time goes by and we realize it&#39;s been awhile since we&#39;ve visited our old favorites. Which is how we wound up with a ginormous quantity of takeout from Grasshopper last night, when my partner stopped to get ice cream at FoMu (also excellent and highly recommended) and decided to bring home dinner as well.<br><br>And we were all happy he did, because it was really great. There are five people in our house (including three perpetually hungry young men), so we erred on the side of excess and ordered the sweet &amp; sour sensation (basically the no name with tofu vs. gluten), seitan with ginger and scallions, sautéed kale with black mushrooms, chow foon noodles with veggies, and the grasshopper supreme (eggplant, asparagus, spinach, and mushrooms in chili-basil sauce); entrees also come with steamed brown rice. Everything was delicious, and the portions were huge - enough for dinner that night and the next - and the whole business came to under $60. On the whole, after a longish hiatus I can still recommend Grasshopper enthusiastically, and it definitely won&#39;t be as long between visits next time.",

"reviewcomment":"Two words: lobster tail ... you won&#39;t be disappointed!<br><br>Caffe Vittoria is well-known for being the first Italian caffe in Boston. I was visiting from LA, and was very impressed. They have four levels within two main areas for seating: the smaller one by the main entrance, and a larger spot in the back which is reserved for when they have more patrons. <br><br>It&#39;s the area in the back that truly gives this place the &#34;old world charm&#34; with a unique set of decorations and wall paintings. Though they had the room locked, we asked nicely and the owner was kind enough to allow us in - he even took pictures for us! The whole place has a vintage look and a very friendly vibe. <br><br>We tried the lobster tail, their famous cappuccino, and even though it was freezing cold outside, I could not pass-up their gelato. Everything was great, and I highly recommend this place. Good luck finding parking tough - we just happened to be lucky that night and found a spot right  in front.",

"reviewcomment":"From the moment we walked in I could tell we picked the right place. The ambience of this restaurant is elegant and inviting. From the lighting to the decor it&#39;s simplistic but upscale details are perfect. <br><br>We started with the fettuccine appetizer. It was decadent. The pasta was cooked perfectly and the buttery sauce was filled with mushrooms and truffles that made every creamy bite better than the last. <br><br>My husband and I both ordered the chicken entree. The portion was large and came with 4 pieces of chicken. The skin was crunchy and the meat was hot and moist. The sides of whipped mashed potatoes and peas were also exceptional. <br><br>We didn&#39;t have any room left in our stomachs for dessert but judging from what we saw on other people&#39;s table that looked great as well. Also forgot to mention they have a bar with a fantastic wine list. <br><br>Our service was perfect and I would recommend this restaurant to anyone looking to have a fantastic Italian dinner in the Back Bay Area.",

"reviewcomment":"What is there to say other than... eh. I work in the Pru so this is a super convenient lunch spot for me that is typically pretty quick - they get you in and out in a timely manner. Our server, Ben, was great. He was quick to approach the table and often checked in to see how we were doing. <br><br>My friend and I both ordered burgers - both Medium Rare. The burgers appeared to be more on the medium side, but as long as they&#39;re not an overdone brick then I&#39;m okay with it. My friend got the Original burger which came with a heaping glop of rosemary aioli. The amount of sauce that was on the burger was gross. Really gross. But easily removed which doesn&#39;t make it too terribly offensive. <br><br>I had the avocado ranch burger which came with the perfect portion of avocado and just a hint of ranch - great in my books! As mentioned, I ordered my burger medium rare, but it appeared to be more on the medium side. The burger was okay and the sweet potato fries were really hot and crispy - yum! <br><br>The only thing that annoyed me was the server that appeared at our table when my friend was struggling with the ketchup. It wasn&#39;t our server, but the man found it would be helpful to teach her how to correctly pour ketchup from the bottle. I get it. It&#39;s a kind gesture. But this guy would not go away. And after going on his rant about how to correctly pour ketchup out of the bottle he appeared yet again with another method. Ugh. <br><br>Overall, the experience was okay. Nothing to run home and tell Mom about, but since this place is just so convenient to where I work it will always be taken into consideration for a lunch spot with friends or colleagues. Would I go out of my way to go here? No. There are other burger joints and even pubs in town that have much better burgers than what was served.",

Otherwise, the food was good. I like how the restaurant accommodated those with dietary restrictions. A huge plus for me since I&#39;m a pescatarian. <br><br>I had the following three course meal: <br>- Salad - Salad came with berries, bleu cheese, almonds, and raspberry vinaigrette. This came with duck prosciutto, but I asked for it to be removed.<br><br>- Salmon with brussels sprouts, cauliflower puree, and bacon and maple vinegar. Salmon was cooked perfectly since I requested it to be on the rarer side. Plus, the vinegar did not have the bacon. <br><br>- Creme brulee with a chocolate chip cookie - Wow. This was a huge portion but really good. I liked how it was paired with a chocolate chip cookie too.",

I ordered the beet salad, which was delicious with fresh goat cheese, the pork medallions with the pears and mashed potatoes/cabbage, and the cardamom ice cream.

"reviewcomment":"This place was a pleasant surprise for me. I went with a group of 7 people on a Saturday night. The restaurant was busy, but not overly crowded. The menu is part French part Cambodian. Rather than mixing the cuisines, the menu seemed to clearly delineate the plates from each region. Our tables was downstairs, and the vibe below deck was much clubier/swankier than above. <br><br>To start, I had the Soupe Phnom-Penh, which had noodles, pork, sprouts, and scallions. Salty and delicious, but not the most original dish in the world. That said, a few friends also ordered soup and mine looked the best. For my main, I ordered the Avocat Kanthor, which the waiter recommended. It was a smaller salad and was a little light on the greens, but the mix of raw tuna and avocado in the middle more than made up for it. Overall very tasty, but I&#39;d recommend ordering this as an appetizer because the portion size is rather small. <br><br>The waiter was friendly and attentive. The place had a fun atmosphere. We were able to get a reservation for a large party on a Saturday night with minimal advance notice. Definitely recommend this place.",

"reviewcomment":"I&#39;m giving a 4 out of 5 because of the service.  Even though the staff is very friendly it seems that some pairings haven&#39;t been thought out. A cheese board with meat should be accompanied by ample portions of bread. Instead,  we were given 4 slices for a group of 5, and left waiting for more bread constantly. Also, given how salty some meat can be,  I feel that a pitcher of water would be needed, or larger glasses, or faster service. <br><br>Food wise: everything is of top quality!  Amazing meat, very nicely sliced, excellent selection. <br><br>Drinks: best bloody Mary&#39;s in town!  I&#39;ve had it multiple times and it never fails to impress. <br><br>Overall, try and go at non peak hours to enjoy the best service possible.",

"reviewcomment":"Delicately fried Arincini with molten cheese spilling out of the middle. The most tender homemade pasta with a fruit-nutty-herby pesto and perfectly al-dente peas. Olive oil cake that was soft and fluffy on the inside but perfectly crispy on the outside.<br><br>But the best thing we ate was the fiddlehead ferns, delivered in a perfectly prepared chili-lime-fish sauce sauce, tasting all wild yet sophisticated, and looking like the head of an organism from outer space.<br><br>The place was dark and brick and very urban without trying too hard or stressing too much. Simple and classic rather than sleek and contemporary, well-appointed but not trendy. And the music! They played a The Bird and the Bee cover of Hall &amp; Oats, and at least two Black Keys songs. It was like they picked an 18-month period that spanned 2007-2008 and played only music that came out during that span that Pitchfork gave 7.3 or higher. I was into it.<br><br>The service was really nice: our server was warm and attentive, but unpretentious and seemed genuinely excited about the food. Unlike many restaurants, I actually felt welcome here, and we enjoyed taking our time on the small plates and enjoying the ambiance. And we walked right in on a Tuesday without a reservation and were seated instantly. Nobody who arrived after us at 8:00 waited at all.<br><br>The crowd was a little weird, but maybe it was just me. There were couples actively fighting and not talking to each other, awkward second dates, and a few too many suits for my liking. But nobody bothered us, so we were ok.<br><br>Overall, very high marks. I never seem to say this about nicer restaurants in Boston - but I&#39;ll certainly be back.",

The place was packed on a Friday night but we were seated quickly having had made a reservation earlier in the week. The staff served our drinks and a out of this world vegetable soup sample. We ordered quite a lot, tandoori chicken, chicken binyani, poori, garlic naan, garlic beef,  and meat samosa. It was all fantastic. The portions are generous, the food was hot, and we loved our dinner. <br><br>My *only* complaint is the service can be a little bit slow. I only saw a few wait staff, so I&#39;m going to chalk it up to a busy night at a popular restaurant. It&#39;s a great place, a little bit pricey, but in my opinion well worth the cash.",

Things may have changed since then so please take note of other more recent reviewers.<br><br>- - -<br><br>This used to be my go-to Vietnamese restaurant when I was living in Boston. I&#39;d trek through hail and snow for their pho! It was that good. They make perfectly seasoned ox tail soups for their bowls of pho and their portions are more than generous. In fact, I realized that their portions were so generous, you could easily double your pho meal by ordering an extra side of noodles (which were only $2 when I used to frequent this place). For $2 extra, you could get two bowls of pho instead of one. That&#39;s pretty darn fantastic, if you ask me! :)<br><br>Everything they make is fresh, clean, and well-seasoned. I definitely think this place ranks as one of the most authentic Vietnamese restaurants in Boston and a must see if you&#39;re ever in town!<br><br>Food: 5/5 -- delicious and authentic!<br>Service: 5/5 -- attentive and accomodating<br>Atmosphere: 3/5 -- decent, clean, spacious, but nothing remarkable<br><br>Overall: 5/5 -- exceptional!",

The almond-fig bisteeya, the bistock, &amp; the sesame caramel roll stand out among the baked goods.<br><br>The turkish breakfast is a must-share tour of well cooked Middle Eastern inspired specialties. <br><br>The sahlep, an orchid root drink, and the sharbot, a natural soda of sorts, are both delightful and worth a try if unfamiliar. <br><br>There are a few things a little lackluster about this place... Every now and then I get a dish that doesn&#39;t quite click, often they are super crowded without a place to sit (i try to go in more off-times), and their counter-service delivery can be lacking.  Often I have found myself waiting for a long time for my food, only to look at the counter and see that it had been delivered without a call, and there it sits, cold. <br><br>However, these little short comings pale in comparison to this plane-based heritage whole foods journey across the fertile crescent.",

"reviewcomment":"I went here with two friends about two weeks ago for Dine Out Boston, and I loved it.<br><br>The service is impeccable. Our waiter was GREAT. He was very attentive, funny, engaging and knowledgeable (Not that it matters, but he was also super cute hehe) <br><br>We started with the Pate of Rabbit and the Venison Loin on the Dine Out Boston menu, but we also added some mussels off the regular menu. The mussels and loin were great, but my fav was the rabbit. <br><br>For our mains, we shared the Asian Spiced Duck Breast and the Pork Three Ways from the Dine Out Boston menu and added the Lamb Osso Buco. Everything was pure heaven. <br><br>The drinks were top-notch as well. I can&#39;t recall the name, but I had a spicy gin martini, per our waiter&#39;s suggestion, that was everything I wanted in a drink. <br><br>Also, the music playlist was so much fun. Michael Jackson came on and even the waiters couldn&#39;t stop themselves from dancing. It was such a great vibe. <br><br>At the end of our mains, they surprised our table with some chocolate fondue and fruit, and it was the perfect end to the night. We were all 100% satisfied. <br><br>Living about a 10 minute walk from Temple Bar, I know I will be back very soon. :)",

"reviewcomment":"My friend and I sat at the bar, so I don&#39;t have much of a review for service (we were catching up and watching the Bruins game so if anything took longer than expected, I didn&#39;t notice). <br><br>Atmosphere: 5 stars! I love how it is completely open to the seaport, but still provides the safety from unpredictable northeastern weather. I also love the set up and decor. Definitely could be a nice date spot.<br><br>Food: Overall, I thought the food was very good. My friend and I split the lobster guacamole and short rib tamale. I like that they gave us a good amount of chips - it really bugs me when you order a $$ guacamole and have to keep asking for more chips. If you love lobster and love guacamole you can&#39;t go wrong. The food wasn&#39;t amazing my any means, but good size portions for what you spend. I do think they should sell the tacos separate instead of requiring an entire entree size. I now live in DC and that&#39;s how every taco-selling restaurant I have been to does things down there. No one really wants to eat rice and beans when you&#39;re out for a drink and need just a little solid food in your stomach...<br><br>Drinks: Good - not amazing. I had the Besos. It wasn&#39;t too sweet and I love basil in my cocktails, but it had too much crushed ice.",

"reviewcomment":"Great find in Boston - it&#39;s a chain so I will preface with that, in the fact that I rarely visit or rate chains with 4-5 stars but Hillstone deserves it. I have visited them in multiple states and have never been let down. I wish there were 1/2 stars because I would absolutely give out 4.5, but I am a little stingy with my 5&#39;s.<br><br>Service is always excellent, decor is impeccable, bar area is always busy with a fun vibe and the dining rooms are dim &amp; sultry. I love their steak with a good glass of wine or champagne - it&#39;s definitely my idea of a perfect dinner. The husband has tried their ribs, fish &amp; burgers all of which he really enjoyed. <br><br>The portions are large, so you can easily enjoy some apps and share an entree (which they happily split for a minimal charge) and have a little room for something sweet. <br><br>I personally suggest sitting at the bar, or outside if possible. Those are the best seats in the house for people watching, fast service and ambiance. <br><br>Definitely a go-to spot when we are staying downtown or in Cambridge.",

Interesting crowd, fun and down to earth staff, and solid food.<br><br>My Nina Panina was awesome: lots of fresh mozzarella, lots of delicious basil, and thank god it wasn&#39;t drowned in balsamic. They serve the sandwich on sourdough, which was a neat twist that really works. Boyfriend reports the cheeseburger (local grassfed beef!) was very satisfying.<br><br>The peach blossom drink they were serving was likewise awesome: very refreshing, made with tequila, peach schnapps, and lime. I was a bit afraid it would be a sugary mess,  but the tequila gives it nice smokiness, and they add grapefruit juice so it&#39;s a tart, tangy drink great for warmer weather. Nice selection of local &amp; not-so-local beers, too.<br><br>I was concerned we wouldn&#39;t be able to grab dinner because they were having a show, but it was no problem. Will definitely be back!",

Hands down! And for that price.. it&#39;s just crazy silly stupid awesome! Grilled sword fish, grilled lamp chop kale salad, pan seared strip bass, seared fresh big scallops, and the list goes on.. (if you don&#39;t like raw kale this place will convert you!)<br><br>(note: the typical burger, sammie, etc.. are as expected. so ORDER from the special menu). <br><br>The draft beers are awesome.

We had 4 of us we all got something to try and share, hands down I did not eat ANYTHING that was not great. Their veal marsala with homemade pasta, so so so good! Server was great he was this fun cranky Bostonian and I loved it! He was very dry but very funny! We got salad&#39;s and alcohol and spent $70 bucks! Best money, worth the money WELL WORTH the tiny space and noise.... Oh I cannot WAIT to come back.",

"reviewcomment":"In the words of my friend, this is absolutely a brilliant bar!<br><br>The place isn&#39;t very big, but is very popular.  My friends kept telling me to try this place, and I&#39;m glad that I did!<br><br>I walked in and greeted my friends who introduced me to the owner, Mickey.  He was really nice and when it got really busy, he jumped in and helped out at the bar.  It&#39;s great that the owner cares enough about the place to pitch in and help work it himself.  This place may look fancy, but it&#39;s very casual and very warm and &#34;homey&#34; for lack of a better adjective.<br><br>Being an Irish pub, the highlight is Guinness of course.  Unfortunately, my body rejects Guinness like a bad organ transplant, so next time, I&#39;ll have the Magners Irish cider.  Or maybe I can break my body in with copious amounts of Guinness. They have pretty much everything so if you like cheap beer like PBR or something, they have it too!<br><br>You can&#39;t go wrong with the food here.  If you don&#39;t believe me, have a seat at the bar.  The smell coming from the kitchen is enough to make you want to order EVERYTHING.<br><br>My friends all reccommended the Druid Burger.  They told me that it would be the best burger that I&#39;ve ever tasted.  I was a bit skeptical, but ordered it anyway.  I couldn&#39;t have been more wrong in my life.  It was indeed the best burger I&#39;ve ever tasted.  I asked for it rare.  The burger was juicy and flavorful, and the charred bits added a lot of flavor.  The fries are hand cut rosemary fries that seemed mealy at first, but when dipped in the burger juices, it was delicious.  They even have a wide array of sauces such as malt vinegar or something called &#34;brown sauce&#34; which is British.<br><br>The fish and chips smelled very good, but I didn&#39;t want another entree, so I opted for the fried calamari.  It was delicious!  The breading was delicious, and the warm marinara sauce was very good.  It even included fried rings of hot peppers like jalapenos if you want to add a kick.<br><br>One of my friends got the fish (cod) sandwich and liked it.  My other friend let me try a bite of her Irish Beef Stew.  It was delicious.  I&#39;m definitely trying that next time!",

"reviewcomment":"Came for restaurant week.<br><br>Food: We got fish tacos and shrimp tempura (they were out of crab dumplings :( ). The fish tacos were okay, not very flavorful but the shrimp tempura was great and there were a ton of shrimp in it! I then got the kiss of fire which was amazing. Perfect heat level. My friend got the back bay which came with gold flakes. She also thought it was great. For desert we had banana spring rolls which were really good, but needed more chocolate and could have been smaller--maybe cut the banana in half long ways so it&#39;s not so thick?<br><br>Drinks: They have a drink special until april which is a great deal because 2 of the drinks are half price, and the drinks are very different from one another. I had something with blackberry which was great and the other drink was very sweet.<br><br>Service: Our drinks came quite late because the bartender had run out of paper. I have two problems with this excuse: (1) what was he doing in the meantime when no orders were coming in--did he think no one was drinking? (2) why didn&#39;t our server check? our aps came out before drinks. After that she was on top of everything though. <br><br>A bit dark inside, so I guess it&#39;s romantic for a date and we saw a lot going on.",

But I&#39;ve never visited better buffet. The food is medium spicy.<br><br>Other friend ordered lamb tikka masala and nun bread. To me, I would prefer lunch buffet.

"reviewcomment":"If you are not aware this place is right on the pier where the fish is brought back to the warehouse. Rad location. This place is nothing fancy, you should base your review as an overall out of 5 for what the place is, and what they advertise themselves to be. Being on the pier the fish is obviously some of the freshest fish you will eat in your life. <br><br>We sat by the window. Rad building nearing a hundred years, well built which is something I dig. Watched fishermen getting back from their shift throw scrapes to seagulls. Being from the the Rocky&#39;s that alone was worth the seat.<br><br>The fish could have been from a few hours old, to at most a couple days. Fantastic! The scallops are like candy. I got the assorted fried plate. If I return there while I am in Boston, which is likely, I will get a broiled plate to avoid the inevitable nap afterwards (errr maybe that was more the red eye plane ride?) Huge portions. I enjoyed the pickled relish that came with it. Some might prefer tarter, so request that. <br><br>Received a 4 because I did think it was a little expensive for what I received. Although the seafood was more fresh that anything in town, you are paying for the location. Which is a pretty rad spot honestly. I&#39;m kind &#34;snob&#34;, shop at Whole Food&#39;s, try to eat the most natural food I can when I can and this was not that. But it obviously was a diner, and I knew that before I arrived. I went because of where it is and how fresh the fish was. Life is too short to not put aside your ideals from time-to-time, especially on vacation.<br><br>If you are from out of town, especially inland like me, I highly suggest coming here if it is not too far out of your way. The view, fresh fish, and rad old building alone is worth the stop. Cheers!",

We have so many great choices from the high end, Rivera, to the ubiquitous taco carts, and everything in between- most all very good.<br><br>The chips, salsa, guacamole, and fish tacos were all very, very good. Surprised the heck out of me!<br><br>Service was spotty and the kitchen wasn&#39;t great at delivering pieces of the meal in a timely manner, but this is still a great spot for a west coaster looking for a decent Mexican food fix after being satiated with great pizza, Italian, fried clams and lobster in Boston.",

"reviewcomment":"I know I left a subpar review for the Harvard location. But ever since I started working in Back Bay, Fire + Ice has been really useful in terms of providing another healthy lunch option in the area. <br><br>It&#39;s reasonably cheap - slightly under $10 for lunch before tip, which includes a decent salad bar. The stir fry section has plenty of lean protein (chicken, steak, fish, and calamari), a wide variety of fresh veggies, healthy seasoning options (spices + fresh herbs), and brown rice. <br><br>No, it&#39;s not gourmet food that will dazzle your tastebuds, but it&#39;s a decent option if you want to get some extra veggies into your diet or plenty of lean protein that&#39;ll keep you full till dinnertime.<br><br>It&#39;s also pretty quick for a sit-down meal - I was in and out within 40 minutes for weekday lunch. I think it would also be great for a group lunch with coworkers, especially for groups that include picky eaters or vegetarians (they will cook vegetarians&#39; plates on a separate grill at the back that doesn&#39;t touch meat).",

"reviewcomment":"In a restaurant industry saturated with overwhelmingly long menus a la Cheesecake Factory, Coda&#39;s menu is refreshingly short, featuring just nine items. Each of the nine entrees sounds delicious - so delicious that when I was at Coda last week, I had difficulty deciding on which dish to order. I ended up going with the bacon cheddar burger (cooked medium), &amp; it was the best burger that I have had in a long time. The burger was juicy &amp; flavorful, without being excessively greasy. The hand-cut fries that came with the burger were also quite tasty.<br><br>In addition to tasty food, Coda has a modern, cozy decor, &amp; the service is friendly &amp; fairly quick. <br><br>Tidbits:<br>-I arrived at Coda around 5:30 on a Friday night, &amp; the place was not too crowded. When I left about an hour later, however, the restaurant had started to fill up. So, if you plan on stopping by Coda for dinner during the weekend, I recommend arriving between 5:30 &amp; 6:00 to ensure that you get a table.",

"reviewcomment":"5 points for many reasons. I am very hard to please with,when it comes to food. I wanted to try this restaurant since we moved to Cambridge and finally we got chance. Trust me, I did good and repent for not trying before.<br><br>1. They gave complimentary soup as a starter - which was very good.<br><br>2. Chai and appetizer were good. I loved the chutneys they provided with the appetizer, specially the spicy onion one.<br><br>3. We ordered Dal Makhni, Kundan Kaliya and Tandoori Chicken Kebab and Sheermal for dinner. Everything were perfect - taste, color, spice level. Food were warm, hot(as i wanted) and very much authentic. <br>Tandoori Chicken came with two sauces and salad - which was finger licking good. <br><br>4. Quantity was enough for both of us - we got a lot to go.<br><br>5. Staffs were very friendly and specially loved that at the end of the meal they gave hot towels to wipe the hands.<br><br>6. Worth paying money for warm quality and quantity food. <br><br>Kebab place is the best dine out indian restaurant in Boston, I have been so far - I would love to be there again. I should tell that, I ate so much that I felt I become whale after my meal - so it explains how much I loved the place.",

You&#39;ll find sushi, maki, and sashimi variations, plus tempura, meats cooked on a robatayaki grill, and a nice selection of hot and cold appetizers. <br><br>I was hoping that they had nigori sake but they had hard cider (my usual drink of choice) so I was happy.  I ordered the steamed buns (bao) with braised pork belly and the ramen kurobuta soup.  Bao are not really Japanese but again, we&#39;re talking fusion cuisine.<br><br>Service was quick and efficient and the bao came out hot and fresh from the steamer.  The bao were presented in a stacked double mini bamboo steamer, each one holding a hot soft bao bun filled with a nice chunk of delicious, tender teriyaki-glazed pork belly, crispy cucumber and greens.  The ramen kurobuta soup had the same pork belly, tender and succulent in a delicious broth filled with vegetables and perfectly cooked ramen noodles.  <br><br>There was plenty of food there and I am a hearty eater of good food - I didn&#39;t quite finish the ramen...<br><br>For a quick, delicious Asian-fusion  lunch right on Boylston Street in Boston, I think Basho hits the mark.",

We also got the poached egg on top of polenta (I think) with veggies, and also the endive salad (this was only &#34;eh&#34;). For entrees, we split the branzino (white fish with peppers and cous cous) and the tuna. The tuna was good, but not terribly exciting, but the white fish was marvelous. <br>The bread was delicious, and the rhubarb shortcake we got for dessert was perfection. I also thought that the service was excellent... friendly but not at all invasive. The atmosphere was cozy and cool, and also classy. <br>I will definitely be back.",

"reviewcomment":"I wasn&#39;t expecting much when I walked in, but everything was actually pretty good!<br><br>When you walk in, they have two separate stations to order, so you everything moves along quickly even when it&#39;s kind of busy. They have your normal Mexican dishes (tacos, quesadillas, burritos, etc.) and meats (steak, chicken, carnitas, etc.) nothing you haven&#39;t seen if you&#39;ve stepped into a Chipotle in the past 5 years.  They have a normal and super variety of all their items, and super will cost you about a dollar more but it feels like twice the size. <br><br>Obviously, because I am SO MANLY I went with the super-sized grilled chicken burrito, and... I could not finish it. It was massive and just packed with rice, beans, cheese, and meat. My main gripe, and the reason why the rating isn&#39;t higher, is that the burrito was folded like a damn pamphlet rather than how a burrito should be folded. I had to eat it with a fork and a knife, and no burrito should ever have to be eaten like that. It brought a single tear to my eye to have to eat it like that. Everything tasted really good, but unfortunately I had to eat it like a burrito bowl, and that was lame. <br><br>All in all, this place is really good and a nice alternative to Chipotle&#39;s cilanto-infused er&#39;thang. They just really need to work their burrito folding.",

They have Bantam cider :-) Which i the best!  We were seated within 10 minutes of coming which was great.  The hake dish was DELICIOUS and I highly recommend; also the oysters and side kale was to die for!  Great choices for people who don&#39;t want a pig roast at 45 dollar per person.<br><br>I will say this though: me and my girlfriend felt totally kicked out of our booth: the waitress asked constantly if we had paid and checked in on us but not in the attentive way but more the &#34;are you fucking done...&#34; way... so I would say in the future do not seat 2 people at a booth made for 6 if you are going to be pushy and ask us to get out<br><br>Otherwise, excellent and I HIGHLY recommend!

"reviewcomment":"THE GOOD: My god, the food here was excellent! We initially visited mostly because it was a tourist attraction and iconic. But I&#39;m so glad we ordered some food too! My fish &amp; chips and clam chowder was excellent. The clam chowder had tons of clams, very creamy and tasty but not too heavy. The fish and chips were fresh and the batter was fluffy without being too oily. We also ordered a salad which was also good. The vege burger was a little underwhelming though. <br><br>THE BAD: Service was a bit slow but it was busy so they really can&#39;t be faulted. <br><br>OVERALL: It was a great meal. Of course, the decor matched the TV show so that was a plus too. Definitely worth a second visit!",

"reviewcomment":"Why such poor reviews?  I think Met is a great place to go for dinner and drinks, or just drinks.  There seems to be a shortage of places in between sports bar and fancy $$$ in Back Bay, so I&#39;m pleased to have it so close to home.<br><br>I&#39;ve had a variety of dishes from burgers to brussel sprouts to brunch.  I will say that it&#39;s consistent.  Decent selection of craft beers. Even a gluten free menu.  It&#39;s not my favorite restaurant or anything, but it gets the job done.  <br><br>I think the burgers are better than most that I&#39;ve tried around here.  The truffle fries don&#39;t even have truffle oil though. It doesn&#39;t make sense.  You dip them in a truffle mayo.  They should call them fries with truffle mayo.  I don&#39;t even like mayo, so I&#39;m not sure why I was eating it. Maybe it said aioli and tricked me.  Still not the same as real truffle fries. I still keep coming back though! So overall good, but I have to keep in mind that I&#39;ve probably been spoiled by places like Hoppdoddy (Dallas &amp; Austin) so my judgment is skewed.",

"reviewcomment":"The food was excellent, the restaurant is odd. <br><br>First the odd: each table had a battery-operated votive candle sitting atop a card advertising other businesses owned by the restaurant. If it&#39;s an upscale restaurant the votive needs to be real or be gone and the crazy advertisement has to go. I don&#39;t give a damn about your other businesses while I&#39;m considering which wine to order. <br><br>The food rescued a star for the review from the silly candle/ad--mostly. The bread with roasted garlic, olive oil and white bean purée was great and we had a zucchini, roasted pepper and ricotta app that was perfect.  Entrees were seafood risotto that was the special which was filled with flavor and fresh seafood and perfectly cooked risotto and a pasta &#34;drum&#34; filled with pasta in an amazing meat sauce floating with two tasty meatballs in a tomato sauce that was absolutely to die for. That dish lost some points though..the garnish was three sticks of uncooked spaghetti and a basil leaf. The presentation looked good but they may as well have used wooden skewers--totally inedible garnish should be tossed into the same place as the stupid ads under the fake candles.",

They also don&#39;t skimp on the fixings for the dipping sauce. <br>-The house broth here is the best one out of all three places listed above. <br>-I also love that their super tasty fish paste isn&#39;t brimming with cilantro and that it&#39;s self-serve - in most shabu places, waitresses do the fish paste for you and drop huge pieces into the broth all at once, resulting in them never cooking through. <br><br>One thing I found odd was that gratuity (about 18%) was already included in the bill, even though I was having dinner by myself. But the credit card bill sheet had a tip line as well as suggested gratuity amounts. So just be on the lookout for that.",

"reviewcomment":"The gal pals and I came in on a Tuesday night after half of Waltham lost power, along with our chosen restaurant. It was obvious that we crossed city lines when the entire place was packed (on a weekday?!) Nevertheless, the host said it would be no more than 15-20 minutes, and made good on it.<br><br>What a surprise it was when we were presented with a menu that rivals the length of the Cheesecake Factory. We started with the inventive cran-crab rangoon and I followed up with Tom Yum which was a touch heavy on the lemongrass. We&#39;re talking big bits. The gals were set on sushi but I decided on pork Rad Nah, and what a stunner she was. The fusion shined on this dish with the clover honey, and the bit of fairy tale sushi I tried was good, even if not at all evocative of a frog prince.<br><br>We collectively enjoyed the meal, but that menu was far too extensive to glean out on the spur of the moment. Good food on par with other Central Sq. spots and probably a good place for a swanky first date, or so I overheard...",

"reviewcomment":"Andala is one of my favorite places to study in Cambridge. The Kufta is amazing -- the first time I tried it (Sept &#39;13), I had to come back the next day to have it again. Pine nuts on rice, steamed and fresh tomatoes side by side, and very tender lamb make for an excellent dish. <br><br>I&#39;m also a fan of their fresh squeezed juices. Just had the carrot juice today and it was very fresh. Don&#39;t recommend the mint smoothie -- it was largely pieces of mint leaf on ice. Another must-have is the rice pudding. It&#39;s covered in shaved coconut, coconut milk and spices that make it taste remarkably different from usual bland rice pudding.<br><br>Not a fan of the service. The key is to go to the bar and chase down a server rather than wait for them to come to you. Today I saw the table next to me wait half an hour for the menu; trying to pay is nearly impossible if you wait for the service staff. Just go to the bar directly. It&#39;s a shame the service is so bad, because the food is so good.",

"reviewcomment":"Among the seemingly endless pizza and pasta-promoting Italian eateries in the North End, Taranta offers something delectably different. Combining Italian and Peruvian flavors, this spot is a truly a unique dining experience in a pretty package.<br><br>Salud! The drinks are definitely South American in nature, as many contain fruity elements of passion fruit as well as the Peruvian liquor of choice, pisco. I opted for the Cholopolitan, a sweet, fruity mix of juices, citrus, and pisco which was delicious and deceptively strong (as our helpful waiter was sure to mention upon bringing them).<br><br>As for entrees, I opted for the Macadamia-crusted salmon, which was served over a risotto cake along with a berry sauce, fusing the traditional Italian rice staple with tropical elements. The salmon had a unique crunch to it, and the sweet, slightly acidic sauce added an interesting twist to the fish. <br><br>The standout dish on our table was definitely the lamb gnocchi, however. The gnocchi was prepared with yucca instead of the usual potato, which led to a tender, somewhat chewy consistency. This was ideal for absorbing the absolutely phenomenal sauce and tender pieces of lamb in the ragu. The menu claimed it was a spicy dish, which I disagree with in terms of heat, but it definitely did not disappoint in terms of spices, as it boasted an outstanding flavor complexity. The texture of the entire dish was on point, and I found myself sneaking bites off my friend&#39;s plate all night.<br><br>Let&#39;s culminate this cultural culinary combo with something sweet! I wanted something warm so was eyeing the chocolate souffle. However, our waiter steered us toward the Lucumisu (lacuma tiramisu) and the Guavannolis (guava and ricotta-stuffed cannolis with pistachios). These desserts combined traditionally Italian pastries with Peruvian ingredients. Both had outstanding flavor, and I enjoyed that they were fruity but not overpoweringly so. Although neither dessert was warm, a decaf cappuccino with milk poured in right at the table warmed me up and was the ideal accompaniment.<br><br>Taranta isn&#39;t the cheapest option, but considering the location, experience, and flavors, I&#39;d feel much better about shelling out dough here (and not of the pizza variety). Luckily I came with work so didn&#39;t need to pay myself, but I would definitely return for a special occasion or to impress someone who thinks they&#39;ve tried it all. Spread the word... Italruvian/Perulian cuisine should definitely be a thing!",

"reviewcomment":"I&#39;ve been to Orinoco so many times at this point that I could tell you my favorites by heart - and they are very near and dear to my heart. The maracuchitos (cheese-filled plantains) and datiles (bacon-wrapped dates) are stellar appetizers. The pernil arepa is my go-to when I&#39;m not too hungry (or getting full from aforementioned appetizers). Otherwise, the pabellon criollo is great for a simple, hearty meal - especially if you ask for a side of their homemade guacamole!<br><br>The vibe is also quintessential South End (read: great for date night). Orinoco is in an intimate corner location with just a few candlelit tables.<br><br>If you&#39;re coming to the South End location, be prepared for a wait. Pro-tip: Orinoco also does some semblance of call-ahead reservations. They&#39;ll call you back when your table is ready, and hold it for 10 minutes or so if you&#39;re nearby.",

"reviewcomment":"What a treat. This place met all my expectations and then some. I read that Stoddard&#39;s was a must for beer enthusiasts and people who like a variety of good craft beer. It offered that plus a great drink selection and a tavern/speakeasy upscale atmosphere. I dig it.<br>As a Chicago native, I was happy to see Local Option&#39;s Morning Wood on draft. I knew it would have good stuff to drink. The bar was packed, so while the drafts were all treated equally for an old-timey vibe (no special, unique tappers), it would&#39;ve really helped to have the actual brewery-distributed tapper, just so I could see some of my options. Because as we all know, not all beers are created equal.<br>I started with the fried goat cheese salad and had the duo of duck entree. Salad = stupendous. Then again, fried goat cheese on a bed of spinach greens always is. Maybe I had a lot to drink too. There was a huge loud annoying guy at the table next to us that clearly wanted everyone in the basement of the restaurant to hear about his recent trek to Hollywood, so I tried to drown him out by focusing on chugging booze and rereading the menu/history of the place a thousand more times. Thank god for the duo of duck...I was finally able to forget about this Kevin Smith-like turd and bask in the glory of this meal. SO GOOD. I was laughing because it was such an unforgettable meal. My husband was laughing at me, but not in quite the mood of ecstasy I was, because A: his Ballotine of Rabbit was clearly not as mind-blowing as my duck meal, and B: because of that, he still could not get over how much of a *explicitive* the loud gelatinous man was. I took a few bites of his meal. It was good. Not as good as mine. I&#39;d be slightly put off if I were him too.<br>I recommend this place. There was one heck of a wait, but we were able to make a 6:30pm reservation on Open Table around 4pm. For ambiance, great food and great drink, I wouldn&#39;t pass this place up.",

"reviewcomment":"I&#39;m not generally crazy about Italian food.  I think this is mostly because pasta is one of the cheapest foods to make for oneself, and yet in restaurants the prices can go sky high.  I was with my manfriend&#39;s preggo cus who was craving a big bowl of pasta, so I threw out this place as a possibility on a pro-tip I&#39;d received from a friend once - he&#39;d claimed this place rivaled the best of the north end, and I figured this was the time to prove him right or wrong.<br><br>We went at 5:30p on a Monday, so we were maybe the second group to the restaurant - no wait at all, and lots of attention from Guy, our waiter and immediate Italian father figure.  He sassed us a bit (I asked if the tortellini was cheese and when he brought it out he told me it was meat tortellini, just like I wanted), he complimented the cousin on her burgeoning belly, but then told manfriend and I why we should never have children, and proceeded to whip out a photo on his flip-phone of his favorite child, a fluffy pup in pink.<br><br>They were prompt and friendly, the food was insanely good and each meal easily two meals&#39; worth - I got the pesto tortellini, manfriend got the gnocchi with chicken/capers/mushrooms etc, and while I enjoyed both of those very much, I think his cousin&#39;s eggplant parmesan was my favorite of the bunch.  Not too saucy, not too greasy, the gnocchi was appropriately fluffy, the eggplant cheese was appropriately bubbled, and the tortellini had just the right amount of chew.<br><br>Next time I&#39;m in the mood for Italian, Carlo&#39;s - I&#39;m in.  Just make sure you seat me at Guy&#39;s table again, and I&#39;ll make sure to come at some ungodly early hour so I won&#39;t complain about a wait.  <br><br>Deal?  Deal.",

"reviewcomment":"I did not know there is such a good Italian restaurant outside of North End. I came here on a Friday night with a reservation in case there was a full house. I think it&#39;s possible to come without a reservation if you are willing to sit at the bar.<br><br>I was super hungry that night and tried 4 of their pastas. I tried the rigatoni, gnocchi, conchiglie, and aborio. My favorites were the conchiglie and aborio. The aborio is a risotto with wild mushrooms, parmesan, truffle oil. You can&#39;t go wrong with anything that has truffle! The dish was very rich and earthy. The risotto was al dente. The conchiglie was also really good. The sauce for the pasta was very buttery.<br><br>My least favorite was the gnocchi. The presentation was nice, but it was kind of bland. It is good for someone who is looking for something light to eat. I also had the meatball for appetizer. The meatball was too bread-y and mushy for me. There was not enough texture. <br><br>The server was very nice. However, when we first ordered our drinks, we waited for what seemed like hours... I was starting to wonder if they were trying to make the wines fresh in the kitchen. I will definitely come back again if I ever crave their conchiglie!",

"reviewcomment":"How do they make a flank steak taste like sirloin? Dish was fabulous, service is impeccable. The mixed drinks are good too. The 3 course meal is the best deal. Parking is next door. Definitely recommend!!<br><br>We did the three course pre fixe - best deal. I had the best salad I ever had in my life. Roasted Golden Beets, Flank Steak, White Chocolate Cheesecake. All great.<br><br>Only issue, sorry to say.. is the Swordfish. It was overcooked, dry, but I definitely understand how keeping this plate warm can do so. Overall great experience definitely will come back.",

The scallion pancakes are yummy too-- though my hands are completely soaked in oil after eating these. The food is really nothing too outstanding-- it&#39;s pretty standard, but like I said, the place is always POPPIN&#39; and you are sure to run into people here.

"reviewcomment":"I was visiting Boston. My college classmate lived there and it had been six years since we last saw each other (on her wedding). She suggested Legal Seafood and it was convenient to us too ( &#34;us&#34; meaning me and my two cousins). <br><br>My husband used to go to college in Boston and he said Legal seafood had the best clam chowder if things hadn&#39;t changed a lot since he left (which had been more than a decade). Anyway, I don&#39;t know if I would say it was the best, but it was pretty close. <br><br>We ordered some raw oysters and little necks. I basically don&#39;t like raw stuff so I didn&#39;t try them. But the comments from the rest of the group were positive. I don&#39;t remember everything we ordered but everything was good enough to go back for. The food wasn&#39;t phenomenal but the average quality was good. The ingredients were very fresh and that is like the most important thing for seafood.<br><br>In conclusion even though it is a chain it&#39;s a good chain and worth trying.",

"reviewcomment":"The funky interior and soft lighting make this a great spot for couples, but the lively atmosphere also is great for groups of family or friends (maybe not for a business meeting). The menu features mostly small bites broken into three categories (tacos, a la plancha, and small bites) with only about 4 entree options.<br>Three of us dined here and decided to go for round after round (after round after round) of nibbles. It was fantastic. the fried Manchago was to die for, the pork belly plancha was melt in your mouth and the seafood tacos were other worldly. We tried about 18 plates (pigs we were!) and all were good or above (not everything is a hit).<br>Cocktails were OK, with the blood orange margarita winning us over (pitcher 36 bucks give you 5 pours)<br>Service was a bit much...the server only had one or two tables and kinda hovered around us too much. I like an attentive server, but one who is standing next to me for 1/3 of the meal is a bit much.<br>The only down side is that it adds up, and quickly. figure $100 per head to nibble and sip like we did...then add the tip.",

"reviewcomment":"Came with a large group of friends on a random Thurs night and we were seated promptly. Since we were a large party 4-5 people used one pot to cook, but that was fun. We went with a miso soup base and a regular soup base. This place is pretty big so I think they can accommodate large parties easily.<br><br>I ordered the beef and seafood combo and it was a lot of food! It was fun teaching some of my non-Asian friends how to cook hot pot and watch them eat. <br><br>They had ponzu sauce, satay sauce, chopped green onions, chopped garlic, and  chopped chili peppers for your sauce. It def helped gave the meat some extra taste. The soup base were a little bland, but the other pot ordered a spicy thai base and that was really good. I think the portion for the combo was just right, but some of the guys said they still felt hungry after we finished all the food. <br><br>The veggie plate was ok... felt like it could have used a tad more veggies. The amount of seafood and meat was perfect tho. And I got some noodles that I cooked at the very end. Very satisfying! <br><br>They also have a red bean soup as dessert and that was pretty delicious! Oh, and they had fresh watermelon juice and that was really refreshing too!",

They are mostly a take-out type place - the atmosphere is not particularly romantic. But the food more than makes up for it. I had some dish of crispy jumbo shrimp in an orange sauce. Oh. my. SO GOOD. <br><br>Just, eat here. Reasonably priced, good portions, SO delicious, friendly staff. I recommend delivery or to-go.",

"reviewcomment":"I just moved to JP, and Canary Square was the first restaurant we went out to.  We met another couple, and all of us loved it.  The drink list- from beer to wine to cocktails, is truly exciting, and not just because there was a fluffy rabbit beer (not made of fluffy rabbits to be clear).  The waitress was knowledgable of all drinks, and when my indecisiveness took over as it usually does, she brought me a little glass to taste, without even having to ask her!  Super nice. I don&#39;t remember which beers we got, which is a sure sign of good beer, but all 4 of us got a new beer each time and there were no complaints. <br><br>The food...so good.  The mussels in chorizo...I want more. We ate every bite, which was sopped up with delicious free bread. We also got deviled eggs, which has spicy mustard, and were pretty fancy.  Also ordered, shared, and devoured were pork tacos, seared tuna, mac and cheese w/ truffle oil and mac and cheese with bacon.  <br><br>#bangin.<br><br>Cant wait to go back and enjoy the drinks/food/atmosphere in the sunshine on the patio!!",

"reviewcomment":"I have no idea what they put in these burgers but they are quite simply amazing. I got a cheeseburger. For under $5 I wasn&#39;t expecting much but the burger was ready quickly. The lettuce was fresh and crispy, the beef patty was freshly made, not from a frozen patty. The tomato was thickly cut and wasn&#39;t an end piece. Their buns are homemade and grilled with butter and some sort of spice that added quite a bit to the flavor of the burger. <br>Seating was fairly limited. There were maybe 10 tables upstairs, one on the main level and some seats in front facing out the window. There are a few more tables outside. Prices are very reasonable. My two teenage boys and I were able to eat and get drinks for under $25 and were all quite full when we left. <br>Overall a great little burger place unlike any other I have ever encountered.",

They are mostly a take-out type place - the atmosphere is not particularly romantic. But the food more than makes up for it. I had some dish of crispy jumbo shrimp in an orange sauce. Oh. my. SO GOOD. <br><br>Just, eat here. Reasonably priced, good portions, SO delicious, friendly staff. I recommend delivery or to-go.",

"reviewcomment":"I am starting with dessert because a dessert here has made my top 10 list... and I couldn&#39;t believe it as it did NOT involve chocolate. I got the floating island as I was curious because of the name, and the waiter told us it sells out quickly every night. I got the second to last one. Now, I have never ever liked meringue. I dislike it very much, but figured I would try it at a french place. My god. The first bite was heaven. Melt in your mouth goodness. I am not ashamed to say I ate the entire thing. It was far to good to leave on my plate and very light for a dessert. Perfect ending to a perfect meal. <br><br>I had oysters for starter, not the best I ever had.. but clean, fresh, cold and the martini was delicious that I ordered with it. <br><br>For dinner I had the duck confit that everyone is raving about on this page. You all were right. It was perfectly cooked duck and the flavor they brought out with the light sauce was outstanding. I had to keep giving my husband bites to continue to agree with me how good it was. <br><br>The staff was very friendly, atmosphere pretty. I would have liked tables for seats to be a little closer. I felt like my hubs was miles away. Get some romantic tables for two added :)",

"reviewcomment":"Great patio seating especially on a nice sunny day for lunch!<br><br>Went here on the suggestion of a coworker.  I will say if you don&#39;t have &#34;your spot&#34; in the North End it can be a bit overwhelming trying to find a nice place.  <br><br>Well this is one I would suggest.  <br>We started with an appetizer of fried calamari.  While we waited for that we munched on the amazing bread and oil.  Simple, but fresh.  Nothing worse than old bread at an Italian joint.  NOT the case here. <br><br>The fried calamari... Amazing.  I could have had a plate of that on my own for my meal.  We are self proclaimed calamari connoisseurs, purely off of the fact I have had so many that are gross and unappealing.  This was lightly fried to the point when you stab them with a fork the batter flakes off... Perfection.  And, they know how to season their food.  So tired of bland food from restaurants.  And the sauce was so good I asked for more bread and dipped that in there too. <br><br>I ordered the salmon and zucchini with pasta and a white sauce.  Good...  The salmon pieces were small and the sauce was a little under seasoned but it was good.  <br><br>My coworker got the Pollo Lemón. It looked great, I do wish I had given that a shot, but it was just chicken no broccoli or spinach which would have been nice.  I think it was actually supposed to have pasta, but he choose not to so that could have evened it out a bit.  <br><br>Over all a great spot...  Now just to go back and have some drinks as well when I&#39;m not working.  <br><br>Try it out and you won&#39;t regret it!<br>Good luck foodies!",

My only tiff was the souffle, but it&#39;s probably because I can&#39;t handle too much chocolate. Chocolate-good, chocolate on top of chocolate, smothered in chocolate with a side of chocolate-not my cup of tea. Although the souffle wasn&#39;t that, that&#39;s how it felt to me. <br><br>But that was too much complaining. Just come here! Well, save some money and then come here!",

The Crazy Roll was worth the trip on it&#39;s on, and the Chicken Satay and Golden Egg Bag were also noteworthy! <br><br>Made a reservation for 8:30 on a Friday night and this place was completely empty--lucky us! The waitstaff was friendly, and because they were empty it was like we have 3 personal servers. <br><br>The decor was up to par with most Thai restaurants, but certainly not overly fancy. The pricing for 3 appetizers and 2 Entrees was just over $60--my wallet thanked me. <br><br>The only reason this place did not get 5/5 stats is because of the 2 fruit flies that seemed reluctant to leave our table. My girlfriend also became stuffed up towards the end of the night, what we think was a result of too much dust. Nevertheless we will return for the Crazy Roll and Egg Bags, either for done in or take out!",

I brought out-of-town friends here on a rainy spring Saturday, and the view of JFK Street through the floor-to-ceiling windows is unparalleled. <br><br>I had a generously sized grilled chicken sandwich and roasted potatoes that was tasty and not too expensive, my friend had one of the flatbreads (can&#39;t remember which one-- I think it had the Vermont cheddar) and raved about it, and her boyfriend liked the burger he ordered as well. Service was great. There was some employee there that had no clear job; my friend and I hypothesized that he was hired to just walk around and look attractive.  Uh, ok, works for me.<br><br>I&#39;m not nuts about the layout/vibe-- shorter tables and chairs with backs would be much appreciated. The aluminum barstools and open layout make it less of a place I&#39;d like to linger and more of a place I&#39;d come to when I know I can&#39;t stay long.",

"reviewcomment":"Why I&#39;ll go back:  Mexican food that stands out as being high quality, authentic, and meticulously prepared.<br>You HAVE to order:  The chilapitas - a complex combination of plantains, pulled pork, and several toppings that add flavor and zest to this app<br>Tony&#39;s Tip:  Between the music and chatter from other diners, it can get loud in there.  If that&#39;s not your thing, try going for lunch or on the early side of dinner.<br><br>Zocalo is my go-to Mexican restaurant in Boston.  Yes - better than Temazcal, better than Papagayo, better than Casa Romero.  There&#39;s a plethora of choices across the salad, appetiizer, small plate, and entree sections of the menu.  And the guacamole is the best I&#39;ve had in the city - it is prepared with a little more lime juice than is typical, which enhances the inherent blandness of avocados.  Service is competent and friendly.  Getting a table as a walk-in is hit or miss, so I&#39;d suggest making a reservation just to be safe.",

We opted for a bunch of shrimp tacos (some of the best I&#39;ve had in recent memory) and a quesdilla, if my memory serves me right and everything was right on the money. Plus, we called in the order, it was ready in 10 minutes, I walked a few blocks, they rang me up lickity split and before I knew it, I was back on my couch, crushing beers, eating way above average Mexican food and losing brain cells watching really bad reality TV.<br><br>Uh, definitely check this place out if you&#39;re crushing beers and get hungry!",

Particularly the upstairs of the restaurant, with it&#39;s high ceilings, all wood interior, and design, makes you feel instantly relaxed. <br><br>The prices are quite high for the menu offerings, which is why I am not giving this place a fifth star. The best thing on the menu is the lentil soup, which I usually have accompanied with a peasant salad. I always feel healthy when stopping by here to meet a friend. It&#39;s also a great place for just a kettle of tea. The mint is my favorite. <br><br>I must say though, the falafel leaves something to be desired.

Came in a few weeks ago to celebrate my cousins graduation and I was impressed to say the least. <br><br>Yea, this place is small, but the food, the FOOD. It was nice to have something different for a change. Same good we&#39;d get at other places, but a difference flavor, a good flavor! Loved everything from the fish, to the salt and pepper pork, to the the fried rice and they even had my favorite dessert soup, tapioca soup with taro AND sweet potato.<br><br>Service was also really great that night, refreshing compared to the lack luster service at most of the chinatown restaurants. Our waitress was efficient and knew how we rolled. Consolidate plates when possible and don&#39;t mix wet with dry foods (our family is a bit OCD when it comes to this, haha)<br><br>Definitely will be asking for family dinners to be here more often!",

"reviewcomment":"I&#39;ve been craving hot &amp; sour soup for days, but was leery about venturing out and getting some since most of my Boston adventures in Asian food have been disappointing. I ended up ordering hot &amp; sour soup and pork eggplant on grubhub from Golden Temple around 11:15 am on Sunday. Not expecting it until closer to 1 I was pleasantly surprised and a little flustered when the delivery guy buzzed me at 11:50!<br><br>The hot &amp; sour soup was definitely darker and thicker than what I&#39;m used to in my hometown (Honolulu), but was hot &amp; sour and hit the spot. The pork eggplant was pretty also not the best I&#39;ve ever had - the pork had crunchy bits and there were red bell peppers in it - but the sauce was good and the scallions added a nice flavor.<br><br>Overall, it was A-OK with an added star for prompt delivery on a cold, January morning in Boston and the super nice delivery guy who actually APOLOGIZED for being early (no need to apologize! I was just surprised!).",

"reviewcomment":"After coming here on a tuesday night a few months ago and having an awesome experience, I decided to bring my entire family and a couple of friends. We were a party of 8 on a Saturday night, which I was pretty weary of. I called 1 hour ahead, and shortly after 6pm we were seated. <br>We had a few starters  (Scallion pancake and the Tuna, which were both yummy) and then we dug into some Hot Pot! It was so delicious and savory, we probably ate for an hour straight... Tons of veggies, Udon noodles  and fish galore. It was delicious!<br>To top it all off, we had told the waiter in secret that it was our friend&#39;s birthday, so after he cleared the table, the waiter brought her a huge piece of chocolate cake topper with a lit roman candle! It was so awesome and we were so thankful that he took such good care of our table. <br><br>I would recommend this to anyone who has never tried Hot Pot before, it is not only a fun experience but a delicious one at that.",

"reviewcomment":"Definitely the most fun place to go in the area (not including Fenway itself). No cover unlike every other bar on the street. Fun early and fun late, just go.<br><br>Top Tips:<br><br>- As soon as you walk in the door, put your name down for a ping pong table and a billiards table. The wait for these is long and one of them always seems to get locked down by at least a few crews that don&#39;t want to leave. Hedge your bets and set yourself up with both. (Bowling doesn&#39;t apply, there are always spare lanes.)<br><br>- The arcade games take credit card, so don&#39;t sweat it if you don&#39;t have change. No surcharge either for using your card instead of cash.<br><br>- PBR Tallboys are $3.75 every night so save your hard earned money and drink like the child that you are.",

"reviewcomment":"There are several options in Boston for Tapas nowadays but I have to say this one has to take top honors. This looks to be one of the more popular options and was jam packed on a Sunday night. Sitting on Beacon in Brookline, the outside of the place looks like it is one of the trendiest spots on this street filled with restaurants. Large inside, with really cool tastefully done designs with dark wood and very large with a bar side and a deep dining room side and even an outside patio on both sides. The staff here is quick on their feet and we were seated right away. If you do not make a reservation here, you might be left standing outside with wait times up to two hours on weekends. This is a very lively and loud place and looks like it is always busy with several large groups in attendance.<br><br>Menu offerings are some very creative cocktails, lots of various beers and a very vast wine list and of course lots and lots of tasty Sangria. The Tapas listings are of course several meats, cheeses and salads and seafood in smaller portions. We opted for the hanger steak, potato tortilla, mushrooms with balsamic, meatballs and mini grill cheeses. From start to finish every bite was delicious and tasted absolutely fantastic! Cooked to perfection with some interesting sauces and even the bread and olive oil was done beautifully. Service to start was a bit slow to start, however very friendly, helpful and ended very well. Even the dessert here, two crepes stuffed with dolce de leche and vanilla ice cream drizzled with chocolate sauce and the churros with dark chocolate sauce to dip was unreal. Plus the prices are modest for the food ordered. Excellent meal and will surely return!",

They are mostly a take-out type place - the atmosphere is not particularly romantic. But the food more than makes up for it. I had some dish of crispy jumbo shrimp in an orange sauce. Oh. my. SO GOOD. <br><br>Just, eat here. Reasonably priced, good portions, SO delicious, friendly staff. I recommend delivery or to-go.",

"reviewcomment":"Went there for dinner on Wednesday, and the place was surprisingly crowded for a weeknight (make reservation if possible).<br><br>Food was well prepared, with plenty of flavor. As far as I understand, menu changes regularly depending on availability of seafood. I decided to try tasting menu with wine pairing, which consisted of ceviche, shrimp dish and fluke. All three courses were great, and wine pairings worked well with the food. My wife ordered spicy lobster taco as an appetizer, and that was the only average dish; while it had plenty of lobster, it lacked spice and flavor. Her main course, catfish dish was also excellent. <br><br>Service and ambiance were also great, and we liked that tables have appropriate spacing between them (while many restaurants in Brookline and Boston pushing tables closer and closer...). Also, everything on the menu is reasonably prices, so the bill will not surprise you.<br><br>Great restaurant, happy with my dining experience there.",

"reviewcomment":"Punjab is probably the best Indian in the Arlington Center area.  Lately, it has become my goto place for takeout after a late-night class as Tufts or just when there&#39;s no energy to cook.  I&#39;ve tried several selections from each of the menu&#39;s main sections, i.e. Hot Appetizers, Cold Appetizers, Classic Curries, Favorites, Tandoori, Biryani, and Vegetarian.  Part of this sampling was deliberate and part was involuntary as about 50% of the time, what I&#39;ve ordered is not what&#39;s in the bag.  So you could, as I often do, view this as a blessing in disguise, an opportunity to sample some dishes you normally wouldn&#39;t think to try.  It&#39;s only a real drag when a selection is completely omitted and not substituted for another. I will say that the folks at Punjab always make amends, giving the desired selection without a fuss plus a few extras for the inconvenience of having to return (which sometimes is the next day for me!).<br>A few comments on the food are in order.  Nearly all selections are excellent with my favorites being: Homestyle Chicken Curry, Tandoori Chicken, Shrimp Biryani, Rogan Josh, Aloo Gobhi, and Saag Paneer. What doesn&#39;t work so well are the Tandoori Lamb or Biryani Lamb which is consistently and completely overcooked to a withering end.  Bainghan Bhartha seems overly oily.<br><br>All in all my favorite Indian place north of Desi Dhaba in Central Sq.",

"reviewcomment":"We were looking for something different in the city (and outskirts!) of Boston that would really titillate our tastebuds. A coworker that worked with the boyfriend suggested that we try this place. Actually.... I think she suggested the grasshopper tacos but we shied away from that (even thought they reportedly taste like shrimp... and I like shrimp... in fact I ordered a shrimp entree!). <br><br>The food here is supposedly &#34;real&#34; Mexican food. I&#39;d believe it. This was definitely not your tex mex at your local taco bell. We started off the night with a plate of mixed tamales. Awesome... there were both sweet and savory with different types of ingredients tied neatly into little pouches like they were gifts for us. <br><br>Our entrees included a shrimp (sorry don&#39;t remember the name and it&#39;s not listed on their online menu!) dish that was covered in a green peppery, lemony sauce with a deliciously seasoned rice and bistec borracha which was steak in a beautiful marinade/sauce. Have you seen walking dead? What am I saying, of course you have. Well when I started tasting the food, I felt my primal instincts taking over and I just wanted all that food in my mouth... kinda like those hangry dead.<br><br>Now that your appetite is ruined after I mentioned zombies, we went onto dessert. The meals were a perfect size not making you overly full but not leaving you dissatisfied (although I wouldn&#39;t have minded being overly full). We decided to give dessert a try and on the menu the avocado cheesecake looked like something that wanted to get devoured. It&#39;s a dessert that wasn&#39;t overly sweet but you can definitely taste the avocado and definitely taste the cheesecake ;)<br><br>Parking&#39;s kind a @#$%. I am surprised at how few people there were at this restaurant. I invite you all to go. This place is a MUST if you&#39;re in the area.",

"reviewcomment":"I went to Thailand 2 years ago and came back with such strong Thai food cravings all the time! There are a handful of good Thai restaurants that I frequent, but I really wanted to seek out that one super authentic hole in the wall that would remind me of the Thai street food that we had (while probably not the best idea at the time, luckily all of our stomachs survived). <br><br>Found S&amp;I on Yelp and was amazed by all of its reviews of authenticity. Tried them, and they really are all that jazz. While it&#39;s super hard to veer away from the typical pad thai or pad see you (because they&#39;re freakin delish!), you really should. I totally recommend trying something different from the &#34;Authentic&#34; part of the menu. I did today, and am blown away. Don&#39;t even remember the name of what I ordered (I&#39;ll update this when I do, but it was the last dish from the Authentic column). It was a flat noodle soup with pork blood, liver and intestines. The soup is savory, with a slight tang to it. It also has tofu and these deep fried pieces of skin that are so so yums. I typically really enjoy (read: LOVE OMG freakin love) pork blood from Vietnamese cuisine, and I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s the difference in cuisine or not, but my one small gripe is that the texture of the pork blood is not good to me/what I&#39;m used to.",

Would def come back here; good vibe + fun for a stress free friday night at a local spot that is on par with all the other places in the south that are always packed on the weekends!",

My fiance and I went on a pretty mild April evening on his birthday weekend, and we got to catch the bagpipe player playing on the street and in the restaurant. It&#39;s really fun to see bagpipes in a non-funeral or memorial setting as dark as that might sound. The Scotch egg was so... so good, and the fish supper was perfect. The potato fries are very thick.<br><br>I look forward to coming back here again for a few pints and more savory, filling good. Good energy, and very friendly, attentive service.

The pizza is proper thin crust that still holds it&#39;s shape when you pick it up. The garlic bread sides are warm, cheesy and hearty. My go to is the Bolognese with homemade fusilli. The meat sauce perfectly coats every strand if the pasta, and after having homemade pasta it&#39;s so hard to go back to dry pasta! <br><br>The place is small so it could get crowded during dinner hours. Luckily they do takeouts. Also prepare to have lots of leftovers for the next day as the portion is huge! The only way I ever finished anything here is by sharing an entree with someone else. And even then I had to stuff myself.<br><br>The only downside of this place is it does not do delivery, and in cold winters I often dream about the place 10 mins down the road yet just did not have the courage to go out.

Also apparently Ho Chi Minh worked here, Malcolm X was a once a busboy, Charles Dickens stayed 2 weeks here, and JFK proposed to Jackie O here.  Lots of history!!  The decor is the classic dark wood interior where I can imagine back in the day, men smoked their fancy cigars and discussed philosophies of life.",

Best food in boston, no? But I&#39;d put the food at around 3.7-4 depending on the night. For me, thats pretty good for a random night at a place thats quite reasonably priced and I am veerrry snobby about my food (I admit this is a shortcoming but just giving you a reference point).<br>There is almost always some space here so I don&#39;t have to deal with these ridiculous 2 hour waits Boston restaurants all seem to have.  <br>Its a sophisticated place and if you are in the mood, there is a (bit more downscale but pretty awesome) music venue next door.<br><br>Yeay, church!",

"reviewcomment":"I work right next to the Fenway Yard House. As a result, a lot of working lunches take place here. [There aren&#39;t too many good options around there.]<br><br>Usually, lunch is empty at the restaurant. That would make one think things are more fluid but every time I&#39;ve gone it has taken so long to get our food. This is probably because there are less people on staff but it can be slowwwww. To my surprise, today we got everything quickly!<br><br>I got the baja fish tacos as I wanted something different from the lunch special which is bomb!! [you can get half a sandwich or a mini (but still large- oh America) pizza with salad for 9.95. For a sit down place, that&#39;s amazeballs. <br><br>The only thing that I was unimpressed with was my side. The tacos came with spicy rice and beans. The beans were more like soup without the beans. It was tasty but not what I expected.",

"reviewcomment":"This place is awesome.  While I have never actually eaten at the Newbury St location (the one time we tried to get dessert there, we were turned away inexplicably) this is a  great offshoot of the original that is more of a neighborhood restaurant.<br><br>The staff is always friendly and accommodating (they have in the past served me the excellent chunky chicken salad that&#39;s not on the dinner menu for dinner).<br><br>Today was exceptional and I wanted to single out Cameron K. for his superb service!<br>He was pleasant, efficient, and every need was attended to, mostly without having to ask. Water refills, etc were all seamless. While this SHOULD be the norm ALL the time, we all know that is often not the case.<br><br>The food here is always good, including the cocktails which are well mixed and change regularly, and the somewhat famous Bloody Mary -- which comes with a check list of all sorts of ingredients to add (from bacon to olives to slim jims.)<br><br>The space is comfortable and nicely decorated, as well.<br><br>This is one of my go-to places, it&#39;s easy to forget how good it can be, but every time i go, i think &#34;why don&#39;t i come here more often.&#34; Isn&#39;t that what you want to say about a favorite neighborhood place?",

Much better than the North End, which is gimmicky and over-priced for average Italian food.<br><br>Fantastic mozzarella bar, and everything from appetizer to dessert is outstanding. Good service, nice ambiance, in an historic hotel. If you have a large party, ask to sit under the chandelier. It&#39;s the best seat in the house as you can look out onto the rest of the restaurant.<br><br>Price-wise, it&#39;s not cheap, but IMO it&#39;s not expensive either. Honestly, anything you order here is great. They even have naan! (I know, sound odd but it is DELICIOUS)",

These days, I don&#39;t really come here as much but I&#39;m still happy to say Anna&#39;s still provides a good, consistent product.<br><br>I&#39;ve had the tacos here but 99% of my visits to Anna&#39;s (here or elsewhere) are for the super steak burrito. It&#39;s a robust sized burrito with steak that&#39;s not dry but is flavorful. You get an abundance of whatever you want in there and I like that fact that the cheese and tortilla are heated up before. The only drawback to that is if you order lettuce in your burrito, by the time you take it home or to the office, the lettuce is cooked as a result of the hot tortilla and cheese.<br><br>Service? If you expect pristine service here then expectations are unrealistic. They&#39;re decently polite and don&#39;t yell at you, which is fine by me.",

The dough was crisp on the outside yet fluffy on the inside. The sauce was nice too, it was classic with the spices and flavors one loves in a true homemade pizza.<br><br>The ham and cheese panini may look small but it was packed with smokey ham and mozzarella cheese. I loved it, and I usually am not one to pick ham and cheese.<br><br>The potato croquette was great too. It was crispy and light on the outside. The breadcrumbs have a wonderful flavor of spices and herbs. The best part of the croquette was how tender the potato inside was and the cheese that was stuffed in it too.<br><br>The BEST was the spinach and cheese calzone!!!! The filling was perfectly crafted to give you the right balance of melted cheese and sauteed spinach. I could have ate 9 of them. THE BEST!",

"reviewcomment":"The Orinoco in Brookline is like the Khloe to the South End&#39;s Kim - somewhat less popular, but very much from the same roots. Whereas the wait in the South End is inevitable, we were seated in this location right away, which is a big plus in my book.<br><br>After multiple visits to Orinoco, I have yet to go wrong with the menu. I highly recommend the maracuchitos (cheese-filled plantains) and the bacon-wrapped dates as appetizers. The empanadas are also fantastic, as is the pernil arepa.<br><br>My one nit with this place is that my friend&#39;s virgin margarita was a whopping $9, which is the same as any alcoholic beverage on their menu. Can you really justify charging that much when you just dump margarita mix in a salt-dipped glass and call it a day? The waiter&#39;s explanation was less than satisfactory - &#34;It&#39;s actually on the cheap end of our drink list.&#34; Maybe because it&#39;s not an actual drink?<br><br>Mini-rant over.

Anyway, stopped in here last week with a few friends for dinner. There were 5 of us, but when we arrived there was only a table available right next to the door (it was kind of chilly out, and people were holding it wide open) Our waitress seated us and told us that she would move us as soon as another table became available..which she did. She even brought us our drinks and let us order our food while we were waiting. <br><br>I got the BLT with avocado, which was good..but I wasn&#39;t blown away by the bacon. It tasted like someone had poured an entire bottle of the &#34;smoke&#34; flavoring over it, due to the fact that it wasn&#39;t completely charred black. The rest of the sandwich was tasty, and they have a great beer selection. I loved the atmosphere, and the staff was friendly and helpful. I&#39;d try a different entree next time, but I&#39;ll totally be back!",

He made my mother another round of swordfish without the salt and jokingly pointed out that if it was too bland there was sea salt on the table. He was funny and very accommodating. <br>The deck is nice but no dogs allowed.",

My first experience here  was superb!!!<br><br>I arrived at 5pm, but this place got PACKED by the time I left at 6:15pm. My suggestion is to go early. The place is also pretty small as well. However, I don&#39;t think it&#39;d be too long of a wait seeing how they bring out your food lightning quick. We probably got our sushi within 10 mins of ordering it. I had the Tokyo Style Soft Shell Crab maki and the Crispy maki with tuna.....I think that&#39;s what it was called????

I have tried almost everything on the menu and the food is never disappointing. It&#39;s always fresh and filled with a lot of flavor. <br><br>If you have never been here, the spaghetti pomodoro is simple but one of the best in Boston. Try it as an entrée or order it as a side dish. As a side dish, it&#39;s the perfect complement to the Chicken Milanese, which is excellent. The burrata also is a favorite and crowd pleaser. <br><br>I have always found the service very attentive and pleasant. They are very professional. The dining atmosphere is elegant and never too noisy. During the summer they have a wonderful outdoor patio, which is a rarity in Boston. <br><br>If you are looking for a great Italian restaurant, you don&#39;t have to go to the North End. I would much rather dine here. It&#39;s perfect for a date or with a group. You can&#39;t go wrong!",

Eggs are perfectly poached, tomatoes are grilled just the right amount, the toast is well done too and their sauce is fantastic. On top of that, the potatoes are heaven. <br><br>I usually split the blintzes with someone as well. While good, I have definitely had a lot better. The cottage cheese in these is quite granular (while I remain a fan of creamy) but this surely is a matter of taste. Note that you have to order any fruits separately. <br><br>For the service, they are pushy. Particularly on Saturday and Sunday mornings, which is when I am guessing they see most of their business, they tend to give you the receipt before you are even done eating the main course (which is rude to begin with, but is particularly uncomfortable if you intended to order something else too). I get that there is a line for getting a table, but if people want to order more food the least you could do is ask whether they are finished before you shove the check on their table.",

The food and service is authentic Chinese, not Americanized Disney style Chinese. <br><br>Mary by the way is very friendly and is often at the register.<br><br>They are cash only, no credit cards accepted here. Don&#39;t forget to do an ATM run before dinner.<br><br>When I worked in Cambridge I used to eat here at least once a week.<br><br>They have a few classic dishes that are just awesome, in particular Suan La Chow Chow and Dun Dun Noodles with shredded chicken. <br><br>Their Dumplings are addictively good.<br><br>I also really like their Ma Pa Tofu. They use soft fresh tasting silken tofu which I love. (An earlier review incorrectly assumed it was not fully cooked.)<br><br>The rest of their menu is good, but not outstanding. Their Dim Sum on Sunday has a relatively limited selection.<br><br>Parking in central square is disaster, which is the main reason I don&#39;t visit Mary&#39;s more often when I am in Cambridge.",

"reviewcomment":"I came here for friends hang-out and assignment for my hospitality course on a Sunday night. It is a nice, semi-casual seafood restaurant that makes me feel like I&#39;m eating by the beach. One of the best restaurant location you can find in Boston because public parking complex and Green Line stops public transportation are both right next to it. You can also get discount from the restaurant on your parking ticket.<br><br>The waiter is very friendly and knowledgeable. A few of us asked about items on the menu, he was patient and explained the ingredient and differences between dishes so we can order the dish that we would like the most.<br><br>I ordered &#34;Summer Shack Seafood Paella&#34; serves two on the special menu. It was the best seafood dish I&#39;ve ever tasted!! The lobster, clams, mussels taste so fresh, and the sauce and rice together is very delicious with all the seafood mixed together. I highly recommend this dish if you don&#39;t care about the price because this dish is $58. At least it serves two people; it was in a wok when it&#39;s served, so it&#39;s $29 per person. You should also have a bit left to take home. I had a small box to take the leftover home, but I forgot and left it on the table. When I got home, I was so angry at myself for forgetting it because I really want to eat that again.<br><br>The food is so good that even made my friend who doesn&#39;t like seafood liked his dish. He never had lobster before he came here with me, so he ordered a whole lobster dish. Although he didn&#39;t like the lobster because he just doesn&#39;t like seafood overall, he loved the sauce, so he kept wiping the corn cob on the plate, so he can get all the sauce on his corn and enjoy it.<br><br>There are five of us. No appetizer, 3 drinks, 4 entree (one of the entrees serves two), and 5 desserts. It was about $45 per person include tax and tips.<br><br>Overall<br>Pro: great location, delicious food, nice ambiance, great service.<br>Con: a bit too expensive (especially for the dessert)",

"reviewcomment":"I have to say, I was not expecting to give this place five stars. Don&#39;t get me wrong-- I love pizza, I love bowling, and I love the sort of low-key relaxed experience that the intersection of the two would imply. But I was basically expecting the emphasis of the place to be on the bowling, with the food as an afterthought. <br><br>Instead, I was treated to some truly spectacular pizza-- and let me reiterate, I *love* pizza. The first time I came to Flatbread Company I was with my work colleagues to celebrate a baby shower. We had one pizza with sausage and red peppers, and another with pepperoni. Both were perfect-- crispy, flavorful, with the perfect balance of sauce to toppings to crust. I was also charmed by their half pint beers. I love to try new beers but hate ordering a pint of something I might not love, but at around $2 per half pint, there&#39;s no reason not to get adventurous. <br><br>The next time I came back I was with a coworker and a friend. Our waitress was the same one who had served us at the party two weeks earlier, and she remembered us-- major points. We split the sausage and red pepper pizza (yep, it&#39;s that good) and one of their specials, which featured sage, butternut squash puree, and goat cheese. Who would even think to put that on a pizza? But it was amazing. And despite the abundance of families, small children, and the sounds of bowling everywhere, we didn&#39;t have to scream to be heard, nor did we feel like we were crashing a second grader&#39;s birthday party. <br><br>This was a great experience both times I went, and I will definitely be returning. Maybe beer and bowling don&#39;t go together so well-- I&#39;ll look forward to finding out.",

"reviewcomment":"I&#39;ve always heard that the &#34;center bar&#34; is much coveted in the business. I don&#39;t doubt that it is but it only works if the edges of said center bar don&#39;t extend out  to the establishment&#39;s walls. This place would be better served having a 3 sided bar extending off of the wall that is to the right upon entry. Once this place gets remotely crowded, you are in somebody&#39;s way 100% of the time because of the narrow corridors.<br><br>Over the years, the food here has been pretty standard bar food . If you are expecting something extraordinary, I don&#39;t know why you would go here instead of one of the dozens of extraordinary restaurants that sit within a mile radius of this joint. Joshua Tree is basically a place where friends who live in the area get stupid with friends who used to live in the area and are now visitors to the area. <br><br>A bulk of my visits to &#34;The Tree&#34; (just lost a bit of my soul) took place in my early to mid 20s which is now a decade ago but I have been in a handful of times in recent years with my buddies who will only go to really generic bars that have TVs every which way you look. The crowd really hasn&#39;t changed. From opening until about 8 it is a fairly reasonable crowd. After 8, at least Thursday through Saturday, a steady stream of frat and sorority D-listers pours in. In other words, if you&#39;re a broski or a puss faced little princess who can&#39;t have a good time, you&#39;ll fit right in. <br><br>The reason for my 3 star review is because the 3 star review on Yelp is basically meaningless. It doesn&#39;t really say anything. But, it somehow best describes Joshua Tree. There&#39;s nothing overly bad or good about this place. It&#39;s very typical. Everything is predictable. Somebody else mentioned that it&#39;s run by the same outfit that runs those taverns that are in squares and whatnot..... That doesn&#39;t surprise me. Those joints are the same: Plain, no real character, lotta football heads, decent nachos, etc.",

"reviewcomment":"We went on a Saturday at 7am - with a reservation, that I was late for. We called, they were super understanding and friendly (we were driving from NH and hit construction). Arriving 15 minutes late, we were still seated right away with a bunch of people waiting. I was really impressed. <br><br>We had the fried mussels which in my opinion is close to the most perfectly cooked food I&#39;ve ever eaten! Their potatoes with melted cheese sauce is to die for as well. <br><br>Drinks were weak and pricey - but that&#39;s what I get for ordering a menu drink vs my usual wine or vodka soda. Service was actually pretty awful, which unfortunately seems like a pattern now - all of a sudden wait staff thinks they are above you (not that they are below you) and therefore don&#39;t want to &#34;serve&#34; you. I practically had to throw a fork at our waitress to get her attention even though she walked by our table 6x&#39;s and even serviced the table next to us twice without asking us for our order, etc....<br><br>I&#39;d definitely go back, maybe on a weeknight and sit at the bar, I loved the atmosphere in there!",

Apps came out quick, no prep time necessary for miso and seaweed salad- although I&#39;d love to try them both fresh, which I know I won&#39;t get around Boston without paying a boatload!<br>Table next to us got their sushi 10 min before we got ours, but we had digestive time. All food made pretty quickly for such a busy place.<br><br>Service- as everyone says, it&#39;s not friendly. But I truly don&#39;t care, which is not normal for me. Just bring me my sushi and let&#39;s not have a conversation. I just want to eat!<br><br>No problem with the size of the sushi, they didn&#39;t skimp on the rice as other posts say. <br><br>Favorite- hand rolls. I could just eat those and be happy.

Just know their 2 Peppers hot is HOT... You know how some places say spicy but it really isnt... Well their stuff is hot (and I love hot) but the Spicy Pad Thai was almost unbearable (unless the cook that day had a heavy hand)<br><br>Everything always fresh.... Mango fried Rice is DELISH, Pineapple is even better... <br><br>Everything is good...   Wont be disappointed!",

"reviewcomment":"I don&#39;t even know where to begin, so I suppose I will go with the appetizers?  <br><br>We hosted our apres-nuptial dinner here and it was amazing.  Mamma Maria puts together a nice menu with plenty of choices and a nice selection of different items for each person to enjoy.  <br><br>The pesto... the polenta... the scallop... these were things that people were muttering, while looking down at the table, between bites.  The selections were perfect at an hour where one sort of needs an appetizer to keep them from devouring a large meal.<br><br>The salads were excellent, as is the wine glass that is magically never empty.  Our guests ordered a variety of different entrees and all were met with rave reviews.  All who ate the beef tenderloin in particular claimed it was the best they had ever had.  I ordered the cod and hadn&#39;t a clue that cod could be cooked so well.  <br><br>As if we hadn&#39;t eaten enough for an army, we had a cake to cut and the dessert platter coming out.  Oof.  I gained three pounds.<br><br>The service is amazing.  We ate dinner there in December and Jason was our waiter then, and we were both happy to see that he (and James) would be taking care of our wedding guests as well.  There is a very keen willingness to help, but they are also relatively soft-spoken, knowing when to interject and when to back away, which is becoming more and more rare these days.  Also, a few of our guests came with food restrictions that we hadn&#39;t known about, and they were accommodated quickly and with quality substitutions. <br><br>I have read many of the reviews for MM and all I can gather is that people want to complain about anything possible when their food is expensive, and that they may think they know more about the cuisine than they do, leading them to some degree of disappointment.  However, if you think to ask the staff to help you make your selections, I don&#39;t see how you could go wrong.<br><br>If you are looking for someplace to invest in a really lovely night out, or you want something different and more innovative out of the North End, or you want to plan a function with a little more class than normal, definitely, definitely, look into this little spot in North Square.",

"reviewcomment":"I went here with my family and some family friends last night for a pre-Mother&#39;s day celebration. It was our first time at McCormick &amp; Schmick&#39;s. <br>We had a great waiter named Tim. Tim gave us excellent recommendations for different dishes on the menu. He was extremely interactive with us and he was great with the young kids we had with us. Our waiter was also extremely attentive. <br>The food was really good as well. My father ordered the shrimp scampi and praised that it was the best pasta he&#39;s ever eaten. I on the other hand ordered the Seared Ahi Tuna. The portions could have been bigger in my opinion but it was still delicious. My family also ordered two dozen clams and we chowed that down within minutes. They were so good and it was clear that the clams were fresh<br><br>However, there are a couple of things that prevents this place from getting five stars. 1) I called in a reservation for 7:30 yet when we got there we still had to wait an additional 15-20 minutes to be seated. <br>2) The food took awhile to come out as well. I mean we were with family friends so we didn&#39;t mind waiting too much, however I was starving by the time the food arrived at our table. We waited for about 40 minutes for our food to come out. To be fair, we did have a party of 8 though and everyone did get their food at the same time so that might be why our food was delayed. <br>3) The lighting of the restaurant made it hard to read the menu. The lighting is a minor detail but still, my sister had to rely on phone&#39;s light to read the menu!<br><br>Overall, we had a great dining experience with McCormick &amp; Schmicks. The service was fantastic and so was the food. My family and I will definitely be coming back.",

This happened to be close by, they don&#39;t take reservations, but they had a table we could have...so we headed over. This place is HUGE which accounts for them having an opentable.<br><br>We sat down, ordered drinks, and were greeted with cornbread...cornbread? Wait? What?  At an Italian Seafood place? odd, no?  I ate it all the same as it was late and we, shockingly, had been drinking :). <br><br>My friend ordered the colossal, chilled seafood platter priced at $68, definitely can be shared as a MEAL, b/w at least 3 people, there was so much food on it (see pix).  Everyone got something different and the meal was delicious.  We didn&#39;t have to wait too long for the food to come out and we all enjoyed it. <br><br>If in the area again I would def consider going back.

"reviewcomment":"I would highly recommend this restaurant.<br><br>FOOD - For my app I ordered the steak tartare, it was the perfect amount of saltiness with the potato chips. For my main dish  I had the Spice Rubbed Long Bone Rib Eye (lemon-parsley salad, bone marrow butter and harissa) 68. The rib eye was cooked perfectly medium rare. I finished the 24 oz - that&#39;s how good it was. It&#39;s very tender! For sides I ordered the truffled mac &amp; cheese, creamed spinach, duck fat roasted root vegetables, whipped potatos &amp; french fries. The vegetables &amp; mac &amp; cheese were AMAZING, a must order! <br><br>WINE: They have a promotion going on, for every 2 filet mignon &amp; bottle of Silver Oak 2009 Cabernet ordered, they will give you 1 complimentary filet mignon. We ordered two bottles and 4 filets, so we got 2 filets free which is a WIN! <br><br>SERVICE: The waiter was very personable, pleasant and attentive. We were a party of 10 and our wine glasses &amp; water never went empty.  He was very good with suggesting which sides to order and the right amount to order for the whole table. <br><br>SPECIAL OCCASIONS: We went for my boyfriend&#39;s birthday. They brought out the cake perfectly, sliced the cake and served it! They did not charge us for using their plates, some restaurants actually charge you $5 per plate for bringing your own cake.<br><br>Awesome night at Smith &amp; Wollensky, thank you!",

"reviewcomment":"This was my second time at TW Food. Took my lady for a weekend in Cambridge/Boston and knew i had to try their menu again. Once again we had the Grand Tasting with the wine pairing. They use seasonal and fresh ingredients here, so i wanted to see what the spring/summer menu would bring. So here goes: <br><br>1st: Creamed pea soup with bbq rabbit and mussels. It was a great way to start the meal. This was my lady&#39;s favorite dish of the night. The smokiness in the rabbit paired wonderfully with the light soup. <br><br>2nd: Scallop ceviche and seared scallops with sumac and Turkish spices. The ceviche was, in one word, amazing. A fresh burst of flavor that awakes the pallet for what&#39;s to come. This was tied for best dish of the meal for me. This was my girl&#39;s second favorite. <br><br>3rd: Foie Gras 3 ways. This was the other dish tied for 1st place. The seared Foie and the brule&#39;d were incredible. I wish i could have a steak sized Foie Gras. That&#39;s how good these were. For the 3rd dish, my girl had the gnocchetti, which was delicious. Very flavorful. BUT, i am so happy i went with the Foie Gras<br><br>4th: Lamb with mustard greens and morel mushrooms. Another great dish. The lamb was perfectly cooked and the morels were perfection. <br><br>5th: Cheese plate w/ fig jam and spicy almond. Wonderful cheeses that paired perfectly with the jam and almonds. <br><br>6th: Dessert. Fantastic. I don&#39;t remember exactly what we had, but i know there was brownie and graham cracker ice cream. <br><br>This dinner is in my top 5 easily, maybe top 3 meals ever. The wines pair wonderfully with the fresh ingredients used to compose the dishes. Service is friendly and attentive without being stuffy. TW Food is a place i have been to twice now, and they manage to wow me both times. If you are anywhere remotely close to this place, do yourself a favor and go eat there. You will thank me.

All their food is very healthy, and allows for a large variety of heavier meals (lamb, sirloin,  sausage) as well as lighter meals (fish and pasta based.) I particularly like that their menu has listed wine pairings with each dish. <br><br>I would definitely recommend this place for friendly light dinners, where the environment is a good facilitator for conversations. the music is great too!",

It was well worth it and we&#39;re so happy that we came. <br><br>The staff was friendly and service was quick. Place was a little small but the turnaround for seats was pretty fast. The atmosphere was chill and the art hanging on the walls were cool (Tim Burton-esque). <br><br>The food was great too! We all had the side of biscuits with gravy because we&#39;re all fat kids at heart. I tend to forget what everyone else in my party had because my food was hands down the best. I had the goat cheese, bacon, caramelized onion, and egg sandwich. Everything complimented each other splendidly and you could taste the awesome goat cheese. <br><br>Next time I visit, I will try my best to come by here again :)",

I kept ordering til the game ended and didn&#39;t get a heart attack from the bill, so that was comforting. <br><br>I ordered the pulled pork nachos to share and we couldn&#39;t finish because they were piled so high (not that I&#39;m complaining). They had cheese and toppings on every chip, not just the top layer. So I was satisfied. <br><br>Overall a great sports bar, and they have a roof deck!

"reviewcomment":"Let me preface this by saying I&#39;ve been coming to Chau Chow since my immediate family moved from California (early 90s). Although it&#39;s a half hour drive from my relatives&#39; place, it is my favorite spot to get my dim sim fix. Moreover, although not in connection with one another, there&#39;s a small parking lot situated beside the business making for convenient parking in a crowded city.<br><br>Oftentimes on weekends, I find my party and I heading upstairs (blazing past the greeters) where were greeted by the second host/hostess who seat us. There&#39;s usually a good number of cart-server-ladies with a variety of goodies. You can&#39;t go wrong with what you&#39;re served here. It&#39;s very good (although I would say it&#39;s sometimes to an American standing.. It&#39;s different from HK) but I will admit that I don&#39;t like the doughy skin... but that&#39;s personal preference. My go-to steamer is the haa gao (sp?) or shrimp dumpling. Overall all of the dumplings are generally delicious. Also, they sell very popular Asian dishes like chicken feet, crab claws, fried rice, etc. So if you don&#39;t find yourself fancying dumplings there&#39;s so much more to pick from (you can ask for a menu also).<br><br>I&#39;d like to note that service is actually very good (in comparison to a number of American-Chinese establishments). Based on 20+ years of experience, I am ALWAYS treated well by the cart-ladies and waitstaff whereas the hosts/hostesses are much more annoying to deal with, but whatever.<br><br>Although I&#39;ve grown up and no longer rely on my parents&#39; ability to communicate with the waitstaff/servers (because I can&#39;t speak Cantonese to save my life)... I find myself coming here because it is overall a great and convenient place for comfort food.",

The guy taking my order made some recommendations and even let me try some of the different cheeses and sauces they have. When eating roast beef, you gotta have horseradish...I go for the triple whammy - horseradish cheddar, raw horseradish, and horseradish sauce (I&#39;m a bit of an addict). For those of you who don&#39;t love the stuff as much as I do, I suggest mixing the beast sauce with the tiger sauce....add some grilled onions, lettuce, tomato, pickles...throw that all on a grilled onion roll and get ready for the best roast beef sandwich you&#39;ve ever had.",

And believe me when I say that you should too.<br><br>This place serves, hands down, the best ramen I have ever had. I even spent a couple of weeks in Japan this past winter, and I&#39;d still like to say that Yume takes the cake. The innumerable ramen places in Boston and Cambridge cannot hold a candle to Yume when it comes to ramen. Most authentic ramen I have had in the US. I think the homemade noodles and fresh, fatty pork slices are the source of Yume&#39;s success. <br><br>Open late on most nights (11pm), however, their hours can be erratic (sometimes they can even be closed for several consecutive weeks if the owner is visiting family in Japan).

"reviewcomment":"Atwood&#39;s has a special place in my heart because I met my lovely, big hearted boyfriend here, but it is pretty rad even without the memory.<br><br>Atwood&#39;s is everything you want from a watering hole, dark enough that the man you are eyeing looks mysterious (even without the booze) but not so dark that groping becomes an acceptable way to pass the time.  <br><br>Atwoods reminds me of all those seedy yet somehow sophisticated bars that I imagine Lou Reed and Leonard Cohen frequented in their youths. It&#39;s all dark wood and moody jazz music. The type of place that is cool and timeless, not trendy and hipster. <br><br>Besides the killer ambiance, the staff here are also wonderful. My crew and I tend to be a wee bit loud, yet they fully embraced our rowdiness. Last night, our waitress accidentally spilled beer all over me, an event that admittedly  usually would not trigger a 5 star review, but was so nice and apologetic that it only endeared me to her further. (the complimentary Taza chocolate pudding she surprised me with also helped). <br><br>Tip for  wannabe online Romeos: Atwoods is far cooler than those stuffy Tapas bars you keep dragging us women folk to. Most of us don&#39;t want to have to put on lipstick and airs for someone we may never want to see again.",

"reviewcomment":"I live less than a block away from Orleans and it has been one of my last visits in the Davis Square area due to reviews. <br><br>I decided I would give it a try one night because I did not feel like cooking dinner and it turned out GREAT! I have been to Orleans 3 times in less than 5 days, twice for dinner and once for brunch. <br><br>I enjoyed the food off the Mardi Gras menu - chicken and biscuits and jambalaya. Only note: I like jambalaya with a bit more heat and add crawfish. For brunch I had the eggs benedict and my partner had the french toast for brunch. I thought the eggs benedict was good and my partner LOVED the french toast. The only con would have been one of the eggs was not runny. Overall I wouldn&#39;t say the food is &#34;To Die For&#34; but I thought the food was good and quite tasty. <br><br>The service has been great all three trips. Yes, there were some mistakes but the server was very kind and corrected them promptly - even comped a alcoholic beverage. <br><br>The biggest plus for me; I don&#39;t have to wait in a line for brunch. Some of the breakfast places in Ball Square are CRAZY! I think the brunch is just as tasty at Orleans. <br><br>Give it a shot and take the dress coat and slacks off when you go into Orleans.",

And boy was it worth the half hour drive from JP. Can you guys open 10 more locations?<br><br>While the layout isn&#39;t so great (order...salad bar...pay...you can&#39;t linger there because there&#39;s always a big line of people, meaning you have to squeeze past the guests to grab your food), it&#39;s got a few tables to sit at. They will kick you out if you linger, which I can see getting annoying, but as it&#39;s such a popular place, people who want to sit and eat and very grateful. This isn&#39;t a snack you can stand and eat....these pitas are just STUFFED full of good things.<br><br>My friend and I ordered smalls (3 falafel balls) and french fries. The falafels were some of the best I&#39;ve ever had. Nice and hot, great texture, soft but crispy on the outside. And they tasted great. I topped mine with cucumber salad, beets, tzatiki, some parsley concoction, and some pickles. I picked up some dutch mayo, ketchup, and garlic sauce at the condiment station. That garlic sauce? TO DIE FOR. I slathered it on everything I could (including my face). Our french fries were very hot, salted and crispy, the best kind.<br><br>Great experience. Good service. They need to expand!",

"reviewcomment":"Somehow I have yet to review Rami&#39;s despite the fact that I&#39;ve been coming here ever since I was a kid and had just moved to the area.<br><br>Without a doubt, Rami&#39;s is the closest thing to actual Israeli falafel in the Boston area. Anyone who tells you differently probably doesn&#39;t know their falafel from their kubbeh. I mean, for one, and for reasons I&#39;ve never fully comprehended, they are legitimately the *only* place in Boston that actually has good pitas. No pocketless, dry, crumbling, burrito-style sandwiches here: this is the real deal. I&#39;ve heard they get them shipped from somewhere else but I don&#39;t really care. I miss Israeli style pitas so much sometimes (and by &#34;sometimes&#34; I mean every time I eat a falafel sandwich in one of their competitors&#39; pitas), these can really make my day.<br><br>The texture of the falafels is perfect, although I will admit that there&#39;s a subtle flavor difference between these and what I&#39;m used to. Still, considering everything else, it&#39;s hardly reason to deduct a star. The vegetables are super fresh, the hummus is good, and everyone&#39;s happy. A note about the delicious green spicy stuff, aka skhug: unless you handle heat very well, I would ask for it on the side. Yes, it will make your sandwich all that much better, but if you&#39;re like me, only in moderation.  <br><br>If you go during the lunch rush, it gets super crowded and there isn&#39;t really any room to sit. And yes, it is expensive, but I think a lot of the folks complaining about the prices don&#39;t realize just how much money it costs to operate a Glatt Kosher restaurant in Boston. <br><br>If you manage to go during off-peak hours, the staff is very nice and the atmosphere is fun and happy. Plus, tonight they gave us free baklava!",

"reviewcomment":"If you&#39;re looking for a place to host a large party with all of your friends, please look no further than Tavern in the Square.<br><br>Last month, I was frantically looking for a place to host a large dinner party. For 40 people. On a Friday night. Yeah right. I called about 15 places in Cambridge and Somerville, all of whom wanted my party to meet a minimum balance and have my guests order off of a fixed price menu.<br><br>But when I called Tavern in the Square, the manager on duty talked to the owners and kitchen staff, and said the magic words to me: &#34;No problem.&#34; I rejoiced that I had found my dream place that would accommodate my crazy request.<br><br>The actual party went perfectly. Tavern in the Square had reserved the entire back space for us, so my party of 40 had our own space where things weren&#39;t too loud. The manager on duty, Angelo, was available that night and personally kept coming in to check on how things were going. We had three servers all to ourselves, who were prompt, efficient, and friendly. We got to order off of their full and very extensive menu, and everyone I talked to was satisfied with their meals (the fried avocado was a hit!). My sister came and even brought her 3-month-old baby, which the restaurant happily accommodated. Plus, many of my guests got to watch the Bruins game that was on that night. And finally, they never rushed us out of the place, even as things got busy toward the later hours of the night.<br><br>Because of the incredibly accommodating staff who made the experience absolutely perfect, I really have a newfound respect for Tavern in the Square.",

"reviewcomment":"Went here with my girlfriend for restaurant week two weeks ago. I had never been, but driven by many times and sort of assumed it was run down based on the tourtisty, hokey spinning sign outside. I was wrong. This place is not what I had always assumed it was.<br><br>It&#39;s a nice open restaurant, you can see the lobster cookers and the entire place has a nice feel to it. Makes you totally forget how many delicious lobsters are &#34;meating&#34; their demise to end up on my plate. But my God, the deliciousness makes me forget about any guilt that might have crept into my mind. <br><br>The Rhode Island Calamari that is &#34;fried and greasy&#34; according to the menu, is not any greasier than regular calamari. I don&#39;t know why referring to it as greasy would be considered appetizing by whoever wrote the menu, but I was willing to try it anyway. Frankly I couldn&#39;t say no to fried calamari if it said it was deep fried in a toilet..<br><br>Both my girlfriend&#39;s and my lobsters were cooked to perfection, very meaty, succulent and drool worthy. We both made it a &#34;clam bake&#34; where they add clams and steamers, both of which were awesome as well. I don&#39;t have lobster super often, but when at restaurants sometimes they don&#39;t cook it properly. Here they certainly do.<br><br>Our waiter was great. Never overeager or anything but helpful. He answered all our questions with ease. i wish I could remember his name to give him credit, but alas I was too focused on devouring as much seafood as I could.<br><br>Also, their creme brulee desert is UNREAL. I&#39;ve never had anything so delicious in my life. I honestly want to go back just for dessert. It would be worth the waiter looking at me like I was on lithium when I said I only wanted dessert at a seafood restaurant... I have no shame.",

"reviewcomment":"I&#39;ve always enjoyed my time here with my friends. It&#39;s not too crowded and there&#39;s plenty of space to move around. The noise level is like that of any other bar, if not a bit better around the main bar area than, say, Oliver&#39;s.<br><br>One small thing I noted was that the glass they used for the mixed drinks, i.e. gin &amp; tonics, etc. may have changed. I definitely remember the architecture of the glass being much smoother, wider, giving that luxurious feel. &#34;Generous,&#34; as one of my friends noted. But now they seem to have shrunk since the start of the new year. I&#39;m not sure if those glasses were used for certain drinks and are still there but kept hidden or if they did away with them overall. It makes me think about the amount of ice and alcohol I&#39;m receiving per purchase. I&#39;ll estimate I&#39;m getting about 10-20% less liquid as a result. It&#39;s quite noticeable.<br><br>Best to see if I can ask for a larger glass next time.",

For $30, we each got juice, coffee, mimosa&#39;s (or bloody marry&#39;s but we&#39;re not fans), an entree each and a dessert to share!<br><br>I got the Brioche French Toast with Pear &amp; Cranberry Compote, Whipped Cream and Vermont Maple Syrup. This was one of the best french toasts I&#39;ve had in awhile. The use of brioche was definitely different from traditional french toasts but it worked beautifully. My girlfriend ordered the Eggs Benedict which came out amazing. The eggs were perfectly poached and the hollandaise sauce was incredible. It even came with a little fruit cup with berries! <br><br>If there is ever another deal for this place, we are definitely jumping on it. The hotel is gorgeous and the food is exceptional. This place is definitely worth a visit (for brunch at least).<br><br>Check out my blog (complete with pictures and childish humor) for the full review! <br><br><a href='/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fthesuchef.org%2F2013%2F10%2F07%2Fclink%2F&amp;s=6993fc93a288f845a9f44199c9ce3384d70159db7bf1ed075f1392c555a1edc6' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>thesuchef.org/2013/10/07…</a>",

"reviewcomment":"Rudy&#39;s has extensive margarita options and good food for the price. Sometimes you have to wait for a table, but I have always felt it was worth it. It&#39;s a great place to relax and catch up with a group of friends, or go on a casual date. Servers are courteous, friendly, and accommodating. They are usually quick to bring out homemade tortilla chips and salsa fresca.<br><br>I like that you can get margaritas made with fresh lime juice, or in some cases fruit purees, instead of just the cheap, sugary or corn syrup-laden mixes that are so prevalent. My favorites are the Prickly Pear Margarita, the Prickly Peach Margarita, and the Calientes Margarita (with jalapeno tequila). <br><br>Their combo plates, taco plates, enchilada plates, and quesadillas are generally all good deals. They have been flexible about substitutions on combo plates -- I loved their spinach enchilada special and when it wasn&#39;t on the menu, I asked for it and got it. For vegetarian food this place is fantastic as there are plenty of options. You can get refried bean, spinach, or even guacamole tacos and they are all very good. <br><br>One thing I have not had good luck with here is chicken. For some reason the two times I recall getting chicken -- in an enchilada once, and in a taco another time -- the meat either seemed on the dry / flavorless side or just not quite as fresh as I would like. However, the pulled pork quesadilla and the beef tacos that I tried were very good.<br><br>The atmosphere is comfortable and people can converse at normal volume -- there is usually music playing but it isn&#39;t so loud that you have to shout over it. Overall this place is a great value if you have the time to hang out and get a drink or two. Or three.",

I have come here multiple times with multiple people and everyone agrees...it is excellent! <br><br>The pizza is awesome, diverse, affordable and filling. The salads are quite good as well and the deserts are fantastic. All and all very affordable. Also, the staff is quite friendly and I have always enjoyed my interactions with them. <br><br>This establishment is excellent for all occasions be it date night, dinner with friends or family, or even if you want your kids to eat good pizza instead of chuck e cheese. <br><br>I brought my girlfriend here, and she is a bit of a pizza snob (she is from New Jersey and NYC) and this is one of her favorite spots for pizza...and mine too!",

"reviewcomment":"Recently brought my parents here when they were visiting me. Started with fried clams for an appetizer, and they were cooked to perfection - not chewy and over done... Just right and they still had that fresh briny taste that you&#39;d expect from fresh clams. <br><br>For dinner I had swordfish. Excellent. My girlfriend got wild mushroom pasta, which was good but the sauce was a bit heavy. My mom had the wild salmon special, which again could only be described as excellent. Finally, my dad got the seafood stuffed cannelloni, which had nice flavor and not too much filler. <br><br>Overall, Mare is a good experience. A bit on the pricey end, but good nonetheless. My one complaint was that our waiter either was new or didn&#39;t really know the menu that well.",

"reviewcomment":"Came here with a group of new friends... wanting seafood of course... the hostess was friendly and we got seated right away... <br><br>It was a pretty mellow night so we were able to seat and really catch up with each other (getting to know stage since we all met from the conference!)<br><br>Our server was friendly (forgot her name!)... and really took care of us the whole evening. <br><br>What I had:<br>* a cup of New England Clam Chowder = highly recommend! It&#39;s creamy, in the right way and it was loaded with clams... and guess what, they weren&#39;t chewy! Plus it was filled up to the edge of the cup... they&#39;re not stingy in the portion! <br><br>* Fisherman&#39;s Platter (shrimp, scallops, calamari, clams &amp; whitefish) = whoa... really fresh seafood! The scallops were chunky and juicy and well fried! I ended up sharing this with the group since it was bit huge but we made good damage at the end.<br><br>Overall... it&#39;s inside the mall... but don&#39;t let that change your mind. The food is actually good but I guess from the other reviews... its a hit or miss... so here&#39;s me hoping that when you do visit... it&#39;ll be a hit and then I won&#39;t be in your &#34;crap&#34; list :P",

Overall you get a great brunch for about $15/person.<br><br>The staff is friendly and easy going, if I had to point one flaw I would say the waiting time can be a downside... Specially during the winter when you have to wait outside. However I still recommend this place to anyone looking for a great, fulfilling and not super pricy brunch!",

"reviewcomment":"I went this Saturday with a friend of mine who has never been to this fine establishment. I told her, ahead of time, that I had written several reviews about the place and that I worried about the quality of service I would receive, because of my reviews. The waiter quickly acknowledged us and said, &#34;I&#39;ll not do the spiel; you look familiar!&#34; I was nervous for a little bit, because I assumed this meant I would get the same pretty-pretty-obnoxious-princess treatment that I got the last time I went.  <br><br>I had, as always, gluten free penne con pollo with no asparagus and no roma tomatoes. It was delicious, as always. I am not writing this review to comment solely on their excellent ability to prepare gluten-free foods that don&#39;t taste gluten free (!!) but to give credit where credit is due. My friend is visually impaired, and she struggles to read menus most of the time. She has, on many occasions, had to ask the server/waiter/management staff to read items off the menu for her. Not this time! She was so pleased by the size of the print on the menu that she told me, &#34;Maria, you have to write a review praising them for this...&#34; <br><br>She did not have to squint...she didn&#39;t have to ask me to read it to her...and she didn&#39;t have to tell the server anything. She also loved her meal: tortellini something or other (gluten-full). <br><br>I would give them 5 stars for this experience, but the dishes came out together. One server brought out both my gluten-free dish and her gluten-full dish, which put my meal at risk for cross-contamination. There wasn&#39;t really an issue at all, but extra measures should generally be taken when dealing with medically-documented issues. I don&#39;t fully blame the staff because the new GF fad dieters have ruined dining experiences for me everywhere. Note to the fad dieters out there: they never used to ask whether it was an allergy or a preference at restaurants! And if we were going to be clinical and medically specific, celiac disease gluten free dieters have neither a preference nor an allergy. But... that&#39;s a conversation for another day!",

"reviewcomment":"I always love a place where the staff are both friendly and gracious. It&#39;s small and tucked between residential homes off of Pearl St (a 3-min walk from the Central Sq T stop).<br><br>Every single dish we had was awesome and really felt authentic and homey. To start, we ordered the sausages (one lamb, one beef) that were appropriately small and had a nice spicy kick, the za&#39;atar app (like a flatbread with pickled onions on top), and the harissa paste.<br><br>For the main dishes, we ordered the leg of chicken, which had a sweet, fruity sauce and the salmon tagine (on the specials menu). The tagine was a little salty for my liking and needed a dash of lemon juice, but when I took the rest home and added some more rice, the overwhelming saltiness of the dish was less apparent and I was able to taste the other flavors of the dish.<br><br>We ended the meal with Turkish coffee w/ cardamom, which actually tasted rather floral, almost like gulab (rose) flavoring with that characteristic bitter after-taste. Not sure I would get it again, but interesting nonetheless.<br><br>So sad I didn&#39;t get to try their cherbat  lemonade since it was rainy and cold when I went last week, but I shall return for more!",

They were really nice though and closed them so we could people watch but not die.<br><br>I had fish and chips and it was excellent. I also had their white sangria and champagne cocktail and both were delicious. My brother had a few momojitos and loved them. My mom ordered a burger and really enjoyed it. The portions were generous and the fish was cooked perfectly and I didn&#39;t find it greasy. We also all fought over their French fries because they were the bomb.<br><br>Overall everything was great and our server was pleasant and attentive. A pretty great way to start our trip.",

This was my first experience with Brazilian barbecue, so I don&#39;t claim to be an expert. But that was simple delicious. I specifically enjoyed the lamb, which ranks among the best I&#39;ve had, and the service was friendly, family-like, and helpful. The kielbasa also were delicious. <br>Minus one star for the confusing bar-like atmosphere, but I enjoyed the live music.<br><br>Lastly, I would like to take this opportunity to thank the people of Brazil for allowing us to eat half their population of farm animals.

All their locations are pretty much the same, so this review is for all of them.<br><br>The ice cream is very good, not a huge variety of toppings but they have all the common tasty ones so you won&#39;t be disappointed. The hot chocolate is delicious too.<br><br>I give JP Licks 4 stars rather than 5 not due to any faults, but because the ice cream does not stand out in any way. In my opinion, it doesn&#39;t differ too much in quality or variety from store-bought Ben and Jerry&#39;s.<br><br>There are sometimes very long lines when it&#39;s sunny out, which is probably when you&#39;d want to get ice cream in the first place.

It&#39;s a much more authentic (and better) variant of a place such as Anna&#39;s Taqueria. <br><br>My go-to dish was the mix burrito, I&#39;d usually get chicken and beef tongue. Fantastic, juicy, delicious meat. They have a variety of vegetables and extras that they put in it, can&#39;t tell you what they are right now because I haven&#39;t been in a while, but I remember being surprised at how much more stuff there is. On request, they put fresh jalapenos in there, which makes your mouth get that real nice burn. Also they provide spicy sauces at the tables in case the jalapenos aren&#39;t enough.<br><br>Oh, and can&#39;t forget that the gigantic burrito comes with a side of tortilla chips and superb sauce to dip them in. The sauce is quite spicy - I&#39;ve experimented mixing it with the sauces that the restaurant provides at the tables, the result of which should be kept at Los Alamos Laboratory, cuz it was NUCLEAR!<br><br>It looks like they have other plates that you can get too, but I lack the expertise to be able to choose. Maybe next time I&#39;ll venture out, they&#39;re probably just as good if not better than the burritos.",

"reviewcomment":"Wait, I haven&#39;t written a review on The Kinsale yet?! Shame on me, SHAME!<br><br>The Kinsale holds a very special place in my heart; it is where I had (evening) graduate class during my last two semester at Suffolk. The first keyword that comes to my mind is consistency. The food is always great, beer nice and chilled, and never a long wait to get a table (thanks to the deserted Government Center area at night).<br><br>Anyways, I had a little grad school reunion a few weeks ago. Let me set the scene - &#39;twas a chilly early spring day in Boston; rain was in the air and Bruins game on the television. As I awkwardly walked as fast as I can (is there anything more annoying than getting drops of rain on my glasses?!) I began getting some food cravings: french onion soup and veggie burger. I knew they had a damn good v-burger, so I was half-pre-satisfied. To my extreme surprise, they did have onion soup -- and it was the first thing on their menu! Perfecto! We also ordered a hummus plate to share. <br><br>The food is, as I said, consistent from time-to-time, which is really nice. I must say, though, it is nothing mind blowing, but it is a treat.<br><br>Pro tips:<br>1. The area once you walk in can get a little loud, especially if a Bruins or Sox game is on. There is a great and quieter section to the left! <br>2. They validate your parking if you park in the Government Center Garage (so don&#39;t be a fool and feed the meter and/or pay an expensive garage).",

"reviewcomment":"Great service, amazing sandwiches, questionable name ;)<br><br>The first time I heard of this place was from a friend. We were coming home from a booze-filled night and a friend suggested we grab brunch the next morning to stave off our (inevitable) hangovers. As brunch is my favorite meal, I enthusiastically agreed and asked where we&#39;d go. He suggested &#34;strip tease.&#34; I scoffed. There was absolutely no way I was going to go to a strip club for brunch! He assured me the food was out of this world. Riiiight, I said. Just like how guys go to Hooters for the wings? <br><br>Fast forward 2 years (2yrs ago). It&#39;s back on my radar. I finally figured out it was a play on words and that I worked just down the street! Co-workers and I come here all the time for lunch. Go early as it is always crowded and it&#39;s a tiny little joint. I&#39;ve tried almost all the sandwiches on the menu the past 2 yrs and you seriously can&#39;t go wrong. My favorite is their burger, although the specials are top notch as well. <br><br>Only issue is that this place is so tiny, and the benches/metal chairs are a bit uncomfy. Only other place similar to this is Parish on Boylston. If you&#39;re in Watertown, this is the best resto to check out!<br><br>Bonus: You get to tell people you&#39;re going to &#34;strip tease&#34; ;)",

"reviewcomment":"All around good performance for this little neighborhood joint. <br>High marks for beer and wine selection and overall outstanding positive and professional service. <br>The food is very good not because it&#39;s unique but because they do simple things correctly. We ordered the buffalo pork belly, the smoked cod fritters, the lamb lollipops, the lamb sausage, the special flatbread pizza, the bison bolognese, and the manicotti. <br>Most of the things were conceptually very good but some were lacking in execution, bringing the star count down. Half of the pork belly was tough, the lamb sausage was overcooked slightly but not really enough to detract too much from the dish, but the manicotti was definitely something I&#39;ll be avoiding from now on...it was clumpy, tough, overcooked at parts and undercooked at others, and I don&#39;t know what the desired effect is for it but the kitchen definitely missed the mark.<br>The bison bolognese was excellent, the fritters were almost addictive,  the half of the pork belly that was cooked correctly was great, the lamb lollipops were perfectly trimmed, and the flatbread pizza was little more than a standard pizza with some good toppings but was executed very well, you can taste all the ingredients and it&#39;s not greasy or over-sauced. <br>Great ambiance and music too.<br>4.25 stars.",

"reviewcomment":"Went last night with my best friend! Since we are currently fasting for 40 days, basically living a vegan lifestyle, we thought we must try this place out. The atmosphere was super cozy and cute, but yet refined (something you wouldn&#39;t expect prior to walking in). Our server-- blonde, petite, forget her name--  was absolutely wonderful! She was extremely helpful and made suggestions regarding everything from wine to food. <br><br>For small plates:<br>1. potato kale cakes--- I could&#39;ve sworn those had bacon, but the smokey flavor actually came from the cashew cheese. Friend&#39;s fav.<br>2. ravioli--- super yummy, although my best friend thought the sauce was a little grainy<br>3. fried mushrooms--- TO DIE FOR! Nutty, crunchy and they had a wonderful sauce accompaniment. My fav!<br><br>For our shared large plate:<br>1. Phyllo purse--- The owner, Mike, warned us we wouldn&#39;t want to eat it because it was so beautifully presented; yup! he was right! I found the filling to be a little sweet for my taste, however, the mole and &#34;sour cream&#34;  helped balanced the flavors. We ended up only eating half of this (took home the rest) because we were dying to have some dessert.<br><br>Dessert:<br>1. Strawberry Ice Cream --- tasted just like Haagen Dazs!<br>2. Warm Banana Bread with Maple Bourbon Ice Cream--- WOW, was that ice cream silky smooth. I&#39;d order the ice cream just by itself because it was that good!<br><br>Overall an amazing first experience! Mike, the owner, came over to our table many times asking about the food, wine, and even showed us the brunch menu. The establishment&#39;s customer service and food knowledge is OUTSTANDING!!! Just as good, and if not better, than some of the upper echelon restaurants downtown. Can&#39;t wait to go back and share this Somerville gem with friends and family!",

North end traditional Italian restaurant, great wine selection and italian food. <br><br>Went here with a friend for restaurant week and enjoyed one of the three course meal options. I had the veal meatball to start followed by the chicken marsala, and ended with the tiramisu, and my friend had the friend calamari, the strip steak and finished with a canoli. Everything came out in a timely fashion and was prepared to our liking. <br><br>The back wall was lined with TV&#39;s playing old mob movies which were fun to glance at every now and again.<br><br>Mood lighting and a dark red theme. Small bar, but filled with a good selection. Building was particularly small, but it is the north end so square footage is always lacking.<br><br>Great place for a classic italian meal.",

"reviewcomment":"Best Pad See Ew in Boston<br><br>Montien is located in Chinatown accessible by T but somewhat challenging by car unless you park in a local garage.  The service is helpful and prompt.  The ambiance is not noteworthy but certainly appropriate for a Thai restaurant.<br><br>I have been to Montien several times.  I tend not to deviate from my usual game plan because of how good the dishes I like are!  The chicken satay to start is quite good although one of the times I went the chicken was VERY under-cooked and I had to send it back.   The really reason to go to Montien is the pad see ew.  There really is nothing like it.  Delicious flat noodles with baby broccoli and beef and a delicious brown soy-based sauce that is different and better than any other pad see ew sauce I have ever had.  The portion is good-sized and yet I always manage to finish it because it is so delicious.  I have tried the pad thai at Montien and it is also quite good (although not much different from anywhere else).  <br><br>Overall, Montien is definitely worth the trip into Chinatown.  Or, if already there, it&#39;s probably THE place to eat for Thai and a great destination after or before a show.",

Therefore, this review is only about the Phoenix Landing on Thursdays. <br>The sound system is awesome. The place is small but that provides a more intimate environment. Lots of amazing DJs are booked from all around the world. Cover charge is cheap, even for headliners. Beer is affordable. The crowd can be sort of weird sometimes, but whatever. <br>If you like electronic music, and especially drum and bass, you&#39;ve got to check out Elements. This is probably the best place for electronic music in Boston. Come dance.",

I felt surprised--and excited--to see how packed the restaurant was on Saturday night, considering it&#39;s a bit off from the main road (Mass Ave). The crowd made eating here even more fun than eating at the House of Tibet Kitchen (which tends to have fewer customers). A group of three ahead of us had to wait for a table, but since we were just two, we got a small table right away.<br><br>We both loved the food. It all tasted delicious, and it also felt wholesome--like something my mom would have made for me, if she knew how to make amazing Tibetan food. We got a vegetable dish with tomato sauce and a chickpea dish. Perfect sized portions to feel full--without feeling stuffed. And perfectly flavorful without using too much oil or sugar. I want to eat this way every night!<br><br>Has a whole vegetarian section on the menu, plus 100% vegetarian appetizers.",

They are mostly a take-out type place - the atmosphere is not particularly romantic. But the food more than makes up for it. I had some dish of crispy jumbo shrimp in an orange sauce. Oh. my.

"reviewcomment":"We are self-confessed foodies trying out new restaurants mostly based on word-of-mouth and Yelp reviews. <br><br>My boyfriend and I walked to Ariana on a Friday evening. We found that it was a smallish space with tables for perhaps 20-30 people. The ambiance was casual, yet sophisticated. We had not made a reservation before coming. We were welcomed warmly and seated quickly at our spot of choice. In-fact, the hostess moved around a couple of tables to prepare a nice table-for-two for us so we would not have to sit in a noisy corner. We felt that this was a really nice gesture. After we were seated, three of the waitstaff attended to us - one brought the menus, one poured water, and one brought the warm afghan bread with the tasty sauces. Bread was warm and fresh.<br><br>As for food, it was far beyond our expectations. We ordered Aushak and Mantu for appetizers, both delicious and had great flavors to them. I would say unique in its own way. For the main course we went with Dopiaza - well prepared lamb meat served on a piece of bread with sides of juicy mushroom and tasty rice. It was a healthy and hearty combination. We would have liked to try more of their dishes, but two appetizers and one entree later, we had no more space in our tummies.<br><br>The waitstaff was prompt and attentive. As another poster has mentioned, there are four or five of them working hard to keep things moving. They do a great job at it. <br><br>Overall, wonderful food, awesome service, and a nice ambience. I would definitely recommend Ariana, their Aushak, Mantu, and Dopiaza, and would go back to try more of their dishes. Five stars!",

"reviewcomment":"My wife (born and raised in Mexico) and I have been coming here for a year and a half now. I am obsessed with the torta campechana; the only time I will get something else (usually fish tacos or tacos al pastor) is if we come twice in a week. That being said, my wife likes to try new things, and I always have a bite of hers, and everything has been fantastic. Most recently she got mole enchiladas, and I&#39;m thinking next time we go I will be getting that. Oh, they also serve my favorite Mexican beer - Bohemia - which normally would bump them up a star, but 6 stars isn&#39;t an option.<br><br>The new breakfast menu looks awesome too, but we haven&#39;t had a chance to go yet (8-11am). Also, thank the Mexican food gods that they are now open every day of the week. My Sunday Tenoch cravings will no longer go unfulfilled!",

They are mostly a take-out type place - the atmosphere is not particularly romantic. But the food more than makes up for it. I had some dish of crispy jumbo shrimp in an orange sauce. Oh. my.

"reviewcomment":"Great concept, decent burgers, poor layout and onion rings.<br><br>I visited Grassfed with my brother today since he&#39;s a huge fan of both burgers and healthy sustainable food. He ordered the kitchen sink burger and I had the classic cheeseburger with a fried egg. Overall, decently seasoned medium temp patty but not much of the flavor that I would expect from grass fed beef. The toppings were fine (extra points for runny egg, negative points for wan, out of season tomato slices). The potato buns were substantial with good flavor and soft but chewy texture.<br><br>The onion rings were underseasoned and over-battered with an almost funnel cake consistency. All the other customers around us had the sense to order fries, which looked delicious (fresh and well done) but I wasn&#39;t creepy enough to ask to try one. Maybe next time. I will give them credit for an extensive local beer selection with a lot of my favorites represented (who doesn&#39;t love a &#39;gansett tall boy?!)<br><br>The layout also leaves something to be desired. The center seating is positioned too closely to the window bar and creates a butt funnel effect that even Jon Taffer would think is unnecessary.<br><br>My brother and I agreed that Uburgwr continues to be our favorite local fast burger spot for overall flavor. Though we loved the concept of a grass fed burger joint, we would rather make the trek to wild Willys for their grass fed option or pay the extra $8 for an amazing burger at the Fireplace or Craigie on Main.",

The pesto was fresh, they were not stingy with their fresh mozzarella, and the fried green tomatoes were a great!<br><br>The prices were super affordable and their lunch menu looked good as well, it would definitely be on my list of places to go back to.",

(and very tasty, too, I might add...very much like the old-time Jewish delis that were once so plentiful yet now impossible to find).  I&#39;ve ordered several &#34;half&#34; sandwiches here which are actually the size of a very abundantly-filled whole sandwich.  The hot dogs, or &#34;franks,&#34; as they are called here, are quite large and delicious, too!  You must come here with a healthy appetite as portions are very generous...an added plus for any restaurant, in my estimation.  I&#39;d also like to add that the people who work here are so friendly and and quite willing to help if you have any questions.  This is an important fact to me as I enjoy spending my money where the staff are considerate and congenial.  <br><br>The restaurant (a little storefront shop with a small amount of seating) is kept clean, but the decor, which is quite simple, could use a bit of refreshing or added zip.  Perhaps someday there will be more effort put into that aspect of the business. <br><br>Another thing I&#39;d like to add is this:  I think this deli is under new ownership, so anyone who had a problem with the previous owner (who I understand was rather rude), please give this place another try!  As they used to say on the old TV commercial, &#34;Try it, you&#39;ll like it&#34;!",

"reviewcomment":"&#34;Oh Lord, may I be hungry and have about ten minutes to pop into Super 88 Food Court for a #37 at Pho Viet&#39;s whenever I pass the fork of Comm Ave and Brighton Ave.&#34;<br><br>What is a #37? Good question. The menu describes it as Dau Hu Xao Gung Com - Tofu Saute with ginger &amp; scallions with rice. The first awesome surprise is the large mound of rice they serve with it. Included. For about eight bucks you get a rectangular styrofoam carton packed with tofu to die for, incredible ginger sauce and other stuff. Seriously, I was trying to imagine camera angles so I could do savsana and get the restaurant logo into the picture to post to Ugly Yoga Postures to impress all my friends, over a hundred on Facebook alone!<br><br>Other stuff in the stryofoam carton includes about a head of broccoli, peppers, green and red, mushrooms, at least two kinds, baby corn, bok choy and who knows what else.<br><br>Once upon a time I was ambivalent about tofu. Not anymore! If money is no object get an order of fresh vegetarian spring rolls with the peanut sauce.<br><br>I love this place. Everything about it. It&#39;s fast, easy, cheap, a fun place to watch people, easy to park, T accessible, groovy friendly people at the counter and sriracha. Go there! Now.",

No so with shawarma.<br><br>Service: always friendly.<br><br>Food: great flavor, large portion, and oh so delicious.<br><br>Ambience: this is a hole in the wall type of place, there&#39;s not much of an ambience.

MMmmmm!<br><br>In addition to tasty rice and beans, the dish came with an enchilada, and the friendly waiter (who I also had last year) let me pick which kind of enchilada I wanted.  I chose a  cheese one with salsa verde.<br><br>The plate also included a generous portion of delicious guacamole.  Listen, I even have my own molcajete, so I know some good guac, and this is the good stuff.<br><br>The ambience is good too.  It&#39;s not a soulless &#34;modern&#34; place.  It&#39;s got an old world air that contributes to the overall experience, and cute Mexican decor - not tacky.  It&#39;s a lively and somewhat festive place.  They have a patio, as well, though I&#39;ve always dined inside.<br><br>I feel it was a great value for the price.  I easily had enough leftovers for lunch today.<br><br>Oh, I don&#39;t want to forget the Cadillac margarita I got, which was terrific.  My friend got the commemmorativo, which was even smoother for like a quarter more.<br><br>Our waiter was very friendly and smiley.  The place was slammed, to be expected on Cinco de Mayo (!), but we got everything we needed in terms of water refills, etc.<br><br>The sauces are delicious and have depth, and make the food worth paying for, IMHO.<br><br>I am shocked to see other diners saying they go to Anna&#39;s instead.  Anna&#39;s has no flavor except, maybe salt.<br><br>The menu is quite varied - shrimp, fish, liver, beef, pork, chicken and more, in various combinations.<br><br>I will be back.  Everyone I take there wants to go back, too.<br><br>The only criticism is that I feel the salsa is a little heavy on the onions.  The flavor is great, but it can be a bit much.",

And if you are looking for a romantic 3 course meal that will blow your mind, you will be disappointed.<br><br>This is a SPORTS BAR! The menu and food are above average for a SPORTS BAR! You should not bring your kids expecting a family style meal at a SPORTS BAR! <br><br>This is a place you go to watch SPORTS, snack on some bar food, and listen to music. That is it. That&#39;s what this place is.<br><br>With that said, I love this place. It does what it does very well.

I can definitely tell that Blue Fuji has their own flare to each food item and it was refreshing. <br><br>The cost is a bit higher but it is completely worth it if you want something above the normal. <br><br>Only one thing I would note, I wish the spicy mustard had a bit more heat.

For a guy who&#39;s eaten at many many sub places in a couple cities, this is arguably my favorite. <br><br>The Good: Freaking all the food. Everything is fresh and quickly made in massive portions for you. My favorite is surprisingly the hamburger sub. The cheese is generous, the portions again are massive and all the meat and veggies taste ridiculously fresh. Another great option is the steak tip sub. Very generous with the cheese and steak tips. <br><br>The Bad: There really isn&#39;t a downside to this place other than the long lines.",

If you are a lover of pub food and craft beer- you will too. <br><br>They have a great selection of beers on tap that is always changing.

"reviewcomment":"I really like the Red House. It is in a great location in Harvard Square. Has a good beer list. Nice outside patio area and the best part... $1 oysters! All the food that I have had over my times of being there is delicious and fairly priced. <br><br>The only two things I was not a fan of that could bring my rating up to that fifth star is the service and beer prices. Both times I have gone the server would go missing for long periods of time and then appear too often when not needed. To get a dozen oysters we waited nearly 20 minutes on a slow Wednesday afternoon. As for the beer prices, they are unlisted but run around $9 for a beer which can quickly run up the bill if you are not aware of this prior to ordering. Perhaps it is worth it for the price of the oysters but it would have been nice to know before ordering that third or fourth beer. <br><br>Anyways, overall, great place and I will most definitely be back in the future when I am in the area!!",

"reviewcomment":"I had a great meal at Sandrine&#39;s last night for my birthday dinner. <br><br>We had a reservation; I apologized for being a few minutes late, and the host was extremely nice and promptly sat us at an intimate table towards the back of the restaurant. <br><br>After ordering drinks, we started off our meal with the traditional tarte flambée, which is a crispy flatbread topped with cheese, bacon and onions. Such a simple dish, but it was absolutely delicious and one of the best flatbreads I&#39;ve tasted. I would recommend starting off your meal with one. <br><br>I ordered the Choucroute Garnie au Riesling, which was a mix of various meats (including sausage, ham and pork) on top of sauerkraut with fingerling potatoes. It was a little different from what I usually order, and it was delicious! The meats were all cooked perfectly and were juicy. The sauerkraut was also great and melted in my mouth. Just a warning: the mustard they bring you on the side is extremely spicy; I had a tiny amount on a sausage and felt it burn my nose.<br><br>For dessert, we ordered the Vanilla Crème Brulee. A little pricey for what it is ($9), but otherwise a nice ending to our meal. <br><br>Sandrine&#39;s has a romantic and intimate atmosphere. Our servers were friendly and prompt, and we did not feel rushed at all. Overall it was a nice evening. I&#39;d recommend this place for a special occasion. I hope to be back someday!",

"reviewcomment":"Two words: Dessert. Cart.<br><br>Instead of a dessert menu, at the end of your meal you will be presented with a dessert cart with 6 tantalizing dessert options, including a deep dish tiramisu that I will have to go back and try next time. I love dessert and I love being able to see exactly what my food will look like before I order it, so the dessert cart pretty much sealed the deal for me as the perfect way to end our delicious meal. Tip: Based on the two desserts we ordered, desserts appear to be $10 apiece. <br><br>The highlight of my night, aside from the sheer presence of a cart full of desserts, was the Lobster Bisque. I&#39;m not usually partial towards lobster bisques and I was getting lobster risotto for my entree, so I decided to pass on ordering any appetizer in order to save room for dessert at the end. However, after trying a sip of my dad&#39;s bisque, I was sold--dessert was just going to have to make room for this soup. It&#39;s a large portion and just the right balance of creamy and tomato-y with chunks of lobster happily adrift.<br><br>For my entree, I ordered the Lobster Risotto. One thing worth mentioning is that most of the lobster in the risotto, if not all, are all claw meat, including the rubbery pointy tips. It didn&#39;t necessarily detract from the risotto though. Again, it was a large portion and I ended up taking a small half of the risotto home with me. Their portion sizes are definitely one thing that sets them apart from other &#34;fancy food&#34; places.<br><br>My parents both ordered the Pan Seared Sea Scallops, which comes with 5 plump scallops sitting in a shallow pool of sweet creamy corn (which my dad replaced with grilled asparagus) and topped with a crunchy match stick potato garnish. The scallops were super tender and flavorful, yum! <br><br>Bonus stars for Davio&#39;s uncommonly extensive menu--this is definitely another thing that sets them apart. I generally find that expensive/fancy restaurants tend to have very short menus with only a handful of choices for each course, which is problematic because someone in my family often can&#39;t find anything on the menu that they really want to eat. This was definitely not a problem we ran into at Davio&#39;s and we all left with happy bellies.<br><br>All this being said, one of the things Davio&#39;s is known for is being a steakhouse, but none of us ordered any steak so I can&#39;t speak to that part of the Davio&#39;s experience.<br><br>I would definitely recommend Davio&#39;s if you&#39;re looking for a dressy night out in a elegant, spacious restaurant that can accommodate large parties and rocks a dessert cart.",

The space is very nicely designed and organized, though only about 1/3 of the patio was open- it&#39;s so beautiful!<br><br>I had a lemonade which tasted freshly squeezed, but took about 10 minutes.. I had the polenta with Roquefort app and it was tiny but soooo delicious! I seriously considered ordering 4 more instead of an entree. However, I had the lobster risotto and though it was delicious, it was certainly not amazing. Definitely too salty and the sweetness of the lobster (delicate morsels placed on top) was overpowered completely by some spice I couldn&#39;t identify. My friend ordered the veggie burger and it was insane- tasted like meat, with truffles, mmmmm. Our server was very professional but far from warm. I would definitely go back again, but perhaps in warm weather when I can sit on the patio comfortable and power through the cocktail list!",

Most wealthy tourists of Back Bay would cry if they had to eat here. This--I like this.<br><br>--One star for average but not too overpriced Japanese cantina food. You can do better, you can do worse. I had the fried rice with chicken, kimchi, and seaweed. I don&#39;t really like the latter two things, so I let my friends pick at them, but the fried rice and chicken were yummy.<br><br>--One star for being the place where I learned to use chopsticks at the tender age of 23.

We sat at the bar because we get a pot for each person. We got the AYCE and ordered a bunch or vegetables. I got the sirloin beef in Spicy Schezuan and my friend got the beef tongue in Tom Yum broth. They were both delicious! We also got a side of pork belly (there&#39;s actually a name for it) and it was absolutely amazing! The meat is good quality here and broth is yummy too. I don&#39;t have any negative comments about this place. One thing though, don&#39;t get AYCE unless you KNOW you&#39;re going to eat a lot. AYCE was kind of a waste for us because we ended up each ordering one side of meat on the AYCE menu. The pork belly was charged separately because it&#39;s more expensive. So make sure you know your portions!",

Almost all the tables are full of people, carts are scattered throughout the huge dining space, and you know that the dimsum is going to be as fresh as it comes.<br><br>Service is insanely fast if you get there during the peak hours. This is also probably the tastiest food you can have if you&#39;re on a budget -- whenever I visit, it usually comes to about $10 a person and we all end up totally stuffed.",

"reviewcomment":"Any day that starts here is bound to be a great one. Breakfast is the most important meal, as they say, and Brookline definitely delivers. Their menu features everything you want to see on a sleepy Saturday morning.<br><br>It&#39;s a small establishment, so there is often a bit of a wait, however my friend was seated in about 5 minutes. I was running a bit late, and the waitress gruffly told him that they don&#39;t hold tables, but let him stay anyway for some reason. How nice of her.<br><br>Once I arrive, it takes a while for her to take our over. We&#39;re hungry! However, the place is packed (and loud!) and we can see that the cooks in the tiny kitchen working their butts off. All I want in my life right now is a breakfast sandwich! <br><br>After we order, there&#39;s another waiting game. The slow, inattentive service is my biggest complaint about the experience, so don&#39;t come starving (as we had) or need to be anywhere in an hour (as we did). <br><br>Once our meals arrived though, we forgot all of our troubles. It&#39;s so nice to see a full, colorful plate! A hefty sandwich cut in half surrounded by a heap of homefries and veggies. I was feeling especially classy and ordered my breakfast sandwich with salmon, which was a great decision, as the fish was tender and added a nice element. The sandwich is grilled, cheesy, eggy, and just the right amount of drippy and oozy. It&#39;s served on soft Texas toast which is charred perfectly and provides just the right absorbancy and texture to house the mm mm good fillings. <br><br>Homefries were prepared well, although I&#39;ve had better, and I really enjoyed the pile of veggies which provided a (somewhat) healthy balance. The homemade chili sauce on the table was just alright in my opinion, since I didn&#39;t taste much flavor and the heat hits you later. The sandwich itself has flavor for days, so I didn&#39;t find the sauce necessary. The price is also on point, as the meal cost us each under $10 buckaroos.<br><br>Now I can officially conquer the day!",

"reviewcomment":"Went to Meritage during restaurant week, and enjoyed my meal. Surprisingly the restaurant was not full even though it was RW and my group had a nice table and zero wait when we arrived. <br><br>I had the jumbo shrimp appetizer which was actually quite good even though I don&#39;t normally like coconut milk in anything. For the main I had the filet mignon, which was good although a little rarer that I would have liked having ordered medium rare. There was an odd bit of fat in the middle of my filet which wasn&#39;t horrible but just somewhat surprising. The chocolate tasting plate dessert was yummy and the post-meal sweet bites were incredible, especially the raspberry one.<br><br>All in all, this was a good meal, but nothing really blew me away enough to come back and pay full prices.",

"reviewcomment":"Ask my friend B.G. what is his absolute favorite restaurant in Boston, and he says Erbaluce, twice, in different emails. B.G. so far shares very similar taste in food with me, so I promptly made reservation prior to my trip to Boston. B.G. split time apparently between Boston and SF, like another friend of mine, come to think of it. If they are in fact uncanny double i would not be surprised. For appetizers: Dandelion greens and razor neck clams. For second course we had cavatelle with home made sausage. For entries: rack of wild boar and pork cheek. Fantastic bread with white bean dipping sauce, and to cap the evening truffles on the house.  French red to pair of course. <br><br>You would not think south end for Italian, at least for untrained eye such as I, but it was quite amazing. Every course was well executed, with lots of complex flavor profile, and the setting is sophisticated and even romantic (though was not my intent for the evening). There are many theatre goers heading out after, and there are many people waiting for tables on a raining night.  <br><br>For me the food is unique enough because you&#39;d not see this in San Francisco. Just not the same type of food really so the food felt a bit exotic, and thus more attractive to me<br><br>Afterwards, I wrote to B.G., &#34;You may not know this, but your friendship was hinged on your recommendation of a true great Boston restaurant. You did not fail. This time.&#34; <br><br>I have a handful more to try out from his list. But this restaurant definitely deserves a second visit, if not more.",

"reviewcomment":"Sorella&#39;s is my favorite, no frills breakfast diner located in Jamaica Plains. About 10 minutes away from JP&#39;s ASPCA and literally across the street from Whole Foods. <br><br>50+ omelette options and the portions are always hearty. From pancakes to waffles, you are spoiled for choice here my friends. Amazing prices, ~$7 omelettes included with 2 pieces of toast. <br><br>++Recommend the Mexican omelette- the jalapeno peppers mixed with the melting cheese and salsa is great for my spicy fanatics. <br><br>The owner with the Boston accent and the staff have always been sweet hearts. <br><br>Martin&#39;s in Brookline used to be my favorite, but Sorella&#39;s is my new rave given that it&#39;s less claustrophobic. <br><br>What makes a great diner is not only the food but also the atmosphere. I like my diners having this dated feel without the rushed service or the claustrophobic feels. I like my diners as a place where I can dress like shit, a place with the homey feels. <br><br>The decor is charming. Stepping into Sorella&#39;s feels like a step back into the 80s. The walls are adorned with all sorts of knicknacks from certificates, colorful construction papers featuring hand written new menus, to a plaque of the state of Chicago. You can seriously play a game of &#34;I Spy&#34; with the things plastered along their turquoise-on-pink walls. All around a charming place, a Boston keepsake.",

Our server(s) still treated us as a valued guest and gave the utmost respect, which I really found important throughout my experience here.<br><br>We both ordered from the $95 prix fixe menu. There were tons of freebie bites in between!<br>What we got:<br><br>Hamachi (+)<br>Chilled Maine Lobster<br><br>East Coast Halibut<br>Faroe Island Salmon (++)<br><br>Berkshire Pork Belly (+)<br>Quail (++)<br><br>Baba au Rhum<br>Rhubarb Vacherin (Interesting...)<br><br>They also gave these for free:<br>caviar hamachi roll<br>savory macaron (goat cheese)<br>foie gras, jelly on crostini<br>Dark chocolate dessert bites<br>A bowl of macarons<br><br>Even though the entrees were small portions, the dishes were really savory and flavorful that we were beyond stuffed. We were too full to eat from the cheese cart. It looked amazing. <br><br>Overall, I had the best dining experience at Menton. They also got us a cab after our meal, and treated us with respect and the best service, even though we were the youngest guests in the restaurant and didn&#39;t order drinks.",

"reviewcomment":"My boyfriend and I recently took a trip to Boston and we were advised to eat at the Chart House. The hotel had given us a map which had a coupon for a free appetizer (Chef&#39;s Special). They orignally sat us downstairs with no view of the water but we asked to be moved and they graciously moved us to the space upstairs. The place is huge! Our waiter was AMAZING! He was honestly the nicest man. He answered our questions about the city and made sure everything was ok, he was funny and very likable. <br><br>For an appetizer we had the Coconut Shrimp, which was on the house and delicious.<br><br>For the entree we both ordered Salmon, which was fresh and also very delicious. We were expecting small portions because that usually happens in places like this. The portions were very big, so you do get your moneys worth. <br><br>Our waiter was so good that he convinced us to get dessert which was a chocolate molten cake with vanilla ice-cream. I was so stuffed but this cake was so good that I couldn&#39;t stop eating it.<br><br>Everything was 5-star worthy! They should consider getting treadmills so people can run off the food after they eat. Although, the waiter did tell me I can run up and down the stairs a couple of times.",

"reviewcomment":"What a mind-blowing, tastebud-tantalizing experience! Came here after a day of shopping on Sunday. The space is huge and kind of reminds me of a Vegas restaurant in terms of the decor and exuberance. They do actually have a location in Vegas, as well as other parts of the U.S.<br><br>The salad bar has amazing choices, such as coconut haddock, pickled cherry peppers, thinly sliced prosciutto, cheeses, mango shrimp salad, etc. I almost got full just eating those!<br><br>The server also brings out complimentary sides before eating the meat, which include cheesey bread, fried polenta sprinkled with a salty cheese, garlic mashed potatoes, and caramelized bananas (not plantains sadly, but still good). These are unlimited by the way! :DDDDD<br><br>The meats come out in rounds and a lot of the time they will ask you if you are waiting for something in particular and they will get someone to bring it out for you in the next round.<br><br>My top meat choices:<br>-Linguica<br>-Filet mignon wrapped in bacon<br>-Sirloin<br><br>The organization, speediness, and friendliness of the staff was impeccable and unique to the sometimes poor service you get at other large chains.<br><br>The price was a bit pricey at around $55 per person, but for the variety and service you receive when dining here, it is worth every single penny. I actually can&#39;t wait to go back again. Have to try their different versions of Caipirinhas, too!",

"reviewcomment":"Based on the food-gasm-splosion that is TTR, I am completely redefining my rating algorithm. There&#39;s just no way that Tip Tap Room should be allowed to be in the same category as Tasty Burger (no offense, Tasty Burger, I still love you). It should be illegal, do you hear me? Goddamn illegal to even consider the possibility. I mean, based on my previous metric, Tip Tap Room should be rated about 10,000 stars. INFINITY STAR!!! I should start quoting Shakespeare now, like when Juliet waxes poetic about Romeo&#39;s face and how it&#39;s like all the stars in the sky or whatever. Bullshit! That wasn&#39;t Romeo&#39;s face, that was Tip Tap Room, son. <br><br>In this restaurant, literally everything single thing you can put in your mouth is insanely delicious. Including the cocktails, including the tablecloths, including the wait staff, should you charm your way into letting you lick their faces. These people are made of gumdrops and jelly beans. But. The best best BEST item on the menu is, in my humble opinion, the wild boar meatballs. Remember when I called ANYTHING ELSE amazeballs? I was wrong. THESE are AMAZE BALLS! These are literal, tangible amaze balls you can put in your mouth. And trust me, you will want these balls in your mouth. Since the menu is always changing, I would just recommend you skim through the entire thing and select what looks like the craziest, most unappetizing item. Order it, eat it, and I promise you won&#39;t regret it.<br><br>And wouldn&#39;t you know, the genius behind this glorious establishment, Brian Poe, is just about the most generous, dedicated, RIDICULOUS (in an awesome way) man you&#39;ll ever meet. Every night he drives around town and surveys his three restaurants, chatting with customers and just gushing all his food-love, which he has a LOT of. It&#39;s like his food-heart is 3x the size of a normal person&#39;s, and it&#39;s overflowing with passion for the culinary arts. If you get the chance, say hello, listen to him describe his recipes, take a ride in his jeep. He will probably offer you one. Just like the menu, it might sound crazy, but just go with it. Just go man. Just go.",

"reviewcomment":"I find it difficult to write a review on this place, as I feel it would take a couple of visits to have an overall experience of what Osaka has to offer. Part of the restaurant is allocated to what some would call &#34;Japanese Show-cooking&#34;, there is a huge underground bar for non-food related entertainment and then there is a space dedicated to the more classic restaurant experience. I only attended the latter and will thus limit my review to my experience there.<br><br>With Bento boxes priced at about 20-25$ each, Osaka is not a cheap place to go. But you get plenty of food for that. I ordered Bento Box number 3. I first got a Miso soup, followed by amazing spicy tuna maki. The rest of my Bento box included teriyaki beef, rice, dumplings and tempura (fried vegetables). The food was good.<br><br>Overall very nice experience in a nice setting, though I believe that prices are a bit steep. If you are just interested in having a Japanese meal in a traditional restaurant setting, there are other places in town that offer similar food at better prices. Osaka is probably a place to be considered more by the show show-cooking fans!",

"reviewcomment":"I&#39;m usually at Tavern in the Square (TITS) once, maybe twice a week. Why? Well, it pretty much hits on all cylinders for me: cold beer, great TV setup, good food, and I can walk there (sorry, I know that last one just applies to me). <br><br>It&#39;s also a very versatile bar. It&#39;s the only bar I know of that I could probably throw down some shots, black out, and rage on a Saturday night; and then meet my parents there for brunch on Sunday morning. <br><br>However, if you do have a night out here, try to manage your expectations on the amount of cash you&#39;ll spend. Those tall craft beers get expensive in a hurry, and paired with some relatively pricey food, don&#39;t be shocked to drop somewhere in the neighborhood of $40-$50 bucks a head. <br><br>NFL Sundays are also amazing here, as I&#39;m already jonesin&#39; for the season to start back up.",

"reviewcomment":"Beacon Hill Bistro<br>February 20th, 2014 by Richard Chudy <br><br>075<br><br>It&#39;d probably be simpler if we could ignore price and just focus on the quality of the burger in hand. In some ways, price is just one factor of many, but it&#39;s always something to think about, especially when that price tag slowly creeps higher and higher. But the flavor of the beef can often trump the price tag, within reason of course, and that beef better be damn great to be worthy of semi-frequent visits. The Beacon Hill Bistro burger launches off at $16, which comes with a side of fries and a red eye aioli (more on that later), and nothing else. Upgrading with cheese (cheddar or blue) will set you back $2, as will the bacon of the day. Of course I went with both, and for all you math majors out there, that comes to a grand total of $20. But how was it?<br><br>Nestled into a soft English Muffin, which appeared to have a small bite removed from the front, the burger is loosely packed, grilled and definitely on the thicker side of things. I&#39;m not sure the English Muffin is the proper choice here, as the patty is simply too tall and hefty, causing the English Muffin to kind of crumble at times, but that&#39;s mostly due to one hell of a juicy burger. The beef, I must say, is one of the top three beefy burger experiences I&#39;ve had to date. Seasoned flawlessly, cooked even better (a perfect medium-rare across the board) this burger is crazy juicy from start to finish and wouldn&#39;t give up. The taste of the grill is there, not in an overly charred way, just balanced, smoky and delightful. Ground daily from sirloin and copious amounts of beef fat (sometimes with the additions of brisket and/or short rib), it&#39;s an 8oz. burger done right in every which way. A side of piping hot fries are dusted with herbs; they arrive nice and salty and are crispy and ever so fluffy. The bacon of the day on this day was a Mangalitsa guanciale, a salt, pepper and herb cured piece of jowl that is dried then sliced raw. It&#39;s like eating the straight-up fat on a strip of bacon, cut just too thick for my liking, and not fully melting on top like was intended, similar to a piece of lardo. Still, I applaud the effort in doing something different with the bacon family, and creativity gets points even if the execution didn&#39;t fully do it for me. Cheddar cheese is slightly detectable but if I had to do it again, I&#39;d probably omit, wishing it was included in the regular $16 price tag. It was the rare time where cheese didn&#39;t necessarily add anything to the burger. Red Eye Aioli was just fine, a little light on both on the espresso and the chili oil front flavor-wise, but much like the bacon, the effort of doing something outside the box will always yield an appreciation.<br><br>If you did strip down this burger for the basic package of $16 with a side of fries, you&#39;d be in burger purist heaven. Cheese and bacon are generally automatics, but in this case, they almost get in the way of the beefy endeavor that awaits. Right up there with the beef from all the other greats like Craigie on Main and Back Bay Social Club, Beacon Hill Bistro makes a hell of a beefy burger. Is it worth $20? I&#39;m not sure any burger truly is, but this one is easily deserving of hanging with the top notch fancy burgers in town.",

Both occasions were when the weather was gorgeous and the outdoor seating gives you a very pretty view of the city! <br><br>Service has been consistently good. The last time I went the waitress was new. When she was unsure of something on the menu she just took the order and updated us which was easier than going back as forth. Food came out in no time.<br><br>The breakfast cocktails are great, especially if you like Bloody Mary&#39;s! They have about 6 varieties. I&#39;ve been very satisfied with the brunch foods. My friend like her Eggs Benedict and my breakfast sandwich was perfect. The best part, though, are the home fries! They are super crunchy on the outside but still soft on the inside.

To my surprise, the Cellar does buns right.<br><br>My bf got a burger and pork bun, I got a couple sliders (burger and lobstah), and we were pretty happy with it all. It&#39;s all in the freakin&#39; bread. The bun was so light, slightly toasty, and fluffy... I just don&#39;t know how they do it. Is it a potato bun? Is it a pretzel bun? I JUST DON&#39;T KNOW.

"reviewcomment":"Kudos to this place for having live music every night, usually with no cover, and when there is a cover it&#39;s usually only $5.<br><br>The food is solid but it&#39;s too expensive for what it is. I wouldn&#39;t go here if I were going out for barbecue, I would go if I wanted to see some music and get a meal while I was there. <br><br>I wish the bar area was larger because if there are more than a few people there just drinking then there&#39;s nowhere to hang out. <br><br>Gotta mention that the bathrooms are really clean, and also there&#39;s a free public parking lot out back. <br><br>Best night to go is on Tuesday was Eddie and boys are playing.

"reviewcomment":"This is a Chinatown staple, I was a bit worried  because of a lot of negative reviews but then I saw the fish tanks for myself and saw how clean it was. My worries disappeared! So I knew that the restaurant would be packed and saw online that they took reservations and so I called ahead to make a reservation for us. What a good call! When we got there, the place was packed and the line was practically out the door. Imagine the looks we got as we walked to the front of the line and said we had a reservation and were seated right away.<br><br>The first dish to come out was the sizzling steak dish. Not too sure what makes it sizzle, the extremely  hot black rock? So usually at a chinese restaurant, they offer you chopsticks. I didn&#39;t realize that Chinese people eat their rice with chopsticks too. Have you ever attempted such a feat? Their rice doesn&#39;t stick together like Japanese rice and Korean rice. Anywho, trying to eat the steaks with chopsticks was a bit of a task. Luckily, I spotted their silverware drawer and ransacked it for all the forks and knives I could hold in one hand.<br><br>Since this place is known for their seafood, i mean it&#39;s in the name, we got the creme de la creme of the ocean, Lobster! They brought out 2 huge lobsters which were boiled and then cooked in a ginger and scallion sauce. I wish they had brought out one of those seafood shell cracker-thing-a-ma-jiggys cuz it would&#39;ve helped to eat some of the smaller pieces. But overall, the lobster was cooked fine and the sauce was good.<br><br>My mom insisted on getting the seafood treasure nest. Scallop, shrimp and calamari inside a taro pastry shell with a light sauce. I really liked the contrast in texture between the shrimp/scallop versus the taro pastry.  Can you tell I was a huge fan of the taro pastry shell?<br><br>We were looking for a carb dish for our feast and it was down to noodle vs fried rice. We decided to go with the noodles but weren&#39;t in the mood for the thick rice noodle and went with the pan fried noodles. I love how the heat from the beef and sauce soften the crispy fried noodles. It was really delicious and complemented the rest of our meal perfectly.",

We came in earlier today to order Margherita pizza.<br><br> When we got it however, my husband was a bit disappointed as Otto&#39;s margherita is different from the classical style (no tomato sauce, but cut tomatoes instead). My hubby specifically orders margheritas because he is on low cholesterol diet and on those rare days when he gets pizza he only gets margheritas. He explained the situation to Otto&#39;s team and to our pleasant surprise they made another pizza for him that fit the classical style and had minimal cheese!<br><br>We were very happy at the end of the day! :-) Yay for customer service.",

"reviewcomment":"This review is for onion bialys from Kupel&#39;s.<br><br>We have lived a block and a half away since some years before Allan Kupelnick started the bakery in the late 1970s. We remember the original Freedman Bakery at the site, the former King Bagel across Fuller St., the former Nat Bluestein&#39;s market where there seemed to be a different price for every customer, the former Hecht&#39;s drug store, the original Rubin&#39;s deli and the six former kosher meat markets in the area before Butcherie. Originally Kupel&#39;s wasn&#39;t kosher, but then Allan gave way and got a hechsher.<br><br>About seven years ago, Allan sold Kupel&#39;s to a long-time employee, Farzard Ghorbi, who kept the bakery kosher but has gradually changed some of the products and developed new ones, including the current version of onion bialys. The new ways also include toasting ovens, toppings cabinets with about 30 choices and recently more cafe seating.<br><br>Allan was an innovator, too--developing what became New England-style bagels with seasonings mixed into the dough instead of laid on the outside. In time, we came to like the style, especially when made with onion and poppy seed--no longer made that way at Kupel&#39;s.<br><br>With onion bialys, the current Kupel&#39;s has gone some distance toward recreating a great Jewlsh bakery product of the late nineteenth and early twentieth century in New York City--to be contrasted with versions of bialys available today in the city, even from Kossar&#39;s. Latter-day bialys in New York City are mostly flavorless, very dense, sometimes hard and often tough as leather if you don&#39;t get them only a few minutes out of the oven.<br><br>Unless you happen upon them just baked, the onion bialys from Kupel&#39;s need to be reheated--about five minutes in a thermal oven at 350 F or three minutes under a broiler or in a toaster oven. If not consumed within a few hours, they are best frozen until wanted and thawed in a microwave and reheated as described. Then you can coat bare parts with butter, cream cheese or another spread. You should find crusts somewhat crisp and interiors medium open, soft and chewy--close to the textures of a classic bialy.<br><br>Kupel&#39;s onion bialys are about 13 cm (5 in) diameter, 4 cm (1-1/2 in) height and 150 g (5-1/4 oz) weight. Shapes are irregular, but weights are more consistent. Center hollows are not well defined. Crusts are lightly dotted with flour and baked to a spotted pale golden color. The topping is a generous amount of minced onion, probably reconstituted from dried flakes but crisp on top from baking at moderate temperature. There is no aroma of olive oil, and there are no poppy seeds.<br><br>The key issues with bialys from Kupel&#39;s are a slight sweetness that can become annoying and crusts that after reheating become more crunchy than crisp--both suggesting bagel intrusions into bialy techniques. The price at Kupel&#39;s is $1.50 in singles as compared with $0.90 in singles at Kossar&#39;s, but adjusted for weights the prices per ounce are about the same.",

They make their fro-yo in one of those machines that blends all of the ingredients into it so you can add almost anything you want into the froyo (they have a very long list). I tend to stick with the Chocolate and then add in butterfingers and heath bar, but that it my standard go to. They also give you a very good portion, sometimes I might even say too much (but can you ever really have too much fro-yo?) Even during the polar vortex this winter I still craved fro-yo and found myself eating it in below freezing temps. If you are a fan of Fro-yo definitely stop by angora.",

No foodies ourselves, we listened to our foodie friends and went to Clio.<br><br>We made our reservations online the week before, planning for the tasting menu. Unfortunately, because we each had to get up early and be functional the next morning, we opted against the wine pairing. Our made us regret this decision, and I think next time we will try the wine pairing. Instead we had the house cocktails, which although good, were not what inspired this 5 star review.<br><br>I don&#39;t want to go through all 14 courses, but notable items include the parsnip foam cassoulet with sea urchin and lobster. I didn&#39;t know such a thing existed! <br><br>I also never knew cod could taste so good.

"reviewcomment":"Symphony Sush has long been a favorite of mine for a fast and healthy, and not outrageously priced, lunch in this area. I&#39;m posting now because I just got a bento-box take-out (unagi, my favorite) and am seriously impressed with its packaging. <br><br>This review will not be at all helpful to customers dining in, but I just have to applaud the restaurant for putting effort into a take-out container with separate sections perfectly sized and apportioned to their dine-in meal. Additionally, unlike at some restaurants, they made sure to include the miso soup which comes with the meal when I dine in. So, props for creating a &#39;dining experience,&#39; through appropriate packaging and thought, not at all far removed from that I would get if I were in-house.",

We were greeted with a smiling staff who kept an eye on us even when the big rush started.<br>They have a short but solid beer list and a good sized menu. It only takes up one side of the page, but I still couldn&#39;t decide what I wanted! Everything looked good. I settled on one of their pizzas that had proscuitto, mozz, arugula, and cherry tomatoes. I want to go back to try some of their appetizers. <br>They have tonssss of televisions in there to watch any game. We even overheard talk of some Bruins players hanging out in there the night before! A great place for sports fans.",

"reviewcomment":"Okay, people. If you&#39;re expecting to get your rear kissed and get all the amenities of a standard restaurant, you aren&#39;t going to get it here. This is a beachside joint. It is what it is. Yes, the lobster roll is overpriced. It&#39;s a friggin&#39; lobster roll. In fact, a lot of the stuff is overpriced, but it is also very good, so quit your whining. About the roast beef, sometimes it is fantastic, sometimes it isn&#39;t. If you had bothered to look, you would have noticed that they cut it from the whole roast. What this means is that if you happen to get your beef from closer to an end, it is going to be drier and possibly overcooked. You try cooking a whole roast beef and then complain. When you get it from closer to the middle, it is deep pink, juicy, and wonderful. They also make the best breakfast sandwiches I have ever had.<br><br>About the service, what do you expect from people who have to deal with so many people at once? Try it when it isn&#39;t so crowded. They are actually pretty nice. Also, Kelly&#39;s is open until 4 AM and opens at 6 AM. I have seen them open during blizzards and hurricanes.

So we were super excited when it reappeared recently on their specials. Curious, we asked the guy behind the counter why they had removed it in the first place. He said that it was because not that many people were ordering it (what?!) but since chorizo has become more popular lately (about damn time!), they put it back as a special. To keep it on there, he asked us to spread the word and tell people to order it more. So GO ORDER IT.<br><br>Wolf Man.<br>(monster burger with cheddar cheese, bacon, over-medium egg, &amp; sriracha mayo)<br>I only got this the one time and will probably not order it again anytime soon since I still want to live a little longer. I mainly wanted to include it in this review so to warn others. It was a good burger but damn, I thought I was going to keel over and die of a heart attack afterwards. I think it might have been the egg that was overkill for me since eggs can be fairly filling on their own. But sriracha mayo! YAY for sriracha!<br><br>The fourth star is purely for the service. Every time b. and I have been in, everyone has been friendly and helpful. There is one guy in particular (the one that was telling us to recruit more chorizo eaters) that is super friendly and welcoming. YAY.",

Plan accordingly.<br><br>Alright, rarely do I come to a place and feel like every single menu item is equally delicious. Usually, I will go to a restaurant or cafe, venture around in the menu until I find something I like and then I&#39;ll stick with it. This place makes me want to be adventurous. Every hand crafted sandwich, fresh ingredient and warm baked treat feels like their &#34;special of the day.&#34;<br><br>Their coffees are warm and hearty, their staff is kind and personable, and their teas (while lighter than I usually enjoy) are still refreshing.<br><br>Alright, here are my shout-outs:<br><br>Greek yogurt, you&#39;re so thick and creamy, but your taste is gentle and comforting. The honey is just fluid enough to make the combination agreeable. You&#39;re always best topped with strawberries and granola.<br><br>Egg and feta sandwich, thank you for being in my life. You&#39;re definitely, hands down, without a doubt, my favorite egg sandwich that I&#39;ve ever had. The egg is so fluffy, the feta is soft and moist, the tomato flavor pops (maybe because it&#39;s tomato season again finally?!), and the arugula just adds that bit of unique flavor to the dish.<br><br>Finally, chai muffin with espresso icing, the fact that you can be sweet, slightly bitter, and never dry is something to appreciate. Everyone wants something different in a muffin, but to me you&#39;re as close to perfect as a muffin can get.<br><br>(Sorry for the whimsy, but definitely try this cafe ASAP.)",

Most of these types of places are also priced like chicken nuggets, so I cannot complain too much. This place is much different however. I keep on going back for the house fish and vegetable dumplings. <br><br>The service is terrible btw. Don&#39;t even expect a smile.",

"reviewcomment":"This is one of our favorite Japanese Restaurants in Cambridge. We had dinner at  Blue Fin on Thursday evening. For those looking for sushi, this place offers the usual mix of sushi along with specials. For those looking for authentic Japanese food at a reasonable price, you ought to give this gem a try. We ordered three appetizers: a special - monk fish liver (fresh tako sunomono); nasu miso eggplant (nasu dengaku); spinach with bonito (ohitashi). All three were delicious. For entrees, we ordered the silver cod (gindara) and the Atka (hokke) mackerel. The gindara was marinated with miso and saki and was quite good. On the other hand the hokke was a bit on the dry side. The service was very good and prompt. Blue Fin updated the restaurant some years ago and aside from a few flat screen TVs and nice new menus, it doesn&#39;t appear much updating has been done since then. Overall a great dining experience.",

I made plans to meet my friend for an evening drink on Friday, and it was packed for the Bruin&#39;s game. We decided to sit in the dining room (there is a pub and a dining room, both with bars). I had a hard week at work, so I ordered a dark and stormy. It was pretty good, but nice and strong (just what I needed). My friend had a glass of wine, and she was excited to see how full it was (worth every penny).<br><br>So aside from a drink, I needed sweets...I got the flourless chocolate cake. It was a smaller portion than I had hoped, that being said, it was rich, and amazing. Who makes their desserts? It was a dome of chocolate (not too dense, but very rich), with a pool of chocolate and a mountain of whipped cream. My friend ordered it as soon as she saw mine.

I cannot stress how fresh and amazing the fish is here. The only way to truly appreciate the quality and expertise of the sushi chefs is to get a seat at the bar and watch them do magic tricks with extremely sharp cutlery.<br><br>Everything I have ever got at Super Fusion my girlfriend describes as, &#34;the best ... ever.&#34; It is kind of like Richard Lewis coining, &#34;the blank from hell&#34; on curb your enthusiasm, but she uses the phrase A LOT at this spot. Normally I would tell her to stop overreacting and enjoy the melt in your mouth tuna, or the char grilled eel, but at Super Fusion, I have to agree with her. <br><br>I know there are fancier, larger, and more expensive sushi restaurants around the beacon street area, but it would be foolish to spend more money on an inferior product. <br><br>MY ADVICE: Go grab a six pack from around the corner (or some saki if your into it), take the short walk to super fusion, and make anybody fall in love with your expert taste in sushi hidden gems.",

"reviewcomment":"Salts is my favorite restaurant in Boston, and I fine dine a lot. It has the most creative dishes and hospitable service. It&#39;s sad that the kitchen flooded over their winter holiday, and so they&#39;re temporarily closed. <br><br>Service is a bit slow and the chairs a bit uncomfortable, so expect to be there for a while, especially if you&#39;re getting the chef&#39;s tasting menu. Nevertheless, every bite is delectable and savory, and the food presentation is immaculate. <br><br>Next time I go, I&#39;ll be getting the duck, which needs to be ordered beforehand!",

Whenever my friends in Florida brag about the weather they&#39;re having...I brag about the Garlic and Lemons I&#39;m having. In my pre Garlic and Lemons days I was a Greek salad fiend...now I can&#39;t get enough fattoush. I&#39;ve tried to recreate this at home, but it is impossible. The thought of it right now is making my mouth water. <br><br>The portions are huge and either the saj rollup or combo plates are enough for two meals. I HIGHLY suggest getting the saj...your choice of meat (any meat other than the spicy beef...it&#39;s a bit over seasoned for my liking), with plenty of veggies (I always get extra pickles), and hummus all wrapped in a thin saj rap and grilled. <br><br>I haven&#39;t had one side I didn&#39;t like. They let me substitute the rice in the combo plate for extra salad, so I usually opt for tabouleh or extra fattoush (I really am obsessed). Make sure to get some spicy garlic sauce at the register! The staff is so friendly and even if there is a line it most fast. <br><br>NOW GO!",

"reviewcomment":"Went here for birthday dinner this week with a guest. An utterly lovely time in a beautiful room with professional (but human) service. <br><br>We both did the tasting menu, which is really where you order off the menu and they throw in one or two small courses and stage it all appropriately. Each course was presented beautifully; the beet salad stood out as one of the more unique presentations of beets I&#39;ve seen. The other app of cheese tartine was delicious. Main courses of scallops and mutton were wonderful. Through all the courses there was a healthy use of greens, which added wonderfully to the texture and flavor of the dishes.<br><br>Service was on point, knowledgeable, and not too serious. Everyone has a sense of humor and seems to really be enjoying working there. <br><br>In all, a great experience.  It&#39;s a bit pricey to make it a regular destination for me, but I can&#39;t wait to return.",

"reviewcomment":"I love this little spot! I first stumbled upon Trattoria Il Panino while lost on a trip in Boston before the days of yelp, Google maps, etc. When I eventually moved I tried hard for ages to find this spot again until I just forgot about it. Then when Google street view became available, I decided to sweep the North End. After quite a bit of searching, I found it! And promptly made reservations. <br><br>The search was well worth it. The food is delicious, the staff are the real deal (really really Italian I mean), and the place was just as cozy as I had remembered. A small dining room with view of the kitchen and a heated, tented area that stays open even during some of the colder weather (not sure whether it stays open in winter, but it is in the Fall and Spring). <br><br>Love the veal, love the gnocchi, and love the pesto pasta.",

"reviewcomment":"Great googly moogly this is the BEST italian restaurant in the Boston area. It&#39;s such a hidden jewel that the smithsonian should put it next to the hope diamond in their museum. Forget the north end. This place is in the back of a little deli/ grocery store. Just going there makes me feel like someone is &#34;going to make me an offer I can&#39;t refuse.&#34;<br><br>The apps were amazing and fast. I ordered the veal prime rib with pesto pasta. The meat was cooked perfectly. It was so tender, meaty and melt in your mouth I never wanted it to end. The pasta was perfectly al dente. The pesto sauce was well developed and seasoned. It was really fresh too, the basil hadn&#39;t even stopped growing yet. Anytime I get a craving for italian food, this is where I go. The food was so good I forget what the service is like. Dumbledore himself could have served it to me in his hat and gown, I still probably wouldn&#39;t have noticed. Writing this makes me want to go to there.....FYI the prices may seem high for a somerville restaurant...but I would gladly give my first born if I could be guaranteed a life time of dining options from this place. Alas the owner is not rumpilstilskin.",

"reviewcomment":"positive: Intimate space. not too loud during the night I went (Saturday night at 7pm) w two friends. <br><br>negative: The soba soup was just ok. I enjoyed the cabbage, mushrooms, both, but chicken and noodles were overcooked. <br><br>positive: the portions were decent. I went to Shiki the week before and though their food is more authentic, the portions left you wanting more so I left feeling I paid too much there. w Gari, I left quite full. <br><br>pos: wasabi was not from powder form. so good in that it was quite pungent. and more flavorful. but bad if you were expecting power form. <br><br>pos: clean bathroom. interesting sink. <br><br>neg: udon noodles were about the same as the soba. (meat was too dry/over cooked) sides(veg, broth) were good, but noodles seemed boiled way before I arrived. or over soggy. <br><br>pos: sushi rolls were aesthetically pleasing as well as creative. I had to have one (even though Im pregnant). <br><br>neg: donkkas (sp?) was a bit hard/over fried. meat should be tender and crispy on outside. It was hard and a bit too chewy on inside. crisp on outside was fine. means they did not tenderize the pork. <br><br>pos: Groupons rock.<br><br>pos: waitress was attentive. And yes. egg is in the soup. at least the udon. nicely pouched. <br><br>Overall: good experience. might come back w hubby w/o a groupon even. good for datenight. but I can see how not all sat evenings would be as nice as ours was. it was not too crowded and not too empty.

"reviewcomment":"After walking Hanover looking for a place to eat, this place won by default since there didn&#39;t seem to be a line outside, and it was raining. The main dining area and bar were nice and cozy, but we were seated downstairs and despite the attempt at decorating (fake grapes hanging from the ceiling), it still felt like a basement.<br><br>Before your meal, they bring a bread basket with dipping plate. The bread was good but would&#39;ve been better served warm. The dipping oil was amazing with fresh garlic, crushed red pepper and other spices. We started with fried mozzarella and the pear/prosciutto/goat cheese plate. The mozzarella was good, but the pear dish won us over. The sweet, salty and savory flavors together were just fantastic on the palate. Collectively, we had the bolognese, gnocchi and spinach ravioli. I had a chance to try everything, and the spinach ravioli was my favorite with a touch of sweetness from the honey butternut squash cream sauce. The gnocchi was tender and not chewy like I often find, but the dish itself was kind of boring with just marinara. The bolognese was good, but there was not much meat to be found, and I felt that the sauce tasted too much of wine. <br><br>I probably would&#39;ve given five stars but the server was short with us, and not so friendly. He rushed us through ordering, and did not provide much for recommendations. On the plus side, the bartender upstairs gave my insistent friend a glass of bourbon so she could mix it with her own Pellegrino lemonade.",

I stop in here (or one of the other Flour locations) at least once a week for a treat, and I&#39;ve thoroughly enjoyed almost everything I&#39;ve tried. <br><br>My favorites are:<br>-Sticky Bun Bread Pudding: Flour&#39;s sticky buns may be famous, and making a bread pudding version is genius.<br>-Brownie: The most chocolatey, dense, and rich brownie. If you are a brownie-skeptic this will change your mind.<br>-Breakfast Sandwich: A bit pricey in my opinion, but a huge egg, arugula, and bacon sandwich on brioche that puts other breakfast sandwiches to shame<br>-Meringue Clouds: These simply look whimsical and fun. Also something that you don&#39;t really find elsewhere, so that adds to the appeal.<br><br>The only downside to Flour is that is frequently is PACKED, but when there is a line it generally moves for quickly.",

"reviewcomment":"West Bridge has an inexpensive, unpretentious lunch menu and a moderately expensive, completely pretentious dinner menu. However, both menus are prepared impeccably well and the staff is very friendly overall. The waiters tend to be very enthusiastic about the menu and knowledgable. The cocktail menu is unique and has some great designer drinks. The bartenders are also very knowledgeable and happy to get creative and whip up a mystery drink if you&#39;re feeling adventurous. <br><br>The only thing I&#39;m knocking them down a star for is the speed of their service. They tend to be slow, sometimes painfully slow. I&#39;m not sure if they&#39;re understaffed in the kitchen or on the floor, but I&#39;ve been there more times than I can count and everything takes longer than you would anticipate. If you&#39;re not in a rush, you won&#39;t be disappointed. Just be sure to plan on a little extra time getting in and out.",

"reviewcomment":"Between 3.5-4<br><br>A couple of friends and I went here one night for margaritas as my friend works in Faneuil hall and the prices are right. We split the appetizer guacamole between the 2 of us. The molcajete it was served in is huge, thus the portion is very big. Oh and not to mention, the bottomless tortilla chip refills as well. As a seasoned guacamole taster, I feel confident saying the guac was delicious. I do prefer more cilantro in my guacamole, but in fairness, I have an unusual liking for cilantro and heavily cover a lot of my dishes at home in it. So, aside from liking more cilantro in my guacamole, it was really tasty. So tasty that my one friend and I polished off the whole serving with 3 chip refills :x  <br>From talking to the waiter, who is also one of  the managers, we learned that everything is made in house, from the taco seasoning mixes to the margarita mixes-big bonus! <br><br>We went to Zumas for the margaritas. Oh so tequila tasty. We each got the classic margaritas, not the Zumas classic, but the other classic. They were very good: strong and tangy! Just how they should be! <br><br>A couple of hours and margaritas later we were full, and feeling very good. <br><br>The service was fast and friendly. I will be back for some more",

"reviewcomment":"If you&#39;re craving a fantastic North End style meal without the expense and tourism bum&#39;s rush, this is the place to go for real Eastie style Italian food. We sat in the lounge area where it&#39;s a little less formal and the service was friendly and personable like a trattoria even though the decor is decked out to be a fancy dining experience. <br><br>The thing that&#39;s nice about this place is both the view, the ease of getting there (plenty of parking) and there&#39;s clearly care on the personal touch to keep it from being just another Italian restaurant in Boston. There&#39;s no rushing, timing is dead on between courses, and the food is just phenomenal. <br><br>We had the mushroom Risotto and the stuffed veal chop and I haven&#39;t had a meal like that since going to Rinos over in Eastie, our favorite next to Kelly&#39;s Pub.  The risotto had three types of mushrooms and was just infused with flavor. The chop was perfectly done, huge, and nestled in with tasty sides and a light marsala sauce. Unbelievable.  Just perfectly done and the pricing right on for the quality of the experience.",

"reviewcomment":"I&#39;ve lived around the corner from Hana for six years, and I never get tired of this place. I love sushi, and I&#39;ve been to all sorts of hi-test places, but Hana is tough to beat. I&#39;ve had friends visiting from manhattan tell me this place has ruined them for their own local sushi joint. <br><br>Don&#39;t expect anything revolutionary on the menu; it&#39;s mostly the standards. They just do them so, so well. The ingredients are excellent and they cut no corners. Even a basic spicy maguro roll arrives with a beautiful cut of tuna and just the right amount of bite. The speciality rolls are plenty dazzling though.<br><br>I may come here often, but it only took a couple of visits before they started treating me like their best customer. The owners know how to run a business. Jason, who is usually around, will often personally greet you when you step through the door. He might even deliver you a special treat now and again. <br><br>The rolls here are so good, you might never notice that they also have a small but excellent Korean menu. Turns out, you can get some of the best bibimbap here as well! Give it a shot!",

"reviewcomment":"When looking for a company to provide catering for a 60 person event, I came across Salvatore&#39;s via Foodler. Their menu looked fabulous and their prices were more than reasonable. We submitted a $550 order with Salvatore&#39;s a week in advance, it was great  that Foodler was able to make was is normally an annoying time consuming process very simple. <br><br>Unfortunately, there was a glitch in Foodler&#39;s system and Salvatore&#39;s never received the purchase order for our event, despite having received a confirmation from Foodler that the order was good to go. We showed up at the restaurant two hours before our event and they had no clue about our order. This is where Salvatore&#39;s becomes fabulous. <br><br>While they could not recreate our exact order in such a short period of time, they put together a fabulous, fresh assortment of sandwiches, grilled veggie salads, cannoli, and various appetizers and delivered in time for our event! The food was great -- no thanks to Foodler -- and everyone from those who knew about the catering problem to our event&#39;s guests were impressed with the quality and flavors of the food. Many asked where it was from and expressed interest in visiting the restaurant independently... not something many people say about catering.<br><br>While I think that we would have been very happy with the food had there not been an issue with Foodler, we were especially happy with the service and quality of the food we received in light of the technical issue. And we definitely plan to order directly from Salvatore&#39;s for future events.",

"reviewcomment":"OMG I&#39;m SOLD!<br><br>So here&#39;s the story, I&#39;m always iffy about sushi especially in the back bay area being that its overpriced for the same quality that I can get elsewhere. Friend convinced me to stop by here and give it a try. <br><br>Ordered the Avocado salad which was nicely presented with a light layer of mayo which was nice since they usually come out drenched in dressing. The presentation for this app was they had avocado slices surrounding the cucumber&amp;crab mixture which was unexpected.<br><br>For sushi, we ordered the Wild fire, Spicy Salmon lover, Spicy Scallop &amp; Volcano roll. I was mezmerized!! each roll really gave off its own unique taste and I could easily distinguish what I was eating. The Spicy salmon lover and spicy scallop were my personal favorites. Each raw item was creamy and savory, it was soooo good.  The volcano roll was disappointing, they had this weird sauted mixture of crab and tuna on top of the roll and it threw off my taste buds. <br><br>The place was not packed but it can still get pretty loud and popular with groups coming in and out. The place can be pretty small and it felt small even though it was just me and a friend. <br><br>I&#39;m coming back!!",

Sometimes you and your brethren only have time for a guys&#39; lunch out (as opposed to the night out) so this is the perfect atmosphere. Dark wood walls, a little tucked away... but the best part? the friendly (but not overly-friendly) service, brew selection, and great pub fare.<br><br>Who doesn&#39;t love a dark brew in the evening? but in the middle of the day I sit on the fence. Great bartenders are also skilled mind-readers when it comes to the art of imbibing. The moment I hesitated he said &#39;dont&#39; worry I&#39;ll take care of you,&#39; and came back with a beautifully blended black and tan... Finally the burger: crisp bacon, perfectly done.

The dressing and cheese all over the salad defeat the entire concept of a healthy option. I ate the meat but had to pick out the leaves that weren&#39;t entirely drenched in cream dressing <br><br>Go to Cheers if you are a fan of the show and want to take some fun pictures.

I usually get the 2-breast meal which comes with 2 sides...the mac and cheese and sweet potatoes are two of my favorites. The meal also comes with a piece of delicious cornbread.

And that frosting is amazing.<br><br>Coffee&#39;s pretty standard. The sizes run a little small. I think the &#34;Small&#34; = Starbucks Short. Good luck finding a place to sit on the weekend. The seating area is pretty tiny/cramped, and, like all coffee shops in the area, there are laptops/books galore and patrons who won&#39;t leave for hours. <br><br>Still, worth a trip just for that scone.",

"reviewcomment":"Tried this place again... It&#39;s in the neighborhood so I have to try and pull for it. I am glad we went back and we will gladly do so again! <br>They updated their menu with more options including gluten free options and many more salads! We had the rosemary fries, fish tacos, wings, and pizza (not gluten free). They were all amazing! The fish tacos are some of the best I have ever had on the east coast. The fries were delicious! They were crunchy with just enough cheese sprinkled on top. Cheese makes everything better! The wings have this amazing rub on them and were cooked perfectly! <br>We were there during a slow time as summer kicked off so the clientele was much better as well! All the frat boys must be at the &#34;shore&#34; for the summer.",

"reviewcomment":"Pretty cool place to grab brunch... or lunch... or both! But really, if you come here, you have to make sure to get the Loaded French Toast.<br><br>More about that in a minute.<br><br>I stopped by twice in one weekend, because if you know me at all, you know that that&#39;s how I roll. Brunch on Saturday, brunch again on Sunday... Yup, I&#39;m officially a fatty. But it&#39;s okay.<br><br>First visit - I got the crab cake eggs Benedict. Pretty standard, but good. Two fresh, house-made crab cakes and two poached eggs on top of an English muffin, topped with lemon chive hollandaise? Can&#39;t go wrong with that.<br><br>My sister got the salmon burger. She was disappointed, and reported that it was far too dry. I agreed. It was supposed to come with a &#34;Mediterranean spread,&#34; but we found said dressing to be severely lacking. We shared the Peanut Butter Shutter for dessert, and it was rich and delicious. It was basically your typical PB pie, but it was still amazing. Because peanut butter. Yes, that&#39;s the end of the sentence. That&#39;s all you need to know.<br><br>Second visit - I stopped by with Nandanie S. and got that Loaded French Toast that I just mentioned. Here&#39;s what you get - huge slices of French toast that are practically swimming in syrup (they may have used an entire bottle on my plate alone), peanut butter, and bananas. That may sound like sweetness overload, but it is pure genius. I swear, I have never inhaled anything so quickly in my life.<br><br>Service was kind of spotty... First visit, not once did our server come over and ask how we were enjoying our meals. Second visit, this wasn&#39;t an issue.<br><br>So three stars overall. But really, get that Loaded French Toast. Just be prepared to be in a major food coma afterward.",

The eggs were fluffy and full of flavor and they were very generous with the portions. I&#39;ve also had the bagel with their house-made boursin cheese which is also great. <br><br>At lunch, this spot gets quite crowded, so if you are planning to come, make sure to leave yourself enough time to wait about 15 mins for your sandwich. But they are worth it!! I recommend the Bird, the Giving Tree or the Delovely... all three are awesome!<br><br>Love blunch and can&#39;t wait to return!!",

The service is fast and the servers are friendly and polite, but be prepared for a wait if you go pretty much any time on the weekends. Also, keep in mind that they are closed for one hour between the lunch and dinner periods.<br><br>My favorite thing to order is the Jigoku ramen (but only get it if you reallyyy like spicy food) or the spicy miso ramen as a close second. Also, you can add on a side of curry for a small fee which is great if you&#39;re really hungry. I&#39;ve been coming here for about 3 years and I really appreciate the fact that they have always consistent with their high quality of food and service.",

"reviewcomment":"My experience at Mission Bar was much different than that of others who noted rude or inattentive service. I stopped in for dinner with my wife and son around 8:30 p.m. on a Thursday in late December. The place was packed with 20- and 30-somethings. There were only two open tables in different parts of the dining room, and they were two-tops. The manager could not have been more accommodating. He asked a party of 2 seated at a 4-top to slide over so we could be seated. He could easily have told us to wait or come back another time. Service from Ana was excellent. Did we just get lucky? Maybe. But I judge restaurants based only on personal experience. <br><br>The menu had much more than the usual pub fare, and I thought the prices were fine. My chicken saltimbocca ($16) was moist, well-seasoned with sage, and topped with fontina and prosciutto. My son&#39;s fish tacos ($16) were made with battered, deep fried cod loin. The fish flavor stood out rather than losing out to the batter and oil. The portion was small for the price. My wife&#39;s chopped salad ($12) was large and had a variety of ingredients. Draft Harpoon IPA at $5.75 was fresh and well-priced.<br><br>The energy in the pub was convivial. Everyone seemed to be having a good time. I liked the upscale, modern pub décor. We definitely will return. <br><br>Let me know what you think of this review by clicking a button below. Thanks.",

Now, I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s gourmet dining; this is late-night guilt-food all the way ... but it&#39;s delicious.<br><br>The one time the food wasn&#39;t up to spec wasn&#39;t even a big deal: my panini was a little thinner than I was used to. Reason: they&#39;d just gotten a new panini press. I know this because I called them up and the owner came on the line and took ten minutes (on a Saturday night) to explain the entire situation to me. I&#39;ve never seen customer service like that at another late-night delivery joint.<br><br>Add to that the courtesy of the delivery drivers and the fair prices, and I don&#39;t see how you can go wrong with this place.

As if we were still waiting for folks to come in, we didn&#39;t end up ordering until closer to 12pm. The staff seem to be ok with this - it wasn&#39;t hugely busy at this time of the day. <br><br>At first our server seemed moody and just not very happy. She went about business and walked pass by a few times not making eye contact and refilling water coffee/tea as needed or when asked. She just had that vibe or not wanting to be there. Later on during our time there she did warm up and actually made conversation with us and sparked. <br><br>Overall, i like this place. It&#39;s located about a 5 min walk from the Blue Line Aquarium stop, right on the Waterfront. If you sit by the windows on the side you can easily gaze outside and see boats docked. It&#39;s a very calming feeling. I had this view the very first time i was here a few years back. <br><br>Today, we sat by the front, before you reach the bar. Noise level was ok. We sat in somewhat of a horse shoe so making conversation was easy. <br><br>The establishment was clean. It&#39;s narrow so there isn&#39;t a great deal of extra room but it&#39;s still spacious enough to be comfortable. The bathroom was clean, though very small stalls and even the doorway isn&#39;t standard size. Big folks beware, as one of my friends would say, because you would always wonder if you might be stuck somehow... (half jokingly). <br><br>The food:<br>Orange Juice was a bit acidic. At first I thought it was just me but another friend confirmed the same. <br>We all ordered from the brunch menu which came with a side of veggies, roasted red skinned potatoes. I ordered the Steak and egg - medium rare. Friend to my right ordered the Salmon. To her right ordered the Lobster omelette. The guest of honor ordered the poached egg minus the Canadian bacon. Next to her, french toast. And our last guest also ordered the steak and eggs - rare. <br><br>Everything on that plate was good, except for the Steak. It was a good size although perhaps because of its thickness, or lack thereof, (about 1/3 inch) it cooked pretty fast but my steak was more than medium - it was medium well. There was no pink left. My friend who ordered the rare got the same steak as mine. <br><br>I had a taste of the lobster omelette and it was quite good!! I didn&#39;t get to taste anything but everyone else said their food was really good. Needless to say, we were stuffed. <br><br>Aside from the above, the brunch also came with a choice or a mimosa, or a Bloody Mary. Since i still had orange juice, along with the friend next to me, she asked if she could just get Prosecco instead, to which the server said no problem so i opted for the same. I expected about half a glass but instead, she brought over an entire little jug enough for an entire glass so we could make our own. Nice! Total bonus points right here! i had two mimosas! <br><br>Lastly, service. The mood definitely changed. Initially it was just a routine walk around and grumpy looking face. But eventually, service got better and better. We were there for nearly 5 hours and no one rushed us to pay the bill or leave. Even after we paid we sat around for awhile and just talked. This to me and my friends were extremely nice considering most places would have been giving you looks and ushering you to go. For this reason only I gave it an extra star and a half. I wished there was a half star system but alas, i can&#39;t give it a five. <br><br>I do want to come back and try other brunch menu items though so hopefully i get to update this review with an even better one! :D",

"reviewcomment":"Lucia&#39;s went through a renovation a few years ago to help brighten things up, but don&#39;t worry, the frescos on the ceiling remain!  The place is still cozy, with small booths along the windows and a warm, inviting vibe.  The service is sometimes great, sometimes okay, depending upon how busy they are.  Those with disabilities should be warned that the bathrooms are down a flight of steep stairs.<br><br>The food is delicious, especially the veal carrozzella.  Fun fact: Lucia&#39;s and Artu are (or at least were) owned by a divorced couple who would direct people to the other when one was too busy.  They serve very similar food, so if you&#39;re looking for a cozy, possibly romantic meal, head to Lucia&#39;s, and if you&#39;re looking for a more modern, busy place with a bar scene, give Artu a try.",

"reviewcomment":"My first time I was at this restaurant, and it was fabulous! This was only the third time I had Ethiopian food, but it was delicious and very filling. The honey wine was a good amount of sweet and went perfectly with our meal. We ordered the beef fitfit spicy. I could eat just that and be a happy camper. We also ordered the vegetarian and meat combos. The beef in the meat combo was a bit tough, but it was tasty nonetheless. The lamb was cooked perfectly. Everything was seasoned just right. The only thing we didn&#39;t care for much was the boiled veggies in the veggie combo, it just tasted ... boiled, but everything else was perfect! <br><br>The location was in a perfect location and the restaurant was a nice small place to catch up with friends.",

"reviewcomment":"Went here with my parents while they were in town.<br>I ordered the Salmon BLAT sandwich. My mom ordered the beet salad, and my dad ordered the fish and chips. I normally don&#39;t order sandwiches because most the time, the quality ordered at a restaurant can be achieved at home (are quite simple).  So I am critical about sandwiches. Needless to say, it was a delicious  quality sandwich, in which all aspects fell together beautifully. It was on a multigrain bread perfectly toasted and buttered. Salmon was cooked well, and it all paired great with bacon, avocado and tomatoe.<br>I really appreciated the decor of the restaurant, as well. Old tavern (matched the name) It was thoughtful and consistent. Service was decent (always seem to try to fit as many people per waiter).",

"reviewcomment":"Note: This review is about the downstairs portion, only.<br><br>Up until recently, I had never actually eaten a meal here. Hello, people go to Scholar&#39;s to drink. It&#39;s a popular after-work spot for those who work in that part of town. The ambience is a bit upscale-ish, considering the neighborhood (the are surrounding the common can feel a bit sketch after dark, especially if you&#39;re closer to Washington Street). On a weekday, the place is packed with a slightly older, corporate crowd. On weekends, it turns into a top-40/college bar with a cover.<br><br>The bartenders are extremely attentive and friendly, and the drinks are strong. I usually stick to beer, but I have my go-to cocktail here, and it&#39;s the tequila smash. Tall, strong, and just what the doctor ordered after a crazy week. <br><br>As for the food, I get the same thing here every time, so I guess I can&#39;t give you a comprehensive review. The tuna tartare appetizer (which is really an entree size for one person) is amazing. Probably some of the best I have had. The tuna is fresh, and they serve it in three &#34;mounds,&#34; all different flavors and seasoning. There&#39;s the classic avocado, a lemon-basil, and the orange-sesame-ginger. The latter of the three is AMAZING--the Asian flare is fantastic. The other two are quite good, as well. This is served with lightly baked Pita triangles. I typically blow through the pita, and they always bring more out at no additional cost. <br><br>Table service can be a tad slow, so I zinged them a star. I usually stick to sitting at the bar, or in the couch seating towards the back of the room (if I am with a larger group).",

"reviewcomment":"I was recommended by my good Iranian friend to come here, who doesn&#39;t live in Boston but remembered this restaurant from the last time he visited the city. My boyfriend and I went on a Saturday night at 7. We booked our reservation through Open Table, which was extremely convenient! We arrived early and were promptly seated. It was relatively busy with a couple of big groups this evening. The atmosphere in the restaurant is very classy but comfortable. Dimmed lights with interesting art pieces on the walls. <br><br>The food was really good! We ordered both of the Sultani kabobs (chicken and beef) and shared. It was very decently sized and I loved the onion that comes on the side! Eating kabobs with onion is the right way to do it. I only wished that there was less rice but instead some more roasted veggies on the side, but it&#39;s alright. The meat was good and that&#39;s what was important. After dinner we shared baklava (which was kind of overpriced for the amount we got) but delicious and coffee. We left very satisfied! <br><br>I&#39;m not sure why so many other yelp reviewers say the service is below average. Everything was served in a very timely manner and we had a pleasant waiter. My boyfriend works as a waiter and gave them compliments on their service. <br><br>Overall, will definitely return with my family and friends.",

"reviewcomment":"Wonderful little restaurant on Hanover a few short blocks from the busy-ness of Giacomo&#39;s, Mike&#39;s, and whatnot. I&#39;ve been here twice now because I am happy with my experience at this restaurant.<br><br>SERVICE: The staff is very accommodating for both walk-ins and reservations. We used OpenTable to make a reservation for a Thursday graduation dinner recently, and the restaurant was happy to meet our request to sit in the street-level dining area. Each time I&#39;ve been here, the bartender, host, waitperson, and bus person were kind, knowledgeable, and very helpful in that they were able to make recommendations and replacements as necessary.<br><br>FOOD AND DRINK: Very filling, yummy portions on all the appetizers and main dishes, which average $10 and $20 respectively. Of the two vegetarian options I&#39;ve had (the porcini ravioli and potato gnocchi), the ravioli are better-tasting, but both are solid choices. Regarding seafood, the frutti di mare dish is only a daily special: lots of shellfish, including a lobster (that was slightly overcooked, and therefore too tough a meat); the lobster ravioli dish is a regular menu item, and is a very manageable, palatable portion. Then, in regards to meat, the double pork chop dish is apparently &#34;the best pork chop&#34; my father has ever had, even better than his own at-home creation; he credits Nico&#39;s savory sauce for its tastiness. As far as appetizers go, the calamari are very light and is drizzled sensibly with a chipotle sauce. Finally for drinks, they have an ample wine and cocktail selection, including a house sangria that&#39;s just a&#39;ight.<br><br>AMBIENCE: Cute to boot place! The TVs on the bar play on silent (no closed captions) classic Italian (American) films, including Cinema Paradiso and the Godfather series. There is a small dining area on street level as well as a dining area downstairs as well. As most of the restaurants in the North End go, the tables are quite close to one another, but you manage.",

I am very excited to hear about the opening of their brick and mortar, especially since they have added to their menu.<br><br>As for my favorite of the grilled cheese offerings: the new pimento melt. It is SO good. All of the flavors are spot on, and I didn&#39;t feel like i gained 100 pounds right after! I didn&#39;t try it when the first added it, but they apparently changed the recipe a bit and I had the new and improved one.<br><br>Seriously though, I know everyone has their timeless favorite, but you must try the pimento at least once! Their drinks are always good, too. <br><br>Friendly service is what pushes them to 5 stars!",

"reviewcomment":"This reviews for this place are incredibly low. I&#39;m unsure why. I enjoyed every minute--but I came on a Thursday evening. <br><br>While the reviews make it appear as a haven for weekend bar brawls, I felt safe. I was in great company and we cozied up at the bar. <br><br>Our bartender was reasonably inattentive. While this didn&#39;t bother me, it really irked my company. She reminded us repeatedly that she was cold, never really smiled, and forgot things. She seemed to be completely aloof to the fact that we were customers,<br><br>BUT<br><br>1.) My tequila flight was $10. <br>2.) I&#39;d had an incredibly long day at the airport.<br>3.) I loved the thinly shaved plantains.<br>4.) The corn was to die for!<br>5.) My tequila flight was $10.<br><br>The above reasons made up for all of that. The place was sanitary, well built, and had and incredibly fresh take on Tex-Mex. <br><br>(Don&#39;t talk yourself out of the Cheeseburger Taco. The &#34;mustard sauce&#34; on it is AWESOME.

My boyfriend and I have gotten into the habit of ordering sushi on Thursday nights and the sushi from here is consistently good.

"reviewcomment":"My husband and I stopped in here for lunch today. My husband walks by it on his way home from work and has wanted to try it. I&#39;m glad he suggested it, because it was fantastic. We were greeted and sat promptly, and the staff was attentive, courteous and friendly. <br><br>We got an order of the gyoza and we each got an order of the pho dac biet. The gyoza came out extremely fast, and were delicious. I wasn&#39;t a huge fan of the sauce that they were served with, it was syrupy and a little too sweet for me, but had good flavor. The soups came out shortly after we had finished our appetizer and it was phenomenal. The it tasted amazing, and it was the perfect lunch for a cold day of walking around the city. The only thing I didn&#39;t like about the soup were the Asian style beef meatballs that I ordered in the soup along with the sliced eye round. The consistency was strange, but they tasted fine. Lesson learned, I just won&#39;t order them in the soup again. Either way, we had a great experience and we will definitely be returning!",

I dream about the peanut butter chocolate bombs!<br><br>Friendly people and quick service. The seating area is small, but this doesn&#39;t bother me much as I usually order to go.",

"reviewcomment":"Head Line at this Hour: CITISIDE BAR AND GRILL CLOSED BY THE CITY OF BOSTON!<br><br>The owners of this Cleveland Circle landmark could not be reached for comment. <br><br>However, news of this action by the Boston Licensing Board comes as a shock to no one in the Brighton/Alston community! Citiside Bar and Grill was long infamous in the community for serving underage international students- some as young as 16 from the Japanese shoa school- with little or no regard for federal law or city statutes.<br><br>&#34;Yeah...I am really bummed this place is closed&#34; Said Sangmi J, an international student from South Korea and frequent underage visitor to Citiside Bar and Grill. &#34;It was Awesome. You just had to show anything written in a foreign language with your picture on it and the bouncers would just let you right it. I always just showed my (South Korean) High School ID card and told the bouncers that it was an Official Korean Govt Id saying I was over 21 and they would let me right in! And the Drinks there were really good and really cheap! I am so bummed out! Now I will have to go back to sneaking into the Estate club. Which totally sucks because I will be like the only Korean there and that is just like a total creep magnet to all the many creeper guys who lurk there! Damn! DAMN!!!&#34;<br><br>Also &#34;Bummed out&#34; is Brighton Resident Claude F. &#34;This is really disappointing&#34; Said Claude F. &#34;I used to come here about once a week for the Steak tips! They were Sooooo Good! And for under $20! You could not beat that! And they had great trivia events!&#34;<br><br>The question remains: Will Citiside re-open? And will it re-open with changed policies and perhaps no liquor license. We attempted to reach newly elected Mayor Marty Walsh for comment but he was too busy trying to get Sangmi J&#39;s phone number to give us any comment or any indication if Citiside will be allowed by the City of Boston to re-open or if the restaurant will now be yet another boarded up eye sore in the Brighton neighborhood. <br><br>Only time will tell. Stay Tuned!",

"reviewcomment":"My brother took me here for lunch one day since it was on our way home... kind of.  I&#39;ve been back a couple of times for lunch since then.  The space is tight, since it&#39;s more of a take-out place, but I never had an issue getting a table during the week.<br>The freshness of the ingredients really comes through in the flavor of the sandwiches.  I really like that they list where all their ingredients come from since most of it&#39;s local.<br>We always start out with the tomato soup which is very nice on a cold day.  I keep telling myself that I will just have half the sandwich and take the other half home, but I just cant stop myself from finishing it there.  I love the greens bacon sandwich... put bacon on anything and I will eat it, but the spicy mayo brings so much flavor to it. I have also tried the Roast Beef 1000 and the Spukie which were equally yummy!  <br>The sandwiches are made perfectly not overstuffed, but perfectly proportioned ingredients in every bite!",

"reviewcomment":"So I&#39;ve been here twice, once at night and once during the day, and the experience was almost quite literally night and day (Not afraid to drop some awful puns in a review).<br><br>At night, the place is pretty packed and there&#39;s a lot of good energy and excitement. It seemed to be mostly a young crowd looking for a chill place to eat and drink. My pulled pork sandwich was MASSIVE, but yet still quite enjoyable to eat. They also had a decent beer selection with decent prices. The service was great, and the waitress was always on top of things. All in all, I quite liked it a lot.<br><br>During the day (around noon or so), it was me and maybe 5 other people who were all old and loud and getting their drink on, (which I can respect!). I sat down at a table right by the bar, and didn&#39;t get any service for about 15 minutes, but I was too hungry and it was snowing too much for me to leave. They also have $5 lunch specials, so for about $10 you can grab a huge meal and a beer. For lunch I ordered some chicken strips and fries, and the plate was so big you could easily share it with someone else and still feel stuffed, not that it stopped me from eating the whole thing anyway because I have no self-control. You pretty much know what you&#39;re getting when you&#39;re ordering chicken strips and fries, and they definitely did not mess them up. The honey mustard was good, and it was a nice and sweet and didn&#39;t taste like Ken&#39;s honey mustard which is an affront to God. The only thing that&#39;s weird though is that you can tell they use sea salt in the back for the fries, but on the table they use regular iodized salt. That&#39;s not even a negative, it&#39;s just strange. Eventually the bartender did come to take my order, and even though he left during my meal to take a smoke break, my glass was never empty, and I had everything I needed, so I can&#39;t hold it against him. <br><br>This probably wouldn&#39;t be my first choice for lunch again unless I went with some friends of my own, but I definitely suggest this place if you&#39;re already in the area and just want a nice relaxing place.",

I had the ribeye steak. It was good...certainly not woth the price. But the accompanying green beans were excellent. A full plate of them would have been an excellent dinner by itself. Also had the baked guyere potatoes were outstanding. They have a good wine list and even though we were full the desserts sounded interesting.  Not a cheap meal but was a very pleasant dinner. We sat upstairs by the window and really enjoed the people watching.",

"reviewcomment":"My very first dining experience in Boston, and I was blown away!  We arrived around 9pm last Friday and there was no wait.  I liked the crowd - a mix of families, students and professionals.  Now for the food:<br><br>-Lobster Ravioli: I&#39;ve never even seen this offered in any restaurant, my friend ordered and she was delighted - plenty of lobster meat, delicious thick tomato sauce.<br>-Seafood platter: this was a daily special, medium-sized with a half lobster, enormous shrimp, mussels and veggies.  My boyfriend was very pleased with this.<br>-Seared scallops with tangy orange marinade and asparagus: daily special that I ordered and it was delicious.  6 large scallops perfectly cooked, and delicious mashed potato and asparagus.<br>-Clam chowder: this was the best chowdah that we had in Boston! Creamy, chunky and savoury.<br><br>We were a party of 4, ordered 4 mains and 2 appetizers and we were stuffed.  Prices were fairly reasonable as well! Would recommend to pasta and seafood lovers.",

"reviewcomment":"When someone suggested First Printer, I imagined a converted news room. Not quite the case, but I appreciated the tall backed dark wood stalls. Definitely necessary if you plan to have a good chat with your company since the high ceilings do lend themselves to amplify sounds, like the background music playing.<br><br>We also appreciated that the menu had plenty of options since some in my group had specific dietary requirements (no meat, gluten-free, no nuts, etc.). They had their bases covered. The wait staff was also helpful and willing to provide details on ingredients. I had the duck panini, which contained healthy amounts of duck. Very succulent and with nice jam spread. I like sweet so it fit the bill for me. The side of sweet potato fries, also a good size portion, were very good as well. Pricing was moderate and covered a wide range, from $6-$9 appetizers, $12-$14 sandwiches, and mid $20 to mid $30 entrees. A good spot for a group and a level up from typical bar food fare.",

The women who work the counter are really sweet and friendly too, which only further encourages my compulsion to give them my money. <br><br>I&#39;ve never had a bad meal from this place and friends and I have ordered most of the menu at this point. That said, my least favorite items have been some of the appetizers (namely the steamed dumplings which I thought were just okay but not worth the price).

But I was corrected by Tom K,. who confirmed that they do have an accessible restroom on the 1st floor, but that it may be poorly marked.  So - if you need it, ASK!!!<br><br>That said, they have some of the best non-street-food Chinese in Boston, outside of Chinatown since Zoe&#39;s closed.  In contrast to Zoe&#39;s, their food tends to have lighter, healthier preparations with more fresh ingredients and less oil / frying.<br><br>Love everything on their dim sum menu (especially dumpling-style offerings and scallion pancakes...soooooo goooooood!)<br><br>&#34;Mooshi&#34; is yummy.  I miss their...was it called Lotus Chicken?..Was unbelievably tasty.  I daydream about the dish...really.<br><br>Jasmine tea smoked and peking duck are pretty good, even compared to what I enjoyed in Asia.<br><br>The bonus is that in addition to their gracious dining room (for a Chinese food place, not a Michelin rated establishment), their takeaway matches up.  It&#39;s head and shoulders above the average greasy, thrown-together, junk food fest that most takeaway / delivery Chinese inherently involves, whether in Cambridge or Somerville. <br><br>Their dumplings aren&#39;t as good as my &#34;special, special place&#34; in Somerville, but they&#39;re above average.",

They are mostly a take-out type place - the atmosphere is not particularly romantic. But the food more than makes up for it. I had some dish of crispy jumbo shrimp in an orange sauce. Oh. my. SO GOOD. <br><br>Just, eat here. Reasonably priced, good portions, SO delicious, friendly staff. I recommend delivery or to-go.",

"reviewcomment":"When visiting TD Garden we always have gone to the Boston Beer Works out of habit and because it looks welcoming for all of it&#39;s windows on the street level. They have good food there. I like it but today we were in a rush and because of the skating championships for the Olympic selections we popped into The Four&#39;s. <br>Mom had: ROBERT PARISH<br>Grilled marinated portobello mushroom with roasted red peppers, provolone cheese and balsamic glaze on ciabatta bread - $10.95<br>Delicious, juicy, meaty and flavorful. It is something I would do well to remember now that I have to change my diet so that I don&#39;t eat red meat.<br>I chose: JOAN BENOIT<br>Turkey burger topped with mozzarella cheese, sauteed peppers and pineapple chili sauce - $10.95<br>This was a private dare to myself. It paid off though, big time. This turkey burger didn&#39;t have that wet dog flavor I associate with ground turkey. It was HUGE and it was juicy! I forgot to ask for the mozzarella to be left off (Darn! I hate that cheese is almost automatically added on to burgers!) I would have liked more pineapple chili sauce though.<br>The waitress was very busy but got our waters. Our food came out relatively fast considering both upstairs and downstairs dining rooms were crowded. We were impressed with the food and service and the time it took them to get us seated. The employees were very polite.<br>Oh yeah and the beans were delicious! Mom liked them. They tasted real not like the canned kind that are a pale comparison to the original Boston Baked beans.<br>This is not your average tavern food. And it&#39;s decorated with many sports relics and photos of local sports heroes. My Mom has the photo they hung in the dining room upstairs of Bobby Orr diving over the ice. Very homey feeling, at least to me.",

"reviewcomment":"First dates are best done over drinks or coffee: &#34;Getting to know you&#34; chit chat and accidental arm touches. Second dates should be more active and unique. Sacco&#39;s is the best second date in Boston.<br><br>The bar menu is extensive, the bowling (Candlepin!) is incredibly fun, and the pizza is out of this f@&amp;%#$g world. Consume all three in large, irresponsible quantities.<br><br>If you want to get a lane, even on a weeknight, you&#39;ll have to show up early. The wait time is very variable (I&#39;ve waited 30 minutes to 3 hours for the same 8PM weeknight lane), so be sure to check in as soon as you can. The host will typically take your phone number so you can roam Davis Square if (for some reason) you don&#39;t like pizza and beer.<br><br>There is a full bar in the back that is worth a trip on its own. Often full of young professionals, the bar has a rotating menu of craft beers and a great bourbon selection. If you are looking for a good happy hour spot, look no further.<br><br>The pizzas are large - be warned - and addictive. You get to choose your cheese, topping, sauce, and dough. Naturally, this yields many combinations, and the menu highlights some of the best. Always go for the house sauce - it is a little more expensive but worth it.<br><br>Prices are fair. People are great. Atmosphere is the best in Somerville. Easier to get a lane weeknights than weekends, but this place is worth a trip any day of the week.",

"reviewcomment":"What a gem! It&#39;s tucked away on a small side street, but it was quite obviously a hot spot. There were lots of people, but we were seated in nice timing. It was pretty loud, and the tables are closer together than I prefer. Not a huge deal, but if you&#39;re looking for a romantic and intimate dinner date, this probably isn&#39;t your spot. However, the food was incredible and employees were very attentive.<br>Drinks :<br>Suffering Bastard - WOW what a strong drink. Although, it&#39;s expected, considering its claim to navy strength rum. Wasn&#39;t particularly a fan because alcohol was ALL you could taste, but I&#39;m not partial to the strong alcohol taste in any case.<br>Rose of Lima - This was a much more delicate drink. If you&#39;re looking for something a bit more unique, then this is a good choice, as it has a floral component. Very tasty!<br>Food : <br>Sweet Potato Chips with Scallion and Meat Jus Dip - a nice way to start off with drinks. The chips themselves were very good! Although, the dip tasted like an ordinary French onion dip.<br>Pad Thai with Scallops and Bacon - to be honest I expected a bit more from this dish. Pad Thai is a favorite of mine, and I&#39;ve always thought that anything you add bacon to was a gift to earth. The flavoring of typical Pad Thai wasn&#39;t really evident. The bacon was thick cut, and although it was good, it wasn&#39;t necessarily a great supplement. The scallops were great in their own regard, but again, I&#39;m not sure about their role in the dish as a whole.<br>Po&#39; Boy - This was a special. Soft Shell Crab with what seemed like a coleslaw topping in a sandwich. The crab was delicious with a crunchy coating. The flavors of whatever was in the sandwich were interesting in their own regards, but I thought they went very well together.<br>Carolina BBQ Potstickers - wonderful crispy goodness of a perfectly fried potsticker FILLED with fantastic pulled pork! Um, yum? And if that&#39;s not enough, there was a spicy sauce underneath that added a great kick to the dish. <br>Bison Mini Burgers - just get it. Best burger in itself that I&#39;ve ever had. The burger alone was SO tasty, cooked PERFECTLY. It also came with a sauce which was a great addition. This was by far the most satisfying part of the meal!<br><br>Overall, this is my favorite fusion restaurant thus far. The ideas were very fun, and for the most part executed well! Worth a try =)",

"reviewcomment":"Tries to do too much... doesn&#39;t quite get it done<br><br>Typhoon has a great location on Boylston St.  It is easily accessible by T and if shopping at Pru/Copley and easy walk.  Offering pan-Asian cuisine, Typhoon is a sushi restaurant at the same time as a Japanese and Thai noodle joint.  The service is good, attentive and helpful.  The ambiance is nice, clean and fun.<br><br>Unfortunately, Typhoon tries to do too much and doesn&#39;t quite pull it off in any one category.  The sushi is pretty good but doesn&#39;t reach the heights of other mainly sushi restaurants in the area.  A good comparator is Douzo.  Douzo offers more innovative rolls with excellent quality to the simpler offerings of sashimi and nigiri.  The sushi is fresh at Typhoon but just doesn&#39;t rise to the level of greatness.  Even the appetizers fall just a bit short, the avocado salad  had too much mayo and not enough avocado.  Typhoon also offers a number of noodle dishes.  The pad thai was underwhelming and not better than the average pad thai you&#39;d get a small divey Thai joint.<br><br>Overall, Typhoon does an ok job at pan-Asian cuisine but doesn&#39;t quite achieve greatness in any category.",

"reviewcomment":"Roggie&#39;s is okay if you want breakfast anytime, an awkward seating situation, the weirdest bar ever and a lot of college kids breathing down your neck.<br><br>Last I was there was pretty early in the day on a weekend. The college set already had the ridiculous pitchers going and were just about as loud as could be without being offensive, so I was grateful for that. I was looking for an easy breakfast without the walk-and-talk of Dunk&#39;s or the lazy diner experience of Mirror, so this is a great way to do that and pair it with an Irish coffee.<br><br>Needless to say, the food here is overpriced. They cater to a college audience, try to run a take-out endeavor on the side and are placed just offsides of Cleveland Circle to make subsistence difficult. They&#39;re like the restaurant you run into when you&#39;re done with a long night, getting off the T and trying to stagger home. It&#39;s not a great location, unless they&#39;re trying to appeal to the public pool across the street.<br><br>That might be a strong selling point as the weather warms up. When I was there, the windows were open to the street, but there was no view of anything but the empty cement pit. During the summer, I&#39;m sure it&#39;s replete with summer camps and ungainly AARP members, but we&#39;ll see.<br><br>In the meantime, my omelette was just okay. For the price, it should have been waaaaaay better. There wasn&#39;t much accompanying it in the way of potatoes, but the Irish coffee was more than enough to pad my need for carbs. You need to start the morning...midafternoon....thing....with a good bit of padding to make it through the day until dinner, I&#39;ve always said, and this was a solid compromise. I just wish there was more protein on the plate and less empty space.<br><br>In the end, the bill was reasonable, the waitstaff was acceptable absent and the crowd was as expected. I avoid coming here on weekends or after 3pm, but otherwise it&#39;s a good place for a somewhat overpriced breakfast any time of the day. If there was a Denny&#39;s nearby, though, I would go there instead.",

"reviewcomment":"Lovely small place. They only have a few seats outdoors, but they seem to put as many as the can inside without being too overcrowded or loud. The drinks are interesting &amp; well mixed. Tired the one with cava, elderflower cucumber and gin. Perfect for the sunny spring day I visited on. The Sangria was a little heavy on the alcohol side &amp; light on the fruit side. But still nice. <br><br>The cheese selection was great. I had one of the sheep milk options, which was true to the description. The homemade pickles were delicious- though you have to like olive oil. Also ate the mussels (escabeche), which was my favorite thing... I ate it too quickly. After that I was still hungry from my day of spring adventures, so I opted for one more thing, an empanada. Decent, but not nearly as hear as the mussels.",

"reviewcomment":"Alright, how do I say this, I&#39;m a diehard Yankee fan and everytime I&#39;m in Boston, I get shit for being a Yankee fan, which is to be expected. Anyways, McGreevey&#39;s is a must stop for me everytime I&#39;m in Boston as its becoming my favorite bar in Boston. So a diehard Yankee fan who always comes to a bar that was named after Nuff Ced McGreevy, a passionate Red Sox fan and a bar that has Red Sox memorabilia all over the place and a sign saying &#39;1200 steps to Fenway&#39;. Does that sound messed up to you cause it sure as hell sounds messed up to me, even as I write this review.<br><br>Drinks are reasonably priced I think, even though I just stick with the cheap and lousy beers but like other reviewers said, bartenders are cool, they&#39;re always nice to talk to, in fact last time I was there some guy was yelling at a bartender to get me another beer and the bartender responded by saying &#34;finish the three drinks in front of you!&#34; and I&#39;ve been here a few times and the bartenders have always given me flack for my team allegiances but its all in good fun. The food is alright, I&#39;ve eaten meals here before and it&#39;s pretty darn good for bar food.<br><br>I can&#39;t say this enough, whenever I&#39;m in Boston, I&#39;ll probably be here sitting at the bar and talking with the bartenders. This place is like that place for me, you like it so much and you always go there and while I&#39;m not completely sure why I always go there, I can pretty much list the following as the main reasons-<br><br>1) Good crowd<br>2) Decently priced beer<br>3) Awesome bartenders<br>4) Oh yeah, owned by the Dropkick Murphys, one of my favorite bands. You just can&#39;t beat that<br><br>Yeah, so if anyone wants to visit Boston with me, know ahead of time that we&#39;re gonna end up here at some point drinking beers.",

"reviewcomment":"Brought my mother here for Sunday brunch - our meals were delicious and the service was first rate. <br><br>My mother ordered the scrambled eggs with fried oysters and it came with a nice green salad on the side and was delightful. I&#39;m not big into eggs, so I decided to take a little gamble and get the fish cakes. I was not disappointed - they were crispy, flavorful, and filled with fish and spices laid on a bed of greens and homemade baked beans. Yum! My boyfriend joined as well and had to scoot early - they were really accommodating in getting his breakfast sandwich prepared really quickly and apparently it was &#34;best breakfast sandwich&#34; he&#39;s ever had. <br><br>I believe it was the owner who was so pleasant and made us feel right at home. Also, the plants and floral arrangements in the restaurant were out of control. There is a huge wall installation brimming with plants and a beautifully arranged epic vase of cherry blossom branches in full bloom. <br><br>We really enjoyed our morning there. This was my first visit and I plan to go for dinner soon.  If the dinner is as wonderful as this brunch I&#39;ll update my review to five stars for sure!",

"reviewcomment":"I liked the brussels sprouts sandwich (seasonal) so much I&#39;m Yelping and I haven&#39;t even finished eating it. Crispy fried/seasoned brussels sprouts, red cabbage slaw (same as used on the chickpea fritter), cheddar cheese, and some herby creamy spread. Mmmmmm. <br><br>Clover is great, cheap, healthy(ish - ignore the word &#34;fried&#34; above), and if you go at non-peak hours (which you should) it is very quick. My regular favorite sandwiches are the Egg &amp; Eggplant and the BBQ Seitan. Rosemary fries are always on point, especially with Sriracha and malt vinegar. Love the breakfast sandwich with soft-boiled egg although I wish the cheese had time to melt instead of being stuffed in cold. <br>Pourover coffee is always some schmancy roaster on rotation and generally good (but pricey at $3 for a small cup).",

"reviewcomment":"Please note: My last visit was in 2012 so things may have changed. Please read other more recent reviews to get a feel for what this place is like now.<br><br>- - -<br><br>This is an authentic (the staff are actually Thai which is rare), casual, hole-in-the-wall gem of a Thai restaurant. Their portions may be annoyingly small, their prices may continue to increase, and the restaurant may not be much of a looker, but just thinking about their food will make you salivate uncontrollably! This is another Boston restaurant I&#39;d trek through hail and snow for, when I was living in Boston. One way to get the most out of their portion sizing for noodle dishes, is to order the noodle dish with thin rice noodles. The cost is the same but they will give you more for some reason. I used to order Pad See Ew with thin rice noodles all the time and I&#39;d get almost 1/3 more than the usual portions when I did. The Pad Thai, Rad Nah, and Pad Kee Mao are fantastic too. So are the rice dishes. In fact, I can&#39;t remember having been disappointed by any of their dishes so why not try them all! :)<br><br>Food: 5/5 -- superb and authentic!<br>Service: 5/5 -- attentive and efficient, though don&#39;t expect any frills<br>Atmosphere: 3/5 -- decent, casual, nothing remarkable<br><br>Overall: 5/5 -- exceptional!",

"reviewcomment":"Underrated, Mr. Sushi is my go-to sushi restaurant in Brookline. Clearly someone was lazy when it came to naming this place, but don&#39;t let that fool you. Even with half a dozen sushi places in Coolidge Corner, I always prefer to come here.<br><br>The service here is always fast, efficient, and polite. They are never overbearing, but some might even see them as too fast.<br><br>The seats consist of a lot of wooden benches and are rather uncomfortable. That&#39;s about the worst part about this place. Prices here are very competitive;not just for Brookline, but the whole Boston area. They have luncheon specials as well. Portions for most entrees are fairly generous, but I always enjoy ordering the sushi a la carte.<br><br>The chefs and many of the employees seem to be Chinese. Nevertheless, they are well trained and the sushi is well prepared and the sashimi is properly cut. Presentation is often simplistic on wood boards and garnishes like white radish and shiso/suzi leaves. They are fairly generous with wasabi and ginger.<br><br>I prefer salmon over tuna in my sushi. There&#39;s just too much variability in tuna and it gets incredibly pricey to try it at new restaurants so often. You never get fake salmon. The salmon here is some of the best I have ever had. It is always fresh, bright, and melts in the mouth. My brother always enjoys the smoked flavor packed in the cooked  eel.<br><br>Now that they are no longer on <a href='/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&amp;s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>restaurant.com</a>, I do not come quite so often.

"reviewcomment":"Whenever I go somewhere new I always seek out local Irish Pubs. I admit, I have a bit of an obsession with them (blame my Irish roots), and I am constantly searching for the best ones. <br><br>Being that it is Boston, Irish Pubs are a dime a dozen, and most of them aren&#39;t very authentic. This is a problem in most major cities. Hell in California (where I now live), it seems that most Irish Pubs turn into Dance Clubs after 10pm. Anyways I digress. <br><br>Mr. Dooley&#39;s is on a number of lists for &#34;Best Irish Pubs In Boston&#34; so I had fairly high expectations going in. My boyfriend and I stopped by here for a couple drinks and a bite to eat prior to heading over to the last day of Boston Calling 2014. From the moment I walked in I immediately felt at home. The longer we stayed, the more I didn&#39;t want to leave. Why?<br><br>1. Live Authentic Irish Music - The performers either had the best fake Irish accent ever, or were actually Irish. Plus they drank pints of Guinness (instead of that swill they call water) to wet their whistles.<br><br>2. Perfectly Poured Pints of Guinness - An absolute must for any place that dare call themselves an Irish Pub.<br><br>3. Tasty Shepherds Pie - Almost like my fully Irish grandmother used to make. We split this because we knew how heavy it would be, and boy was it delicious.<br><br>4. Older Crowd Drinking Early - You know how I know this was a true Irish Pub? It was 5pm when we got there (on a Sunday) and it was filled with jolly people who look liked they were at least 50+. None of this annoying hipster young crowd. Oh and even better? Everyone seemed to know each other. <br><br>5. Irish Waitress - She was super sweet, very attentive (even though she was the only waitress for the entire place), and she had the best accent ever!<br><br>What can I say, I didn&#39;t want to leave, my boyfriend had to drag me out so we wouldn&#39;t miss our concert. Only problem? It wasn&#39;t actually in Ireland, but beggars can&#39;t be choosers can they?",

"reviewcomment":"Seriously, the chocolate buffet is like a dream come true for anyone who has an inkling of desire for chocolate and not afraid to indulge.  Yes, it&#39;s a tiny bit pricey, but if you come hungry and don&#39;t eat the entire portion of every dessert, you can get your money&#39;s worth - I certainly did! <br><br>I didn&#39;t count, but there must had been ~40, if not more, variations in chocolate desserts, and I had one of each. Tip - bring someone along who&#39;s willing to try everything with you - that way, you can just split each dessert and not waste it.<br><br>Minus one star because the quality is not consistent across all desserts - some were good, some were so-so, and some, I would not want to try again.<br><br>On the plus side, the decor, ambiance, and structure of the building is beautiful. <br><br>Another tip: wear stretchable pants.<br><br>One more tip: get coffee, no sugar, so you can reset your taste buds after every couple bites.",

I love that the food quality is great despite the crazy cheap price - they weigh your food and mine has always been under $7 for a full meal, and I&#39;m always stuffed after. <br><br>The desserts are fantastic too, with the passionfruit custard being my favorite. Great espresso and mango juice. Haven&#39;t tried their &#34;drink&#34; drinks yet but I plan on it eventually. <br><br>Cute, cheap, and delicious - no complaints here!",

"reviewcomment":"Came here a few years ago and left unimpressed. Then recently went for a large work event. It was a sit down 5 course meal and everything was great! Started with the Campo salad, then had family style appetizers of burrata, antipasta platter, and margherita pizza. The pizza was very light on cheese but well cooked and flavorful. For my first course I had Linguine ai Crostacei which was great, packed with lobster and crab meat. For my second course I had a fish wrapped in crispy potatoes. Delicious! The dessert was the only nonmemorable course. <br><br>Came back again for a third time and again everything was great! I enjoyed the Linguine ai Crostacei so much the last time, I had it again. Still good, but this time I noticed there was a lot more shrimp and less lobster and crab meat. Also, I was there on a Tuesday evening, it wasn&#39;t very crowded, and yet the service was painfully slow. Took us hours to get out. Good thing we weren&#39;t in a hurry.",

It really is the perfect breakfast sandwich - just the right amount of food and the perfect mix of carb/protein/cheese. I searched for the perfect breakfast sandwich near work for nearly seven years, and I&#39;m super glad to have finally found it!<br><br>Also a big fan of the chickpea fritter sandwich and the rosemary fries at lunch. The 3pm specials are often tasty, too (I love the different hush puppies I&#39;ve had).<br><br>More than anything, the staff here is always friendly regardless of what crazy weather they are dealing with! I also really appreciate the transparency the owners and managers share on their blog, the dedication to using locally sourced, high quality ingredients, and their mission to always be improving. <br><br>Hands down, one of my very favorite local companies to support.",

"reviewcomment":"I tried this place out because I had some Foodler credits I wanted to use, and it had free delivery with an $8 minimum which is practically nothing. I ordered a large hamburger pizza and it got here within 30 minutes, so I can&#39;t complain about delivery time.<br><br>The pizza itself tastes like a better version of Papa John&#39;s pizza (take that however you want, I personally think it&#39;s the best national pizza chain). They LOAD it with toppings, so you probably want to think carefully when you add toppings. I think I may have actually preferred just cheese or pepperoni because the ground beef/hamburger they use is a little bland. The crusts are doughy, and that&#39;s just how I like it. It was also really cheesy, which is never a bad thing. I enjoyed the pizza overall, but I&#39;d probably make a different choice next time.<br><br>Overall, the pizza was good, it was cheap (about $15 total including tip), and it was delivered quickly.

Two people splitting 60oz is an unreasonable assumption, especially since we are not 21.

Our server was this petite older Italian woman. Oh my goodness, she was the cutest thing ever, always checked up on us, gave us her opinions, told us little life stories and her family.

The staff was very friendly and jolly. I ordered Chicken Thuk-pa and chicken momos. Both were super delicious! Do not forget the hot sauce. Its a must have. The chicken pieces in the thuk-pa could have been smaller and huge chunks start to taste bland after some time, but the broth in thuk-pa was very flavourful. For sweet we tried the bhag-tsa, small chunks of bread in butter and cheese, not very sweet but a slight hint of sugar.<br>All of them worth trying! Will be sure to visit the place again!",

I really liked the decor - a mix of modern chic and rustic vintage charm.<br><br>The wine list is pretty eclectic. We had a beautiful 2008 St. Chinian, which our waiter double decanted for us. After dinner we also tried a bual madeira and a rare sweet jura wine... both delicious.<br><br>The food was equally spectacular. DO NOT MISS THE SWORDFISH PASTRAMI with mustard gelato. It was one of the best things I&#39;ve eaten in a long time. Also noteworthy were the deviled crab snacks and the cheddar gougeres.<br><br>Service was attentive and friendly. We will be back when we next venture across the river to check out the bar. I noticed some cool bottles of hootch on the top shelf. I&#39;m guessing the cocktails are just as fabulous as everything else.<br><br>Thank you to all at Puritan and Co. for such a lovely evening!",

"reviewcomment":"disclaimer: the place is owned by two nephews of a co-worker; we went for a happy hour/dinner in hopes to find a suitable locale for a upcoming staff party, back in December.<br><br>ended up loving the place ourselves. the reno/decor made you feel like you&#39;re at somebody&#39;s &#34;warehouse style&#34; studio: exposed pipes, brick wall, gigantic mural...simplistic yet modern - got lots of character in there. <br><br>Yeah drinks and food were a bit pricey for &#34;chinatown&#34;, but if you walk two blocks down to Genko Sushi or Abbey Lane, you&#39;ll be met with the same price point. <br><br>Had the Gin Gin Mule and the one with the cucumber ice, both impressed my palate. Friend had one that was served in a tiki cup (Plantation Punch?), fruitier but also good.<br><br>Got a bunch of small plates to sample: sucking pig bao, duck fat fries, duck meat dumpling, a cold noodle that&#39;s surprisingly spicy, kimchi fried rice...among other things. Yes portion is on the smaller size but it&#39;s tapas! Cut most in half and all four of us had a decent bite. <br><br>The highlight was on the dessert sample plate (on the house, due to our connections, and also coz we were booking a private party!).... I can&#39;t remember other things but the choco sesame balls were da bomb!! Just the right size (a bite or two), and the semi-liquidy choco filling was dark and rich (not plain sweet), like a Valhrona kind, not the Hershey kind.<br><br>A very pleasant meal in all.<br><br>Small complaint on the young staff: service was a little spotty as they&#39;re all engrossed in their phone. Take a break in the back room if you need! Phones should NEVER be out in front of customers, unless that&#39;s what you use to take their order or close their tab!<br><br>On another note: staff party was a huge success. All staff liked the location (walkable from work), the restaurant was just the right size to reserve the whole place to ourselves for a couple hours, food and drinks were approved by all. The owners also worked our budget into menu planning and were very accommodating to our needs (ex. food allergies) as well. <br><br>p.s. Try the cold tea for two!!!",

"reviewcomment":"My friend made reservations for this restaurant for our little reunion during Easter. I never heard of this restaurant and was wondering why she didn&#39;t pick a more well-known place in the North End, like Giacomo&#39;s or Neptune Oyster. However, after having a late lunch here, I was glad she decided to come here!<br><br>When I first walked into the restaurant, I thought it was way too small and wondered where they were gonna seat us because we had a party of 7. The host led us towards the right side of the restaurant and there were more tables there. It&#39;s actually a big restaurant! <br><br>We started off with the crispy calamari with lemon aioli and Italian parsley. It was amazing and I was impressed. I thought they were gonna serve the calamari with marinara sauce (like how most restaurants do).<br><br>I ordered the risotto with asparagus, black truffle, and pecorino with a glass of Malbec to accompany it. We waited somewhat long for the food the come, but they were still steaming hot when it got to our table, so that wasn&#39;t a problem. I was super satisfied with the risotto and definitely want to come back for it again.<br><br>For dessert, we had their homemade tiramisu and their homemade blackberry and lavender gelato. Boy was it aromatic! It was my first time trying a dessert with lavender flavor and I am IN LOVE! Definitely a must-try when you go there. I think the flavors change daily though.<br><br>Can&#39;t wait to bring my friends here! =)",

And if you use the bathroom you can walk through the hotel is connected to which is pretty swanky.<br><br>Back to the ramen. I was pretty sad they no longer had the umami ramen which has unagi (eel) so I picked the traditional pork instead. It was not your typical traditional broth, but it was interesting flavor and the noodles were just right and it comes with radish and really tasty mushrooms and of course tons of scallions and seaweed. <br><br>We also got the shishito peppers which are dressed in A sweet thick soy sauce and bonito flakes. This was the first time I got a spicy one! I wish all of them were spicy cause the heat is nice.<br><br>Lastly the ice cream sandwich. This was the best! It&#39;s a chocolate cookie with mint ice cream. They don&#39;t use that artificial alien green stuff that tastes like mint extract. Their ice cream is from fresh mint and it&#39;s just so light and then with the chocolate cookies it&#39;s the perfect way to cap the night.",

"reviewcomment":"I came here for restaurant week.. without a reservation.. on a Friday night. But I came here early enough ( At 6:30) Just in time to beat the rush of dinnertime. I asked the host if he was taking in walk-ins because everyone that came in before me had made reservations. He said yes and got me seated within 5 minutes. Our waitress was very nice! I ordered an alcoholic drink but didn&#39;t like the taste so I left it on the table without complaining because it was my fault for the choice.. and by the end of the dinner, the waitress noticed and she took it off our bill because it was untouched! <br><br>I had the regular Caesar salad for appetizers, 6 oz. filet mignon with sides of mashed potato for main course, and lastly the Double Chocolate Mousse. I was very satisfied with the quality of the food and the atmosphere was just great. It was packed by 7 PM and there would have been no way for walk-ins to come in at that time.. well the wait would have been maybe 45 minutes or so? <br><br>While dining, I saw the waiters serving desserts like a chocolate cake, souffle, and others that looked so delicious. I will definitely consider coming again!",

My friend ordered the falafel, which was awesome. I got a falafel ball on the side and can easily say it was the best in Boston. Great pita chips and hummus. Price is right $8-10 per person.

"reviewcomment":"I will preface this review by stating that pad thai is not simply a favorite food but an obsession of mine. Anytime someone asks what I&#39;m in the mood for, the answer is pad thai.. and more specifically, Khao Sarn!<br><br>PAD THAI: They&#39;ve got what I consider a solid, standard pad thai.. by &#34;standard,&#34; I mean that it doesn&#39;t have weird ingredients (I&#39;ve had places include things like carrots and baby corn.. they don&#39;t belong!!) or use weird things like chile sauce to make the pad thai spicy (I always ask for spicy!). I get the tofu pad thai but my fellow diners will get it with chicken and shrimp. The tofu is fried perfectly- it&#39;s firm, not that silken cheap stuff which doesn&#39;t create as good a &#34;skin&#34;, and bite-sized. The chicken is good quality white meat and the shrimp looks plump and scrumptious. The noodles are always perfectly cooked, too and I also appreciate that while the taste is totally traditional, it&#39;s not overly fishy.<br><br>APPETIZERS: I&#39;ve had both the fresh and fried veggie spring rolls and they&#39;re perfect. I love that the fried spring rolls are really thin and tightly wrapped, making for a super crunchy roll. The dipping sauce is also amazing- it&#39;s the usual sweet/sour stuff but a little spicy!<br><br>AMBIANCE/EXPERIENCE: This is one of the best parts... I&#39;d take Khao Sarn any day if it were some hole-in-the-wall, but it&#39;s actually a super clean, nicely decorated place. It&#39;s the nicest looking Thai restaurant in Boston that doesn&#39;t have tacky décor so it&#39;s great for dates.<br><br>PRICE: Despite being a little &#34;fancier&#34;, the prices are totally standard and competitive with other Thai restaurants.<br><br>Overall, I clearly recommend this place and whether you&#39;re a regular Thai eater or not very familiar, Khao Sarn is a safe bet!",

"reviewcomment":"We&#39;ve ordered from Thaitation many times, but have yet to write a review! We&#39;ve always been really happy with the quality of the food as well as the low delivery fees.  The customer service is fantastic as well. I am gluten-free, and I&#39;ve never had a problem with anything we&#39;ve ordered from them. We specify gluten-free on the notes when we order from foodler, and it&#39;s always written on the receipt in big letters to let us know that they did make it gluten-free.<br>We&#39;ve had a couple of mistakes with the orders (little stuff, like missing rice) but they are so apologetic and are quick to bring out a new order or whatever was missing.  <br>Overall, we love ordering from them and highly recommend!<br>Our favorites: garlic chicken, grapow beef, and beef with broccoli",

Our waiter was knowledgable and was kind enough to ask the chef a few questions for us. He gave us some great ideas on appetizers. Do not miss the warm ricotta dip!!! The pasta was cooked fresh and all of the food was perfect. We were not rushed or bothered but we had everything we needed. The salted caramel gelato was the perfect end to a perfect meal. <br><br>We were lucky and had a spacious table but noticed some were close together. This would not be a problem for us if I was not pregnant hehe. If you need more space while dining I would suggest letting the host know.<br><br>We will definitely be returning !",

"reviewcomment":"Diners = love.  And Kelly&#39;s is no exception.<br><br>After passing this on a million runs and weekend strolls, I finally went in for breakfast today.  I was looking for something more personal that Soundbites and Ball Square, with better hash browns (fried mashed potatoes are SO not the same thing).  <br><br>Kelly&#39;s definitely lived up to this vision.  The waitress acted like she knew us before we even sat down (&#34;you both like coffee, right?  you know where the menus are&#34; etc) even though we&#39;d never been here before - adorable.  The food options are not overly extensive but that just makes it easier to pick.<br><br>My sister and I both got the &#34;famous&#34; homemade corned beef hash and poached eggs.  Both were a lot less greasy/salty than usual diner grub - almost to a fault.  I would rather add a little of my own salt (and skip the fat altogether) but it was still a little strange to have my tastebuds turned in this direction.  Add a pinch of salt and pepper and you have me clearing my plate in record time.<br><br>I love the scene here - the other patrons with their huge hair, the friendly staff, the non-working jukebox.  I&#39;ll definitely be back - and by then, the waitress should definitely know my order. <br><br>Note: cash only, but there&#39;s an ATM in the entrance.",

"reviewcomment":"This place is overly spacious and nice inside, to the point where the investment doesn&#39;t make sense for a Watertown sports bar (w/ very little college presence). The few times I&#39;ve been here it&#39;s been easy to get fast service and there&#39;s been a ton of space to sit at the bar. The beer selection has the nod on similar sports bars in the area (i.e. Tavern in the Sq). I&#39;ve tried a few of the appetizers which have been satisfactory.<br><br>Just don&#39;t expect this place to get roaring busy on a weekend night, or at any time of week for that matter. I&#39;m going to guess there&#39;s about an 85% chance this place shuts down within 2 years, so enjoy it while it lasts.<br><br>3.5/5",

"reviewcomment":"5 stars based solely on the food. Nothing else. <br><br>No, this place has not won any respectable awards. Yes, their Yelp reviews are mediocre at best. And sure, the service is horrendous and the level of sanitation is questionable. But when you walk under those sketchy reddish awnings advertising twin lobsters for $18.99 (or is it $19.99 now?), your taste buds are treated to a bewilderment of salty spicy goodness that can only be described as indescribable.<br><br>Whenever we visit this fine establishment, we always order the basics. Every now and then we will sample some rogue dishes if we&#39;re feeling adventurous (hello pig intestines), but we generally stick to our favorites.<br><br>1) Peeking spare ribs. The sauce alone is worth the trip.<br>2) Chinese broccoli in garlic sauce. It&#39;s always good to mix in some greens with all of this sodium you are about to ingest. <br>3) Pan fried noodles with beef and black bean sauce. Always a crowd pleaser. <br>4) And last but never least, the Salty Spicy Squid.<br><br>If you are looking for a romantic &#34;cultural&#34; evening out with your significant other, this is not the place for you. There is an overpriced P.F. Changs down the street I can refer you and your sesame chicken loving friends to. But if you are looking for a solid place for an amazing, no frills dinner with friends, look no further than the dingy reddish awnings of Victoria Seafood.<br><br>Check out my blog (complete with pictures and childish humor) for the full review! <br><br><a href='/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fthesuchef.org%2F2014%2F04%2F06%2Fvictoria-seafood%2F&amp;s=c1327db324c61cbd64b14c0a5f647d97e85d61eb9de983ac3d02942ce3d29e89' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>thesuchef.org/2014/04/06…</a>",

At the night of graduation party everything was exactly the way we wanted, even the flowers on each table as I wanted.   Food was extraordinary tasty.   Service excellent.  The owner was approaching us every often to make sure that everything was ok.   Whole staff was extremely nice , helpful and they did everything in their power to make this special night memorable and special as it should be.  This year my daughter ordered food for my birthday surprise party from Sabur  and everyone was impressed with quality and taste of the food ordered. Everything was perfect, food was very tasty and the  owner even sent me a bottle of a great vine as a gift.   Very thoughtful.  I am going back to that place very often as I have only good memories connected to Sabur   Highly recommended.",

One claw and a dinky piece of lobster does not a lobster roll make, my friends.<br><br>The lobster rolls here are basically delicious mounds of lobster oozing out of a bun, well worth the drive to the south shore. Located across the street from the beach, it&#39;s the perfect spot to grab food before heading over for some sun and sand.

"reviewcomment":"I checked out this place tonight with the &#34;Dine-out Boston&#34; deal. It was better than I thought because I had read an article mentioning some negative things about their menus during this restaurant week. <br><br>For the first course we ordered the scallops, the rib eye, and the artichoke hearts for the first course. I really liked the artichoke hearts. The goat cheese inside the artichoke hearts were very creamy and smooth! The proscuitto was wrapped perfectly and it was adding crispy texture to it.   <br><br>As for the second sourse, we had the veal Saltimbocca, the fillet mignon(steak), and the salmon filet. I LOVED the veal. The steak was very nicely done as well. The quality of the meat seemed very good. However, the salmon was just not that great. <br><br>They also had a wine Wednesday deal and the three of us had each glass - coudn&#39;t believe the three glasses of wine(although they are half glass size... it was appropriate amount amount) were only $12.95 in total. The selection was very decent!  <br><br>Can&#39;t wait to come back to this place soon! Highly recommend it! :)",

"reviewcomment":"We scuttled our way to Twin Do-Nuts at around 9am on a Sunday and they were half sold out. Not sure if it was an error on the cashier&#39;s part but we got four donuts and it came out under $4. Not entirely sure why I&#39;ve been walking past this place to Dunkin Donuts all this time.<br><br>The chocolate dipped donut and butternut donut are DENSE and huge. If thrown hard enough it&#39;d probably dent a car. More importantly, they&#39;re delicious. Moist, chewy, and decadent without being overly sweet. We also got the Boston creme which was pillowy light and fantastic. Next time: breakfast sandwiches.",

"reviewcomment":"So there are reviews below that are questionable. I&#39;ve been here once, and my job gets food from Aegean for our company lunches.  I&#39;ve NEVER had an issue. The service was good, wine offerings were good, and the food is very delicious. I&#39;ve only been to the Watertown location, but the interior is very Greek - white walls with blue and white tablecloths. I liked it :) <br><br>The food. I ordered the scallops and it also came with a huge side of rice pilaf with a red sauce. I practically devoured it. The rice with the scallops was a nice accompaniment as well as the salad, pita bread, and dips that were given to us after we were seated.<br><br>Today for our lunch I tried the spicy sausage, which I didn&#39;t like, but my friends loved it. I enjoyed the chicken and beef souvlakis, rice pilaf, roasted potatoes, and the garden salad.<br><br>I&#39;m a boring Greek eater. I don&#39;t like feta or tzatziki sauce...but I&#39;ll eat anything else. I also tried dolma for the first time, and it was okay for my first try. <br><br>Galaktoboureko. Order that thing, and savor each bite...it is SO good. Almost like a Greek version of Boston cream pie without the chocolate...<br><br>Now I cannot be productive for the rest of the work day...but it was worth it. Each and every bite.",

"reviewcomment":"Had dinner here tonight with a friend. I&#39;m a fan! Had reservations for two for 7:00 pm but when we informed the hostess that a last minute third party may show up we were immediately accommodated from a table for two to a table for four. The restaurant has two levels, both attractively accented with dark woods, brick walls and great views of the city streets. A very comfortable atmosphere. <br>       Our waiter (alas, I forget his name) was very efficient. Prompt with orders, informative about the menu, always about in the background eyeballing our table but never intrusive. There when we needed him and not when we didn&#39;t. <br>         We started out with the antipasto platter for two. A delicious mix of tangy marinated vegetables, meats and cheeses. A perfectly proportioned appetizer for two people to whet the appetite. The complimentary bread and olive oil/balsamic vinegar dipping sauce was a great go-with. For entrees, my friend ordered the scallops puttanesca, which she said was very good. I had the gnocchi Bolognese which was amazing. I had always been on the fence about gnocchi, having had mostly pastey globs of garbage. Bacco reminded me how fantastically great a correctly made gnocchi can taste and the Bolognese sauce was spot on delicious. Order it, you won&#39;t be sorry...........make sure to have your server add the grated parmesan cheese and pepper!<br>             No dessert, as we were both more than satisfied. Simply finished off the meal with a simple cup of coffee and left feeling we go our money&#39;s worth. Bacco&#39;s lost one star for it&#39;s singular unisex bathroom. Not the most attractive and promotes long waits. Recommended.",

"reviewcomment":"As a resident in Harvard Square, I can name a few things about Spice Thai that makes it my go-to Thai restaurant. <br><br>Service: fast, polite, and attentive. They are always busy especially during the dinner time, but I never had to wait to get seated. The staff here are altogether pleasant and likable, which is great considering the busy flow of the customers here.<br><br>Atmosphere: pleasant with the dim light. They have flower deco on tables which makes it a nice casual place for couples as well. I also appreciate the art deco adding to the cozy exotic vibe around the restaurant. As mentioned above, this place is usually crowded, and there are not much room between tables to go to bathroom easily. If you have been to some of the most popular places in North End though, you&#39;ll be fine. It&#39;s not nearly as bad! The crowd is usually local people off work, grad students, undergrads, and visitors. You can easily overhear conversation from nearby tables, so be discreet with sensitive info! ;)<br><br>Food: yummy. The food is good. Be ware of the chili signs, indicative of the spice-level of each dish. I highly recommend not going for the four-chili dish - it was impossible after several bites, and left me crying. But the curry and noodle dishes are very good. I recently also tried their lunch bento, for which I&#39;d be happy to come back for more.<br><br>Price: decent. It is above Le&#39;s, but definitely still within a reasonable range. Together with food quality, service, and atmosphere, it is an excellent place. Their dishes are not nearly as greasy as Le&#39;s, much more presentable, and I like their thin (in terms of width) noodles better.",

My sister has gotten the chicken pho and said it was very good. Maybe I&#39;ll go with that next time.<br><br>Ask for the chili pepper sauce.

"reviewcomment":"You know, I&#39;m a little surprised by how negative a lot of these reviews are.  I&#39;ve been to Moksa twice, and each time I&#39;ve had a positive experience.<br><br>My bf and I went last night for the patio event, but it was kind of rainy and windy, so we chose to sit at the bar instead.<br><br>Did you know that from 5-7pm every weekday, they have ALL YOU CAN EAT SUSHI for $15?  Yeah.  They do.  The sushi menu for all-you-can eat is a bit smaller -- <br>Spicy Tuna Roll, Shrimp Tempura Roll, California Roll, Philly Roll, Seaweed Samba, Maimo Roll, Salmon &amp; Avocado Roll, and Cucumber &amp; Avocado Roll.<br><br>My boyfriend and I ate the spicy tuna, philly roll, maimo, roll, and salmon &amp; avocado roll (don&#39;t worry we ate several servings of each...definitely got our money&#39;s worth!).<br>The maimo roll is sweet potato tempura, and it was the surprise winner of the night.  The sweet potato was still warm and a little crunch from the tempura -- really delightful.  I always love a good spicy tuna and philly roll, too.  We also got a couple of the $1 menu apps -- dumpling, chicken skewer, and gyoza.  All delicious little bites.  There was a special $2 paneer tikka from the patio event that was also nice (although a little small and should probably have just been $1).<br><br>Did you know that they have wine ON TAP?  Yes.  I&#39;d never heard of it either.  It was a Cote de Rhone and I would have had more than one glass, but the bartender was light with her hand and I didn&#39;t think it was worth another $8 for a short glass.<br><br>All in all, the food was really great and I&#39;m only giving it 4 stars because service was a little slow.  Otherwise, everyone there was very friendly!",

The order took much longer than it needed to about an hour and 15 minutes and therefore part of my order was comped; I didn&#39;t ask for it they offered and I found that really respectful. Because of their customer service I will eat there again this weekend. <br><br>The Lobster bisque was smooth, delicate, almost velvety with a hint of spice. I wish there was chunks of lobster in it though. <br><br>The Arancini was the best thing we ordered. Wonderful taste, crispy, and the short rib pairs well with the sauce<br><br>The Helen&#39;s pot roast had incredible mashed potatoes &amp; wonderful vegetables; the sauce was the star but there wasn&#39;t enough sauce, and therefore the pot roast ended up being really dry at some points. I wouldn&#39;t recommend the pot roast it wasn&#39;t bad but I think they have better.",

"reviewcomment":"Deserves an update. Closer to 4.5 stars but, for Italian west of Boston, it&#39;s one of the best spots you&#39;ll get to. I&#39;m actually a bit surprised by the negative reviews. The food can be slightly uneven, at times, but the handmade pastas tend to be well-balanced and frankly delicious. The entrees are often well-thought out and well-prepared. <br><br>The wine list is all Italian, so if you want worldy variety it&#39;s not the place, but the prices aren&#39;t out of bounds and the owner (Jennifer) is often there to help walk you through the list she put together. <br><br>The biggest downfall is service, followed by slight uneven cooking, at times. Service can be a bit brusque and aloof and some dishes fall flat in execution, although rarely in seasoning and flavor. <br><br>If you want to try new and exciting Italian fare with wines you&#39;ve likely never had, La Morra is a great spot.

"reviewcomment":"The Red Hat a.k.a Chapeau Rouge!<br><br>My home away from home, where everybody knows my name!  I had the chowdah in a bread bowl (c.i.a.b.b.)  the other night.  Folks, looks like i am going to be chowing down on ciabb more often!  The bread bowl, likely one of the world&#39;s top innovations of the modern age! I mean, dishes.. who needs to do dishes , when you can eat your tableware! <br>The chowdah...okay , okay.. chowder, was delicious to say the least. Generally when you order chowder, it is either too thick, soupy, or is just downright lousy.  Well not here, I was pleasantly surprised on this blustery evening when I sat down and started devouring my late dinner. The fresh bread, and perfect viscosity of the chowder was too good, not to go mentioned. At that moment, I decided I would sign up and create a Yelp account and log a review.<br> I am over people posting bummer reviews about places...  Reviews posted by snotty patron&#39;s whom like to throw said establishments under the proverbial  bus.  In &#34;my&#34; book, this is thoughtless act of cowardice, so shame on you! (unless deserved of course, this reminds me of the old common man adage &#34;It&#39;s like putting lipstick on a pig&#34; ) you can only praise a place so much before the truth becomes evident... In this case, the Hat does not fall into the lipstick and pigs category. So to lamebot&#39;s whom post damning reviews for you own kicks.  You try opening a business and keeping customers after someone similar to  your snotty self drops a Whah , Whah  review.  Before you know it, you are back at your 9-5 wondering what  the H , E double hockey sticks just happened! <br>So to all you Joe&#39;s , Schmos, and Debutante Princess&#39;s.. If you&#39;re looking for something off of the beaten path of techno music and goddy decor e.t.c.. Hit up the Rouge for a little you time!<br><br>Ps: forgive my grammatical errors and so on.. I am not a literary genius, which is obviously evident. I wanted review a great chowder, and say... Come on, it doesn&#39;t hurt to be nice once in awhile.<br><br>Lamebot: a lame person or persons, of lame stature.  The word has nothing to do with robots.<br><br>Lastly, Big ups to &#34;The corner&#34;, the staff, particularly weds night barkeep (downstairs) you know who you are! : P",

"reviewcomment":"We (2) have been here multiple times and every time, it has been excellent. Great food, great atmosphere, and the entire staff is probably the friendliest bunch of people I have ever met. The first time we went there, the owner greeted us when we walked in and also checked in on us throughout the night. You can easily tell that he takes pride in his restaurant which you don&#39;t usually see at other businesses. The only, and I mean only downside is that the restaurant is rather on the small side, so you may have a wait on Friday or Saturday nights. It is WELL worth the wait and usually you get a table much sooner than expected. Plus the bartender&#39;s are awesome and always attentive which makes the time fly by.<br><br>The food is some of the best Italian food we have had in Boston and the portions are huge. I would highly recommend the steak tips. Yes, I said the steak tips at an Italian restaurant. Incredibly tender and full of flavor. Besides the steak tips, everything from the pasta to the seafood is amazing. I guarantee if you give this restaurant a try, it will become a favorite of yours and keep you coming back.",

"reviewcomment":"If you&#39;re looking for great bone-in or boneless wings, look no further. Wings Over&#39;s offers super tasty and tender wings, and has a great selection of flavors. It seems that many people on here have had delivery issues. I can speak to one slow experience where it took about an hour for my delivery to arrive, but that was during an NFL playoff game when they were probably busy. My advice: Go and pick-up your order if you can. Every time I have picked up my order, my food has been ready when I arrived.<br><br>Tip: Go for the boneless wings unless you really love the bone-in wings. Reason being is they don&#39;t give you a ton of wings for your money, so you&#39;re better off getting boneless to maximize your value. <br><br>Another Tip: Ask for extra sauce on your wings. Sometimes they will skimp on the sauce so it is best to ask for more.<br><br>Can&#39;t go wrong with the Honey Mustard (favorite flavor) or Honey BBQ flavors. If you prefer a bit of spice, go for the Cruising Altitude (2nd hottest buffalo flavor).",

The French toast were also very good, but I would say go for the Challah Bread French Toast when you order them because they do look better and the waitress told me that they just taste better, but either way they were very very good.",

Unlike many of the North End establishments, this one takes both reservations and credit cards. The menu was intriguing, with a number of offerings different from the traditional ones. Reviews high (deservedly so!). The Yelp coupon was icing on the cake. <br><br>The Portobello al Forno is truly exquisite and easily one of the best / most memorable dishes I&#39;ve ever had. The others had Bruschetta alla Mediterranea - very nice, yet unless one dislikes mushrooms, the first is the better choice (3-0 vote). For entrees, we had a seafood special risotto (divine !!), Orecciette alla Pugliese (fabulous with an incredibly succulent sauce) and Malloreddus alla Campidanese (aside from an intriguing pasta form, rather pedestrian in our collective opinion - the only down check in our choices). We had a really nice Chianti with the meal followed by espresso (well prepared) and a good Tiramasu.<br><br>Very small and likely noisy when crowded (we were there early in the evening midweek outside of tourist season); the intimacy enhanced the experience. Service satisfactory. All in all, the enthusiastic reviews and critical accolades are clearly deserved.",

"reviewcomment":"After standing in line for 40 minutes on the first warm day of the season, let me just tell you that it is worth the wait. The salads here are unmatched because the ingredients are of superior quality and the dressings are so unique! The service is incredibly fast. They have like 10 people working behind the counter, and the &#34;assembly-line&#34; style is a pretty well-oiled machine here. Right now, I&#39;m obsessed with the spicy sabzi. The quinoa, the ginger-carrot dressing, and the kale just make my day. The portions are huge, and you have the option of adding a slice of bread, as well. I&#39;m thinking my next one will be the kale Caesar salad. Delish! <br><br>P.S. It&#39;s priced comparably to Panera and Au Bon Pain.",

"reviewcomment":"Before I visit a new city I engage in serious culinary recon. Where are the best places to eat? That&#39;s what I wanna know. Forget historical and cultural points of interest. It&#39;s all about the food.<br><br>I was spending a day and a night in Boston with some friends. A friend of a friend recommended some Italian place in Boston&#39;s North End, which is basically nothing but Italian restaurants. Well, we never made it to our intended destination as we were sidelined by Carmelina&#39;s. <br><br>I dunno, there was something about the menu posted outside that drew us in. That and the atmosphere. Modern, but rustic, with ambient lighting.<br><br>The wine selection is limited and I believe all Italian as far as vintages go. I had a fantastic Chianti. <br><br>We shared the Simple Arugula salad, the Winter Blood Orange and Beet salad and a house salad. All excellent. The arugula salad was drenched in extra virgin olive oil and lemon, yet not a bit over done. And that blend of blood orange and beets, oh my.<br><br>For the main course, I ordered the simple carbonara. Never, in my life-- and this is not an exaggeration-- have I ever had pasta this outrageously good. It was as perfect as  pasta can get and you get a lot. The portions are incredibly generous. One of my friends ordered the &#34;Sunday Macaroni&#34;. After a couple of bites she said, &#34;This is better than the pasta I had in Italy.&#34; So, I had a bite of this &#34;Sunday Macaroni&#34; laden with meatballs, sausage and short ribs in a tomato sauce. Oh. My. God. Seriously, the food at Carmelina&#39;s is that good. I&#39;m still fantasizing about that carbonara. I&#39;m not kidding. <br><br>It should be noted that Carmelina&#39;s does not serve dessert or coffee. This, we learned, is out of respect for the pastry and gelato shops and cafes in the area. In fact, as we were being seated, the guy at the adjoining table his bag away from our table to the other side of himself. My friend reassured him he didn&#39;t have to do that, and in his very Boston accent he replied, cheekily, &#34;Oh, yes I did. I don&#39;t trust you. I can see it in your eyes.&#34; Turns out that bag contained pastries from Mike&#39;s Pastries across the street. (They&#39;re very serious about their pastries around here.) We&#39;d noticed Mike&#39;s as were wending our way through the neighborhood. It was packed. Our server informed us Mike&#39;s would soon be closing for the night, so one of my friends left in the middle of our salad course to score some cannoli.",

"reviewcomment":"You&#39;ve got to love strange, can-do, tasty little Flora. You don&#39;t have to give them five stars, I&#39;ll understand. But I want their overall Yelp rating to reflect the fact that they are, for better or worse, clearly the best restaurant in Arlington.<br><br>The classics are great. The steaks, burgers, lamb chops all melt in your mouth and are cooked by an artist with an eye for detail and an impeccable sense of timing. Often there&#39;s a spice or seasoning element that&#39;s delicately applied.<br><br>The homemade pastas are divine: soft, but toothsome, slippery but sustaining and bathed in sauces that do them justice. The waitstaff never fails to alert me to which of the pastas are homemade too. Foodwise, though, I&#39;ve been disappointed by the experiments with ethnic flavors, and the more veggie friendly entrees, at the edges of the menu. <br><br>The desserts are brilliant flavor combinations with solid execution - a cornmeal cake of a perfectly tender, crumbly texture, with a deep, spicy, blueberry compote on top, for example. <br><br>But I&#39;ve had some awkward moments with the service, most notably, the time when the fiddleheads were left off my fiddlehead pasta, or they forgot to serve coffee at a catered brunch party I attended. Sure, the food was actually still great in both instances, but, um . . . keep your eye on the ball, Flora. <br><br>And then there was that period when the whole place was decorated with the work of a local wedding photographer. Like, it was a selection of random engagement photos and such. Thank god I was having dinner with my husband of many years. There were people there on dates, for goodness sake. In general, I kind of feel like they could do better with the absolutely gorgeous building they&#39;ve got.",

"reviewcomment":"It took me a little while to figure out how many starts to give Yasu. As you&#39;ve probably noticed, I&#39;ve given them 4. Here&#39;s why:<br><br>The food was pretty good. We did the Korean Barbeque Combo 1 and got a few pieces of sushi. The sushi, while not bad, did not rank as one of the better sushi I&#39;ve had in the Boston area. <br><br>In pseudo-contrast, he barbeque combo platter was great! They really give you a large quantity of food; the combo platter was meant for 2 people, but we were able to split it between three people just fine (plus some sushi). <br><br>As part of the platter, we got beef, chicken, and pork bulgogi as well as kalbi. I especially enjoyed the beef bulgogi and the kalbi, and the pork was ok. I&#39;m really sensitive to spice, so I struggled with the pork a bit. However,I really wasn&#39;t a fan of the chicken bulgogi. I&#39;m not sure if it was the marinade or the cut of chicken, but it really didn&#39;t do it for me. <br><br>In addition to the meat, it also included vegetables. They were fine. As part of the combo platter, they also have us two bowls of rice and miso soup. They also had a bunch of little side dishes, such as pickled daikon.<br><br>So, why didn&#39;t it get five stars? Mostly because I wasn&#39;t super impressed with their service. The service was ok, but they really didn&#39;t come around that often given that you are cooking the food. I&#39;ve been to other Korean bbq restaurants where they practically hovered over you to make sure the food was cooked correctly. While that&#39;s REALLY not necessary, our food would have burned if we had waited for them. Perhaps that&#39;s not their job to make sure our food cooks correctly, but it&#39;s always nice when they are a little extra attentive.<br><br>All in all, this was a good place, and I could see myself coming again.",

It&#39;s a Boston bar, and with that, it would get 3 stars. But this is for the food.<br><br>I had the luxury of eating here. At first when my friend suggested to meet there, I was a little hap-hazard. I mean, it&#39;s a bar. A club. However, I was beyond beyond pleased with my entire experience. Their chicken fingers are by far, in my top 3 best chicken fingers I have ever had. And if you know me, you know how competitive this ranking is. Like, I could live off of these. Overall, everyone&#39;s food was very very good (nachos, salad, fries). <br><br>Looking for a sports bar? Looking for young 20&#39;s? Looking for good bar food? Looking for a sports game?

For example, It was a freezing cold day and I wanted a hot toddy with appetizers and Barlow&#39;s gave me exactly that! How could I not love that?! <br><br>It&#39;s a large room, all wooden bar, chairs, floors...perfect place to go in the wintertime on a Saturday or Sunday afternoon for drinks and to keep warm. They had lots of TV&#39;s so it seemed like a good place to watch a game. Our bartenders were friendly and accommodating, not pushy at all. The food was great too. Soups, calamari and fries were unique and delicious. Did I mention they made a me a hot toddy with Jameson and apple cider? Yum! It is a bit isolated from the rest of the Seaport or whatever we&#39;re calling that part of Boston these days.  I might not go to the area just for Barlow&#39;s, but would definitely go back if in the area for a concert at the Pavilion or at the ICA.",

"reviewcomment":"When your Bostonian friends want to take you out to dinner and insist on steering clear of the de facto spot for Italian cuisine in the North End, you might feel two things:<br>1. Resentful because you really only have one shot at eating at the place you&#39;ve been trying to eat Italian at but now cannot<br>2. Helpless because they drove, want to pay for your dinner, and above all vouch for their go-to spot.<br><br>Guess what? You&#39;re at their mercy, so make the best of it.<br><br>My friends professed to be regulars at L&#39;osteria and vehemently expressed that we did not require reservations because of that fact. Well, I have my doubts about their claim. When we walked in, the maître d&#39; greeted us as strangers and did not recognize my friends! When asked if we had reservations, my friends replied, &#39;no.&#39; Immediately, his tepidly friendly disposition became ever the more pissy. Dinner was rapidly taking a sour note. He became reluctant to seat us in spite the fact that capacity was not even 25%. Finally after a little persuasion, he agreed to seat our party. For the record, by the time our party left the premises, the dining room did not even reach 50% capacity.<br><br>As you would expect, complimentary bread served along olive oil and balsamic vinegar arrived at our table with haste. I didn&#39;t want to get too full because I was hoping to leave ample room to devour concessions at Fenway.<br><br>Gnocchi with Marinara: 4/5<br>One of my favorite things to order at Italian restaurants is gnocchi. For whatever reason, I have conceived in my mind that if a restaurant can pull off this dish admirably, then they should be capable of making decent Italian cuisine. I nearly avoided their gnocchi because my friends swore by L&#39;osteria&#39;s Chicken Parmesan and were practically pressuring me to go that route. Frankly, I&#39;m delighted to have stayed with my instincts. L&#39;osteria&#39;s homemade gnocchi was served with just enough mildly sweet and tangy marinara. I found them to not be as pillowy as I would have liked but did melt in my mouth like any amazing hand crafted gnocchi should. Surely, a dish I would not hesitate ordering again.<br><br>Some closing thoughts...<br>Compound the fact that we did not have reservations nor consume alcohol, service was less than stellar as waitstaff seemed less enthused to wait on our table. Guess what? I still tipped a bit over 20%.<br><br>If you are not familiar with my reviews, you will come to realize that I seldom penalize a business for service (or the lack thereof). The reason for this is, I would like to think of myself as a fair, understanding person. We all have our bad days and I feel you should not penalize a business with low ratings because your waiter or waitress did not or forgot to refill your tap water.<br><br>I feel reviews should be based on the merits of the product (or food) being served.<br><br>Happy yelping!",

"reviewcomment":"Really good pizza of an actual Italian variety. <br><br>Classic American pizza tends to emphasize sauce, while a lot of pizza joints in Italy focus on a few pure ingredients, with or without a tomato base. <br><br>One of the best pizzas at Ducali, the prosciutto, reminds me of the simple pizzas I used to have in Florence with a few lovely high quality ingredients. It doesn&#39;t have a tomato sauce but comes with fresh cherry tomatoes and arugula on top. And prosciutto of course. Yum. For those who like a tomato sauce base I recommend the three meat pizza. <br><br>It&#39;s definitely a family place. Earnest but sometimes surly service. Great beer on tap selection.",

"reviewcomment":"I&#39;ve been going to Bistro 5 every year for the past three years for birthdays and other special events. When I had my wedding dinner here last summer with family, they put together an amazing, cohesive, and elegant menu that really emphasized the ingredients (panko-crusted green tomatoes &amp; duck confit stood out). It was one of the best meals of my life and I&#39;m so thankful to the restaurant for making such a beautiful day even more memorable!<br><br>I always have their tastings because it is honestly one of the best tasting menu deals in Boston. The food is consistently delicious - I still think about a parpadelle I had once (with boar I think). Their wine pairings are always top notch (with their wine guy going to wine conventions to test out and stock up on good bottles) and they give very generous pours. <br><br>Above all else, Bistro 5 provides exemplary service - always professional and without any pretentiousness or elitism. The servers are knowledgeable about the dishes and wines, quick to replace silverware and fill up your water, and attentive.",

Growing up in Boston, I have tried countless Italian restaurants and never been truly happy with my food. My family is Italian and immigrated here in the early 50s. I grew up eating some pretty legit food so my expectations are almost too high.. until I tried Beneventos.<br><br>This restaurant is ridiculous. The service? perfect. The food? perfect. My favorite is the chicken broccoli Alfredo. Simple, right? No. Not at all. The sauce is the most perfect sauce on the planet. Their pizzas are sooooo tasty I could probably gain 20 lbs by eating triple my body weight when I go here. I make a point to be starving before I go so I can eat as much as possible. How one can go to the North End and not stop here is ridiculous to me. Anyone who I have sent here has hugged me in pure thankfulness. Please, do yourself a favor and go here. We can hug later.",

"reviewcomment":"I tried this place for the second time yesterday. Again, I was not disappointed. The salmon sashimi practically melted in my mouth. The shrimp tempura was delicious. I also tried just about every roll. The smaller tuna and salmon speciality rolls were my favorites. <br><br>I&#39;m never quite sure if I am eating the ~$30 I pay for the buffet, but I think it&#39;s just about break-even. And I skipped lunch to make sure I&#39;d be sufficiently hungry for dinner. <br><br>The place has an interesting vibe. It&#39;s in a strip mall, which is not ideal, but inside the decor is pretty modern. There is a ton of seating, so there were open tables everywhere (granted it was a weeknight). Good place for a big group if everyone is willing to fork over that much money.",

"reviewcomment":"Finding authentic German near Boston is tough.  Up until now Jacob Wirth was the only place I knew in Boston serving it.  Now Somerville has Bronwyn a nice and cozy German restaurant in Union Square.  <br><br>I came here this past Saturday night with my girlfriend to check it out.  I made a reservation on OpenTable (highly suggested) but arrived almost an hour early.  I was happy the hostess said she could take us early saving me a few quarters in meter money.  <br><br>The atmosphere was very enjoyable, darker colors and lots of exposed wood.  The dining room is full with long tables, short tables with elaborate arm chairs.  Sadly, I did not get to sit in one...and I wanted to feel like a king!  Shortly after being seated we were greeted by our waitress who handed us drink and dinner menus.  Normally I can find something I want right away but this time I really had to make a good decision.  It has been years since I had an authentic German dinner and I really wanted to make sure I wouldn&#39;t regret my choice.  <br><br>For started a beer and pretzel, two giant ones, were a no-brainer.  Beer was great, pretzels were to die for!  Honestly, I&#39;m surprised I had enough self control to stop at two, normally I could go on and on and one.  Pretzels come with horseradish mustard, be careful it is very powerful.  Gently dip them into the mustard before committing to a dunk.  <br><br>Bronywn&#39;s food is amazing!  My girlfriend had the Schweineschnitzel, normally pounded veal, Bronwyn&#39;s version is pork.  It was delicious, light, crispy and perfectly breaded.  I had the Haxe and was happily delighted by my choice.  Fall off the bone pork meat, juicy apples, tender potatoes and yummy Sauerkraut.  I even ate the Sauerkraut which I normally hate because of the bitterness.  My only complaint of the Haxe was the fatty skin, but other than that I was very happy.  <br><br>Now you have to know that the prices are not cheap.  Normally, I do not drop this much cash on a dinner out for two but in my opinion it was worth it all.  I wish I could afford to come here more often but for a once-in-a-while dining big dinner it&#39;s a good place to come for something different.",

"reviewcomment":"Swish-Shabu has really grown on me.  It has consistently fresh food and good service. <br><br>The house broth is flavorful (and free!), but I recommend trying the Tonkatsu, Tom yum and kimchi broths.  I want to be adventurous and try something new sometime, but those three are so good! I am hesitant to stray away from what I know, haha.  (EDIT: I recently tried the Vietnamese Pho base, and I have to say I was disappointed.  My waitress recommended it, but I found the ginger to be overpowering and I was pretty unhappy with it :(  It didn&#39;t remind me of other pho broths I have had.)<br><br>As far as meats etc. go, I always order a combo.  It&#39;s cost-efficient and you get a great balance of food.  Each combo comes with a choice of starch (rice, udon noodles, vegetable noodles, vermicelli noodle etc), and a plate of mixed vegetables (napa cabbage, watercress, taro, radish, carrot, spinach etc).  <br><br>The beef combo is a classic, and affordable, but I do think the sirloin beef is worth the extra $2.  The meat is noticeably more tender.  <br><br>I recently tried the sushi for the first time.  I just got a salmon (sake) hand-roll and I really liked it!  it was $5+ so a bit pricey for just one roll, but it came with avocado and cucumber and was pretty sizable.  <br><br>I bumped up my rating from 4 to 5 stars because Swish Shabu has provided me with probably 20 great meals over the past two years.  The only things that have &#34;gotten worse&#34; are that it&#39;s busier now since it&#39;s been so successful and that they no longer offer a 20% off coupon in the collegiate coupon book :(<br><br>NOTE: Hot pot is something that I consider relatively healthy.  You&#39;re boiling lean meat and veggies in soup, and the meal is generally light on carbs.  However, I do think it&#39;s easy to overdo the sodium with these meals.  The soups don&#39;t taste over salted, but if you dip your meats in the soy sauce provided you may find your self extremely thirsty a few hours after your meal.",

We wanted to see her so agreed to meet her and the entourage at the Hard Rock Café for dinner. <br><br>It was late afternoon on a Saturday, but the place was not overcrowded considering tourist season is kicking into gear around here. We were early and the tour group was not there, but a hostess seated us on the patio to grab a drink while we waited for our friend for half an hour. <br><br>Once seated in the main restaurant shortly thereafter with the tour group, it was pretty standard food/service. Our server had only been on the job for a week, but did pretty well and seemed to be doing her very best. She managed to bring our orders all at the same time, and there were no screw ups. <br><br>Being a huge music fan, I do enjoy looking at all the memorabilia that a Hard Rock Café has to offer. I don&#39;t go for the food. I did order a club sandwich, and it was actually better than I expected, so there&#39;s that.",

There menu covers everything from steak with mashed potatoes, salads, and the inevitable breakfast choices. The staff is always nice and very personable. However, they are very loyal to their regulars and a bit distant with just the run of the mill college student. The space isn&#39;t too big, but people are very &#34;in and out&#34;, so there is never too long of a line or anything. Busy Bee in terms of food is like any other diner, but the only real difference I see is through their vast menu, they have a consistency in taste. For example, sometimes diners shine in their desserts but lack in their entrees. Getting here is really convenient with the parking across the street.",

Seriously a friend in our group was on the regular for this chain restaurant because she get&#39;s loyalty bucks back.<br><br>They do have quite the selection of margaritas. I had the the Hornitas, using a brand vs house tequila, and the prickly cactus, which was more on the sweet side. Both hit the spot, were not heavily liquored, and that was a-okay with me.<br><br>They do have some decent food options. Several people had the sliders, which must have been good since they were gone in minutes. I had the Mexican Flag which was were three chimichangas and three different sauces. It I was very tasty and very filling. Also tried a fish taco, which wasn&#39;t very memorable. My friends who are repeat customers like their mini chmis and the chimichanga dishes.<br><br>Our server, Chris, did a fine job, considering they were understaffed that day, and the place was fairly busy.<br><br>Prices were reasonable. $8-$9 for each margarita (they also sell them by the pitcher), $7-$10 apps, and $11-$15 main dishes.<br><br>There&#39;s plenty of parking and the Wilmington T stop is a 2 minute walk away.",

You get 2 strips of pork that isn&#39;t dry with plenty of belly fat. Didn&#39;t eat anything for the rest of the day as it was that filling. They try to keep their plates balanced with scoops of boiled corn and broccoli as sides. Their fried egg was an excellent topper. <br><br>Friendly service from a young lady who was considerate working with my friend who is a vegetarian.<br>BAC is reminiscent of the food courts of Asia, albeit cleaner and with heartier portions.

"reviewcomment":"Crossroads is the type of Irish pub you know you will like as soon as you walk in. This is NOT the old Crossroads, as the new owners have put a lot of sweat and love into the place. Both upstairs and the first floor have been completely renovated, you might not recognize it as Crossroads. Overall, the atmosphere is comfortable and after spending last Saturday night in the upstairs bar, we know we will be back. Plenty of sports on the TVs and the background music is great; they definitely know their music and what to spin.<br><br>It seems everything has been expanded: the menu, the beer list, the Irish whiskey selection and the drink list. A few familiar faces still work at Crossroads, but the new bartender - Steve - impressed us. He knew his drinks, and he knew how to make them well. He is a &#34;professional bartender&#34; - friendly, knowledgeable and dedicated to making you enjoy a great night. The manager - Kristen - introduced herself and was very kind and helpful. This is what I call an &#34;all hands&#34; pub, as everyone we met was busy; trying to make sure everyone around us had a great time.<br><br>The menu reflected the environment: Truly, a real Irish menu at a true Irish pub. The old Crossroads relied heavily on burgers; this menu is much more than beef. And the prices are definitely competitive. The two waitresses - Jesse and Kayla - are easy on the eyes, and professional in every way. They took the time to explain the new items on the menu, and made suggestions for my wary friend. I&#39;m going to try a few more items before making my own suggestions to you. <br><br>My suggestion: Come to the new Crossroads, give it a try. It&#39;s definitively NOT the old Crossroads - it is better!<br><br>OPEN - new website: <a href='/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.crossroads-irishpub.com&amp;s=3742545c4aed99a9a61b5a7519b7c08aaca74d327efc0edc9e2a4d72dd3a132c' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>crossroads-irishpub.com</a>",

Thank you for choosing us to open your amazing little gem.<br><br>The servers are as lovely and accommodating as the food is good. They all seem to be very sweet Turkish women for the most part, and know the menu well and present their options easily. Especially helpful if like me, you&#39;re curious, want to try everything, and obnoxiously ask a lot of questions because you&#39;re so excited, starving, and handicapped by your minimal knowledge of Turkish food.<br><br>The place is small, intimate, great for dates and close gatherings of friends. Not a spot to hang out and linger, there are so many others who want to eat here it feels almost sinful to hold onto a table longer than 30 minutes after you&#39;re done. <br><br>I look forward to coming back!",

"reviewcomment":"Maybe its because of the low rating on Yelp, but walking in here my expectation of the place was low and I was pleasantly surprised to discover this Boston based chain. <br><br>I expected a typical fast food joint, but this place is much more like a fast casual place like Chipotle or Panera - it had nicer, warm decoration with comfortable booth and lightening. Its definitely someplace you can take the family to for a meal without breaking the bank. Walking in the place is crowded - a good sign for Friday night for sure!<br><br>I ordered the famous Roast Beef Sandwich, was given a number to take to my booth and sat down to wait. 5 minutes later the food appeared. It was on a small paper plate with a huge sandwich/hamburger. At this point, me and my friend we both confessed that we, in fact, have never had a roast beef sandwich before. Turns out I was expecting more like a french dip kind of thing, and this is much more closer to a hamburger (completed with sesame bun, lettuce, tomato and some sort of mayo sauce). The bun was toasted PERFECTLY, with just the right amount of crispiness. The roast beef was good too, definitely quality ingredients that I didn&#39;t expect given how much I paid for this. But it was a little bland, so the additional sauce on top really helped. In fact, all of the ingredients are fresh and of great quality and I would definitely come back again. <br><br>Overall I really like the place and don&#39;t understand why it only has a 3 star on Yelp. Its much harder for a chain to still maintain quality with a large operation, and I applaud Kelly&#39;s Roast Beef for making that happen.",

You&#39;re going to pay out the wAzzzo for a taco, BUT it&#39;s a good quality taco. Ceviche is amazing! Guac is great and the have micheladas. Done. Saves me a plane ticket home on nights I miss TX.

He really wanted to go to the mall (which we found out does not have much there) and we decided to try Brickhouse on the way home. He had heard about it somehow. We ordered it with the intention of togo, but ended up sitting at the window-bar and eating it. It is very small, with only about 4 seats, so I would plan on taking it to-go.

"reviewcomment":"This place is really one of those hidden gems in Little Italy. Honestly, most of the restaurants in this area are high quality, but I can&#39;t say too many of them are that authentic.<br><br>This one is pretty authentic. The atmosphere is romantic - very homey decor, dim lighting but enough that you can see well, and very professional staff. Great service also! Our server was very friendly and attentive but not overbearing.<br><br>Foodwise, my boyfriend and I ordered the homemade manicotti and the salticcia. The manicotti was perfectly done, very nice cheese to pasta ratio. The salticcia was also very good, loved the sausage. It was a little salty for me, but I am very sensitive to salt. We ordered Moretti beers, which was a nice accompinament. Finally, for dessert, we ordered the tiramisu. It wasn&#39;t the best I&#39;ve had - a little soggy. However, everything was plated beautifully and overall delicious!",

"reviewcomment":"I just got a small bowl of Penne alla Bolognaise, a roll, a can of Polar Seltzer, and a humungous rice crispy treat, for just over eight dollars. That...is crazy!!<br><br>What&#39;s even crazier though, is that the quality of food isn&#39;t compromised at all, despite the ridiculously cheap prices. Viga offers a pretty decent selection of calzones, pizza, sandwiches, salads, and pasta. The Bolognaise was one of several daily specials offered, and it was incredible. Sauteed ground beef, pancetta, red wine, marinara and alfredo sauce, and salt and pepper, all served over penne. The sauce was rich and creamy. The roll that came with it was fresh and doughy and buttery. If I didn&#39;t know better, I&#39;d say I was eating at a fancy schmancy sit-down Italian restaurant, and not some tiny take-out joint that caters to people working in downtown Boston.<br><br>That said, there&#39;s no seating, aside from three tables outside. You&#39;re clearly meant to grab your food and go back to your office to eat. However, I do hope that your trek back to work isn&#39;t very far...their paper bags are very flimsy. Mine ripped while carrying it to a table outside! <br><br>But hey, if cheap to-go bags are the only complaint I&#39;ve got, then that&#39;s pretty darn good! Sadly, I do not work in the area, but if I did, I&#39;d easily be stopping by a couple times a week.",

The delivery guy (same one each time) is also a very cheerful fella, so that&#39;s always nice. :-)<br><br>I never feel like I ever get gypped here. I get a decent amount of food for my $ -- even (especially?) with the lunch specials. They&#39;re &#34;smaller&#34; portions, but they come with little apps (Thai rolls and such) and they&#39;re very reasonably priced. Case in point: my gra pao lunch combo yesterday actually fed me for both lunch and linner (LOL, OF COURSE I ATE ANOTHER DINNER)... all for less than $15 (incl. $2 delivery fee and $2 tip). And they run lunch specials until FOUR P.M. -- huzzah!<br><br>Anyway, I&#39;m a big fan... whether I eat in or eat out, Sweet Chili&#39;s my Thai place of choice in Arlington.",

"reviewcomment":"Boloco has long been one of my favorite restaurants primarily due to the nutritious &#34;real food&#34; offerings and reasonable prices coupled with a really generous frequency discount program, their Boloco card.   Well, they recently raised their prices and changed their menu somewhat.  I absolutely CANNOT compliment them enough on their changes!  They went from being AWESOME to BEYOND-AWESOME.  The nominal price increase is totally worth it for what they offer---and it also goes towards paying their staff better.  The newest offerings are AMAZING--REALLY!!  I just tried their Kale/ Beet/ Sweet potato/ Goat cheese/ mushroom/ Quinoa/ chicken salad and have to say it may well be the BEST salad I have EVER had.  The BEST!!  WELL worth the $8.99.  It is so good that no dressing is needed.  In addition to REALLY tasting good, I feel good about eating it!   I notice that they also have several other choices that I am looking forward to trying.  All of their burrito choices can also be made as salads.  They have also changed their burrito tortillas so that the tortillas themselves have fewer calories!!  The portion sizes are quite generous--the food is HEALTHY---locations are plentiful---Their free Boloco card is rewarding.  Check this place out.  I really cannot speak highly enough about Boloco.  (In addition, their employees are really cool and always pleasant!)   Also, it looks like they use almost all recyclable packaging! <br><br>Accrue additional savings when you pay for all purchases at Boloco using LevelUp: INSTANTLY get $5 FREE to spend at Boloco or any of their participating locations when signing up using this link: <a href='/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thelevelup.com%2Fjoin%2F6219&amp;s=814d81e891cd025c9b5a6ca66e8eb3a074a0c0c876ab0df81f19d31d31ac30ec' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>thelevelup.com/join/6219</a>",

Thereby, there&#39;s a advertisement (outdoor) that says &#34;piano bar&#34; and this called my attention because it is very  interesting a restaurant which has piano bar.  The hostess was so friendly and the sitting was pretty comfortable. <br><br>Nevertheless, the Main factor that called my attention it was because this restaurant exist since 19th century. It is a classical and historical restaurant which breath history. <br><br>However, I ordered some calamari for appetizer and it was so delicious. For during I ordered Stella Artois beer (Belgian beer). Then, the waitress served some bread, but I did not tried because the bread was so big. I ordered some ceaser salad before the entree and it was pretty nice, but it was só creamy ( they putted a lot of ceaser sauce). For entree I ordered some filet mignon with mashed potatoes and vegetables which it was so delicious and I really appreciated it. The filet was soft and succulent.  For dessert, I ordered some cheesecake (I don&#39;t remembered the flavor, but I think it was blueberry), it was soooooo gooood! <br><br>Despite I did not see any piano there, it was pretty interesting went to a restaurant that exist since 19th century. Outstanding American Food. I really appreciated  the environment there. Probably, someday I would come back to have a good American Dinner.",

"reviewcomment":"My sis and I had a 2-hour layover in Boston when we came here, knowing we HAVE to have a lobster roll somewhere!<br><br>At first we were a little skeptical about this place because it felt pricy for a meal.  But we figure it must be really good so we thought we&#39;d go for it and treat ourselves!<br><br>So we ordered one thing and one thing only:<br><br>LOBSTER ROLL - $24.95 (market price)<br>Freshly shucked native lobster, celery mayo, brioche bun, served with French fries and cole slaw.<br><br>My sis asked if the roll could be cut in half and you know what, they just split the meal in 2!  And no, they didn&#39;t just take one meal and split into 2 literally, but we each received our own batch of fresh and crispy French fries and our own serving of cole slaw! It&#39;s like we both received our own meal and the only thing that was split in half was the lobster roll! :)<br><br>The lobster roll was wonderful! There was a generous portion of lobster meat...huge and chunky!  The brioche bun that it was served in was lightly toasty, fluffy and buttery! YUM!  There was a good amount of celery mayo in the lobster that didn&#39;t make the roll overly rich.  I&#39;m not fan of cole slaw but I sure had a couple of bites because it seemed to fit well.  <br><br>I&#39;m glad t sis and I made the right choice eating here...this meal was just enough for the both of us!  Our server Monica was absolutely wonderful!  She was so friendly and nice!<br><br>Thanks legal for making our layover a wonderful one! :)",

"reviewcomment":"Worth every dime!... In planning my trip to Boston many yelp reviews insisted that I must try Pauli&#39;s  for the experience of a great lobster roll. <br><br>As soon as I landed I had the cab driver take me straight to Little Italy where Pauli&#39;s is located. We entered Pauli&#39;s around 1pm on Thursday and to my surprise the joint didn&#39;t have many customers considering it was lunch time but the workers behind the counter worked as if they were swamped with orders. <br><br>As soon as we entered I walked to the counter and ordered with out looking at the menu but my friend however took her precious time reviewing and inquiring about the different selections of lobster creations that they had. We sat down and not even 10 minutes later our orders came out. To my surprise my lobster roll came loaded with lumps and lumps of lobster meat. Once my friend opened her container I became super jealous... she ordered a lobster grilled cheese sandwich. .. whaaaat???? Where they do that? I had to taste and I was even more jealous because it was sooooo delicious. <br><br>Overall,  both selections were to die for. I spent $17 for my lobster roll which came with bag of chips and she spent $18 on her grilled cheese lobster sandwich that came with fries.<br><br>If you visit Boston anytime soon you need to stop by Pauli&#39;s",

"reviewcomment":"Well, I know it&#39;s not a popular opinion, but at least as far as watching a football game goes, I&#39;m a fan of sitting Courtside. <br><br>One thing I&#39;ve never really been is an out-of-market fan. I&#39;m a son of the Commonwealth, born and raised. So my love of the Patriots is undiluted and unchanging.  I have quite a few friends, however, whose transplanted citizenship did not dissuade them from following their teams, and I&#39;ve always felt a little bad for them.  You gotta go find an NFL Sunday Ticket, or shell out the dough for it yourself. <br><br>At the courtside, two large groups meet here to cheer on their teams - the Detroit Lions and the Chicago Bears, and while I have no love for Ndamiken Suh, I respect the dedication these fans have to their team. It was nice to have a few pints on an October sunday and hear the cheers and boos of a group really into their football. <br><br>The guys behind the bar are as nice as you could ask for, serving both the bar patrons and the folks at the tables. The wings are HUGE, and while everything is of bar quality, what more do you want with your PBRs and Jameson? I enjoyed myself and wouldn&#39;t mind a game or two more this season at Courtside.",

Then Precinct is for you!<br><br>While it might be a bit too dark for you to read your menu at your table, chances are whatever you pick will be just fine. All of the entrees are perfectly priced and tasty enough. It&#39;s nicer than bar food, but with bar food prices. <br><br>The cocktails are creative and tasty, keeping this joint out of the realm of dive bar. The taps tend to be local and tasty. Like the food, the drinks are reasonably priced. <br><br>When we were last in, there was one waitress for the entire floor. She was a committed caver/waitress. A lesser experienced staff member would have been swamped and bedraggled, but she juggled her heavy table load like an expert spelunker. <br><br>Unfortunately, we hear they&#39;re going to be closing for some renovations. Part of the charm of Precinct is the falling apart walls, upholstery coming off of the booths and the winding hallways which eventually lead to the restrooms. <br><br>Just bring a helmet with a flashlight tapped on it.",

"reviewcomment":"Literally my favorite bar in Boston. I am not exaggerating, I lived in the area, I went to law school in the area and I have a fair basis for comparison. It is what some would call &#34;divey&#34;, but I&#39;d argue it adds to the charm. It&#39;s the kind&#39;ve bar that sums up the city in general.<br>      The drinks are always great, always reasonably priced. They have a stocked and loaded bar and they&#39;ll provide just about anything. They have a fair selection on tap and a good selection of bottled beers. They have great prices for pitchers and nice specials on things like Molson&#39;s and Coors<br>     The bar is also in an excellent location. It is almost right across from the capital. It is close enough to Quincy Market that it is easily within walking distance, but far enough that it is not overpriced. It is about a 10 minute walking distance from the Garden, so it makes for a great pre-game place for Bruins games, Celtics games, and other assorted events.<br>     The insides are also charming and friendly. There are several tv&#39;s and even a drop down screen for a projector on certain nights. Most of all it has the friendliest staff of any bar in Boston. The bartenders are excellent people who are funny, engaging and friendly. It never feels as though they are stretching or going out of their way to talk and laugh with customers. They legitimately are just nice and funny people.<br>     Hands down, the Hub Pub is the best bar in Boston.",

"reviewcomment":"Met here for dinner and drinks because of a suggestion from a friend who lives in the area.  <br>I got there first and sat at the bar, the bar tender came over and I asked for a few suggestions on drinks, they all sounded pretty good.  I am a huge fan of Bloody Mary&#39;s and they had a Dirty Tomato. The bar tender said it was tasty, she was right! It was strong but she told me it would be.  Very nice drink.  <br>The have a soup and egg roll special of the day. The different egg roll a day is an interesting idea.  <br>We ended up eating at the bar. We started with the Mac and Cheese Bites- amazing! They were plated on a red pepper sauce that was very good.  We later got a flat bread with steak, mashed potatoes, bacon and blue cheese- another good eat.  The steak was very tasty.  All of the plates were smallish- just right to snack and share.  <br>For dessert and the whole reason for going here was the ice cream cookie sandwich.  We got it with chocolate ice cream and it was worth it! Homemade cookies with chocolate cream and jimmies.  It was also cut up so we could share.  <br>The bar tender was good about checking in but not being annoying.  <br>I would go back again for dinner and drinks, brunch also sounds really good.",

"reviewcomment":"Coffee on a good, bad, or ugly day with music that&#39;ll keep you talking or writing or drinking more coffee. I&#39;ve spent a fair amount of my afternoons sitting around the cafe. Sometimes it gets a bit too crowded here and no seats can be found. I&#39;ll excuse it as a sign that their business is doing their job: bringing in repeat customers and good conversation. Wait around for ten or fifteen minutes and a seat will turn up (on a cold day you&#39;ll have a nice warm seat!). <br><br>As for the food, I really enjoy their bagels and (especially) their cream cheese. I believe they make it themselves? Definitely go for the veggie or jalapeno, as those are the bold flavors that&#39;ll make your bagel experience that much more bagel-y. My roommates are fans of the Allston Sunrise and haven&#39;t really ventured beyond that because it&#39;s their favorite. What I think Refuge does is it hooks the customer on one item, making it hard to resist the feeling when those taste buds are yearning for familiar deliciousness.<br><br>Give it a go, be adventurous. The menu has a bunch of options and no matter what it won&#39;t be too harsh on your wallet.",

"reviewcomment":"Not all Aquitaine restaurants are created equal...<br><br>I&#39;m generous with my 3-star rating for Aquitaine in Dedham. That restaurant is a major disappointment for me. Maybe my rating is generous because I&#39;m a sucker for French bistro food.<br><br>So I came here for brunch one Saturday, after realizing that Shake Shack was going to be at least a 30 min wait to order and get food. Aquitaine was quiet, but felt more charming than Dedham. Although I had bad experiences there, I decided to give this one a shot.<br><br>I really liked the omelettes here, as they&#39;re large and cooked well. They&#39;re not overcooked but you won&#39;t have a puddle of egg at the end. You get a lot of filling inside. There&#39;s also the prix fixe brunch here as well.<br><br>I came recently for Restaurant Week lunch and though it was pretty nice. Overall, the RW menu for this Aquitaine is far more attractive than Dedham. The watercress soup was stronger than I thought and I could really taste the watercress. I liked the consistency of the soup. The wolf-fish was delicate but flavorful. The lobster nage with the wolf-fish had lobster taste but didn&#39;t have any trace of lobster at all, so it was more of a sauce.<br><br>But the winner of the 3-course lunch was the lavender creme brulee. It didn&#39;t taste burnt at all but had a nice caramel flavor. The vanilla cigar cookie was a wonderful accompaniment. <br><br>The only disappointment from this lunch was that the restaurant had already ran out of bone marrow appetizer and this was only the second day of RW. That, unfortunately, is poor planning in my book.<br><br>Service here is generally professional and polite. This location is so much better than Dedham, but you&#39;ve figured that out already, right?",

"reviewcomment":"Absolutely love this place! You can&#39;t compare it to fancy brunch spots like Abe &amp; Louies, but it&#39;s good food for its price.<br><br>The inside retains a classic diner feel. Bar seats and a handful of booths. Waitstaff is usually pretty good, except for this one lady. Always grouchy/unfriendly for some reason.<br><br>I went with the Lumberjack this time, my go-to plate. It&#39;s a plate with 2 pancakes (you can request specialty pancakes; I went for the banana pancake), toast, 2 eggs, bacon (i substituted it for sausages), and home fries. Super cheap meal and you can never go wrong. Check it out next time!",

Located on Harvard Ave, this is a great place for breakfast before running your errands for the day. <br><br>I really enjoy their hash dishes, all seems to be home made, and delicious. I tried the Benedict, and was in heaven. Their cafe is excellent, haven&#39;t had a bad brew yet. The menu is filled out with some sweeter options for your coffee, one which appears to be a type of frappe, which I will have to try when I next return.",

"reviewcomment":"This is by far the most well hidden and special restaurant I have been to in Boston.  The street is a dead end, but it also looks like an alleyway.  There is parking around (a bit hard to find), and definitely some in the back.  I was surprised, really surprised, to see that it is tucked at such an odd location.  That is also perhaps why it is not very well known YET.  Given that it was Valentine&#39;s Day and not every table was booked.. People in Boston are definitely missing out!<br><br>The Valentine&#39;s Day prix-fixe menu was $85/person, with alcoholic and non-alcoholic pairing available.  I opted for a bottle of wine instead, while my bf got some sort of whiskey that I can&#39;t comment on.  Not a whiskey girl!  The wine I got was Arbois, Poulsard from the Jura (France) wine region.  It is a type of CORAL wine, which I have never heard of.. and it&#39;s delicious!  Very light for a red-ish wine.  Easy to drink even for people who dislike wine.  I also need to give props to my servers because I asked way too many questions (and every single one of them was answered so well!  It actually made the dinner more enjoyable).<br><br>Amuse-bouche:  Flax seed rice chips with Greek yogurt.  The best part was the greek yogurt; sour and opened up our appetite for the rest of the meal.  The rice chips wasn&#39;t as crispy, a bit soft to the bite..can be improved.<br><br>First course: Island creek oyster (raw) with chopped radish, lemon zest, with gelatin on top.  It was fresh, and a mouthful.  I wasn&#39;t sure how to go about it.  Ended up taking multiple bites and took off the gelatin.  The gelatin tasted a bit strange to me (it&#39;s made from seaweed infused water).  Creative, and a bit funny.  The presentation is amazing though, just like the rest of the meal.<br><br>Second course:  Raw scallop with Apple celery infused tapioca pearl, potato chip on top.  Simple but special.  The chef gave us two different dipping sauce as well.<br><br>Third course:  Coffee roasted carrots with pesto and pine nut purée.  I have to admit the presentation was nice, but lacking.  But you know what they say:  Never judge food by its presentation.  This was easily one of my favorite course.  And I don&#39;t even like carrots all that much!<br><br>Fourth course:  Lightly breaded, pan fried monkfish with escargot and reduced powdery butter.  This was also one of my favorites.  The monkfish and escargot were cooked so well, and so tender.  All the toppings and extra touches were nothing short of amazing.<br><br>Fifth course:  Roast lamb and shoulder with pickled mushroom, artichoke and radish.  The lamb shoulder is JUICY and TENDER!  There&#39;s a lot of little things in there, a taste here and there.  The chef is too crazy!<br><br>Sixth course:  Matcha cake and rhubarb sorbet.  Best dessert ever!  I wish I can get the rhubarb sorbet every day.  The matcha flavor was very hint, and I love that it was not a typical super sweet dessert to end my dinner.  It&#39;s mild and sour, exactly my type of dessert!<br><br>Seventh course:  Cherry on top of sour cherry layered chocolate cake, general mill&#39;s cocoa puffs, and creme fraiche.  Another dessert that isn&#39;t just sweet.  I love that I can finish both desserts!  I&#39;m usually one bite and done with desserts.<br><br>Overall:  Very creative.  Very, very well executed.  They did not provide us with the menu until the end so we can taste it as it&#39;s presented.  The atmosphere is very laid back, clean, and open.  It can easily look like someone&#39;s apartment.  The servers, again, were super sweet and fun to converse with!",

The food was amazing, perfectly cooked and the potatoes were very smooth and velvety, and the sauces and blue cheese butter accented perfectly. <br><br>The drinks were very good, however the presentation was a touch sloppy, my martini was a bit too full (not a bad thing at all). <br><br>Overall the dinner was fantastic and a great experience. The atmosphere was also perfect and a great date night type of restaurant for a reasonable cost.",

"reviewcomment":"I&#39;m a pretty big fan of City Slicker and their super eclectic menu. Full disclosure - I&#39;ve never eaten at the restaurant and can&#39;t speak to their service, just the food...<br><br>Friends and I have ordered all sorts of things from these guys including salads, burgers and other entrees like the meatloaf and seasonal specials like the empanadas. Everything has been pretty solid, and some of their side sauces that they make are really delicious too.<br><br>They have greek style pizza with great topping choices like roasted tomato, caramelized onion etc. which are delicious, although the pizza can be a bit greasy. What has impressed me most about their food though has been the pasta dishes. Normally I avoid ordering any kind of pasta for takeout because it ends up being overcooked and I can make it better at home, but City Slicker&#39;s pasta dishes are always perfect when they get to me. Love their chicken parm and the roasted tomato garlic bread is outstanding. Give it a try.<br><br>I&#39;ve never waited longer than 45-60 minutes for delivery even on Friday/Saturday nights.<br><br>I do find their prices to be expensive, but they do use good quality ingredients which helps I suppose.<br><br>So, if you&#39;re looking for something a little different during your next takeout adventure, give City Slicker a shot.",

I suppose I&#39;m more a creature of habit than I&#39;d like to think because I&#39;ve been going to/ordering from the same Thai place time and time again ever since I&#39;ve moved to Arlington... and missing out on some SERIOUSLY good food over here!<br><br>I&#39;m so glad I decided to traipse out of my comfort zone and grab a bite to eat here (word to the wise: unless it&#39;s warm outside, opt out of sitting by the door in those cute little window spaces... très romantique... but also really friggin&#39; freezing because of the draft). The ambience is cozy; the tables are clean; and the service is friendly. Then the food. Oh, the food (accidentally typed &#39;good&#39; instead, because I guess my brain just went there first). <br><br>We started off with an order of the golden bags: yummy petite dumplings filled with ground chicken, corn, and veggies. So crisp, so tasty. And I&#39;m glad we also ordered Thai iced tea and coffee (not sure I can pick a fave between the two) because it helped calm my tongue once I took a few bites of the hot basil chicken fried rice and noodles kee mao entrees. WOW. <br><br>When some places say &#39;spicy,&#39; it&#39;s more like &#39;sorta spicy, but not really.&#39;  Here... it&#39;s no joke. When they say spicy, they mean SPICY! But it was an awesome, delicious spicy, and the flavors of the dish were not lost or overwhelmed by mere capsaicin-induced pain. You can still appreciate the meat, seafood, and vegetables in the dishes here... and appreciate I did. The shrimp in their noodles were so fresh and meaty; the peppers and onions added appropriate crunchy texture; every bite I took was as enjoyable as the first.<br><br>I can&#39;t wait to come back again... this has now become my fave Thai place: where the food is tasty, and the spicy is spicy.

Cool vibes for music lovers.<br><br>The second time I went they were way understaffed, but the man behind the bar was awesome (perhaps his name was Warren, I don&#39;t recall).<br><br>$7 cover charge. Street parking is impossible although both times I went I found parking after only about 5 mins of searching.",

"reviewcomment":"I have been going here for 10 years I think, ever since I moved up to Boston, especially during the 4 years I lived in JP.  Their food is exceptional and I love that the staff is knowledgeable, honest, and helpful when it comes to knowing about ingredients and what can/can&#39;t be vegetarian and vegan.  They are much more knowledgeable and flexible than other Thai restaurants in the area.  My favorite dish hands-down is the Southern Pad Thai.  At most Thai restaurants when you order Pad Thai vegan (meaning no fish sauce and no eggs) it is dry and flavorless, but the Southern Pad Thai here still has a ton of great flavor. You can get both tofu and veggies if you pay a little extra. They also have other great vegetarian/vegan dishes as well as a huge range of meat and seafood dishes. They even have mock duck for the vegetarians!  <br><br>As most Thai places, a lot of their soups and curries have chicken/fish stock in them but a few don&#39;t so you can ask to find out.  The Bor Bor soup is the only soup that can be made vegan (no fish/chicken stock) and it is DELICIOUS. I mean amazingly good.  I just ordered it last night for the first time and was blown away.  It takes a while to get since they have to make a special stock for the vegans but it&#39;s well worth it. I&#39;m pretty sure this soup could cure any winter colds.<br><br>They also have cheap reasonably priced wine and other drinks, as well as appetizers and desserts. The staff is friendly, there is lots of seating, and they have a shared bathroom (with other businesses).  You can sit outside in their patio during the warm months which is fun. They even have a space heater for the customers in the winter to keep the window tables extra warm.  There is street parking or the two back lots for your car.  They also are accessible via the 39 bus and the Green St Orange Line T stop (10 min walk).",

"reviewcomment":"Went here on a double date (4 of us) Saturday night and loved it.  I had low expectations going in, because Dominican food is not always very vegan friendly. I have heard though from friends (non-vegans) that this place is great so I knew the others in my party would eat well (just maybe not me?)   <br><br>We got there early - around 6:30pm so there was no wait as it wasn&#39;t too busy.  Each couple got the cassava with the garlic sauce.  It was ok, the garlic sauce is VERY garlicky.  I got the sangria which was delicious and really strong!  And it had REAL FRUIT in it, not just orange slices, yum!! One of the best in Boston for sure.  My friends got beer.<br><br>I talked to the server about what vegetarian and vegan options were available to me since there wasn&#39;t anything specifically labeled on the menu. She was very polite and super helpful.  I suggested doing a mix plate of sides:  the plantains (both sweet and green) are vegan, the rice and beans and coconut peas (mixed with rice is called Spanish Rice) are vegan (she said no butter and no chicken stock), the side salad with vinaigrette dressing (on table), and the eggplant appetizer (SO GOOD! you HAVE to get it).  The eggplant was the best by far, everyone tried it and loved it.  I don&#39;t really understand how you eat it though as an appetizer, because it reminds you of a Mediterranean or Indian dish but it doesn&#39;t come with bread or rice, so you feel like it lacks something to use to dip into the dish.  But as a part of your entree it was perfect.  She also said they could do a vegetarian and vegan mofongo as well.  You could get it made without the chicken stock and they would use the garlic sauce (no butter) over veggies. So when I come back I may try that, though that garlic sauce would be a little overwhelming if it was your entire entree.<br><br>My boyfriend and friends got meat dishes - chicken and pork? I think as well as the salads, plantains, and Spanish Rice sides. They all loved their meals.  My veggie platter was huge and provided leftovers the next day.<br><br>I was very impressed and would definitely recommend this to any of my meat eater and veggie friends!  I also like the decor of the place and make sure to look at all the famous people on the wall as you walk to the bathroom.",

"reviewcomment":"Brownstone - home of the $5 breakfast. And for Boston, that&#39;s saying something.<br><br>We met friends here for brunch last weekend and this place certainly did not disappoint. Situated in the heart of back bay bordering the South End, this place serves up some pretty bangin brunch options. Even though we had both just eaten breakfast before we came, the options were too enticing to resist. Though we did not opt for the $5 breakfast option (2 eggs, home fries, toast, choice of meat), we did get some other fantastic items.<br><br>We ordered the eggs benedict and the crunchy french toast. The eggs were poached perfectly and the hollandaise sauce had a unique lemony bite which was refreshing. The Crunchy French Toast (frosted flake crusted toast, blueberry compote, whipped cream). I don&#39;t usually go for the sweeter breakfast options (I like my meat) but this was surprisingly awesome. It smelled and tasted like the State Fair of Texas and reminded me of a crunchy funnel cake. <br><br>I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking to try something different for brunch.<br><br>Check out my blog (complete with pictures and childish humor) for the full review!<br><br><a href='/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fthesuchef.org%2F2014%2F03%2F23%2Fbrownstone%2F&amp;s=b342269d6c86db81c7ecdfeb18d9870182f6a3e3a3792aa391160a13ec243677' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>thesuchef.org/2014/03/23…</a>",

"reviewcomment":"Though Cafe Pamplona has a full page of coffee, tea, and other beverage options, I go to Café Pamplona for one of only two things: hot chocolate or cold chocolate. The ratio of milk to chocolate and the quality of the cocoa are just  right. Unlike a perhaps more famous Harvard Square purveyor of hot chocolate, Pamplona&#39;s is not overly rich and viscous. The café offers a handful of salads, pastries, and sandwiches, including a visually appealing medianoche. <br><br>I suppose I also go to Pamplona for the pleasant off-the-grid feeling I get when literally going underground to this bare bones cellar. There is a romantic character to Café Pamplona. It&#39;s a place where you can escape into your own thoughts, or into the company of a paramour. <br><br>Let me know what you think of this review by clicking a button below. Thanks.",

I had the Celtics Maki, which was white tuna with cucumber, avocado, and asparagus (green and white. Get it?), the Fire Dragon Maki, which was shrimp and cucumber with spicy tuna on top, and the Crispy Spicy Tuna Maki, which was basically a Spicy Tuna with tempura flakes. Each one was really tasty. We also tried some of the basics, like the Shrimp Cucumber Roll, and the regular Spicy Tuna. Lots of fish, and it all tasted great.<br><br>Very good. I will definitely be back.

"reviewcomment":"Martin&#39;s Coffee Shop is one of my favorite breakfast destinations in all of Boston. This is your typical hole-in-the-wall diner that serves up the usuals at at very affordable price. However, just because they serve ordinary diner food does not mean they don&#39;t do it extraordinarily well. It is located in the quaint little shopping plaza of Brookline Village and is easy to miss if you&#39;re not looking for it. From the outside, it doesn&#39;t look like much. However, the constant line forming out of their door should automatically tell you that this place is a winner.<br><br>Check out my blog (complete with pictures and childish humor) for the full review! <br><br><a href='/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fthesuchef.org%2F2013%2F10%2F28%2Fmartins-coffee-shop-to-go%2F&amp;s=0bd872d8195b370b1bf9940242eefa6deda288409211c4aa573fb52ed1266fd4' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>thesuchef.org/2013/10/28…</a>",

"reviewcomment":"I&#39;ll give these guys a good rating because they&#39;re super nice, and that goes a long way if you&#39;re a Midwestern transplant in Boston. I would recommend calling in orders for delivery though, because I&#39;ve ordered via Foodler and had a ticket get lost. <br><br>Food-wise, calzones are delicious. The crust is chewy and flavorful. You get to add three toppings (free), and they have a bunch to choose from. A &#34;small&#34; probably feeds two people, if your stomach isn&#39;t a cavernous hole that bottoms out over the Great Pit of Carkoon. [You know, the monster mouth thing that almost ate Luke and Han on Tattooine-- shut up, forget I said anything.] I can eat a whole one, but that&#39;s irrelevant. <br><br>Chicken Alfredo: The sauce was rad, and I really liked the curly pasta-- but the chicken was weird. Pan-fried to the point of crispy/chewy and kinda tough. They sort of made up for that (if you&#39;re factoring in value, I guess), by including a LOT of chicken. Chicken jerky for DAYS. <br>That may have been an isolated incident, though?<br><br>I&#39;ve also gotten a few of the veggie pastas, which were tasty and generously portioned. I tried the Steak Bomb Sub as well-- I noticed that item is pretty much on every Italian-takeout-eatery menu in the neighborhood, so I suspect it&#39;s pretty standard and maybe comes out of a box. But I&#39;d never tried a steak sub, so my palate might be awry. It was tasty enough, just a bit fatty.<br><br>Sides (fries, mozz sticks, etc) are all pretty standard. Probably not made from scratch, but sufficient to fuel your intoxicated binges.  And they&#39;re reasonably priced. <br><br>I think if you&#39;re going for delicious, fresh food-- order pizza and calzones, and try a few of the pastas. The rest of the menu errs on &#34;tasty and affordable drunk food&#34;. But sometimes, that&#39;s exactly what you want.",

"reviewcomment":"This is our new favorite restaurant in Cambridge (the other is the oft-overlooked Bergamot, run by the amazing chef Keith Puller.)  A little pricy, but the modern Italian creations are on par with what you would find in a little locals&#39; Osteria in say, Firenze or Milano.  Main entrees are good, but I say, &#34;Go for any of the pasta dishes;  the pastas are all made that day on the humongous wooden table by owner/chef Michael Pagliarini.&#34;  As others have noted, the Pappardalle with Wild Boar is transcendent.  For apps, the Semolina Cakes are a must;  sort of a savory, creamy, little pudding-cicle is the best I can do for description.  The only starter dish I have been under-whelmed by are the Bruschette.<br>  Cocktails are up to par by Boston standards, and their wine list is focused on some of the lesser-known Italian grapes.  Check the blackboard over the bar for appearances of limited-availability special &#39;Guest Star&#39; wines -- we got a bottle of some low-volume red that a crazed Sicilian guy grows on  the upper slopes of Mt. Etna, and it was quite tasty;  similar to a Petit Sirah in character.  All of the deserts are toothsome.  The knock-out there is the Lemon Torta, which he only makes sporadically.  <br>Finally, MAKE RESERVATIONS!  Giuilia is sited right by Harvard Law, and it has become the de facto HLS community canteen, so is basically mobbed within 20 minutes of opening, pretty much every night of the work week, and then by weekend diners on Saturdays. Hostess/co-owner Pamela makes a valiant effort to seat walks-in at long bar, etc.  But there is only some much room in this narrow old store-front space!",

The pizza was seriously good. Very tasty. Ordered fries and beer also...Also very good...Place was clean...and fun.<br><br>There was a weird incident though. They have a dj on Friday night&#39;s who was very good...and during our meal these two women come in who were obviously drunk and start making out with each other right in front of us...very weird....lol!...They put on quite a show but they were young and hammered so hey...it was just weird seeing that while eating pizza and french fries...lol.

"reviewcomment":"My husband and I were visiting Boston and were on foot when we walked by this restaurant. I was wanting some good seafood, so we decided to go ahead and eat an early dinner.<br><br>It was late afternoon so we were about the only ones at the restaurant. We were seated outside with a nice waterfront view. Although I went in wanting my usual shrimp, scallops, or fish, I was intrigued by this &#34;black pasta&#34; on the menu. I had no idea that black pasta made from squid ink existed! It must not be very popular in the South. Anyways, being the adventurous eater that I am, I ordered the black pasta &#34;aglio olio.&#34; It was delicious. The pasta was hearty and chewy, with plenty of garlic, ground squid, and anchovies to give it incredible flavor. The pasta came out served in the sauté pan and was nice and hot. My husband enjoyed his entree as well. I was definitely stuffed and couldn&#39;t finish mine as much as I wanted to continue eating!<br><br>Our server was friendly although at times inattentive. Although we were one of 2-3 other couples at the restaurant, it took her forever to come back to get our order, waters refilled, and check to us.<br><br>If I&#39;m ever back in Boston, I&#39;d definitely come back just for the black pasta aglio olio. It&#39;s a very unique dish that I probably won&#39;t find in the South.",

"reviewcomment":"Abby Lane is a great spot to hit up before a show at the Wilbur. The food and atmosphere was great and it&#39;s right across the street, so it&#39;s super convenient. <br><br>We popped in a little after 6PM on a weekday before a show at the Wilbur. The place was busy, but not jam packed. Since we didn&#39;t have a reservation, we sat at the bar on the main level. (Apparently there is also a lounge and bar on the second level, but we didn&#39;t get a chance to check it out.)<br><br>The cocktail and beer options were good and plentiful. The food options looked pretty excellent. We both opted for burgers - mine with bacon and provolone, his was just a regular cheeseburger. Both were perfectly cooked - cooked evenly medium rare throughout, which made me very happy. The fries were crisp on the outside and fluffy potato-heaven on the inside. Yum. <br><br>Oh! Pre-meal, we were served complimentary house made blue potato chips with house made french onion dip. It was addictive. <br><br>The service was prompt and friendly. Our server knew we were on a schedule and even though she was busy, she was on top of things. <br><br>If I had more time, I would have loved to have tried more drinks off their menu. Good to know there&#39;s a reliable spot for eats!",

The front door opens up to the bar area where a friendly bartender greets you to either direct you to a table or invite you to sit at the bar. We chose to stay at the bar. <br><br>After looking Over the menu, We decided to have the cheerful bartender assist us in picking an order with variety. And boy, did he pick well. Our group feasted on the Fasika special and zil zil tibs that came out on what looks similar to a fajita skillet.... And we all know the feeling that comes over you when a heated skillet is presented to you. It&#39;s a good feeling.<br><br>The flavor were bold and the portions were very filling. Their Ethiopian beers were awesome and the wine was delectable. The company at the bar was welcoming so after dining we stayed for a few more drinks.<br><br>What a place! I highly recommend it.",

"reviewcomment":"Enjoyed an absolutely amazing night as a guest of a private tasting event at Troquet. A small gang of us, and a bundle of French wine took up at the bar and knocked down a fabulous evening.  <br><br>Chef Hebert chose a pair of Suckling Pigs to roast for us while we drank our way through a few killer bottles of wine.  The wine list here is absolutely top notch by the way, offering vintage selections from the 1970&#39;s and beyond.  A 1996 Volnay Coche Dury 1er Cru, pulled right from the list, had a soft floral character that challenges description. Great bottle of wine. <br><br>GM/Owner Chris Campbell was a fine and gracious host, the bar staff extraordinary and exemplary.  And the food, from my Chilled Maine Lobster Crêpe, dressed with vibrantly bright tomatoes; to the roasted pig, served a la Cassoulet over white beans and Boudin blanc, did not disappoint.<br><br>As if we needed further indulgence, we finished with a share of roasted Pig Cheeks and a sauce from the drippings of the roasted pork. A crispy, near candy, finish to a great night of dining.<br><br>A+",

"reviewcomment":"I had dinner here on a Friday night and was happy with just about everything.   I think we had a 7pm reservation and were seated immediately in the back room which was cozy but not cramped.   From our table we could see a cute dining area in the backyard.  If it&#39;s Kitchen&#39;s, I&#39;d love to come back to eat out there. <br>The house bread was pretty fantastic - pillowy rolls with a sprinkle of salt on top.  I chose the &#34;Sallet&#34; to start - a colorful and delicious mix of greens, eggs, sweet and tart fruit, loved it.  He got clams casino which isn&#39;t really my thing, but the clams were  served on plate of salt and spilling over with crispy bacon stuffing and I couldn&#39;t resist 1 or 2.  <br>Several appetizers looked appealing to me and I considered forgoing the entree for a few small plates (I really wanted a full plate of duck fat brussels sprouts!) but I ended up ordering the crispy half duck since it came with a side of brussels and a big endorsement from our server.   I took the chef&#39;s recommendation for medium rare, and the meat was beautifully tender, but I really would have preferred a crispier skin and a bit more salt.  So the duck was a bit lackluster on its own, but the smoky bed of lentils and baby brussels saved it..  <br>He got the pork and beans.  Of the 3 or 4 different styles of pork, I liked the offal meatball the most.  He must have liked the rib because I didn&#39;t get to taste any.  We both agreed that the sausage and pulled pork were a little bland. <br>The doughnuts for dessert were a big winner, with tangy dollops of jam and vanilla.  <br>Overall, a very good experience.  Some things better than others, but great service and lots on the menu left to try.",

"reviewcomment":"Used to eat here all the time when I lived in Boston. The &#34;staple&#34; soups (that are there every single day) are ok, but the specials are what I loved. If they have their split pea soup or the tomato butternut squash soup, haul over there as soon as possible. It&#39;s amazing something can taste so creamy with no cream! Both are outstanding. <br><br>In addition to being a lover and not a hater, I am a baker and not a cook. Such is my love for these soups that I even bought the cook book, have made the tomato butternut squash soup multiple times and it ACTUALLY COMES OUT RIGHT. Unbelievable. I used to go and buy the chicken broth from the store whenever I&#39;d make soup - really worth it.",

Be careful if you&#39;re a tall person because the ceilings are low. <br><br>A server greeted us and put us in a table in the middle. There is a beautiful display of wine where a fireplace would normally be. Since this is a tiny restaurant, the whole place was filled with the delicious smell of italian food.<br><br>We got a couple of glasses of the house wines. My husband got Peroni beer, and it came with a frosted Peroni glass.<br><br>We ordered the Cozze e Calamari Fra Diavolo dish for our appetizer. The bowl came out piping hot. We gave it a minute to cool off before diving in. Just delicious. The buttery sauce soaking the seafood was awesome.<br><br>I ordered the Gamberi Saggitario and my husband got a Shrimp scampi dish for our pasta choices.

"reviewcomment":"A hidden gem in a dumpy alley. The front door was barely visible, even while standing in front of it, because there&#39;s literal dump trucks in the alley. Good thing it is in the heart of downtown. Hubs and I were wandering around looking for something to cure our hangover...Barracuda Tavern picked us right up. The place was generally empty, but it didn&#39;t feel like a huge cave or anything because the place is small and divey, like an upstairs beach bar in Key West. Speaking of Key West, they had conch fritters...they were delicious, but I&#39;m glad I wasn&#39;t expecting to share these. The order only came with three, but they are dang good. Then I got some disco fries...basically fries covered with a ridiculous amount of melted cheese, gravy, and bacon (I was hungover, don&#39;t judge me). I could have eaten these all day. To be honest, I don&#39;t remember what my husband ordered, because I was in cheese fry heaven. <br><br>This place is definitely a far cry from some of the touristy or hip places in downtown Boston. I think if I lived in Boston, I&#39;d frequent this place for the dope food and summertime vibe.",

"reviewcomment":"The breakfast Montecristo. How majestic does that sound?! How can you not order something like that when you see it on the menu? French toast with scrambled eggs and ham and bacon and pepper jack cheese, as a sandwich, with homefries. Order up, indeed. <br><br>It was a breakfast fit for a man the size of a truck. Truck men everywhere agree, the Breakfast Montecristo is where it&#39;s at. <br><br>I am not the size of a truck. I am the size of a modest 2-door sedan. Therefore I could not be what the sandwich truly needed me to be. But that sandwich treated me good. <br><br>I had initial reservations due to the potentially sticky and/or structural integrity of french toast as a sandwich bread, but those worries were soon put to a soft, cinnamony rest as I sank my teeth (jaw almost unhinged) into the first bite. Fingers came away clean. The sandwich held fast, still resembling a sandwich despite the fact I was unable to bite through the ham on the first (or any) bite and had to remove it from the sandwich to eat on its own. Truck men may or may not have the same issue here. <br><br>I needed to go deeper though. Could I add an additional sauce and still preserve the sandwich? I put it to the test with french toast&#39;s BFF, syrup. With all the concentration of a bomb diffuser I drizzled syrup artfully under the french toast of one half of the sandwich. A bite. Another bite. Momentary out of body experience. Sandwich intact. Achievement unlocked. <br><br>But what about egg&#39;s favorite mistress, hot sauce? One half of my sandwich still untouched, I continued my experiment. Hot sauce was liberally daubed over the cheese of the other (unsyruped) half. I took a bite. No gustas were had. You put up a good fight, hot sauce, but syrup is the clear winner in this battle of the condiments. <br><br>The homefries are the round, chubbier cousins of the potato chip, imparting a delicious rosemary-influenced salt-and-peppery goodness with every soft-but-crunchy bite. These were seriously so good. Maybe top 10 homefries awards. Definitely top 10. <br><br>Also it may have been the Montecristo goggles, but the apple juice was uncommonly good.",

"reviewcomment":"Yummy and affordable shawarma!<br>The perfect end to an afternoon at the MFA, Boston Shawarma is a quick walk from the museum. There were about six tables and a seating counter next to the window. It&#39;s a low key place, and it&#39;s about the food, not the atmosphere. On top of the desserts case they had free samples of some kind of sweet. I don&#39;t remember the name of it, but it was really good, and you could take as many pieces as you wanted. <br><br>The lamb shawarma wrap me and my boyfriend each had was big - one would have been enough to feed two - but I ate all of mine because it was so good. It is spicy; so be forewarned - and they didn&#39;t have any free water that I could see (although they did sell bottled water). It also gets messy, since the sauce and some of the fillings tend to fall out as you are eating. Just get some extra napkins and you&#39;ll be fine.<br><br>For dessert, we had the basbousa and the baklava. Very very sweet, as Middle Eastern desserts tend to be, but it was a great end to the spicy meal. The rice pudding looked really good too, but I didn&#39;t get a chance to try it. <br><br>I&#39;d definitely go back! Shawarma was absolutely worth it.",

At first the waitresses seemed slightly irked by how long we were taking to order but soon had smiles as we all ordered an entree and drinks. Cash money, y&#39;all. <br>Everyone enjoyed their wings, burgers, and sammies. I shared a fried zucchini and baked brie with a friend and we felt pretty damn good by the time we finished. Unfortunately, the brie wasn&#39;t baked into the bread, but the grapes, apple and pear slices were all fresh and crisp. <br><br>Suddenly the fire alarm went off. Everyone still stayed in their seat. Die hard Bruins fans no doubt for it was the finals! Just kidding. Another restaurant connected to the building had set the fire alarm off and the entire line of restaurants was graced with the pounding sound of fire alarm. <br><br>10/10 will go again.",

Within the span of 2 months, we&#39;ve already been here 4 times, always from my honey&#39;s beckoning aiiiiyyyy what will I do with him. <br><br>This place is great. The taste, atmosphere, and TVB news channel/dramas playing in the background is really reminiscent of the cafes of Hong Kong. The menu is there to spoil you with the abundance in choices. Their drinks menu is also large in variety with Hong Kong favorites.<br><br>Major kudos to their cha siu, my god, the best place for them. Their empress chicken also do not disappoint. If there&#39;s meat to your dish, they&#39;re not skimpy. No piece has ever been dry and their cuts are excellent. <br><br>Recs: <br>+Yok Jurn Yee Fan- a cantonese style pasta. Not your Italian tomato base, but meat based. <br><br>+BBQ Pork and Chicken rice (their empress chicken is the bomb!) <br><br>Overall, this place is straight up a hole in the wall. It only took me 5 years to try this out given the dated building it&#39;s located in and the fact that it&#39;s located in the basement. It is THE hidden gem of Chinatown and a great place to get the biggest bang for your buck.",

The food delicious, the company fantastic and we were celebrating my birthday. <br><br>The only problem was that the two things, drink and appetizer I wanted were out. Currently, 49 Social is changing it&#39;s menu so the Hamachi Crudo is off the menu. In addition there were no cuques so I couldn&#39;t have the gin drink I was fancying. That was disappointing. The reasoning was that the printer wasn&#39;t working? Thus, the menu couldn&#39;t be updated. <br><br>That being said the frito misto and seared scallops were great. This place is a hidden gem of the financial district. Usually, it is hard to find a reasonably priced and nicely delivered dish. Here, you definitely got it with the apps.

Scutra looks like not-much from the outside -- almost a strip-mall-type location, but inside the place is well-decorated, not overly lighted, and quiet. That&#39;s the physical ambiance. In terms of a warm welcome and attentive service, it was a standout. Dinner began with crusty bread and a herbed good-quality olive oil. Cocktails($10 range) were imaginative and not fruit-punchy -- mine simply had vodka, gin, and lillet with a twist of orange; and the wine list was short but nice, with enough choices by the glass ($7-9 range). The food was imaginative, too, including a duck and sundried fruit strudel, a not-rice-heavy paella, a lamb scallopin, plus nice desserts. A one-page, thoughtully constructed, and correctly spelled menu (for once!). I&#39;ve had tastes that stood out more than these -- though they were certainly very good indeed -- and the overall experience is definitely one I&#39;ll repeat. I don&#39;t know whether it&#39;s a family- or chef-owned place, but it felt like it, with all the care and pride that such a designation implies.",

"reviewcomment":"The first time I walked into Boloco, I was kind of confused; I saw the burrito bowls, and I saw the guacamole...but where were the traditional Mexican burritos? Instead, I saw Buffalo, Teriyaki, and Bangkok Thai burritos.  At this point, I was starting to get what they meant by &#34;gobally inspired burritos.&#34;  However, I was a little apprehensive, but I had heard good things about burrito and gave them a try.<br><br>And good thing I did.  Their food is delicious, and I have never had something from them that wasn&#39;t fresh.  The guacamole for their chips had dates on them, so you know exactly when they were made.  Their chips also had dates on them.  It was great!  Having fresh ingredients is a big reason why their food tasted good. Additionally, they allow you to get additional things added to your burrito for free.  Which is awesome!  <br><br>My &#39;go-to&#39; burrito is the Buffalo burrito bowl.  Adding salsa and guacamole to it always made it a lot better. As a confirmed guacaholic, I especially enjoyed being able to add guacamole to my burrito bowls for no extra charge.<br><br>Less important to me, but certainly an important factor to think about: the sizes are enormous.  Eating a mini burrito bowl was enough to fill me up.  I unwittingly got the  original size once, and the bowl was really big!  It lasted me for a few meals.  And it really wasn&#39;t that expensive given the amount of food that you received.<br><br>Bottom line: I think these burritos are awesome!  They&#39;re different than your normal burritos from, for example, Chipotle or Qdoba...but if you&#39;re willing to try a burrito with a &#39;global&#39; twist, Boloco is definitely the way to go.",

"reviewcomment":"I was here for the second time for my friend&#39;s birthday a weekend ago. We had a table reserved for the group, which came with a bar service (just means that waitress comes over to your table and mixes your drinks with either cranberry juice or orange juice) and a bottle of Grey Goose. The atmosphere was trendy but crowded. The tables were litereally arranged on the dance floor, leaving almost no room to dance. High risk for tripping over. It was kind of weird that the waitress took away the bottle after each serving. (we had about 8 people in our group and each of us got 3~4 drinks)<br><br>The bathroom had only 2 stalls and there were people lining up outside all the time.<br><br>The music was trendy. 99% house music with about less than 1% of hip hop. I got sort of bored after 2 hours of house music, but I was with my friends so it was still pretty entertaining. Mind you, this place can get quite crowded. At some point, random people started putting there glasses on our table and even sitting on our couch. The drinks spilled everywhere. <br><br>I would say that the crowd was more mature the last time I went. Not much college students or young crowds. This could be a good thing, or a bad thing depending on your own atmosphere preference.<br><br>For general admission, I believe that there is no cover charge. I would go back to this place if I really had to, but not by choice.",

"reviewcomment":"If you were born in the Boston-area, you&#39;ve probably spent many a family parties here . Did someone get confirmed? Go to the North End. Did your boyfriend dump you and your slightly awkward Dad want to do something nice for you? Your probably split a pie at the Medford location. <br><br>Bostonians love talking about the good ol&#39; days when Regina&#39;s meant going to the North End, not to a stop in the &#39;burbs. My brother enjoys devouring the pasta at the Medford location whilst simultaneously complaining that the &#34;real&#34; Regina&#39;s doesn&#39;t offer anything except pizza. These points are valid, there is something magical about going to the North End- filled with men sucking on cigars and the smell of fresh pizza in the air - but the Medford location has its own charm. If you are a Medford-onian, you will ALWAYS bump into someone you know - the bartender probably was in your homeroom, and the man screaming furiously at the TV, was your CCD teacher. <br><br>The pizza is solid. I always just get the cheese, but my parents enjoy going on date night here and spilting the shrimp and spinach. The bar is also a great way to watch the &#34;game.&#34;",

This place gets pretty packed late at night but they seem to have a good system figured out so they end up serving everyone pretty quickly. I say 4 stars instead of 5 because they broke my heart one time, here&#39;s the story:<br>It was a cold winter day and I didn&#39;t have time to grab lunch, 3pm was rolling around and I was starving. I walk past Il Mondo and get a wiff of the pizza and I have to turn around to grab a slice. I get 2 slices to go and hustle home so they don&#39;t get cold. I open my bag and what do I see? 2 slices with crust halfway down the slice burnt to hell. Devastating. <br>Other than that it&#39;s really good pizza, I can&#39;t speak for anything else on the menu because that&#39;s all I&#39;ve had",
