Oh wait, apparently in LA they do. All joking aside though, maybe they should be a little more discriminatory about who they let in here, or at least who they don&#39;t kick out. I recently went here for dinner and even though we had an amazing time we were seated in the main dining area, in the vicinity of a room that was closed for a private party which sounded like it had about 50 loud and kind of obnoxious drunk people in it. Fair enough, this *is* a winery, but seriously, tone it down a few notches. We all don&#39;t need to hear your conversations...I promise you, you aren&#39;t that interesting. Yet the noise level just got louder and louder, until finally the party left the room. All 6 of them. Yep, 6 people making enough noise in there for basically everyone in the main dining room to hear their yelling and SUPER loud drunk cackling laughter. They must have paid a helluva deposit. Anyway, I don&#39;t fault the winery for this, they aren&#39;t here to baby-sit their patrons.<br><br>Though Los Angeles is a young city compared to some others, there is a lot of history here. This winery is a little piece of that history, owned by the Riboli family since 1917 it&#39;s the oldest operating winery in Los Angeles. The layout and decor are still reminiscent of classic, elegant times. Too bad some of that class couldn&#39;t be transferred to certain clientele, but I digress.<br><br>I have been many times to Maddelena restaurant, and always enjoy the food. Their menu is fresh and seasonal, and visual rather than written down. There is nothing quite like a good seasonal menu, when everything is at it&#39;s peak of freshness and not just thrown on, but beautifully arranged on the plate. All the dishes are prepared and wrapped for examples, and you just choose the one that looks best to you. They give you crusty bread, butter, and a salad and a sign with the name of the entree you chose, which is freshly prepared and brought out to your table.<br><br>The salmon lasagna...definitely the show stopper. I wouldn&#39;t have ever thought that combination would work, and actually thought my dad was weird for ordering that. Until I tried a bite...it&#39;s hands down the best lasagna I&#39;ve ever had. Whoever made the sauce, pasta, and tender chunks of salmon into that masterpiece is a culinary genius. My chicken Marsala was good but paled in comparison to this lasagna, it was amazing. The desserts are touch and go...we got the tiramisu and the dessert trio. Most tiramisu tastes like soggy cake to me so I wasn&#39;t a huge fan, and the dessert trio looked a lot better than it tasted. <br><br>I like the gift shop, but everything besides the wines is a little pricey. That&#39;s pretty typical of any winery though, so I can&#39;t knock them for that. What I can and did knock them a star for is the actual taste of some of the food. Though it looks pretty, I found the salad to be more of an afterthought...sad looking lettuce and some carrots, reminiscent of school lunch type of salads. Also the desserts look sinfully good, but they missed the mark on flavor. Of the dessert trio we got (Chocolate filled chocolate cupcake with strawberry icing and a (dry) brown heart on top, a cannoli (tasted old/stale), and a raspberry tart abomination) everything was sub-par flavor wise. And tasted like they had been sitting there for a little too long, way past their peak of freshness.<br><br>Shout out to the staff for holding it down with class. Everyone is extremely attentive and upbeat, and knows their stuff when it comes to food and wine. Just enough attention from the servers to make sure your dinner is going well without feeling like they&#39;re breathing down your neck. Â Even the security guard at the door is awesome and warmly wishes you a good night as you&#39;re leaving.

We set up an appointment and met her at her bakery to taste cake and talk about what we were looking for. She told us that she is second generation local business, which was a plus for us. She was easy going and had great input and ideas for our cake. I did not have an exact vision for what we wanted, which could have made things difficult. Instead, Leslie was very patient and gave us great ideas and feedback. The tasting was great - she offered a variety of flavors that she had available that day and they were delicious. Although she didn&#39;t offer it the day of our tasting, I would love to go back and try some of her pumpkin cake or some of the other seasonal offerings.<br><br>When I arrived to the wedding venue on my wedding day I was so distracted by everything that I had going on. I had no idea how seamlessly the vendors did their jobs, but my coordinator had everyone marching in the right direction. From my point of view, there were absolutely no issues with the delivery and setup of the cake. It looked beautiful! When we went to cut the cake it tasted great, and I was happy that we decided to go with Fantasy Frostings. One huge plus for us was that Leslie did not use fondant. This is not to say she does not, or will not, but we specifically did not want to use fondant. Some of the other bakeries insisted that it was their standard and I could not have a cake from them without it. We had a beautiful and amazing (and yummy cake) just the way we wanted from Fantasy Frostings! <br><br>I&#39;m sure Leslie can do cakes for lots of other kinds of events and I would certainly check them out for something other than wedding cake as well. We tasted her raspberry lemon cake and I asked if she could make a poppyseed cake with the same fillings and she was more than willing to do that.

Oh wait, apparently in LA they do. All joking aside though, maybe they should be a little more discriminatory about who they let in here, or at least who they don&#39;t kick out. I recently went here for dinner and even though we had an amazing time we were seated in the main dining area, in the vicinity of a room that was closed for a private party which sounded like it had about 50 loud and kind of obnoxious drunk people in it. Fair enough, this *is* a winery, but seriously, tone it down a few notches. We all don&#39;t need to hear your conversations...I promise you, you aren&#39;t that interesting. Yet the noise level just got louder and louder, until finally the party left the room. All 6 of them. Yep, 6 people making enough noise in there for basically everyone in the main dining room to hear their yelling and SUPER loud drunk cackling laughter. They must have paid a helluva deposit. Anyway, I don&#39;t fault the winery for this, they aren&#39;t here to baby-sit their patrons.<br><br>Though Los Angeles is a young city compared to some others, there is a lot of history here. This winery is a little piece of that history, owned by the Riboli family since 1917 it&#39;s the oldest operating winery in Los Angeles. The layout and decor are still reminiscent of classic, elegant times. Too bad some of that class couldn&#39;t be transferred to certain clientele, but I digress.<br><br>I have been many times to Maddelena restaurant, and always enjoy the food. Their menu is fresh and seasonal, and visual rather than written down. There is nothing quite like a good seasonal menu, when everything is at it&#39;s peak of freshness and not just thrown on, but beautifully arranged on the plate. All the dishes are prepared and wrapped for examples, and you just choose the one that looks best to you. They give you crusty bread, butter, and a salad and a sign with the name of the entree you chose, which is freshly prepared and brought out to your table.<br><br>The salmon lasagna...definitely the show stopper. I wouldn&#39;t have ever thought that combination would work, and actually thought my dad was weird for ordering that. Until I tried a bite...it&#39;s hands down the best lasagna I&#39;ve ever had. Whoever made the sauce, pasta, and tender chunks of salmon into that masterpiece is a culinary genius. My chicken Marsala was good but paled in comparison to this lasagna, it was amazing. The desserts are touch and go...we got the tiramisu and the dessert trio. Most tiramisu tastes like soggy cake to me so I wasn&#39;t a huge fan, and the dessert trio looked a lot better than it tasted. <br><br>I like the gift shop, but everything besides the wines is a little pricey. That&#39;s pretty typical of any winery though, so I can&#39;t knock them for that. What I can and did knock them a star for is the actual taste of some of the food. Though it looks pretty, I found the salad to be more of an afterthought...sad looking lettuce and some carrots, reminiscent of school lunch type of salads. Also the desserts look sinfully good, but they missed the mark on flavor. Of the dessert trio we got (Chocolate filled chocolate cupcake with strawberry icing and a (dry) brown heart on top, a cannoli (tasted old/stale), and a raspberry tart abomination) everything was sub-par flavor wise. And tasted like they had been sitting there for a little too long, way past their peak of freshness.<br><br>Shout out to the staff for holding it down with class. Everyone is extremely attentive and upbeat, and knows their stuff when it comes to food and wine. Just enough attention from the servers to make sure your dinner is going well without feeling like they&#39;re breathing down your neck.

Sheila made one special trip to our office to see the furniture she needed to match the colors to, and then made another trip to go through the different types of display containers for the cookies.

The day of the event people were moving quickly from room to room in order to try all of the flavors. Salted Caramel was gone in a flash and Mint Chocolate was another favorite.

Oh wait, apparently in LA they do. All joking aside though, maybe they should be a little more discriminatory about who they let in here, or at least who they don&#39;t kick out. I recently went here for dinner and even though we had an amazing time we were seated in the main dining area, in the vicinity of a room that was closed for a private party which sounded like it had about 50 loud and kind of obnoxious drunk people in it. Fair enough, this *is* a winery, but seriously, tone it down a few notches. We all don&#39;t need to hear your conversations...I promise you, you aren&#39;t that interesting. Yet the noise level just got louder and louder, until finally the party left the room. All 6 of them. Yep, 6 people making enough noise in there for basically everyone in the main dining room to hear their yelling and SUPER loud drunk cackling laughter. They must have paid a helluva deposit. Anyway, I don&#39;t fault the winery for this, they aren&#39;t here to baby-sit their patrons.<br><br>Though Los Angeles is a young city compared to some others, there is a lot of history here. This winery is a little piece of that history, owned by the Riboli family since 1917 it&#39;s the oldest operating winery in Los Angeles. The layout and decor are still reminiscent of classic, elegant times. Too bad some of that class couldn&#39;t be transferred to certain clientele, but I digress.<br><br>I have been many times to Maddelena restaurant, and always enjoy the food. Their menu is fresh and seasonal, and visual rather than written down. There is nothing quite like a good seasonal menu, when everything is at it&#39;s peak of freshness and not just thrown on, but beautifully arranged on the plate. All the dishes are prepared and wrapped for examples, and you just choose the one that looks best to you. They give you crusty bread, butter, and a salad and a sign with the name of the entree you chose, which is freshly prepared and brought out to your table.<br><br>The salmon lasagna...definitely the show stopper. I wouldn&#39;t have ever thought that combination would work, and actually thought my dad was weird for ordering that. Until I tried a bite...it&#39;s hands down the best lasagna I&#39;ve ever had. Whoever made the sauce, pasta, and tender chunks of salmon into that masterpiece is a culinary genius. My chicken Marsala was good but paled in comparison to this lasagna, it was amazing. The desserts are touch and go...we got the tiramisu and the dessert trio. Most tiramisu tastes like soggy cake to me so I wasn&#39;t a huge fan, and the dessert trio looked a lot better than it tasted. <br><br>I like the gift shop, but everything besides the wines is a little pricey. That&#39;s pretty typical of any winery though, so I can&#39;t knock them for that. What I can and did knock them a star for is the actual taste of some of the food. Though it looks pretty, I found the salad to be more of an afterthought...sad looking lettuce and some carrots, reminiscent of school lunch type of salads. Also the desserts look sinfully good, but they missed the mark on flavor. Of the dessert trio we got (Chocolate filled chocolate cupcake with strawberry icing and a (dry) brown heart on top, a cannoli (tasted old/stale), and a raspberry tart abomination) everything was sub-par flavor wise. And tasted like they had been sitting there for a little too long, way past their peak of freshness.<br><br>Shout out to the staff for holding it down with class.

This winery is a little piece of that history, owned by the Riboli family since 1917 it&#39;s the oldest operating winery in Los Angeles.

Too bad some of that class couldn&#39;t be transferred to certain clientele, but I digress.<br><br>I have been many times to Maddelena restaurant, and always enjoy the food. Their menu is fresh and seasonal, and visual rather than written down. There is nothing quite like a good seasonal menu, when everything is at it&#39;s peak of freshness and not just thrown on, but beautifully arranged on the plate. All the dishes are prepared and wrapped for examples, and you just choose the one that looks best to you. They give you crusty bread, butter, and a salad and a sign with the name of the entree you chose, which is freshly prepared and brought out to your table.<br><br>The salmon lasagna...definitely the show stopper. I wouldn&#39;t have ever thought that combination would work, and actually thought my dad was weird for ordering that. Until I tried a bite...it&#39;s hands down the best lasagna I&#39;ve ever had. Whoever made the sauce, pasta, and tender chunks of salmon into that masterpiece is a culinary genius. My chicken Marsala was good but paled in comparison to this lasagna, it was amazing. The desserts are touch and go...we got the tiramisu and the dessert trio. Most tiramisu tastes like soggy cake to me so I wasn&#39;t a huge fan, and the dessert trio looked a lot better than it tasted. <br><br>I like the gift shop, but everything besides the wines is a little pricey. That&#39;s pretty typical of any winery though, so I can&#39;t knock them for that. What I can and did knock them a star for is the actual taste of some of the food. Though it looks pretty, I found the salad to be more of an afterthought...sad looking lettuce and some carrots, reminiscent of school lunch type of salads. Also the desserts look sinfully good, but they missed the mark on flavor. Of the dessert trio we got (Chocolate filled chocolate cupcake with strawberry icing and a (dry) brown heart on top, a cannoli (tasted old/stale), and a raspberry tart abomination) everything was sub-par flavor wise. And tasted like they had been sitting there for a little too long, way past their peak of freshness.<br><br>Shout out to the staff for holding it down with class.

Oh wait, apparently in LA they do. All joking aside though, maybe they should be a little more discriminatory about who they let in here, or at least who they don&#39;t kick out. I recently went here for dinner and even though we had an amazing time we were seated in the main dining area, in the vicinity of a room that was closed for a private party which sounded like it had about 50 loud and kind of obnoxious drunk people in it. Fair enough, this *is* a winery, but seriously, tone it down a few notches. We all don&#39;t need to hear your conversations...I promise you, you aren&#39;t that interesting. Yet the noise level just got louder and louder, until finally the party left the room. All 6 of them. Yep, 6 people making enough noise in there for basically everyone in the main dining room to hear their yelling and SUPER loud drunk cackling laughter. They must have paid a helluva deposit. Anyway, I don&#39;t fault the winery for this, they aren&#39;t here to baby-sit their patrons.<br><br>Though Los Angeles is a young city compared to some others, there is a lot of history here. This winery is a little piece of that history, owned by the Riboli family since 1917 it&#39;s the oldest operating winery in Los Angeles. The layout and decor are still reminiscent of classic, elegant times. Too bad some of that class couldn&#39;t be transferred to certain clientele, but I digress.<br><br>I have been many times to Maddelena restaurant, and always enjoy the food. Their menu is fresh and seasonal, and visual rather than written down. There is nothing quite like a good seasonal menu, when everything is at it&#39;s peak of freshness and not just thrown on, but beautifully arranged on the plate. All the dishes are prepared and wrapped for examples, and you just choose the one that looks best to you. They give you crusty bread, butter, and a salad and a sign with the name of the entree you chose, which is freshly prepared and brought out to your table.<br><br>The salmon lasagna...definitely the show stopper. I wouldn&#39;t have ever thought that combination would work, and actually thought my dad was weird for ordering that. Until I tried a bite...it&#39;s hands down the best lasagna I&#39;ve ever had. Whoever made the sauce, pasta, and tender chunks of salmon into that masterpiece is a culinary genius. My chicken Marsala was good but paled in comparison to this lasagna, it was amazing. The desserts are touch and go...we got the tiramisu and the dessert trio. Most tiramisu tastes like soggy cake to me so I wasn&#39;t a huge fan, and the dessert trio looked a lot better than it tasted. <br><br>I like the gift shop, but everything besides the wines is a little pricey. That&#39;s pretty typical of any winery though, so I can&#39;t knock them for that. What I can and did knock them a star for is the actual taste of some of the food. Though it looks pretty, I found the salad to be more of an afterthought...sad looking lettuce and some carrots, reminiscent of school lunch type of salads. Also the desserts look sinfully good, but they missed the mark on flavor. Of the dessert trio we got (Chocolate filled chocolate cupcake with strawberry icing and a (dry) brown heart on top, a cannoli (tasted old/stale), and a raspberry tart abomination) everything was sub-par flavor wise. And tasted like they had been sitting there for a little too long, way past their peak of freshness.<br><br>Shout out to the staff for holding it down with class. Everyone is extremely attentive and upbeat, and knows their stuff when it comes to food and wine. Just enough attention from the servers to make sure your dinner is going well without feeling like they&#39;re breathing down your neck. Â Even the security guard at the door is awesome and warmly wishes you a good night as you&#39;re leaving.

Oh wait, apparently in LA they do. All joking aside though, maybe they should be a little more discriminatory about who they let in here, or at least who they don&#39;t kick out. I recently went here for dinner and even though we had an amazing time we were seated in the main dining area, in the vicinity of a room that was closed for a private party which sounded like it had about 50 loud and kind of obnoxious drunk people in it. Fair enough, this *is* a winery, but seriously, tone it down a few notches. We all don&#39;t need to hear your conversations...I promise you, you aren&#39;t that interesting. Yet the noise level just got louder and louder, until finally the party left the room. All 6 of them. Yep, 6 people making enough noise in there for basically everyone in the main dining room to hear their yelling and SUPER loud drunk cackling laughter. They must have paid a helluva deposit. Anyway, I don&#39;t fault the winery for this, they aren&#39;t here to baby-sit their patrons.<br><br>Though Los Angeles is a young city compared to some others, there is a lot of history here. This winery is a little piece of that history, owned by the Riboli family since 1917 it&#39;s the oldest operating winery in Los Angeles. The layout and decor are still reminiscent of classic, elegant times. Too bad some of that class couldn&#39;t be transferred to certain clientele, but I digress.<br><br>I have been many times to Maddelena restaurant, and always enjoy the food. Their menu is fresh and seasonal, and visual rather than written down. There is nothing quite like a good seasonal menu, when everything is at it&#39;s peak of freshness and not just thrown on, but beautifully arranged on the plate. All the dishes are prepared and wrapped for examples, and you just choose the one that looks best to you. They give you crusty bread, butter, and a salad and a sign with the name of the entree you chose, which is freshly prepared and brought out to your table.<br><br>The salmon lasagna...definitely the show stopper. I wouldn&#39;t have ever thought that combination would work, and actually thought my dad was weird for ordering that. Until I tried a bite...it&#39;s hands down the best lasagna I&#39;ve ever had. Whoever made the sauce, pasta, and tender chunks of salmon into that masterpiece is a culinary genius. My chicken Marsala was good but paled in comparison to this lasagna, it was amazing. The desserts are touch and go...we got the tiramisu and the dessert trio. Most tiramisu tastes like soggy cake to me so I wasn&#39;t a huge fan, and the dessert trio looked a lot better than it tasted. <br><br>I like the gift shop, but everything besides the wines is a little pricey. That&#39;s pretty typical of any winery though, so I can&#39;t knock them for that. What I can and did knock them a star for is the actual taste of some of the food. Though it looks pretty, I found the salad to be more of an afterthought...sad looking lettuce and some carrots, reminiscent of school lunch type of salads. Also the desserts look sinfully good, but they missed the mark on flavor. Of the dessert trio we got (Chocolate filled chocolate cupcake with strawberry icing and a (dry) brown heart on top, a cannoli (tasted old/stale), and a raspberry tart abomination) everything was sub-par flavor wise. And tasted like they had been sitting there for a little too long, way past their peak of freshness.<br><br>Shout out to the staff for holding it down with class. Everyone is extremely attentive and upbeat, and knows their stuff when it comes to food and wine. Just enough attention from the servers to make sure your dinner is going well without feeling like they&#39;re breathing down your neck. Â Even the security guard at the door is awesome and warmly wishes you a good night as you&#39;re leaving.

Turkey was done for Thanksgiving...that&#39;s out. Not everyone eats ham...think again. Then I saw a good recipe from the food network and decided to cook prime rib. I wanted it to be top shelf quality! The chain grocery stores were either out of stock, didn&#39;t have the size I was looking for or created some other excuse. So I started looking for butchers and found this one. It was a win win for me, considering The Grove is there. <br><br>The butcher was very informative and explained to me the difference between choice and prime, etc. The price of the roast seemed a little steep to me at first.

Oh wait, apparently in LA they do. All joking aside though, maybe they should be a little more discriminatory about who they let in here, or at least who they don&#39;t kick out. I recently went here for dinner and even though we had an amazing time we were seated in the main dining area, in the vicinity of a room that was closed for a private party which sounded like it had about 50 loud and kind of obnoxious drunk people in it. Fair enough, this *is* a winery, but seriously, tone it down a few notches. We all don&#39;t need to hear your conversations...I promise you, you aren&#39;t that interesting. Yet the noise level just got louder and louder, until finally the party left the room. All 6 of them. Yep, 6 people making enough noise in there for basically everyone in the main dining room to hear their yelling and SUPER loud drunk cackling laughter. They must have paid a helluva deposit. Anyway, I don&#39;t fault the winery for this, they aren&#39;t here to baby-sit their patrons.<br><br>Though Los Angeles is a young city compared to some others, there is a lot of history here. This winery is a little piece of that history, owned by the Riboli family since 1917 it&#39;s the oldest operating winery in Los Angeles. The layout and decor are still reminiscent of classic, elegant times. Too bad some of that class couldn&#39;t be transferred to certain clientele, but I digress.<br><br>I have been many times to Maddelena restaurant, and always enjoy the food. Their menu is fresh and seasonal, and visual rather than written down. There is nothing quite like a good seasonal menu, when everything is at it&#39;s peak of freshness and not just thrown on, but beautifully arranged on the plate. All the dishes are prepared and wrapped for examples, and you just choose the one that looks best to you. They give you crusty bread, butter, and a salad and a sign with the name of the entree you chose, which is freshly prepared and brought out to your table.<br><br>The salmon lasagna...definitely the show stopper. I wouldn&#39;t have ever thought that combination would work, and actually thought my dad was weird for ordering that. Until I tried a bite...it&#39;s hands down the best lasagna I&#39;ve ever had. Whoever made the sauce, pasta, and tender chunks of salmon into that masterpiece is a culinary genius. My chicken Marsala was good but paled in comparison to this lasagna, it was amazing. The desserts are touch and go...we got the tiramisu and the dessert trio. Most tiramisu tastes like soggy cake to me so I wasn&#39;t a huge fan, and the dessert trio looked a lot better than it tasted. <br><br>I like the gift shop, but everything besides the wines is a little pricey. That&#39;s pretty typical of any winery though, so I can&#39;t knock them for that. What I can and did knock them a star for is the actual taste of some of the food. Though it looks pretty, I found the salad to be more of an afterthought...sad looking lettuce and some carrots, reminiscent of school lunch type of salads. Also the desserts look sinfully good, but they missed the mark on flavor. Of the dessert trio we got (Chocolate filled chocolate cupcake with strawberry icing and a (dry) brown heart on top, a cannoli (tasted old/stale), and a raspberry tart abomination) everything was sub-par flavor wise. And tasted like they had been sitting there for a little too long, way past their peak of freshness.<br><br>Shout out to the staff for holding it down with class. Everyone is extremely attentive and upbeat, and knows their stuff when it comes to food and wine. Just enough attention from the servers to make sure your dinner is going well without feeling like they&#39;re breathing down your neck. Â Even the security guard at the door is awesome and warmly wishes you a good night as you&#39;re leaving.

Oh wait, apparently in LA they do. All joking aside though, maybe they should be a little more discriminatory about who they let in here, or at least who they don&#39;t kick out. I recently went here for dinner and even though we had an amazing time we were seated in the main dining area, in the vicinity of a room that was closed for a private party which sounded like it had about 50 loud and kind of obnoxious drunk people in it. Fair enough, this *is* a winery, but seriously, tone it down a few notches. We all don&#39;t need to hear your conversations...I promise you, you aren&#39;t that interesting. Yet the noise level just got louder and louder, until finally the party left the room. All 6 of them. Yep, 6 people making enough noise in there for basically everyone in the main dining room to hear their yelling and SUPER loud drunk cackling laughter. They must have paid a helluva deposit. Anyway, I don&#39;t fault the winery for this, they aren&#39;t here to baby-sit their patrons.<br><br>Though Los Angeles is a young city compared to some others, there is a lot of history here. This winery is a little piece of that history, owned by the Riboli family since 1917 it&#39;s the oldest operating winery in Los Angeles. The layout and decor are still reminiscent of classic, elegant times. Too bad some of that class couldn&#39;t be transferred to certain clientele, but I digress.<br><br>I have been many times to Maddelena restaurant, and always enjoy the food. Their menu is fresh and seasonal, and visual rather than written down. There is nothing quite like a good seasonal menu, when everything is at it&#39;s peak of freshness and not just thrown on, but beautifully arranged on the plate. All the dishes are prepared and wrapped for examples, and you just choose the one that looks best to you. They give you crusty bread, butter, and a salad and a sign with the name of the entree you chose, which is freshly prepared and brought out to your table.<br><br>The salmon lasagna...definitely the show stopper. I wouldn&#39;t have ever thought that combination would work, and actually thought my dad was weird for ordering that. Until I tried a bite...it&#39;s hands down the best lasagna I&#39;ve ever had. Whoever made the sauce, pasta, and tender chunks of salmon into that masterpiece is a culinary genius. My chicken Marsala was good but paled in comparison to this lasagna, it was amazing. The desserts are touch and go...we got the tiramisu and the dessert trio. Most tiramisu tastes like soggy cake to me so I wasn&#39;t a huge fan, and the dessert trio looked a lot better than it tasted. <br><br>I like the gift shop, but everything besides the wines is a little pricey. That&#39;s pretty typical of any winery though, so I can&#39;t knock them for that. What I can and did knock them a star for is the actual taste of some of the food. Though it looks pretty, I found the salad to be more of an afterthought...sad looking lettuce and some carrots, reminiscent of school lunch type of salads. Also the desserts look sinfully good, but they missed the mark on flavor. Of the dessert trio we got (Chocolate filled chocolate cupcake with strawberry icing and a (dry) brown heart on top, a cannoli (tasted old/stale), and a raspberry tart abomination) everything was sub-par flavor wise. And tasted like they had been sitting there for a little too long, way past their peak of freshness.<br><br>Shout out to the staff for holding it down with class. Everyone is extremely attentive and upbeat, and knows their stuff when it comes to food and wine. Just enough attention from the servers to make sure your dinner is going well without feeling like they&#39;re breathing down your neck. Â Even the security guard at the door is awesome and warmly wishes you a good night as you&#39;re leaving.

Â I learned a lot from Peter, which I never was able to learn online or from other holistic healers or therapists, and I can honestly say that Peter actually just saved my life. Â I never realized that I am so sensitive to toxins that ANYTHING I take can cause me harm like that when used incorrectly. Â Peter explained that he and his staff are not doctors and do in fact insist on each customer paying close attention to their own bodies, and that they are only recommending the &#39;traditional healing aspects of the herbs and teas&#39;. Â He also spent a great deal of time encouraging me to &#39;be kind to your body&#39; and not use myself as a &#39;guinea pig&#39; because I could do greater harm to myself.

It was fresh, and had the most perfect texture. You know, the one where it&#39;s slightly crispy on the outside, but has that buttery cake-like dough inside.

Oh wait, apparently in LA they do. All joking aside though, maybe they should be a little more discriminatory about who they let in here, or at least who they don&#39;t kick out. I recently went here for dinner and even though we had an amazing time we were seated in the main dining area, in the vicinity of a room that was closed for a private party which sounded like it had about 50 loud and kind of obnoxious drunk people in it. Fair enough, this *is* a winery, but seriously, tone it down a few notches. We all don&#39;t need to hear your conversations...I promise you, you aren&#39;t that interesting. Yet the noise level just got louder and louder, until finally the party left the room. All 6 of them. Yep, 6 people making enough noise in there for basically everyone in the main dining room to hear their yelling and SUPER loud drunk cackling laughter. They must have paid a helluva deposit. Anyway, I don&#39;t fault the winery for this, they aren&#39;t here to baby-sit their patrons.<br><br>Though Los Angeles is a young city compared to some others, there is a lot of history here. This winery is a little piece of that history, owned by the Riboli family since 1917 it&#39;s the oldest operating winery in Los Angeles. The layout and decor are still reminiscent of classic, elegant times. Too bad some of that class couldn&#39;t be transferred to certain clientele, but I digress.<br><br>I have been many times to Maddelena restaurant, and always enjoy the food. Their menu is fresh and seasonal, and visual rather than written down. There is nothing quite like a good seasonal menu, when everything is at it&#39;s peak of freshness and not just thrown on, but beautifully arranged on the plate. All the dishes are prepared and wrapped for examples, and you just choose the one that looks best to you. They give you crusty bread, butter, and a salad and a sign with the name of the entree you chose, which is freshly prepared and brought out to your table.<br><br>The salmon lasagna...definitely the show stopper. I wouldn&#39;t have ever thought that combination would work, and actually thought my dad was weird for ordering that. Until I tried a bite...it&#39;s hands down the best lasagna I&#39;ve ever had. Whoever made the sauce, pasta, and tender chunks of salmon into that masterpiece is a culinary genius. My chicken Marsala was good but paled in comparison to this lasagna, it was amazing. The desserts are touch and go...we got the tiramisu and the dessert trio. Most tiramisu tastes like soggy cake to me so I wasn&#39;t a huge fan, and the dessert trio looked a lot better than it tasted. <br><br>I like the gift shop, but everything besides the wines is a little pricey. That&#39;s pretty typical of any winery though, so I can&#39;t knock them for that. What I can and did knock them a star for is the actual taste of some of the food. Though it looks pretty, I found the salad to be more of an afterthought...sad looking lettuce and some carrots, reminiscent of school lunch type of salads. Also the desserts look sinfully good, but they missed the mark on flavor. Of the dessert trio we got (Chocolate filled chocolate cupcake with strawberry icing and a (dry) brown heart on top, a cannoli (tasted old/stale), and a raspberry tart abomination) everything was sub-par flavor wise. And tasted like they had been sitting there for a little too long, way past their peak of freshness.<br><br>Shout out to the staff for holding it down with class. Everyone is extremely attentive and upbeat, and knows their stuff when it comes to food and wine. Just enough attention from the servers to make sure your dinner is going well without feeling like they&#39;re breathing down your neck. Â Even the security guard at the door is awesome and warmly wishes you a good night as you&#39;re leaving.

Because these little tacos are STUFFED with quality meats. my duck breast taco had a full breasts worth of meat in there and let me just tell you I have NEVER tried anything like it. It was seriously to die for. We got lucky because we were the second to last people to eat this before it ran out for the day. Very unique and the duck had so much flavor and was cooked to perfection. Also tried the pork shoulder and just about fell over from the deliciousness of it all.

Oh wait, apparently in LA they do. All joking aside though, maybe they should be a little more discriminatory about who they let in here, or at least who they don&#39;t kick out. I recently went here for dinner and even though we had an amazing time we were seated in the main dining area, in the vicinity of a room that was closed for a private party which sounded like it had about 50 loud and kind of obnoxious drunk people in it. Fair enough, this *is* a winery, but seriously, tone it down a few notches. We all don&#39;t need to hear your conversations...I promise you, you aren&#39;t that interesting. Yet the noise level just got louder and louder, until finally the party left the room. All 6 of them. Yep, 6 people making enough noise in there for basically everyone in the main dining room to hear their yelling and SUPER loud drunk cackling laughter. They must have paid a helluva deposit. Anyway, I don&#39;t fault the winery for this, they aren&#39;t here to baby-sit their patrons.<br><br>Though Los Angeles is a young city compared to some others, there is a lot of history here. This winery is a little piece of that history, owned by the Riboli family since 1917 it&#39;s the oldest operating winery in Los Angeles. The layout and decor are still reminiscent of classic, elegant times. Too bad some of that class couldn&#39;t be transferred to certain clientele, but I digress.<br><br>I have been many times to Maddelena restaurant, and always enjoy the food. Their menu is fresh and seasonal, and visual rather than written down. There is nothing quite like a good seasonal menu, when everything is at it&#39;s peak of freshness and not just thrown on, but beautifully arranged on the plate. All the dishes are prepared and wrapped for examples, and you just choose the one that looks best to you. They give you crusty bread, butter, and a salad and a sign with the name of the entree you chose, which is freshly prepared and brought out to your table.<br><br>The salmon lasagna...definitely the show stopper. I wouldn&#39;t have ever thought that combination would work, and actually thought my dad was weird for ordering that. Until I tried a bite...it&#39;s hands down the best lasagna I&#39;ve ever had. Whoever made the sauce, pasta, and tender chunks of salmon into that masterpiece is a culinary genius. My chicken Marsala was good but paled in comparison to this lasagna, it was amazing. The desserts are touch and go...we got the tiramisu and the dessert trio. Most tiramisu tastes like soggy cake to me so I wasn&#39;t a huge fan, and the dessert trio looked a lot better than it tasted. <br><br>I like the gift shop, but everything besides the wines is a little pricey. That&#39;s pretty typical of any winery though, so I can&#39;t knock them for that. What I can and did knock them a star for is the actual taste of some of the food. Though it looks pretty, I found the salad to be more of an afterthought...sad looking lettuce and some carrots, reminiscent of school lunch type of salads. Also the desserts look sinfully good, but they missed the mark on flavor. Of the dessert trio we got (Chocolate filled chocolate cupcake with strawberry icing and a (dry) brown heart on top, a cannoli (tasted old/stale), and a raspberry tart abomination) everything was sub-par flavor wise. And tasted like they had been sitting there for a little too long, way past their peak of freshness.<br><br>Shout out to the staff for holding it down with class. Everyone is extremely attentive and upbeat, and knows their stuff when it comes to food and wine. Just enough attention from the servers to make sure your dinner is going well without feeling like they&#39;re breathing down your neck. Â Even the security guard at the door is awesome and warmly wishes you a good night as you&#39;re leaving.

Oh wait, apparently in LA they do. All joking aside though, maybe they should be a little more discriminatory about who they let in here, or at least who they don&#39;t kick out. I recently went here for dinner and even though we had an amazing time we were seated in the main dining area, in the vicinity of a room that was closed for a private party which sounded like it had about 50 loud and kind of obnoxious drunk people in it. Fair enough, this *is* a winery, but seriously, tone it down a few notches. We all don&#39;t need to hear your conversations...I promise you, you aren&#39;t that interesting. Yet the noise level just got louder and louder, until finally the party left the room. All 6 of them. Yep, 6 people making enough noise in there for basically everyone in the main dining room to hear their yelling and SUPER loud drunk cackling laughter. They must have paid a helluva deposit. Anyway, I don&#39;t fault the winery for this, they aren&#39;t here to baby-sit their patrons.<br><br>Though Los Angeles is a young city compared to some others, there is a lot of history here. This winery is a little piece of that history, owned by the Riboli family since 1917 it&#39;s the oldest operating winery in Los Angeles. The layout and decor are still reminiscent of classic, elegant times. Too bad some of that class couldn&#39;t be transferred to certain clientele, but I digress.<br><br>I have been many times to Maddelena restaurant, and always enjoy the food. Their menu is fresh and seasonal, and visual rather than written down. There is nothing quite like a good seasonal menu, when everything is at it&#39;s peak of freshness and not just thrown on, but beautifully arranged on the plate. All the dishes are prepared and wrapped for examples, and you just choose the one that looks best to you. They give you crusty bread, butter, and a salad and a sign with the name of the entree you chose, which is freshly prepared and brought out to your table.<br><br>The salmon lasagna...definitely the show stopper. I wouldn&#39;t have ever thought that combination would work, and actually thought my dad was weird for ordering that. Until I tried a bite...it&#39;s hands down the best lasagna I&#39;ve ever had. Whoever made the sauce, pasta, and tender chunks of salmon into that masterpiece is a culinary genius. My chicken Marsala was good but paled in comparison to this lasagna, it was amazing. The desserts are touch and go...we got the tiramisu and the dessert trio. Most tiramisu tastes like soggy cake to me so I wasn&#39;t a huge fan, and the dessert trio looked a lot better than it tasted. <br><br>I like the gift shop, but everything besides the wines is a little pricey. That&#39;s pretty typical of any winery though, so I can&#39;t knock them for that. What I can and did knock them a star for is the actual taste of some of the food. Though it looks pretty, I found the salad to be more of an afterthought...sad looking lettuce and some carrots, reminiscent of school lunch type of salads. Also the desserts look sinfully good, but they missed the mark on flavor. Of the dessert trio we got (Chocolate filled chocolate cupcake with strawberry icing and a (dry) brown heart on top, a cannoli (tasted old/stale), and a raspberry tart abomination) everything was sub-par flavor wise. And tasted like they had been sitting there for a little too long, way past their peak of freshness.<br><br>Shout out to the staff for holding it down with class. Everyone is extremely attentive and upbeat, and knows their stuff when it comes to food and wine. Just enough attention from the servers to make sure your dinner is going well without feeling like they&#39;re breathing down your neck. Â Even the security guard at the door is awesome and warmly wishes you a good night as you&#39;re leaving.

There is nothing quite like a good seasonal menu, when everything is at it&#39;s peak of freshness and not just thrown on, but beautifully arranged on the plate. All the dishes are prepared and wrapped for examples, and you just choose the one that looks best to you. They give you crusty bread, butter, and a salad and a sign with the name of the entree you chose, which is freshly prepared and brought out to your table.<br><br>The salmon lasagna...definitely the show stopper. I wouldn&#39;t have ever thought that combination would work, and actually thought my dad was weird for ordering that. Until I tried a bite...it&#39;s hands down the best lasagna I&#39;ve ever had. Whoever made the sauce, pasta, and tender chunks of salmon into that masterpiece is a culinary genius. My chicken Marsala was good but paled in comparison to this lasagna, it was amazing. The desserts are touch and go...we got the tiramisu and the dessert trio. Most tiramisu tastes like soggy cake to me so I wasn&#39;t a huge fan, and the dessert trio looked a lot better than it tasted. <br><br>I like the gift shop, but everything besides the wines is a little pricey. That&#39;s pretty typical of any winery though, so I can&#39;t knock them for that. What I can and did knock them a star for is the actual taste of some of the food. Though it looks pretty, I found the salad to be more of an afterthought...sad looking lettuce and some carrots, reminiscent of school lunch type of salads. Also the desserts look sinfully good, but they missed the mark on flavor. Of the dessert trio we got (Chocolate filled chocolate cupcake with strawberry icing and a (dry) brown heart on top, a cannoli (tasted old/stale), and a raspberry tart abomination) everything was sub-par flavor wise. And tasted like they had been sitting there for a little too long, way past their peak of freshness.<br><br>Shout out to the staff for holding it down with class.

There is nothing quite like a good seasonal menu, when everything is at it&#39;s peak of freshness and not just thrown on, but beautifully arranged on the plate. All the dishes are prepared and wrapped for examples, and you just choose the one that looks best to you. They give you crusty bread, butter, and a salad and a sign with the name of the entree you chose, which is freshly prepared and brought out to your table.<br><br>The salmon lasagna...definitely the show stopper. I wouldn&#39;t have ever thought that combination would work, and actually thought my dad was weird for ordering that. Until I tried a bite...it&#39;s hands down the best lasagna I&#39;ve ever had. Whoever made the sauce, pasta, and tender chunks of salmon into that masterpiece is a culinary genius. My chicken Marsala was good but paled in comparison to this lasagna, it was amazing. The desserts are touch and go...we got the tiramisu and the dessert trio. Most tiramisu tastes like soggy cake to me so I wasn&#39;t a huge fan, and the dessert trio looked a lot better than it tasted. <br><br>I like the gift shop, but everything besides the wines is a little pricey. That&#39;s pretty typical of any winery though, so I can&#39;t knock them for that. What I can and did knock them a star for is the actual taste of some of the food. Though it looks pretty, I found the salad to be more of an afterthought...sad looking lettuce and some carrots, reminiscent of school lunch type of salads. Also the desserts look sinfully good, but they missed the mark on flavor. Of the dessert trio we got (Chocolate filled chocolate cupcake with strawberry icing and a (dry) brown heart on top, a cannoli (tasted old/stale), and a raspberry tart abomination) everything was sub-par flavor wise. And tasted like they had been sitting there for a little too long, way past their peak of freshness.<br><br>Shout out to the staff for holding it down with class. Everyone is extremely attentive and upbeat, and knows their stuff when it comes to food and wine. Just enough attention from the servers to make sure your dinner is going well without feeling like they&#39;re breathing down your neck. Â Even the security guard at the door is awesome and warmly wishes you a good night as you&#39;re leaving.

Fair enough, this *is* a winery, but seriously, tone it down a few notches. We all don&#39;t need to hear your conversations...I promise you, you aren&#39;t that interesting. Yet the noise level just got louder and louder, until finally the party left the room. All 6 of them. Yep, 6 people making enough noise in there for basically everyone in the main dining room to hear their yelling and SUPER loud drunk cackling laughter. They must have paid a helluva deposit. Anyway, I don&#39;t fault the winery for this, they aren&#39;t here to baby-sit their patrons.<br><br>Though Los Angeles is a young city compared to some others, there is a lot of history here. This winery is a little piece of that history, owned by the Riboli family since 1917 it&#39;s the oldest operating winery in Los Angeles. The layout and decor are still reminiscent of classic, elegant times. Too bad some of that class couldn&#39;t be transferred to certain clientele, but I digress.<br><br>I have been many times to Maddelena restaurant, and always enjoy the food. Their menu is fresh and seasonal, and visual rather than written down. There is nothing quite like a good seasonal menu, when everything is at it&#39;s peak of freshness and not just thrown on, but beautifully arranged on the plate. All the dishes are prepared and wrapped for examples, and you just choose the one that looks best to you. They give you crusty bread, butter, and a salad and a sign with the name of the entree you chose, which is freshly prepared and brought out to your table.<br><br>The salmon lasagna...definitely the show stopper. I wouldn&#39;t have ever thought that combination would work, and actually thought my dad was weird for ordering that. Until I tried a bite...it&#39;s hands down the best lasagna I&#39;ve ever had. Whoever made the sauce, pasta, and tender chunks of salmon into that masterpiece is a culinary genius. My chicken Marsala was good but paled in comparison to this lasagna, it was amazing. The desserts are touch and go...we got the tiramisu and the dessert trio. Most tiramisu tastes like soggy cake to me so I wasn&#39;t a huge fan, and the dessert trio looked a lot better than it tasted. <br><br>I like the gift shop, but everything besides the wines is a little pricey. That&#39;s pretty typical of any winery though, so I can&#39;t knock them for that. What I can and did knock them a star for is the actual taste of some of the food. Though it looks pretty, I found the salad to be more of an afterthought...sad looking lettuce and some carrots, reminiscent of school lunch type of salads. Also the desserts look sinfully good, but they missed the mark on flavor. Of the dessert trio we got (Chocolate filled chocolate cupcake with strawberry icing and a (dry) brown heart on top, a cannoli (tasted old/stale), and a raspberry tart abomination) everything was sub-par flavor wise. And tasted like they had been sitting there for a little too long, way past their peak of freshness.<br><br>Shout out to the staff for holding it down with class. Everyone is extremely attentive and upbeat, and knows their stuff when it comes to food and wine. Just enough attention from the servers to make sure your dinner is going well without feeling like they&#39;re breathing down your neck. Â Even the security guard at the door is awesome and warmly wishes you a good night as you&#39;re leaving.

Oh wait, apparently in LA they do. All joking aside though, maybe they should be a little more discriminatory about who they let in here, or at least who they don&#39;t kick out. I recently went here for dinner and even though we had an amazing time we were seated in the main dining area, in the vicinity of a room that was closed for a private party which sounded like it had about 50 loud and kind of obnoxious drunk people in it. Fair enough, this *is* a winery, but seriously, tone it down a few notches. We all don&#39;t need to hear your conversations...I promise you, you aren&#39;t that interesting. Yet the noise level just got louder and louder, until finally the party left the room. All 6 of them. Yep, 6 people making enough noise in there for basically everyone in the main dining room to hear their yelling and SUPER loud drunk cackling laughter. They must have paid a helluva deposit. Anyway, I don&#39;t fault the winery for this, they aren&#39;t here to baby-sit their patrons.<br><br>Though Los Angeles is a young city compared to some others, there is a lot of history here. This winery is a little piece of that history, owned by the Riboli family since 1917 it&#39;s the oldest operating winery in Los Angeles. The layout and decor are still reminiscent of classic, elegant times. Too bad some of that class couldn&#39;t be transferred to certain clientele, but I digress.<br><br>I have been many times to Maddelena restaurant, and always enjoy the food. Their menu is fresh and seasonal, and visual rather than written down. There is nothing quite like a good seasonal menu, when everything is at it&#39;s peak of freshness and not just thrown on, but beautifully arranged on the plate. All the dishes are prepared and wrapped for examples, and you just choose the one that looks best to you. They give you crusty bread, butter, and a salad and a sign with the name of the entree you chose, which is freshly prepared and brought out to your table.<br><br>The salmon lasagna...definitely the show stopper. I wouldn&#39;t have ever thought that combination would work, and actually thought my dad was weird for ordering that. Until I tried a bite...it&#39;s hands down the best lasagna I&#39;ve ever had. Whoever made the sauce, pasta, and tender chunks of salmon into that masterpiece is a culinary genius. My chicken Marsala was good but paled in comparison to this lasagna, it was amazing. The desserts are touch and go...we got the tiramisu and the dessert trio. Most tiramisu tastes like soggy cake to me so I wasn&#39;t a huge fan, and the dessert trio looked a lot better than it tasted. <br><br>I like the gift shop, but everything besides the wines is a little pricey. That&#39;s pretty typical of any winery though, so I can&#39;t knock them for that. What I can and did knock them a star for is the actual taste of some of the food. Though it looks pretty, I found the salad to be more of an afterthought...sad looking lettuce and some carrots, reminiscent of school lunch type of salads. Also the desserts look sinfully good, but they missed the mark on flavor. Of the dessert trio we got (Chocolate filled chocolate cupcake with strawberry icing and a (dry) brown heart on top, a cannoli (tasted old/stale), and a raspberry tart abomination) everything was sub-par flavor wise. And tasted like they had been sitting there for a little too long, way past their peak of freshness.<br><br>Shout out to the staff for holding it down with class. Everyone is extremely attentive and upbeat, and knows their stuff when it comes to food and wine. Just enough attention from the servers to make sure your dinner is going well without feeling like they&#39;re breathing down your neck. Â Even the security guard at the door is awesome and warmly wishes you a good night as you&#39;re leaving.

Oh wait, apparently in LA they do. All joking aside though, maybe they should be a little more discriminatory about who they let in here, or at least who they don&#39;t kick out. I recently went here for dinner and even though we had an amazing time we were seated in the main dining area, in the vicinity of a room that was closed for a private party which sounded like it had about 50 loud and kind of obnoxious drunk people in it. Fair enough, this *is* a winery, but seriously, tone it down a few notches. We all don&#39;t need to hear your conversations...I promise you, you aren&#39;t that interesting. Yet the noise level just got louder and louder, until finally the party left the room. All 6 of them. Yep, 6 people making enough noise in there for basically everyone in the main dining room to hear their yelling and SUPER loud drunk cackling laughter. They must have paid a helluva deposit. Anyway, I don&#39;t fault the winery for this, they aren&#39;t here to baby-sit their patrons.<br><br>Though Los Angeles is a young city compared to some others, there is a lot of history here. This winery is a little piece of that history, owned by the Riboli family since 1917 it&#39;s the oldest operating winery in Los Angeles. The layout and decor are still reminiscent of classic, elegant times. Too bad some of that class couldn&#39;t be transferred to certain clientele, but I digress.<br><br>I have been many times to Maddelena restaurant, and always enjoy the food. Their menu is fresh and seasonal, and visual rather than written down. There is nothing quite like a good seasonal menu, when everything is at it&#39;s peak of freshness and not just thrown on, but beautifully arranged on the plate. All the dishes are prepared and wrapped for examples, and you just choose the one that looks best to you. They give you crusty bread, butter, and a salad and a sign with the name of the entree you chose, which is freshly prepared and brought out to your table.<br><br>The salmon lasagna...definitely the show stopper. I wouldn&#39;t have ever thought that combination would work, and actually thought my dad was weird for ordering that. Until I tried a bite...it&#39;s hands down the best lasagna I&#39;ve ever had. Whoever made the sauce, pasta, and tender chunks of salmon into that masterpiece is a culinary genius. My chicken Marsala was good but paled in comparison to this lasagna, it was amazing. The desserts are touch and go...we got the tiramisu and the dessert trio. Most tiramisu tastes like soggy cake to me so I wasn&#39;t a huge fan, and the dessert trio looked a lot better than it tasted. <br><br>I like the gift shop, but everything besides the wines is a little pricey. That&#39;s pretty typical of any winery though, so I can&#39;t knock them for that. What I can and did knock them a star for is the actual taste of some of the food. Though it looks pretty, I found the salad to be more of an afterthought...sad looking lettuce and some carrots, reminiscent of school lunch type of salads. Also the desserts look sinfully good, but they missed the mark on flavor. Of the dessert trio we got (Chocolate filled chocolate cupcake with strawberry icing and a (dry) brown heart on top, a cannoli (tasted old/stale), and a raspberry tart abomination) everything was sub-par flavor wise. And tasted like they had been sitting there for a little too long, way past their peak of freshness.<br><br>Shout out to the staff for holding it down with class. Everyone is extremely attentive and upbeat, and knows their stuff when it comes to food and wine. Just enough attention from the servers to make sure your dinner is going well without feeling like they&#39;re breathing down your neck. Â Even the security guard at the door is awesome and warmly wishes you a good night as you&#39;re leaving.

Yet the noise level just got louder and louder, until finally the party left the room. All 6 of them. Yep, 6 people making enough noise in there for basically everyone in the main dining room to hear their yelling and SUPER loud drunk cackling laughter. They must have paid a helluva deposit. Anyway, I don&#39;t fault the winery for this, they aren&#39;t here to baby-sit their patrons.<br><br>Though Los Angeles is a young city compared to some others, there is a lot of history here. This winery is a little piece of that history, owned by the Riboli family since 1917 it&#39;s the oldest operating winery in Los Angeles. The layout and decor are still reminiscent of classic, elegant times. Too bad some of that class couldn&#39;t be transferred to certain clientele, but I digress.<br><br>I have been many times to Maddelena restaurant, and always enjoy the food. Their menu is fresh and seasonal, and visual rather than written down. There is nothing quite like a good seasonal menu, when everything is at it&#39;s peak of freshness and not just thrown on, but beautifully arranged on the plate. All the dishes are prepared and wrapped for examples, and you just choose the one that looks best to you. They give you crusty bread, butter, and a salad and a sign with the name of the entree you chose, which is freshly prepared and brought out to your table.<br><br>The salmon lasagna...definitely the show stopper. I wouldn&#39;t have ever thought that combination would work, and actually thought my dad was weird for ordering that. Until I tried a bite...it&#39;s hands down the best lasagna I&#39;ve ever had. Whoever made the sauce, pasta, and tender chunks of salmon into that masterpiece is a culinary genius. My chicken Marsala was good but paled in comparison to this lasagna, it was amazing. The desserts are touch and go...we got the tiramisu and the dessert trio. Most tiramisu tastes like soggy cake to me so I wasn&#39;t a huge fan, and the dessert trio looked a lot better than it tasted. <br><br>I like the gift shop, but everything besides the wines is a little pricey. That&#39;s pretty typical of any winery though, so I can&#39;t knock them for that. What I can and did knock them a star for is the actual taste of some of the food. Though it looks pretty, I found the salad to be more of an afterthought...sad looking lettuce and some carrots, reminiscent of school lunch type of salads. Also the desserts look sinfully good, but they missed the mark on flavor. Of the dessert trio we got (Chocolate filled chocolate cupcake with strawberry icing and a (dry) brown heart on top, a cannoli (tasted old/stale), and a raspberry tart abomination) everything was sub-par flavor wise. And tasted like they had been sitting there for a little too long, way past their peak of freshness.<br><br>Shout out to the staff for holding it down with class. Everyone is extremely attentive and upbeat, and knows their stuff when it comes to food and wine. Just enough attention from the servers to make sure your dinner is going well without feeling like they&#39;re breathing down your neck. Â Even the security guard at the door is awesome and warmly wishes you a good night as you&#39;re leaving. San Antonio winery has a special place in my heart, and every time I go it&#39;s an adventure.

Oh wait, apparently in LA they do. All joking aside though, maybe they should be a little more discriminatory about who they let in here, or at least who they don&#39;t kick out. I recently went here for dinner and even though we had an amazing time we were seated in the main dining area, in the vicinity of a room that was closed for a private party which sounded like it had about 50 loud and kind of obnoxious drunk people in it. Fair enough, this *is* a winery, but seriously, tone it down a few notches. We all don&#39;t need to hear your conversations...I promise you, you aren&#39;t that interesting. Yet the noise level just got louder and louder, until finally the party left the room. All 6 of them. Yep, 6 people making enough noise in there for basically everyone in the main dining room to hear their yelling and SUPER loud drunk cackling laughter. They must have paid a helluva deposit. Anyway, I don&#39;t fault the winery for this, they aren&#39;t here to baby-sit their patrons.<br><br>Though Los Angeles is a young city compared to some others, there is a lot of history here. This winery is a little piece of that history, owned by the Riboli family since 1917 it&#39;s the oldest operating winery in Los Angeles. The layout and decor are still reminiscent of classic, elegant times. Too bad some of that class couldn&#39;t be transferred to certain clientele, but I digress.<br><br>I have been many times to Maddelena restaurant, and always enjoy the food. Their menu is fresh and seasonal, and visual rather than written down. There is nothing quite like a good seasonal menu, when everything is at it&#39;s peak of freshness and not just thrown on, but beautifully arranged on the plate. All the dishes are prepared and wrapped for examples, and you just choose the one that looks best to you. They give you crusty bread, butter, and a salad and a sign with the name of the entree you chose, which is freshly prepared and brought out to your table.<br><br>The salmon lasagna...definitely the show stopper. I wouldn&#39;t have ever thought that combination would work, and actually thought my dad was weird for ordering that. Until I tried a bite...it&#39;s hands down the best lasagna I&#39;ve ever had. Whoever made the sauce, pasta, and tender chunks of salmon into that masterpiece is a culinary genius. My chicken Marsala was good but paled in comparison to this lasagna, it was amazing. The desserts are touch and go...we got the tiramisu and the dessert trio. Most tiramisu tastes like soggy cake to me so I wasn&#39;t a huge fan, and the dessert trio looked a lot better than it tasted. <br><br>I like the gift shop, but everything besides the wines is a little pricey. That&#39;s pretty typical of any winery though, so I can&#39;t knock them for that. What I can and did knock them a star for is the actual taste of some of the food. Though it looks pretty, I found the salad to be more of an afterthought...sad looking lettuce and some carrots, reminiscent of school lunch type of salads. Also the desserts look sinfully good, but they missed the mark on flavor. Of the dessert trio we got (Chocolate filled chocolate cupcake with strawberry icing and a (dry) brown heart on top, a cannoli (tasted old/stale), and a raspberry tart abomination) everything was sub-par flavor wise. And tasted like they had been sitting there for a little too long, way past their peak of freshness.<br><br>Shout out to the staff for holding it down with class. Everyone is extremely attentive and upbeat, and knows their stuff when it comes to food and wine. Just enough attention from the servers to make sure your dinner is going well without feeling like they&#39;re breathing down your neck. Â Even the security guard at the door is awesome and warmly wishes you a good night as you&#39;re leaving.

Oh wait, apparently in LA they do. All joking aside though, maybe they should be a little more discriminatory about who they let in here, or at least who they don&#39;t kick out. I recently went here for dinner and even though we had an amazing time we were seated in the main dining area, in the vicinity of a room that was closed for a private party which sounded like it had about 50 loud and kind of obnoxious drunk people in it. Fair enough, this *is* a winery, but seriously, tone it down a few notches. We all don&#39;t need to hear your conversations...I promise you, you aren&#39;t that interesting. Yet the noise level just got louder and louder, until finally the party left the room. All 6 of them. Yep, 6 people making enough noise in there for basically everyone in the main dining room to hear their yelling and SUPER loud drunk cackling laughter. They must have paid a helluva deposit. Anyway, I don&#39;t fault the winery for this, they aren&#39;t here to baby-sit their patrons.<br><br>Though Los Angeles is a young city compared to some others, there is a lot of history here. This winery is a little piece of that history, owned by the Riboli family since 1917 it&#39;s the oldest operating winery in Los Angeles. The layout and decor are still reminiscent of classic, elegant times. Too bad some of that class couldn&#39;t be transferred to certain clientele, but I digress.<br><br>I have been many times to Maddelena restaurant, and always enjoy the food. Their menu is fresh and seasonal, and visual rather than written down. There is nothing quite like a good seasonal menu, when everything is at it&#39;s peak of freshness and not just thrown on, but beautifully arranged on the plate. All the dishes are prepared and wrapped for examples, and you just choose the one that looks best to you. They give you crusty bread, butter, and a salad and a sign with the name of the entree you chose, which is freshly prepared and brought out to your table.<br><br>The salmon lasagna...definitely the show stopper. I wouldn&#39;t have ever thought that combination would work, and actually thought my dad was weird for ordering that. Until I tried a bite...it&#39;s hands down the best lasagna I&#39;ve ever had. Whoever made the sauce, pasta, and tender chunks of salmon into that masterpiece is a culinary genius. My chicken Marsala was good but paled in comparison to this lasagna, it was amazing. The desserts are touch and go...we got the tiramisu and the dessert trio. Most tiramisu tastes like soggy cake to me so I wasn&#39;t a huge fan, and the dessert trio looked a lot better than it tasted. <br><br>I like the gift shop, but everything besides the wines is a little pricey. That&#39;s pretty typical of any winery though, so I can&#39;t knock them for that. What I can and did knock them a star for is the actual taste of some of the food. Though it looks pretty, I found the salad to be more of an afterthought...sad looking lettuce and some carrots, reminiscent of school lunch type of salads. Also the desserts look sinfully good, but they missed the mark on flavor. Of the dessert trio we got (Chocolate filled chocolate cupcake with strawberry icing and a (dry) brown heart on top, a cannoli (tasted old/stale), and a raspberry tart abomination) everything was sub-par flavor wise. And tasted like they had been sitting there for a little too long, way past their peak of freshness.<br><br>Shout out to the staff for holding it down with class. Everyone is extremely attentive and upbeat, and knows their stuff when it comes to food and wine. Just enough attention from the servers to make sure your dinner is going well without feeling like they&#39;re breathing down your neck. Â Even the security guard at the door is awesome and warmly wishes you a good night as you&#39;re leaving.

The market lies off of the South Pasadena (formerly the Mission stop) station next to the stone watering trough erected in 1906. There is such diversity and good cheer here, you can&#39;t help but root for it. If you&#39;re buying the hot food, keep in mind that there are lots of people and seating is limited.

Oh wait, apparently in LA they do. All joking aside though, maybe they should be a little more discriminatory about who they let in here, or at least who they don&#39;t kick out. I recently went here for dinner and even though we had an amazing time we were seated in the main dining area, in the vicinity of a room that was closed for a private party which sounded like it had about 50 loud and kind of obnoxious drunk people in it. Fair enough, this *is* a winery, but seriously, tone it down a few notches. We all don&#39;t need to hear your conversations...I promise you, you aren&#39;t that interesting. Yet the noise level just got louder and louder, until finally the party left the room. All 6 of them. Yep, 6 people making enough noise in there for basically everyone in the main dining room to hear their yelling and SUPER loud drunk cackling laughter. They must have paid a helluva deposit. Anyway, I don&#39;t fault the winery for this, they aren&#39;t here to baby-sit their patrons.<br><br>Though Los Angeles is a young city compared to some others, there is a lot of history here. This winery is a little piece of that history, owned by the Riboli family since 1917 it&#39;s the oldest operating winery in Los Angeles. The layout and decor are still reminiscent of classic, elegant times. Too bad some of that class couldn&#39;t be transferred to certain clientele, but I digress.<br><br>I have been many times to Maddelena restaurant, and always enjoy the food. Their menu is fresh and seasonal, and visual rather than written down. There is nothing quite like a good seasonal menu, when everything is at it&#39;s peak of freshness and not just thrown on, but beautifully arranged on the plate. All the dishes are prepared and wrapped for examples, and you just choose the one that looks best to you. They give you crusty bread, butter, and a salad and a sign with the name of the entree you chose, which is freshly prepared and brought out to your table.<br><br>The salmon lasagna...definitely the show stopper. I wouldn&#39;t have ever thought that combination would work, and actually thought my dad was weird for ordering that. Until I tried a bite...it&#39;s hands down the best lasagna I&#39;ve ever had. Whoever made the sauce, pasta, and tender chunks of salmon into that masterpiece is a culinary genius. My chicken Marsala was good but paled in comparison to this lasagna, it was amazing. The desserts are touch and go...we got the tiramisu and the dessert trio. Most tiramisu tastes like soggy cake to me so I wasn&#39;t a huge fan, and the dessert trio looked a lot better than it tasted. <br><br>I like the gift shop, but everything besides the wines is a little pricey. That&#39;s pretty typical of any winery though, so I can&#39;t knock them for that. What I can and did knock them a star for is the actual taste of some of the food. Though it looks pretty, I found the salad to be more of an afterthought...sad looking lettuce and some carrots, reminiscent of school lunch type of salads. Also the desserts look sinfully good, but they missed the mark on flavor. Of the dessert trio we got (Chocolate filled chocolate cupcake with strawberry icing and a (dry) brown heart on top, a cannoli (tasted old/stale), and a raspberry tart abomination) everything was sub-par flavor wise. And tasted like they had been sitting there for a little too long, way past their peak of freshness.<br><br>Shout out to the staff for holding it down with class. Everyone is extremely attentive and upbeat, and knows their stuff when it comes to food and wine. Just enough attention from the servers to make sure your dinner is going well without feeling like they&#39;re breathing down your neck. Â Even the security guard at the door is awesome and warmly wishes you a good night as you&#39;re leaving.

Oh wait, apparently in LA they do. All joking aside though, maybe they should be a little more discriminatory about who they let in here, or at least who they don&#39;t kick out. I recently went here for dinner and even though we had an amazing time we were seated in the main dining area, in the vicinity of a room that was closed for a private party which sounded like it had about 50 loud and kind of obnoxious drunk people in it. Fair enough, this *is* a winery, but seriously, tone it down a few notches. We all don&#39;t need to hear your conversations...I promise you, you aren&#39;t that interesting. Yet the noise level just got louder and louder, until finally the party left the room. All 6 of them. Yep, 6 people making enough noise in there for basically everyone in the main dining room to hear their yelling and SUPER loud drunk cackling laughter. They must have paid a helluva deposit. Anyway, I don&#39;t fault the winery for this, they aren&#39;t here to baby-sit their patrons.<br><br>Though Los Angeles is a young city compared to some others, there is a lot of history here. This winery is a little piece of that history, owned by the Riboli family since 1917 it&#39;s the oldest operating winery in Los Angeles. The layout and decor are still reminiscent of classic, elegant times. Too bad some of that class couldn&#39;t be transferred to certain clientele, but I digress.<br><br>I have been many times to Maddelena restaurant, and always enjoy the food. Their menu is fresh and seasonal, and visual rather than written down. There is nothing quite like a good seasonal menu, when everything is at it&#39;s peak of freshness and not just thrown on, but beautifully arranged on the plate. All the dishes are prepared and wrapped for examples, and you just choose the one that looks best to you. They give you crusty bread, butter, and a salad and a sign with the name of the entree you chose, which is freshly prepared and brought out to your table.<br><br>The salmon lasagna...definitely the show stopper. I wouldn&#39;t have ever thought that combination would work, and actually thought my dad was weird for ordering that. Until I tried a bite...it&#39;s hands down the best lasagna I&#39;ve ever had. Whoever made the sauce, pasta, and tender chunks of salmon into that masterpiece is a culinary genius. My chicken Marsala was good but paled in comparison to this lasagna, it was amazing. The desserts are touch and go...we got the tiramisu and the dessert trio. Most tiramisu tastes like soggy cake to me so I wasn&#39;t a huge fan, and the dessert trio looked a lot better than it tasted. <br><br>I like the gift shop, but everything besides the wines is a little pricey. That&#39;s pretty typical of any winery though, so I can&#39;t knock them for that. What I can and did knock them a star for is the actual taste of some of the food. Though it looks pretty, I found the salad to be more of an afterthought...sad looking lettuce and some carrots, reminiscent of school lunch type of salads. Also the desserts look sinfully good, but they missed the mark on flavor. Of the dessert trio we got (Chocolate filled chocolate cupcake with strawberry icing and a (dry) brown heart on top, a cannoli (tasted old/stale), and a raspberry tart abomination) everything was sub-par flavor wise. And tasted like they had been sitting there for a little too long, way past their peak of freshness.<br><br>Shout out to the staff for holding it down with class. Everyone is extremely attentive and upbeat, and knows their stuff when it comes to food and wine. Just enough attention from the servers to make sure your dinner is going well without feeling like they&#39;re breathing down your neck. Â Even the security guard at the door is awesome and warmly wishes you a good night as you&#39;re leaving.

Oh wait, apparently in LA they do. All joking aside though, maybe they should be a little more discriminatory about who they let in here, or at least who they don&#39;t kick out. I recently went here for dinner and even though we had an amazing time we were seated in the main dining area, in the vicinity of a room that was closed for a private party which sounded like it had about 50 loud and kind of obnoxious drunk people in it. Fair enough, this *is* a winery, but seriously, tone it down a few notches. We all don&#39;t need to hear your conversations...I promise you, you aren&#39;t that interesting. Yet the noise level just got louder and louder, until finally the party left the room. All 6 of them. Yep, 6 people making enough noise in there for basically everyone in the main dining room to hear their yelling and SUPER loud drunk cackling laughter. They must have paid a helluva deposit. Anyway, I don&#39;t fault the winery for this, they aren&#39;t here to baby-sit their patrons.<br><br>Though Los Angeles is a young city compared to some others, there is a lot of history here. This winery is a little piece of that history, owned by the Riboli family since 1917 it&#39;s the oldest operating winery in Los Angeles. The layout and decor are still reminiscent of classic, elegant times. Too bad some of that class couldn&#39;t be transferred to certain clientele, but I digress.<br><br>I have been many times to Maddelena restaurant, and always enjoy the food. Their menu is fresh and seasonal, and visual rather than written down. There is nothing quite like a good seasonal menu, when everything is at it&#39;s peak of freshness and not just thrown on, but beautifully arranged on the plate. All the dishes are prepared and wrapped for examples, and you just choose the one that looks best to you. They give you crusty bread, butter, and a salad and a sign with the name of the entree you chose, which is freshly prepared and brought out to your table.<br><br>The salmon lasagna...definitely the show stopper. I wouldn&#39;t have ever thought that combination would work, and actually thought my dad was weird for ordering that. Until I tried a bite...it&#39;s hands down the best lasagna I&#39;ve ever had. Whoever made the sauce, pasta, and tender chunks of salmon into that masterpiece is a culinary genius. My chicken Marsala was good but paled in comparison to this lasagna, it was amazing. The desserts are touch and go...we got the tiramisu and the dessert trio. Most tiramisu tastes like soggy cake to me so I wasn&#39;t a huge fan, and the dessert trio looked a lot better than it tasted. <br><br>I like the gift shop, but everything besides the wines is a little pricey. That&#39;s pretty typical of any winery though, so I can&#39;t knock them for that. What I can and did knock them a star for is the actual taste of some of the food. Though it looks pretty, I found the salad to be more of an afterthought...sad looking lettuce and some carrots, reminiscent of school lunch type of salads. Also the desserts look sinfully good, but they missed the mark on flavor. Of the dessert trio we got (Chocolate filled chocolate cupcake with strawberry icing and a (dry) brown heart on top, a cannoli (tasted old/stale), and a raspberry tart abomination) everything was sub-par flavor wise. And tasted like they had been sitting there for a little too long, way past their peak of freshness.<br><br>Shout out to the staff for holding it down with class. Everyone is extremely attentive and upbeat, and knows their stuff when it comes to food and wine. Just enough attention from the servers to make sure your dinner is going well without feeling like they&#39;re breathing down your neck. Â Even the security guard at the door is awesome and warmly wishes you a good night as you&#39;re leaving.

Oh wait, apparently in LA they do. All joking aside though, maybe they should be a little more discriminatory about who they let in here, or at least who they don&#39;t kick out. I recently went here for dinner and even though we had an amazing time we were seated in the main dining area, in the vicinity of a room that was closed for a private party which sounded like it had about 50 loud and kind of obnoxious drunk people in it. Fair enough, this *is* a winery, but seriously, tone it down a few notches. We all don&#39;t need to hear your conversations...I promise you, you aren&#39;t that interesting. Yet the noise level just got louder and louder, until finally the party left the room. All 6 of them. Yep, 6 people making enough noise in there for basically everyone in the main dining room to hear their yelling and SUPER loud drunk cackling laughter. They must have paid a helluva deposit. Anyway, I don&#39;t fault the winery for this, they aren&#39;t here to baby-sit their patrons.<br><br>Though Los Angeles is a young city compared to some others, there is a lot of history here. This winery is a little piece of that history, owned by the Riboli family since 1917 it&#39;s the oldest operating winery in Los Angeles. The layout and decor are still reminiscent of classic, elegant times. Too bad some of that class couldn&#39;t be transferred to certain clientele, but I digress.<br><br>I have been many times to Maddelena restaurant, and always enjoy the food. Their menu is fresh and seasonal, and visual rather than written down. There is nothing quite like a good seasonal menu, when everything is at it&#39;s peak of freshness and not just thrown on, but beautifully arranged on the plate. All the dishes are prepared and wrapped for examples, and you just choose the one that looks best to you. They give you crusty bread, butter, and a salad and a sign with the name of the entree you chose, which is freshly prepared and brought out to your table.<br><br>The salmon lasagna...definitely the show stopper. I wouldn&#39;t have ever thought that combination would work, and actually thought my dad was weird for ordering that. Until I tried a bite...it&#39;s hands down the best lasagna I&#39;ve ever had. Whoever made the sauce, pasta, and tender chunks of salmon into that masterpiece is a culinary genius. My chicken Marsala was good but paled in comparison to this lasagna, it was amazing. The desserts are touch and go...we got the tiramisu and the dessert trio. Most tiramisu tastes like soggy cake to me so I wasn&#39;t a huge fan, and the dessert trio looked a lot better than it tasted. <br><br>I like the gift shop, but everything besides the wines is a little pricey. That&#39;s pretty typical of any winery though, so I can&#39;t knock them for that. What I can and did knock them a star for is the actual taste of some of the food. Though it looks pretty, I found the salad to be more of an afterthought...sad looking lettuce and some carrots, reminiscent of school lunch type of salads. Also the desserts look sinfully good, but they missed the mark on flavor. Of the dessert trio we got (Chocolate filled chocolate cupcake with strawberry icing and a (dry) brown heart on top, a cannoli (tasted old/stale), and a raspberry tart abomination) everything was sub-par flavor wise. And tasted like they had been sitting there for a little too long, way past their peak of freshness.<br><br>Shout out to the staff for holding it down with class. Everyone is extremely attentive and upbeat, and knows their stuff when it comes to food and wine. Just enough attention from the servers to make sure your dinner is going well without feeling like they&#39;re breathing down your neck. Â Even the security guard at the door is awesome and warmly wishes you a good night as you&#39;re leaving.

Â He was super friendly and knowledgeable--I actually learned some things about boba, which I enjoyed--and accommodated my request to have a coconut milk tea without sugar (my blood sugar tested a bit high recently, so I&#39;m being careful). Â The boba had a great chew to it, and the natural sweetness of the honey-dipped boba brought just enough sweetness to the tea and worked nicely with the coconut flavor. Â The owner let me try a little of the milk tea (yes, that had the regular sugar), which was delicious.

Oh wait, apparently in LA they do. All joking aside though, maybe they should be a little more discriminatory about who they let in here, or at least who they don&#39;t kick out. I recently went here for dinner and even though we had an amazing time we were seated in the main dining area, in the vicinity of a room that was closed for a private party which sounded like it had about 50 loud and kind of obnoxious drunk people in it. Fair enough, this *is* a winery, but seriously, tone it down a few notches. We all don&#39;t need to hear your conversations...I promise you, you aren&#39;t that interesting. Yet the noise level just got louder and louder, until finally the party left the room. All 6 of them. Yep, 6 people making enough noise in there for basically everyone in the main dining room to hear their yelling and SUPER loud drunk cackling laughter. They must have paid a helluva deposit. Anyway, I don&#39;t fault the winery for this, they aren&#39;t here to baby-sit their patrons.<br><br>Though Los Angeles is a young city compared to some others, there is a lot of history here. This winery is a little piece of that history, owned by the Riboli family since 1917 it&#39;s the oldest operating winery in Los Angeles. The layout and decor are still reminiscent of classic, elegant times. Too bad some of that class couldn&#39;t be transferred to certain clientele, but I digress.<br><br>I have been many times to Maddelena restaurant, and always enjoy the food. Their menu is fresh and seasonal, and visual rather than written down. There is nothing quite like a good seasonal menu, when everything is at it&#39;s peak of freshness and not just thrown on, but beautifully arranged on the plate. All the dishes are prepared and wrapped for examples, and you just choose the one that looks best to you. They give you crusty bread, butter, and a salad and a sign with the name of the entree you chose, which is freshly prepared and brought out to your table.<br><br>The salmon lasagna...definitely the show stopper. I wouldn&#39;t have ever thought that combination would work, and actually thought my dad was weird for ordering that. Until I tried a bite...it&#39;s hands down the best lasagna I&#39;ve ever had. Whoever made the sauce, pasta, and tender chunks of salmon into that masterpiece is a culinary genius. My chicken Marsala was good but paled in comparison to this lasagna, it was amazing. The desserts are touch and go...we got the tiramisu and the dessert trio. Most tiramisu tastes like soggy cake to me so I wasn&#39;t a huge fan, and the dessert trio looked a lot better than it tasted. <br><br>I like the gift shop, but everything besides the wines is a little pricey. That&#39;s pretty typical of any winery though, so I can&#39;t knock them for that. What I can and did knock them a star for is the actual taste of some of the food. Though it looks pretty, I found the salad to be more of an afterthought...sad looking lettuce and some carrots, reminiscent of school lunch type of salads. Also the desserts look sinfully good, but they missed the mark on flavor. Of the dessert trio we got (Chocolate filled chocolate cupcake with strawberry icing and a (dry) brown heart on top, a cannoli (tasted old/stale), and a raspberry tart abomination) everything was sub-par flavor wise. And tasted like they had been sitting there for a little too long, way past their peak of freshness.<br><br>Shout out to the staff for holding it down with class. Everyone is extremely attentive and upbeat, and knows their stuff when it comes to food and wine. Just enough attention from the servers to make sure your dinner is going well without feeling like they&#39;re breathing down your neck. Â Even the security guard at the door is awesome and warmly wishes you a good night as you&#39;re leaving.

I would eat out every day until I discovered Vegin&#39; Out. <br><br>I&#39;ve been getting their deliveries for about 4 months now (had to skip only 2 or 3 weeks due to travel) and I&#39;m a super happy customer.<br><br>The very first week I happened to receive a delivery that wasn&#39;t completely up my alley but I kept ordering from them because I was curious what the other dishes were like. And I wasn&#39;t disappointed.<br><br>The menu repeats every 8 weeks, so after these 8 weeks you&#39;ll get a good idea what each dish tastes like. I now know when to substitute one dish for another, which is super easy to do. I pay for 4 weeks upfront delivery and I only have to send a quick email to adjust to my travel schedule or if I want items substituted.<br><br>As others have mentioned already, delivery is on point and super friendly. These guys really love what they do, and it translates into the meals.<br><br>In regards to bland: I absolutely love the fact that the dishes are only lightly salted and not over spiced. I have sensitive taste buds and I appreciate that these meals give me the option to add salt to taste, which is basically all it needs. But I rarely add anything to the dishes because the flavors usually satisfy me. On hot summer days I might add a little bit of salt but additions are usually limited to fresh ground pepper and hemp seed for the salads.<br><br>If you are used to processed foods or fast food, this might be something that one needs to get used to. Keep in mind that you&#39;re eating some super healthy, freshly prepared food, not overly processed garbage :)<br><br>The cookies: I had to order extra cookies for this week because I eat them all after 2 days. Very difficult to ration such delicious things! My favorites are the Lemon Thyme. <br><br>Bottom line: It&#39;s absolutely worth trying if you can afford it and I don&#39;t think that $117 a month is a lot of money for so much delicious and healthy food.

I recently went here for dinner and even though we had an amazing time we were seated in the main dining area, in the vicinity of a room that was closed for a private party which sounded like it had about 50 loud and kind of obnoxious drunk people in it.

Most tiramisu tastes like soggy cake to me so I wasn&#39;t a huge fan, and the dessert trio looked a lot better than it tasted. <br><br>I like the gift shop, but everything besides the wines is a little pricey. That&#39;s pretty typical of any winery though, so I can&#39;t knock them for that. What I can and did knock them a star for is the actual taste of some of the food. Though it looks pretty, I found the salad to be more of an afterthought...sad looking lettuce and some carrots, reminiscent of school lunch type of salads. Also the desserts look sinfully good, but they missed the mark on flavor. Of the dessert trio we got (Chocolate filled chocolate cupcake with strawberry icing and a (dry) brown heart on top, a cannoli (tasted old/stale), and a raspberry tart abomination) everything was sub-par flavor wise. And tasted like they had been sitting there for a little too long, way past their peak of freshness.<br><br>Shout out to the staff for holding it down with class.

Though it looks pretty, I found the salad to be more of an afterthought...sad looking lettuce and some carrots, reminiscent of school lunch type of salads. Also the desserts look sinfully good, but they missed the mark on flavor. Of the dessert trio we got (Chocolate filled chocolate cupcake with strawberry icing and a (dry) brown heart on top, a cannoli (tasted old/stale), and a raspberry tart abomination) everything was sub-par flavor wise. And tasted like they had been sitting there for a little too long, way past their peak of freshness.<br><br>Shout out to the staff for holding it down with class.

Oh wait, apparently in LA they do. All joking aside though, maybe they should be a little more discriminatory about who they let in here, or at least who they don&#39;t kick out. I recently went here for dinner and even though we had an amazing time we were seated in the main dining area, in the vicinity of a room that was closed for a private party which sounded like it had about 50 loud and kind of obnoxious drunk people in it. Fair enough, this *is* a winery, but seriously, tone it down a few notches. We all don&#39;t need to hear your conversations...I promise you, you aren&#39;t that interesting. Yet the noise level just got louder and louder, until finally the party left the room. All 6 of them. Yep, 6 people making enough noise in there for basically everyone in the main dining room to hear their yelling and SUPER loud drunk cackling laughter. They must have paid a helluva deposit. Anyway, I don&#39;t fault the winery for this, they aren&#39;t here to baby-sit their patrons.<br><br>Though Los Angeles is a young city compared to some others, there is a lot of history here. This winery is a little piece of that history, owned by the Riboli family since 1917 it&#39;s the oldest operating winery in Los Angeles. The layout and decor are still reminiscent of classic, elegant times. Too bad some of that class couldn&#39;t be transferred to certain clientele, but I digress.<br><br>I have been many times to Maddelena restaurant, and always enjoy the food. Their menu is fresh and seasonal, and visual rather than written down. There is nothing quite like a good seasonal menu, when everything is at it&#39;s peak of freshness and not just thrown on, but beautifully arranged on the plate. All the dishes are prepared and wrapped for examples, and you just choose the one that looks best to you. They give you crusty bread, butter, and a salad and a sign with the name of the entree you chose, which is freshly prepared and brought out to your table.<br><br>The salmon lasagna...definitely the show stopper. I wouldn&#39;t have ever thought that combination would work, and actually thought my dad was weird for ordering that. Until I tried a bite...it&#39;s hands down the best lasagna I&#39;ve ever had. Whoever made the sauce, pasta, and tender chunks of salmon into that masterpiece is a culinary genius. My chicken Marsala was good but paled in comparison to this lasagna, it was amazing. The desserts are touch and go...we got the tiramisu and the dessert trio. Most tiramisu tastes like soggy cake to me so I wasn&#39;t a huge fan, and the dessert trio looked a lot better than it tasted. <br><br>I like the gift shop, but everything besides the wines is a little pricey. That&#39;s pretty typical of any winery though, so I can&#39;t knock them for that. What I can and did knock them a star for is the actual taste of some of the food. Though it looks pretty, I found the salad to be more of an afterthought...sad looking lettuce and some carrots, reminiscent of school lunch type of salads. Also the desserts look sinfully good, but they missed the mark on flavor. Of the dessert trio we got (Chocolate filled chocolate cupcake with strawberry icing and a (dry) brown heart on top, a cannoli (tasted old/stale), and a raspberry tart abomination) everything was sub-par flavor wise. And tasted like they had been sitting there for a little too long, way past their peak of freshness.<br><br>Shout out to the staff for holding it down with class.

I had to be careful not to one-shot it, because it was that good. I also purchased one of those overpriced boxed waters because I didn&#39;t know there was complimentary water at the napkin stand.

Oh wait, apparently in LA they do. All joking aside though, maybe they should be a little more discriminatory about who they let in here, or at least who they don&#39;t kick out. I recently went here for dinner and even though we had an amazing time we were seated in the main dining area, in the vicinity of a room that was closed for a private party which sounded like it had about 50 loud and kind of obnoxious drunk people in it. Fair enough, this *is* a winery, but seriously, tone it down a few notches. We all don&#39;t need to hear your conversations...I promise you, you aren&#39;t that interesting. Yet the noise level just got louder and louder, until finally the party left the room. All 6 of them. Yep, 6 people making enough noise in there for basically everyone in the main dining room to hear their yelling and SUPER loud drunk cackling laughter. They must have paid a helluva deposit. Anyway, I don&#39;t fault the winery for this, they aren&#39;t here to baby-sit their patrons.<br><br>Though Los Angeles is a young city compared to some others, there is a lot of history here. This winery is a little piece of that history, owned by the Riboli family since 1917 it&#39;s the oldest operating winery in Los Angeles. The layout and decor are still reminiscent of classic, elegant times. Too bad some of that class couldn&#39;t be transferred to certain clientele, but I digress.<br><br>I have been many times to Maddelena restaurant, and always enjoy the food. Their menu is fresh and seasonal, and visual rather than written down. There is nothing quite like a good seasonal menu, when everything is at it&#39;s peak of freshness and not just thrown on, but beautifully arranged on the plate. All the dishes are prepared and wrapped for examples, and you just choose the one that looks best to you. They give you crusty bread, butter, and a salad and a sign with the name of the entree you chose, which is freshly prepared and brought out to your table.<br><br>The salmon lasagna...definitely the show stopper. I wouldn&#39;t have ever thought that combination would work, and actually thought my dad was weird for ordering that. Until I tried a bite...it&#39;s hands down the best lasagna I&#39;ve ever had. Whoever made the sauce, pasta, and tender chunks of salmon into that masterpiece is a culinary genius. My chicken Marsala was good but paled in comparison to this lasagna, it was amazing. The desserts are touch and go...we got the tiramisu and the dessert trio. Most tiramisu tastes like soggy cake to me so I wasn&#39;t a huge fan, and the dessert trio looked a lot better than it tasted. <br><br>I like the gift shop, but everything besides the wines is a little pricey. That&#39;s pretty typical of any winery though, so I can&#39;t knock them for that. What I can and did knock them a star for is the actual taste of some of the food. Though it looks pretty, I found the salad to be more of an afterthought...sad looking lettuce and some carrots, reminiscent of school lunch type of salads. Also the desserts look sinfully good, but they missed the mark on flavor. Of the dessert trio we got (Chocolate filled chocolate cupcake with strawberry icing and a (dry) brown heart on top, a cannoli (tasted old/stale), and a raspberry tart abomination) everything was sub-par flavor wise. And tasted like they had been sitting there for a little too long, way past their peak of freshness.<br><br>Shout out to the staff for holding it down with class. Everyone is extremely attentive and upbeat, and knows their stuff when it comes to food and wine. Just enough attention from the servers to make sure your dinner is going well without feeling like they&#39;re breathing down your neck. Â Even the security guard at the door is awesome and warmly wishes you a good night as you&#39;re leaving.

Oh wait, apparently in LA they do. All joking aside though, maybe they should be a little more discriminatory about who they let in here, or at least who they don&#39;t kick out. I recently went here for dinner and even though we had an amazing time we were seated in the main dining area, in the vicinity of a room that was closed for a private party which sounded like it had about 50 loud and kind of obnoxious drunk people in it. Fair enough, this *is* a winery, but seriously, tone it down a few notches. We all don&#39;t need to hear your conversations...I promise you, you aren&#39;t that interesting. Yet the noise level just got louder and louder, until finally the party left the room. All 6 of them. Yep, 6 people making enough noise in there for basically everyone in the main dining room to hear their yelling and SUPER loud drunk cackling laughter. They must have paid a helluva deposit. Anyway, I don&#39;t fault the winery for this, they aren&#39;t here to baby-sit their patrons.<br><br>Though Los Angeles is a young city compared to some others, there is a lot of history here. This winery is a little piece of that history, owned by the Riboli family since 1917 it&#39;s the oldest operating winery in Los Angeles. The layout and decor are still reminiscent of classic, elegant times. Too bad some of that class couldn&#39;t be transferred to certain clientele, but I digress.<br><br>I have been many times to Maddelena restaurant, and always enjoy the food. Their menu is fresh and seasonal, and visual rather than written down. There is nothing quite like a good seasonal menu, when everything is at it&#39;s peak of freshness and not just thrown on, but beautifully arranged on the plate. All the dishes are prepared and wrapped for examples, and you just choose the one that looks best to you. They give you crusty bread, butter, and a salad and a sign with the name of the entree you chose, which is freshly prepared and brought out to your table.<br><br>The salmon lasagna...definitely the show stopper. I wouldn&#39;t have ever thought that combination would work, and actually thought my dad was weird for ordering that. Until I tried a bite...it&#39;s hands down the best lasagna I&#39;ve ever had. Whoever made the sauce, pasta, and tender chunks of salmon into that masterpiece is a culinary genius. My chicken Marsala was good but paled in comparison to this lasagna, it was amazing. The desserts are touch and go...we got the tiramisu and the dessert trio. Most tiramisu tastes like soggy cake to me so I wasn&#39;t a huge fan, and the dessert trio looked a lot better than it tasted. <br><br>I like the gift shop, but everything besides the wines is a little pricey. That&#39;s pretty typical of any winery though, so I can&#39;t knock them for that. What I can and did knock them a star for is the actual taste of some of the food. Though it looks pretty, I found the salad to be more of an afterthought...sad looking lettuce and some carrots, reminiscent of school lunch type of salads. Also the desserts look sinfully good, but they missed the mark on flavor. Of the dessert trio we got (Chocolate filled chocolate cupcake with strawberry icing and a (dry) brown heart on top, a cannoli (tasted old/stale), and a raspberry tart abomination) everything was sub-par flavor wise. And tasted like they had been sitting there for a little too long, way past their peak of freshness.<br><br>Shout out to the staff for holding it down with class. Everyone is extremely attentive and upbeat, and knows their stuff when it comes to food and wine. Just enough attention from the servers to make sure your dinner is going well without feeling like they&#39;re breathing down your neck.

Most of the flavors come from a mix, but a handful are from a homemade recipe and are made on premises. (Made? Manufactured? Synthesized? I have no idea how frozen yogurt comes to be.)

Oh wait, apparently in LA they do. All joking aside though, maybe they should be a little more discriminatory about who they let in here, or at least who they don&#39;t kick out. I recently went here for dinner and even though we had an amazing time we were seated in the main dining area, in the vicinity of a room that was closed for a private party which sounded like it had about 50 loud and kind of obnoxious drunk people in it. Fair enough, this *is* a winery, but seriously, tone it down a few notches. We all don&#39;t need to hear your conversations...I promise you, you aren&#39;t that interesting. Yet the noise level just got louder and louder, until finally the party left the room. All 6 of them. Yep, 6 people making enough noise in there for basically everyone in the main dining room to hear their yelling and SUPER loud drunk cackling laughter. They must have paid a helluva deposit. Anyway, I don&#39;t fault the winery for this, they aren&#39;t here to baby-sit their patrons.<br><br>Though Los Angeles is a young city compared to some others, there is a lot of history here. This winery is a little piece of that history, owned by the Riboli family since 1917 it&#39;s the oldest operating winery in Los Angeles. The layout and decor are still reminiscent of classic, elegant times. Too bad some of that class couldn&#39;t be transferred to certain clientele, but I digress.<br><br>I have been many times to Maddelena restaurant, and always enjoy the food. Their menu is fresh and seasonal, and visual rather than written down. There is nothing quite like a good seasonal menu, when everything is at it&#39;s peak of freshness and not just thrown on, but beautifully arranged on the plate. All the dishes are prepared and wrapped for examples, and you just choose the one that looks best to you. They give you crusty bread, butter, and a salad and a sign with the name of the entree you chose, which is freshly prepared and brought out to your table.<br><br>The salmon lasagna...definitely the show stopper. I wouldn&#39;t have ever thought that combination would work, and actually thought my dad was weird for ordering that. Until I tried a bite...it&#39;s hands down the best lasagna I&#39;ve ever had. Whoever made the sauce, pasta, and tender chunks of salmon into that masterpiece is a culinary genius. My chicken Marsala was good but paled in comparison to this lasagna, it was amazing. The desserts are touch and go...we got the tiramisu and the dessert trio. Most tiramisu tastes like soggy cake to me so I wasn&#39;t a huge fan, and the dessert trio looked a lot better than it tasted. <br><br>I like the gift shop, but everything besides the wines is a little pricey. That&#39;s pretty typical of any winery though, so I can&#39;t knock them for that. What I can and did knock them a star for is the actual taste of some of the food. Though it looks pretty, I found the salad to be more of an afterthought...sad looking lettuce and some carrots, reminiscent of school lunch type of salads. Also the desserts look sinfully good, but they missed the mark on flavor. Of the dessert trio we got (Chocolate filled chocolate cupcake with strawberry icing and a (dry) brown heart on top, a cannoli (tasted old/stale), and a raspberry tart abomination) everything was sub-par flavor wise. And tasted like they had been sitting there for a little too long, way past their peak of freshness.<br><br>Shout out to the staff for holding it down with class. Everyone is extremely attentive and upbeat, and knows their stuff when it comes to food and wine. Just enough attention from the servers to make sure your dinner is going well without feeling like they&#39;re breathing down your neck. Â Even the security guard at the door is awesome and warmly wishes you a good night as you&#39;re leaving.

Oh wait, apparently in LA they do. All joking aside though, maybe they should be a little more discriminatory about who they let in here, or at least who they don&#39;t kick out. I recently went here for dinner and even though we had an amazing time we were seated in the main dining area, in the vicinity of a room that was closed for a private party which sounded like it had about 50 loud and kind of obnoxious drunk people in it. Fair enough, this *is* a winery, but seriously, tone it down a few notches. We all don&#39;t need to hear your conversations...I promise you, you aren&#39;t that interesting. Yet the noise level just got louder and louder, until finally the party left the room. All 6 of them. Yep, 6 people making enough noise in there for basically everyone in the main dining room to hear their yelling and SUPER loud drunk cackling laughter. They must have paid a helluva deposit. Anyway, I don&#39;t fault the winery for this, they aren&#39;t here to baby-sit their patrons.<br><br>Though Los Angeles is a young city compared to some others, there is a lot of history here. This winery is a little piece of that history, owned by the Riboli family since 1917 it&#39;s the oldest operating winery in Los Angeles. The layout and decor are still reminiscent of classic, elegant times. Too bad some of that class couldn&#39;t be transferred to certain clientele, but I digress.<br><br>I have been many times to Maddelena restaurant, and always enjoy the food. Their menu is fresh and seasonal, and visual rather than written down. There is nothing quite like a good seasonal menu, when everything is at it&#39;s peak of freshness and not just thrown on, but beautifully arranged on the plate. All the dishes are prepared and wrapped for examples, and you just choose the one that looks best to you. They give you crusty bread, butter, and a salad and a sign with the name of the entree you chose, which is freshly prepared and brought out to your table.<br><br>The salmon lasagna...definitely the show stopper. I wouldn&#39;t have ever thought that combination would work, and actually thought my dad was weird for ordering that. Until I tried a bite...it&#39;s hands down the best lasagna I&#39;ve ever had. Whoever made the sauce, pasta, and tender chunks of salmon into that masterpiece is a culinary genius. My chicken Marsala was good but paled in comparison to this lasagna, it was amazing. The desserts are touch and go...we got the tiramisu and the dessert trio. Most tiramisu tastes like soggy cake to me so I wasn&#39;t a huge fan, and the dessert trio looked a lot better than it tasted. <br><br>I like the gift shop, but everything besides the wines is a little pricey. That&#39;s pretty typical of any winery though, so I can&#39;t knock them for that. What I can and did knock them a star for is the actual taste of some of the food. Though it looks pretty, I found the salad to be more of an afterthought...sad looking lettuce and some carrots, reminiscent of school lunch type of salads. Also the desserts look sinfully good, but they missed the mark on flavor. Of the dessert trio we got (Chocolate filled chocolate cupcake with strawberry icing and a (dry) brown heart on top, a cannoli (tasted old/stale), and a raspberry tart abomination) everything was sub-par flavor wise. And tasted like they had been sitting there for a little too long, way past their peak of freshness.<br><br>Shout out to the staff for holding it down with class. Everyone is extremely attentive and upbeat, and knows their stuff when it comes to food and wine. Just enough attention from the servers to make sure your dinner is going well without feeling like they&#39;re breathing down your neck. Â Even the security guard at the door is awesome and warmly wishes you a good night as you&#39;re leaving.

There is nothing quite like a good seasonal menu, when everything is at it&#39;s peak of freshness and not just thrown on, but beautifully arranged on the plate.

Whoever made the sauce, pasta, and tender chunks of salmon into that masterpiece is a culinary genius. My chicken Marsala was good but paled in comparison to this lasagna, it was amazing. The desserts are touch and go...we got the tiramisu and the dessert trio. Most tiramisu tastes like soggy cake to me so I wasn&#39;t a huge fan, and the dessert trio looked a lot better than it tasted. <br><br>I like the gift shop, but everything besides the wines is a little pricey. That&#39;s pretty typical of any winery though, so I can&#39;t knock them for that. What I can and did knock them a star for is the actual taste of some of the food. Though it looks pretty, I found the salad to be more of an afterthought...sad looking lettuce and some carrots, reminiscent of school lunch type of salads. Also the desserts look sinfully good, but they missed the mark on flavor. Of the dessert trio we got (Chocolate filled chocolate cupcake with strawberry icing and a (dry) brown heart on top, a cannoli (tasted old/stale), and a raspberry tart abomination) everything was sub-par flavor wise. And tasted like they had been sitting there for a little too long, way past their peak of freshness.<br><br>Shout out to the staff for holding it down with class.

One of my husband&#39;s good friends, Dennis K. moved to a new apartment downtown and low and behold, it was very close to semi sweet! So one day when the hubby went to visit his friend, he brought home a box of 6 peanut butter dingalings for me! I was in heaven! I ate each one delicately and savored every bite. They were gone in a few days. <br><br>A few weeks ago, my friend wanted to go to the Last Bookstore downtown and grab lunch afterwards. Since we were in the vicinity, I HAD to go to semi sweet myself. When I got there, time stopped and I knew that this is where I needed to be at that exact moment. It was as if the stars had aligned and I had a renewed sense of purpose in my life - to eat all the dingalings I could possibly get my hands on.<br><br>I ordered 6 of the peanut butter dingalings (which are the best ones since they have this wonderful crunch in the middle and this amazing peanut butter mousse) and I decided to try their new mac and cheese empanada.

Oh wait, apparently in LA they do. All joking aside though, maybe they should be a little more discriminatory about who they let in here, or at least who they don&#39;t kick out. I recently went here for dinner and even though we had an amazing time we were seated in the main dining area, in the vicinity of a room that was closed for a private party which sounded like it had about 50 loud and kind of obnoxious drunk people in it. Fair enough, this *is* a winery, but seriously, tone it down a few notches. We all don&#39;t need to hear your conversations...I promise you, you aren&#39;t that interesting. Yet the noise level just got louder and louder, until finally the party left the room. All 6 of them. Yep, 6 people making enough noise in there for basically everyone in the main dining room to hear their yelling and SUPER loud drunk cackling laughter. They must have paid a helluva deposit. Anyway, I don&#39;t fault the winery for this, they aren&#39;t here to baby-sit their patrons.<br><br>Though Los Angeles is a young city compared to some others, there is a lot of history here. This winery is a little piece of that history, owned by the Riboli family since 1917 it&#39;s the oldest operating winery in Los Angeles. The layout and decor are still reminiscent of classic, elegant times. Too bad some of that class couldn&#39;t be transferred to certain clientele, but I digress.<br><br>I have been many times to Maddelena restaurant, and always enjoy the food. Their menu is fresh and seasonal, and visual rather than written down. There is nothing quite like a good seasonal menu, when everything is at it&#39;s peak of freshness and not just thrown on, but beautifully arranged on the plate. All the dishes are prepared and wrapped for examples, and you just choose the one that looks best to you. They give you crusty bread, butter, and a salad and a sign with the name of the entree you chose, which is freshly prepared and brought out to your table.<br><br>The salmon lasagna...definitely the show stopper. I wouldn&#39;t have ever thought that combination would work, and actually thought my dad was weird for ordering that. Until I tried a bite...it&#39;s hands down the best lasagna I&#39;ve ever had. Whoever made the sauce, pasta, and tender chunks of salmon into that masterpiece is a culinary genius. My chicken Marsala was good but paled in comparison to this lasagna, it was amazing. The desserts are touch and go...we got the tiramisu and the dessert trio. Most tiramisu tastes like soggy cake to me so I wasn&#39;t a huge fan, and the dessert trio looked a lot better than it tasted. <br><br>I like the gift shop, but everything besides the wines is a little pricey. That&#39;s pretty typical of any winery though, so I can&#39;t knock them for that. What I can and did knock them a star for is the actual taste of some of the food. Though it looks pretty, I found the salad to be more of an afterthought...sad looking lettuce and some carrots, reminiscent of school lunch type of salads. Also the desserts look sinfully good, but they missed the mark on flavor. Of the dessert trio we got (Chocolate filled chocolate cupcake with strawberry icing and a (dry) brown heart on top, a cannoli (tasted old/stale), and a raspberry tart abomination) everything was sub-par flavor wise. And tasted like they had been sitting there for a little too long, way past their peak of freshness.<br><br>Shout out to the staff for holding it down with class. Everyone is extremely attentive and upbeat, and knows their stuff when it comes to food and wine. Just enough attention from the servers to make sure your dinner is going well without feeling like they&#39;re breathing down your neck. Â Even the security guard at the door is awesome and warmly wishes you a good night as you&#39;re leaving.

Oh wait, apparently in LA they do. All joking aside though, maybe they should be a little more discriminatory about who they let in here, or at least who they don&#39;t kick out. I recently went here for dinner and even though we had an amazing time we were seated in the main dining area, in the vicinity of a room that was closed for a private party which sounded like it had about 50 loud and kind of obnoxious drunk people in it. Fair enough, this *is* a winery, but seriously, tone it down a few notches. We all don&#39;t need to hear your conversations...I promise you, you aren&#39;t that interesting. Yet the noise level just got louder and louder, until finally the party left the room. All 6 of them. Yep, 6 people making enough noise in there for basically everyone in the main dining room to hear their yelling and SUPER loud drunk cackling laughter. They must have paid a helluva deposit. Anyway, I don&#39;t fault the winery for this, they aren&#39;t here to baby-sit their patrons.<br><br>Though Los Angeles is a young city compared to some others, there is a lot of history here. This winery is a little piece of that history, owned by the Riboli family since 1917 it&#39;s the oldest operating winery in Los Angeles. The layout and decor are still reminiscent of classic, elegant times. Too bad some of that class couldn&#39;t be transferred to certain clientele, but I digress.<br><br>I have been many times to Maddelena restaurant, and always enjoy the food. Their menu is fresh and seasonal, and visual rather than written down. There is nothing quite like a good seasonal menu, when everything is at it&#39;s peak of freshness and not just thrown on, but beautifully arranged on the plate. All the dishes are prepared and wrapped for examples, and you just choose the one that looks best to you. They give you crusty bread, butter, and a salad and a sign with the name of the entree you chose, which is freshly prepared and brought out to your table.<br><br>The salmon lasagna...definitely the show stopper. I wouldn&#39;t have ever thought that combination would work, and actually thought my dad was weird for ordering that. Until I tried a bite...it&#39;s hands down the best lasagna I&#39;ve ever had. Whoever made the sauce, pasta, and tender chunks of salmon into that masterpiece is a culinary genius. My chicken Marsala was good but paled in comparison to this lasagna, it was amazing. The desserts are touch and go...we got the tiramisu and the dessert trio. Most tiramisu tastes like soggy cake to me so I wasn&#39;t a huge fan, and the dessert trio looked a lot better than it tasted. <br><br>I like the gift shop, but everything besides the wines is a little pricey. That&#39;s pretty typical of any winery though, so I can&#39;t knock them for that. What I can and did knock them a star for is the actual taste of some of the food. Though it looks pretty, I found the salad to be more of an afterthought...sad looking lettuce and some carrots, reminiscent of school lunch type of salads. Also the desserts look sinfully good, but they missed the mark on flavor. Of the dessert trio we got (Chocolate filled chocolate cupcake with strawberry icing and a (dry) brown heart on top, a cannoli (tasted old/stale), and a raspberry tart abomination) everything was sub-par flavor wise. And tasted like they had been sitting there for a little too long, way past their peak of freshness.<br><br>Shout out to the staff for holding it down with class. Everyone is extremely attentive and upbeat, and knows their stuff when it comes to food and wine. Just enough attention from the servers to make sure your dinner is going well without feeling like they&#39;re breathing down your neck. Â Even the security guard at the door is awesome and warmly wishes you a good night as you&#39;re leaving.

That&#39;s the SECRET to any successful business by the way.

Oh wait, apparently in LA they do. All joking aside though, maybe they should be a little more discriminatory about who they let in here, or at least who they don&#39;t kick out. I recently went here for dinner and even though we had an amazing time we were seated in the main dining area, in the vicinity of a room that was closed for a private party which sounded like it had about 50 loud and kind of obnoxious drunk people in it. Fair enough, this *is* a winery, but seriously, tone it down a few notches. We all don&#39;t need to hear your conversations...I promise you, you aren&#39;t that interesting. Yet the noise level just got louder and louder, until finally the party left the room. All 6 of them. Yep, 6 people making enough noise in there for basically everyone in the main dining room to hear their yelling and SUPER loud drunk cackling laughter. They must have paid a helluva deposit. Anyway, I don&#39;t fault the winery for this, they aren&#39;t here to baby-sit their patrons.<br><br>Though Los Angeles is a young city compared to some others, there is a lot of history here. This winery is a little piece of that history, owned by the Riboli family since 1917 it&#39;s the oldest operating winery in Los Angeles. The layout and decor are still reminiscent of classic, elegant times. Too bad some of that class couldn&#39;t be transferred to certain clientele, but I digress.<br><br>I have been many times to Maddelena restaurant, and always enjoy the food. Their menu is fresh and seasonal, and visual rather than written down. There is nothing quite like a good seasonal menu, when everything is at it&#39;s peak of freshness and not just thrown on, but beautifully arranged on the plate. All the dishes are prepared and wrapped for examples, and you just choose the one that looks best to you. They give you crusty bread, butter, and a salad and a sign with the name of the entree you chose, which is freshly prepared and brought out to your table.<br><br>The salmon lasagna...definitely the show stopper. I wouldn&#39;t have ever thought that combination would work, and actually thought my dad was weird for ordering that. Until I tried a bite...it&#39;s hands down the best lasagna I&#39;ve ever had. Whoever made the sauce, pasta, and tender chunks of salmon into that masterpiece is a culinary genius. My chicken Marsala was good but paled in comparison to this lasagna, it was amazing. The desserts are touch and go...we got the tiramisu and the dessert trio. Most tiramisu tastes like soggy cake to me so I wasn&#39;t a huge fan, and the dessert trio looked a lot better than it tasted. <br><br>I like the gift shop, but everything besides the wines is a little pricey. That&#39;s pretty typical of any winery though, so I can&#39;t knock them for that. What I can and did knock them a star for is the actual taste of some of the food. Though it looks pretty, I found the salad to be more of an afterthought...sad looking lettuce and some carrots, reminiscent of school lunch type of salads. Also the desserts look sinfully good, but they missed the mark on flavor. Of the dessert trio we got (Chocolate filled chocolate cupcake with strawberry icing and a (dry) brown heart on top, a cannoli (tasted old/stale), and a raspberry tart abomination) everything was sub-par flavor wise. And tasted like they had been sitting there for a little too long, way past their peak of freshness.<br><br>Shout out to the staff for holding it down with class. Everyone is extremely attentive and upbeat, and knows their stuff when it comes to food and wine. Just enough attention from the servers to make sure your dinner is going well without feeling like they&#39;re breathing down your neck. Â Even the security guard at the door is awesome and warmly wishes you a good night as you&#39;re leaving.

There is parking in the Chase parking lot. So far we&#39;ve been really lucky to always get a spot. We come around 12:30pm. <br><br>It is family friendly, tons of stuff for the kids. Pony rides, bouncy castle, rock climbing, train, petting zoo, balloons, and temp tattoo. <br><br>There are a ton of prepared food vendors, also a lot of places to eat in the area. People like to sit in the grass and eat their food. <br><br>Studio City is home to many people in the film industry. You probably will spot someone famous. We saw an actor today, but we couldn&#39;t remember his name.<br><br>They accept food stamps (EBT). You go to the Studio City Farmers Market information table, which is in the middle of the market, there are tote bags hanging for sale. They will slide your EBT card and give you Farmers Market money. You can use that money at any vendor (except artisans). They only thing I would recommend is bringing change, often things didn&#39;t ring up to whole amounts. Â <br><br>I&#39;ve been trying to go to the same vendors in order to establish a relationship with the farmers. That&#39;s a big plus about this farmers market is that it has the same vendors week after week. <br><br>Review for Winter (January, February)<br>I always go to Sweet Tree Farms for fruit, which is located towards the end without the pony&#39;s. My boyfriend loves the Pink Lady Apples and the grapes were very delicious. I got a big bag of apples for $7.<br><br>The old Town Bakery, which located closer to the pony side, has some delicious breads. I got olive bread and garlic bread (comes with 2 large french bread) for $7, but the guy said he was giving me a special so I&#39;m not sure how much they are regular. <br><br>I get my salad mixes from Scarborough Farms, located in the middle of the Farmers market. They have boxes full of pre-cut and washed salad mixes. They also have Frisee and Butter Lettuce still intact for $1 each. I get a bag of the restaurant mix, baby spinach, Frisee, and Butter lettuce for $5. <br><br>Menos Farms is where I get the majority of my vegetables. I get broccoli, carrots, peas, asparagus, and celery. The total came out to $10. <br><br>I got garlic from Yang&#39;s farm. I got 4 bunches for $2. <br><br>I got Avocado&#39;s from Valley Center Growers. They were 3 for $5.

Oh wait, apparently in LA they do. All joking aside though, maybe they should be a little more discriminatory about who they let in here, or at least who they don&#39;t kick out. I recently went here for dinner and even though we had an amazing time we were seated in the main dining area, in the vicinity of a room that was closed for a private party which sounded like it had about 50 loud and kind of obnoxious drunk people in it. Fair enough, this *is* a winery, but seriously, tone it down a few notches. We all don&#39;t need to hear your conversations...I promise you, you aren&#39;t that interesting. Yet the noise level just got louder and louder, until finally the party left the room. All 6 of them. Yep, 6 people making enough noise in there for basically everyone in the main dining room to hear their yelling and SUPER loud drunk cackling laughter. They must have paid a helluva deposit. Anyway, I don&#39;t fault the winery for this, they aren&#39;t here to baby-sit their patrons.<br><br>Though Los Angeles is a young city compared to some others, there is a lot of history here. This winery is a little piece of that history, owned by the Riboli family since 1917 it&#39;s the oldest operating winery in Los Angeles. The layout and decor are still reminiscent of classic, elegant times. Too bad some of that class couldn&#39;t be transferred to certain clientele, but I digress.<br><br>I have been many times to Maddelena restaurant, and always enjoy the food. Their menu is fresh and seasonal, and visual rather than written down. There is nothing quite like a good seasonal menu, when everything is at it&#39;s peak of freshness and not just thrown on, but beautifully arranged on the plate. All the dishes are prepared and wrapped for examples, and you just choose the one that looks best to you. They give you crusty bread, butter, and a salad and a sign with the name of the entree you chose, which is freshly prepared and brought out to your table.<br><br>The salmon lasagna...definitely the show stopper. I wouldn&#39;t have ever thought that combination would work, and actually thought my dad was weird for ordering that. Until I tried a bite...it&#39;s hands down the best lasagna I&#39;ve ever had. Whoever made the sauce, pasta, and tender chunks of salmon into that masterpiece is a culinary genius. My chicken Marsala was good but paled in comparison to this lasagna, it was amazing. The desserts are touch and go...we got the tiramisu and the dessert trio. Most tiramisu tastes like soggy cake to me so I wasn&#39;t a huge fan, and the dessert trio looked a lot better than it tasted. <br><br>I like the gift shop, but everything besides the wines is a little pricey. That&#39;s pretty typical of any winery though, so I can&#39;t knock them for that. What I can and did knock them a star for is the actual taste of some of the food. Though it looks pretty, I found the salad to be more of an afterthought...sad looking lettuce and some carrots, reminiscent of school lunch type of salads. Also the desserts look sinfully good, but they missed the mark on flavor. Of the dessert trio we got (Chocolate filled chocolate cupcake with strawberry icing and a (dry) brown heart on top, a cannoli (tasted old/stale), and a raspberry tart abomination) everything was sub-par flavor wise. And tasted like they had been sitting there for a little too long, way past their peak of freshness.<br><br>Shout out to the staff for holding it down with class. Everyone is extremely attentive and upbeat, and knows their stuff when it comes to food and wine. Just enough attention from the servers to make sure your dinner is going well without feeling like they&#39;re breathing down your neck. Â Even the security guard at the door is awesome and warmly wishes you a good night as you&#39;re leaving.

Oh wait, apparently in LA they do. All joking aside though, maybe they should be a little more discriminatory about who they let in here, or at least who they don&#39;t kick out. I recently went here for dinner and even though we had an amazing time we were seated in the main dining area, in the vicinity of a room that was closed for a private party which sounded like it had about 50 loud and kind of obnoxious drunk people in it. Fair enough, this *is* a winery, but seriously, tone it down a few notches. We all don&#39;t need to hear your conversations...I promise you, you aren&#39;t that interesting. Yet the noise level just got louder and louder, until finally the party left the room. All 6 of them. Yep, 6 people making enough noise in there for basically everyone in the main dining room to hear their yelling and SUPER loud drunk cackling laughter. They must have paid a helluva deposit. Anyway, I don&#39;t fault the winery for this, they aren&#39;t here to baby-sit their patrons.<br><br>Though Los Angeles is a young city compared to some others, there is a lot of history here. This winery is a little piece of that history, owned by the Riboli family since 1917 it&#39;s the oldest operating winery in Los Angeles. The layout and decor are still reminiscent of classic, elegant times. Too bad some of that class couldn&#39;t be transferred to certain clientele, but I digress.<br><br>I have been many times to Maddelena restaurant, and always enjoy the food. Their menu is fresh and seasonal, and visual rather than written down. There is nothing quite like a good seasonal menu, when everything is at it&#39;s peak of freshness and not just thrown on, but beautifully arranged on the plate. All the dishes are prepared and wrapped for examples, and you just choose the one that looks best to you. They give you crusty bread, butter, and a salad and a sign with the name of the entree you chose, which is freshly prepared and brought out to your table.<br><br>The salmon lasagna...definitely the show stopper. I wouldn&#39;t have ever thought that combination would work, and actually thought my dad was weird for ordering that. Until I tried a bite...it&#39;s hands down the best lasagna I&#39;ve ever had. Whoever made the sauce, pasta, and tender chunks of salmon into that masterpiece is a culinary genius. My chicken Marsala was good but paled in comparison to this lasagna, it was amazing. The desserts are touch and go...we got the tiramisu and the dessert trio. Most tiramisu tastes like soggy cake to me so I wasn&#39;t a huge fan, and the dessert trio looked a lot better than it tasted. <br><br>I like the gift shop, but everything besides the wines is a little pricey. That&#39;s pretty typical of any winery though, so I can&#39;t knock them for that. What I can and did knock them a star for is the actual taste of some of the food. Though it looks pretty, I found the salad to be more of an afterthought...sad looking lettuce and some carrots, reminiscent of school lunch type of salads. Also the desserts look sinfully good, but they missed the mark on flavor. Of the dessert trio we got (Chocolate filled chocolate cupcake with strawberry icing and a (dry) brown heart on top, a cannoli (tasted old/stale), and a raspberry tart abomination) everything was sub-par flavor wise. And tasted like they had been sitting there for a little too long, way past their peak of freshness.<br><br>Shout out to the staff for holding it down with class. Everyone is extremely attentive and upbeat, and knows their stuff when it comes to food and wine. Just enough attention from the servers to make sure your dinner is going well without feeling like they&#39;re breathing down your neck. Â Even the security guard at the door is awesome and warmly wishes you a good night as you&#39;re leaving.

Oh wait, apparently in LA they do. All joking aside though, maybe they should be a little more discriminatory about who they let in here, or at least who they don&#39;t kick out. I recently went here for dinner and even though we had an amazing time we were seated in the main dining area, in the vicinity of a room that was closed for a private party which sounded like it had about 50 loud and kind of obnoxious drunk people in it. Fair enough, this *is* a winery, but seriously, tone it down a few notches. We all don&#39;t need to hear your conversations...I promise you, you aren&#39;t that interesting. Yet the noise level just got louder and louder, until finally the party left the room. All 6 of them. Yep, 6 people making enough noise in there for basically everyone in the main dining room to hear their yelling and SUPER loud drunk cackling laughter. They must have paid a helluva deposit. Anyway, I don&#39;t fault the winery for this, they aren&#39;t here to baby-sit their patrons.<br><br>Though Los Angeles is a young city compared to some others, there is a lot of history here. This winery is a little piece of that history, owned by the Riboli family since 1917 it&#39;s the oldest operating winery in Los Angeles. The layout and decor are still reminiscent of classic, elegant times. Too bad some of that class couldn&#39;t be transferred to certain clientele, but I digress.<br><br>I have been many times to Maddelena restaurant, and always enjoy the food. Their menu is fresh and seasonal, and visual rather than written down. There is nothing quite like a good seasonal menu, when everything is at it&#39;s peak of freshness and not just thrown on, but beautifully arranged on the plate. All the dishes are prepared and wrapped for examples, and you just choose the one that looks best to you. They give you crusty bread, butter, and a salad and a sign with the name of the entree you chose, which is freshly prepared and brought out to your table.<br><br>The salmon lasagna...definitely the show stopper. I wouldn&#39;t have ever thought that combination would work, and actually thought my dad was weird for ordering that. Until I tried a bite...it&#39;s hands down the best lasagna I&#39;ve ever had. Whoever made the sauce, pasta, and tender chunks of salmon into that masterpiece is a culinary genius. My chicken Marsala was good but paled in comparison to this lasagna, it was amazing. The desserts are touch and go...we got the tiramisu and the dessert trio. Most tiramisu tastes like soggy cake to me so I wasn&#39;t a huge fan, and the dessert trio looked a lot better than it tasted. <br><br>I like the gift shop, but everything besides the wines is a little pricey. That&#39;s pretty typical of any winery though, so I can&#39;t knock them for that. What I can and did knock them a star for is the actual taste of some of the food. Though it looks pretty, I found the salad to be more of an afterthought...sad looking lettuce and some carrots, reminiscent of school lunch type of salads. Also the desserts look sinfully good, but they missed the mark on flavor. Of the dessert trio we got (Chocolate filled chocolate cupcake with strawberry icing and a (dry) brown heart on top, a cannoli (tasted old/stale), and a raspberry tart abomination) everything was sub-par flavor wise. And tasted like they had been sitting there for a little too long, way past their peak of freshness.<br><br>Shout out to the staff for holding it down with class. Everyone is extremely attentive and upbeat, and knows their stuff when it comes to food and wine. Just enough attention from the servers to make sure your dinner is going well without feeling like they&#39;re breathing down your neck. Â Even the security guard at the door is awesome and warmly wishes you a good night as you&#39;re leaving.

The bar itself also wasn&#39;t too dense, nor too cakey - so it had just the right amount of chew.

Oh wait, apparently in LA they do. All joking aside though, maybe they should be a little more discriminatory about who they let in here, or at least who they don&#39;t kick out. I recently went here for dinner and even though we had an amazing time we were seated in the main dining area, in the vicinity of a room that was closed for a private party which sounded like it had about 50 loud and kind of obnoxious drunk people in it. Fair enough, this *is* a winery, but seriously, tone it down a few notches. We all don&#39;t need to hear your conversations...I promise you, you aren&#39;t that interesting. Yet the noise level just got louder and louder, until finally the party left the room. All 6 of them. Yep, 6 people making enough noise in there for basically everyone in the main dining room to hear their yelling and SUPER loud drunk cackling laughter. They must have paid a helluva deposit. Anyway, I don&#39;t fault the winery for this, they aren&#39;t here to baby-sit their patrons.<br><br>Though Los Angeles is a young city compared to some others, there is a lot of history here. This winery is a little piece of that history, owned by the Riboli family since 1917 it&#39;s the oldest operating winery in Los Angeles. The layout and decor are still reminiscent of classic, elegant times. Too bad some of that class couldn&#39;t be transferred to certain clientele, but I digress.<br><br>I have been many times to Maddelena restaurant, and always enjoy the food. Their menu is fresh and seasonal, and visual rather than written down. There is nothing quite like a good seasonal menu, when everything is at it&#39;s peak of freshness and not just thrown on, but beautifully arranged on the plate. All the dishes are prepared and wrapped for examples, and you just choose the one that looks best to you. They give you crusty bread, butter, and a salad and a sign with the name of the entree you chose, which is freshly prepared and brought out to your table.<br><br>The salmon lasagna...definitely the show stopper. I wouldn&#39;t have ever thought that combination would work, and actually thought my dad was weird for ordering that. Until I tried a bite...it&#39;s hands down the best lasagna I&#39;ve ever had. Whoever made the sauce, pasta, and tender chunks of salmon into that masterpiece is a culinary genius. My chicken Marsala was good but paled in comparison to this lasagna, it was amazing. The desserts are touch and go...we got the tiramisu and the dessert trio. Most tiramisu tastes like soggy cake to me so I wasn&#39;t a huge fan, and the dessert trio looked a lot better than it tasted. <br><br>I like the gift shop, but everything besides the wines is a little pricey. That&#39;s pretty typical of any winery though, so I can&#39;t knock them for that. What I can and did knock them a star for is the actual taste of some of the food. Though it looks pretty, I found the salad to be more of an afterthought...sad looking lettuce and some carrots, reminiscent of school lunch type of salads. Also the desserts look sinfully good, but they missed the mark on flavor. Of the dessert trio we got (Chocolate filled chocolate cupcake with strawberry icing and a (dry) brown heart on top, a cannoli (tasted old/stale), and a raspberry tart abomination) everything was sub-par flavor wise. And tasted like they had been sitting there for a little too long, way past their peak of freshness.<br><br>Shout out to the staff for holding it down with class. Everyone is extremely attentive and upbeat, and knows their stuff when it comes to food and wine. Just enough attention from the servers to make sure your dinner is going well without feeling like they&#39;re breathing down your neck. Â Even the security guard at the door is awesome and warmly wishes you a good night as you&#39;re leaving.

I just happened to be scrolling through Yelp and saw an advert for Menchie&#39;s. Usually, I ignore half of their recommendations but when I saw the photos, I was mesmerized! <br><br>I usually try to frequent Snow Station in Tustin after one of my MANY trips to Disneyland. I have been deeply infatuated with Snow Station for a while now but after today, we grew apart! I have fallen for a new frozen goodie place and it&#39;s called MENCHIE&#39;S!

Menchie&#39;s is tucked away in the Downey Landing parking lot, closer to Ross but around the corner. <br><br>Anyway, as I walked through the door, it was like a ray of light shone down brightly upon the wall of yogurt flavors and toppings! There they were, waiting for me to pull the levers in an attempt to free all of the flavors to sample until my heart was content! Although I do have ADHD, I was able to control the impulse to sample more than 2 flavors. The first one that I tried was fruit punch! Good gracious, my taste buds went into overdrive. The second flavor that I sampled was cake batter. It wasn&#39;t too sweet and it really did taste like cake batter. Therefore, I selected two containers and filled both of them with one of each flavor. Suddenly, I turned around and the toppings station drew me in! I couldn&#39;t decide which ones to adorn my yogurt with so I played it safe and only selected: gummy bears, sprinkles, waffle cone bits, color-changing sprinkles, and cookie dough bits. This was a heavenly combination!<br><br>I realized at this point that I have been deprived of awesome yogurt and I have been reformed! Snow Station is going to be my back up plan but only when I&#39;m in the area. At this point, I&#39;ve moved on to the bigger, better deal and it&#39;s called MENCHIE&#39;S! <br><br>You are greeted with a smile when you walk through the door and you just can&#39;t help but get that warm and fuzzy feeling inside upon your exit.

Oh wait, apparently in LA they do. All joking aside though, maybe they should be a little more discriminatory about who they let in here, or at least who they don&#39;t kick out. I recently went here for dinner and even though we had an amazing time we were seated in the main dining area, in the vicinity of a room that was closed for a private party which sounded like it had about 50 loud and kind of obnoxious drunk people in it. Fair enough, this *is* a winery, but seriously, tone it down a few notches. We all don&#39;t need to hear your conversations...I promise you, you aren&#39;t that interesting. Yet the noise level just got louder and louder, until finally the party left the room. All 6 of them. Yep, 6 people making enough noise in there for basically everyone in the main dining room to hear their yelling and SUPER loud drunk cackling laughter. They must have paid a helluva deposit. Anyway, I don&#39;t fault the winery for this, they aren&#39;t here to baby-sit their patrons.<br><br>Though Los Angeles is a young city compared to some others, there is a lot of history here. This winery is a little piece of that history, owned by the Riboli family since 1917 it&#39;s the oldest operating winery in Los Angeles. The layout and decor are still reminiscent of classic, elegant times. Too bad some of that class couldn&#39;t be transferred to certain clientele, but I digress.<br><br>I have been many times to Maddelena restaurant, and always enjoy the food. Their menu is fresh and seasonal, and visual rather than written down. There is nothing quite like a good seasonal menu, when everything is at it&#39;s peak of freshness and not just thrown on, but beautifully arranged on the plate. All the dishes are prepared and wrapped for examples, and you just choose the one that looks best to you. They give you crusty bread, butter, and a salad and a sign with the name of the entree you chose, which is freshly prepared and brought out to your table.<br><br>The salmon lasagna...definitely the show stopper. I wouldn&#39;t have ever thought that combination would work, and actually thought my dad was weird for ordering that. Until I tried a bite...it&#39;s hands down the best lasagna I&#39;ve ever had. Whoever made the sauce, pasta, and tender chunks of salmon into that masterpiece is a culinary genius. My chicken Marsala was good but paled in comparison to this lasagna, it was amazing. The desserts are touch and go...we got the tiramisu and the dessert trio. Most tiramisu tastes like soggy cake to me so I wasn&#39;t a huge fan, and the dessert trio looked a lot better than it tasted. <br><br>I like the gift shop, but everything besides the wines is a little pricey. That&#39;s pretty typical of any winery though, so I can&#39;t knock them for that. What I can and did knock them a star for is the actual taste of some of the food. Though it looks pretty, I found the salad to be more of an afterthought...sad looking lettuce and some carrots, reminiscent of school lunch type of salads. Also the desserts look sinfully good, but they missed the mark on flavor. Of the dessert trio we got (Chocolate filled chocolate cupcake with strawberry icing and a (dry) brown heart on top, a cannoli (tasted old/stale), and a raspberry tart abomination) everything was sub-par flavor wise. And tasted like they had been sitting there for a little too long, way past their peak of freshness.<br><br>Shout out to the staff for holding it down with class. Everyone is extremely attentive and upbeat, and knows their stuff when it comes to food and wine. Just enough attention from the servers to make sure your dinner is going well without feeling like they&#39;re breathing down your neck. Â Even the security guard at the door is awesome and warmly wishes you a good night as you&#39;re leaving.

Oh wait, apparently in LA they do. All joking aside though, maybe they should be a little more discriminatory about who they let in here, or at least who they don&#39;t kick out. I recently went here for dinner and even though we had an amazing time we were seated in the main dining area, in the vicinity of a room that was closed for a private party which sounded like it had about 50 loud and kind of obnoxious drunk people in it. Fair enough, this *is* a winery, but seriously, tone it down a few notches. We all don&#39;t need to hear your conversations...I promise you, you aren&#39;t that interesting. Yet the noise level just got louder and louder, until finally the party left the room. All 6 of them. Yep, 6 people making enough noise in there for basically everyone in the main dining room to hear their yelling and SUPER loud drunk cackling laughter. They must have paid a helluva deposit. Anyway, I don&#39;t fault the winery for this, they aren&#39;t here to baby-sit their patrons.<br><br>Though Los Angeles is a young city compared to some others, there is a lot of history here. This winery is a little piece of that history, owned by the Riboli family since 1917 it&#39;s the oldest operating winery in Los Angeles. The layout and decor are still reminiscent of classic, elegant times. Too bad some of that class couldn&#39;t be transferred to certain clientele, but I digress.<br><br>I have been many times to Maddelena restaurant, and always enjoy the food. Their menu is fresh and seasonal, and visual rather than written down. There is nothing quite like a good seasonal menu, when everything is at it&#39;s peak of freshness and not just thrown on, but beautifully arranged on the plate. All the dishes are prepared and wrapped for examples, and you just choose the one that looks best to you. They give you crusty bread, butter, and a salad and a sign with the name of the entree you chose, which is freshly prepared and brought out to your table.<br><br>The salmon lasagna...definitely the show stopper. I wouldn&#39;t have ever thought that combination would work, and actually thought my dad was weird for ordering that. Until I tried a bite...it&#39;s hands down the best lasagna I&#39;ve ever had. Whoever made the sauce, pasta, and tender chunks of salmon into that masterpiece is a culinary genius. My chicken Marsala was good but paled in comparison to this lasagna, it was amazing. The desserts are touch and go...we got the tiramisu and the dessert trio. Most tiramisu tastes like soggy cake to me so I wasn&#39;t a huge fan, and the dessert trio looked a lot better than it tasted. <br><br>I like the gift shop, but everything besides the wines is a little pricey. That&#39;s pretty typical of any winery though, so I can&#39;t knock them for that. What I can and did knock them a star for is the actual taste of some of the food. Though it looks pretty, I found the salad to be more of an afterthought...sad looking lettuce and some carrots, reminiscent of school lunch type of salads. Also the desserts look sinfully good, but they missed the mark on flavor. Of the dessert trio we got (Chocolate filled chocolate cupcake with strawberry icing and a (dry) brown heart on top, a cannoli (tasted old/stale), and a raspberry tart abomination) everything was sub-par flavor wise. And tasted like they had been sitting there for a little too long, way past their peak of freshness.<br><br>Shout out to the staff for holding it down with class. Everyone is extremely attentive and upbeat, and knows their stuff when it comes to food and wine. Just enough attention from the servers to make sure your dinner is going well without feeling like they&#39;re breathing down your neck. Â Even the security guard at the door is awesome and warmly wishes you a good night as you&#39;re leaving.

Oh wait, apparently in LA they do. All joking aside though, maybe they should be a little more discriminatory about who they let in here, or at least who they don&#39;t kick out. I recently went here for dinner and even though we had an amazing time we were seated in the main dining area, in the vicinity of a room that was closed for a private party which sounded like it had about 50 loud and kind of obnoxious drunk people in it. Fair enough, this *is* a winery, but seriously, tone it down a few notches. We all don&#39;t need to hear your conversations...I promise you, you aren&#39;t that interesting. Yet the noise level just got louder and louder, until finally the party left the room. All 6 of them. Yep, 6 people making enough noise in there for basically everyone in the main dining room to hear their yelling and SUPER loud drunk cackling laughter. They must have paid a helluva deposit. Anyway, I don&#39;t fault the winery for this, they aren&#39;t here to baby-sit their patrons.<br><br>Though Los Angeles is a young city compared to some others, there is a lot of history here. This winery is a little piece of that history, owned by the Riboli family since 1917 it&#39;s the oldest operating winery in Los Angeles. The layout and decor are still reminiscent of classic, elegant times. Too bad some of that class couldn&#39;t be transferred to certain clientele, but I digress.<br><br>I have been many times to Maddelena restaurant, and always enjoy the food. Their menu is fresh and seasonal, and visual rather than written down. There is nothing quite like a good seasonal menu, when everything is at it&#39;s peak of freshness and not just thrown on, but beautifully arranged on the plate. All the dishes are prepared and wrapped for examples, and you just choose the one that looks best to you. They give you crusty bread, butter, and a salad and a sign with the name of the entree you chose, which is freshly prepared and brought out to your table.<br><br>The salmon lasagna...definitely the show stopper. I wouldn&#39;t have ever thought that combination would work, and actually thought my dad was weird for ordering that. Until I tried a bite...it&#39;s hands down the best lasagna I&#39;ve ever had. Whoever made the sauce, pasta, and tender chunks of salmon into that masterpiece is a culinary genius. My chicken Marsala was good but paled in comparison to this lasagna, it was amazing. The desserts are touch and go...we got the tiramisu and the dessert trio. Most tiramisu tastes like soggy cake to me so I wasn&#39;t a huge fan, and the dessert trio looked a lot better than it tasted. <br><br>I like the gift shop, but everything besides the wines is a little pricey. That&#39;s pretty typical of any winery though, so I can&#39;t knock them for that. What I can and did knock them a star for is the actual taste of some of the food. Though it looks pretty, I found the salad to be more of an afterthought...sad looking lettuce and some carrots, reminiscent of school lunch type of salads. Also the desserts look sinfully good, but they missed the mark on flavor. Of the dessert trio we got (Chocolate filled chocolate cupcake with strawberry icing and a (dry) brown heart on top, a cannoli (tasted old/stale), and a raspberry tart abomination) everything was sub-par flavor wise. And tasted like they had been sitting there for a little too long, way past their peak of freshness.<br><br>Shout out to the staff for holding it down with class. Everyone is extremely attentive and upbeat, and knows their stuff when it comes to food and wine. Just enough attention from the servers to make sure your dinner is going well without feeling like they&#39;re breathing down your neck. Â Even the security guard at the door is awesome and warmly wishes you a good night as you&#39;re leaving.

Oh wait, apparently in LA they do. All joking aside though, maybe they should be a little more discriminatory about who they let in here, or at least who they don&#39;t kick out. I recently went here for dinner and even though we had an amazing time we were seated in the main dining area, in the vicinity of a room that was closed for a private party which sounded like it had about 50 loud and kind of obnoxious drunk people in it. Fair enough, this *is* a winery, but seriously, tone it down a few notches. We all don&#39;t need to hear your conversations...I promise you, you aren&#39;t that interesting. Yet the noise level just got louder and louder, until finally the party left the room. All 6 of them. Yep, 6 people making enough noise in there for basically everyone in the main dining room to hear their yelling and SUPER loud drunk cackling laughter. They must have paid a helluva deposit. Anyway, I don&#39;t fault the winery for this, they aren&#39;t here to baby-sit their patrons.<br><br>Though Los Angeles is a young city compared to some others, there is a lot of history here. This winery is a little piece of that history, owned by the Riboli family since 1917 it&#39;s the oldest operating winery in Los Angeles. The layout and decor are still reminiscent of classic, elegant times. Too bad some of that class couldn&#39;t be transferred to certain clientele, but I digress.<br><br>I have been many times to Maddelena restaurant, and always enjoy the food. Their menu is fresh and seasonal, and visual rather than written down. There is nothing quite like a good seasonal menu, when everything is at it&#39;s peak of freshness and not just thrown on, but beautifully arranged on the plate. All the dishes are prepared and wrapped for examples, and you just choose the one that looks best to you. They give you crusty bread, butter, and a salad and a sign with the name of the entree you chose, which is freshly prepared and brought out to your table.<br><br>The salmon lasagna...definitely the show stopper. I wouldn&#39;t have ever thought that combination would work, and actually thought my dad was weird for ordering that. Until I tried a bite...it&#39;s hands down the best lasagna I&#39;ve ever had. Whoever made the sauce, pasta, and tender chunks of salmon into that masterpiece is a culinary genius. My chicken Marsala was good but paled in comparison to this lasagna, it was amazing. The desserts are touch and go...we got the tiramisu and the dessert trio. Most tiramisu tastes like soggy cake to me so I wasn&#39;t a huge fan, and the dessert trio looked a lot better than it tasted. <br><br>I like the gift shop, but everything besides the wines is a little pricey. That&#39;s pretty typical of any winery though, so I can&#39;t knock them for that. What I can and did knock them a star for is the actual taste of some of the food. Though it looks pretty, I found the salad to be more of an afterthought...sad looking lettuce and some carrots, reminiscent of school lunch type of salads. Also the desserts look sinfully good, but they missed the mark on flavor. Of the dessert trio we got (Chocolate filled chocolate cupcake with strawberry icing and a (dry) brown heart on top, a cannoli (tasted old/stale), and a raspberry tart abomination) everything was sub-par flavor wise. And tasted like they had been sitting there for a little too long, way past their peak of freshness.<br><br>Shout out to the staff for holding it down with class. Everyone is extremely attentive and upbeat, and knows their stuff when it comes to food and wine. Just enough attention from the servers to make sure your dinner is going well without feeling like they&#39;re breathing down your neck.

Oh wait, apparently in LA they do. All joking aside though, maybe they should be a little more discriminatory about who they let in here, or at least who they don&#39;t kick out. I recently went here for dinner and even though we had an amazing time we were seated in the main dining area, in the vicinity of a room that was closed for a private party which sounded like it had about 50 loud and kind of obnoxious drunk people in it. Fair enough, this *is* a winery, but seriously, tone it down a few notches. We all don&#39;t need to hear your conversations...I promise you, you aren&#39;t that interesting. Yet the noise level just got louder and louder, until finally the party left the room. All 6 of them. Yep, 6 people making enough noise in there for basically everyone in the main dining room to hear their yelling and SUPER loud drunk cackling laughter. They must have paid a helluva deposit. Anyway, I don&#39;t fault the winery for this, they aren&#39;t here to baby-sit their patrons.<br><br>Though Los Angeles is a young city compared to some others, there is a lot of history here. This winery is a little piece of that history, owned by the Riboli family since 1917 it&#39;s the oldest operating winery in Los Angeles. The layout and decor are still reminiscent of classic, elegant times. Too bad some of that class couldn&#39;t be transferred to certain clientele, but I digress.<br><br>I have been many times to Maddelena restaurant, and always enjoy the food. Their menu is fresh and seasonal, and visual rather than written down. There is nothing quite like a good seasonal menu, when everything is at it&#39;s peak of freshness and not just thrown on, but beautifully arranged on the plate. All the dishes are prepared and wrapped for examples, and you just choose the one that looks best to you. They give you crusty bread, butter, and a salad and a sign with the name of the entree you chose, which is freshly prepared and brought out to your table.<br><br>The salmon lasagna...definitely the show stopper. I wouldn&#39;t have ever thought that combination would work, and actually thought my dad was weird for ordering that. Until I tried a bite...it&#39;s hands down the best lasagna I&#39;ve ever had. Whoever made the sauce, pasta, and tender chunks of salmon into that masterpiece is a culinary genius. My chicken Marsala was good but paled in comparison to this lasagna, it was amazing. The desserts are touch and go...we got the tiramisu and the dessert trio. Most tiramisu tastes like soggy cake to me so I wasn&#39;t a huge fan, and the dessert trio looked a lot better than it tasted. <br><br>I like the gift shop, but everything besides the wines is a little pricey. That&#39;s pretty typical of any winery though, so I can&#39;t knock them for that. What I can and did knock them a star for is the actual taste of some of the food. Though it looks pretty, I found the salad to be more of an afterthought...sad looking lettuce and some carrots, reminiscent of school lunch type of salads. Also the desserts look sinfully good, but they missed the mark on flavor. Of the dessert trio we got (Chocolate filled chocolate cupcake with strawberry icing and a (dry) brown heart on top, a cannoli (tasted old/stale), and a raspberry tart abomination) everything was sub-par flavor wise. And tasted like they had been sitting there for a little too long, way past their peak of freshness.<br><br>Shout out to the staff for holding it down with class. Everyone is extremely attentive and upbeat, and knows their stuff when it comes to food and wine. Just enough attention from the servers to make sure your dinner is going well without feeling like they&#39;re breathing down your neck. Â Even the security guard at the door is awesome and warmly wishes you a good night as you&#39;re leaving.

Fair enough, this *is* a winery, but seriously, tone it down a few notches. We all don&#39;t need to hear your conversations...I promise you, you aren&#39;t that interesting. Yet the noise level just got louder and louder, until finally the party left the room. All 6 of them. Yep, 6 people making enough noise in there for basically everyone in the main dining room to hear their yelling and SUPER loud drunk cackling laughter. They must have paid a helluva deposit. Anyway, I don&#39;t fault the winery for this, they aren&#39;t here to baby-sit their patrons.<br><br>Though Los Angeles is a young city compared to some others, there is a lot of history here. This winery is a little piece of that history, owned by the Riboli family since 1917 it&#39;s the oldest operating winery in Los Angeles. The layout and decor are still reminiscent of classic, elegant times. Too bad some of that class couldn&#39;t be transferred to certain clientele, but I digress.<br><br>I have been many times to Maddelena restaurant, and always enjoy the food. Their menu is fresh and seasonal, and visual rather than written down. There is nothing quite like a good seasonal menu, when everything is at it&#39;s peak of freshness and not just thrown on, but beautifully arranged on the plate. All the dishes are prepared and wrapped for examples, and you just choose the one that looks best to you. They give you crusty bread, butter, and a salad and a sign with the name of the entree you chose, which is freshly prepared and brought out to your table.<br><br>The salmon lasagna...definitely the show stopper. I wouldn&#39;t have ever thought that combination would work, and actually thought my dad was weird for ordering that. Until I tried a bite...it&#39;s hands down the best lasagna I&#39;ve ever had. Whoever made the sauce, pasta, and tender chunks of salmon into that masterpiece is a culinary genius. My chicken Marsala was good but paled in comparison to this lasagna, it was amazing. The desserts are touch and go...we got the tiramisu and the dessert trio. Most tiramisu tastes like soggy cake to me so I wasn&#39;t a huge fan, and the dessert trio looked a lot better than it tasted. <br><br>I like the gift shop, but everything besides the wines is a little pricey. That&#39;s pretty typical of any winery though, so I can&#39;t knock them for that. What I can and did knock them a star for is the actual taste of some of the food. Though it looks pretty, I found the salad to be more of an afterthought...sad looking lettuce and some carrots, reminiscent of school lunch type of salads. Also the desserts look sinfully good, but they missed the mark on flavor. Of the dessert trio we got (Chocolate filled chocolate cupcake with strawberry icing and a (dry) brown heart on top, a cannoli (tasted old/stale), and a raspberry tart abomination) everything was sub-par flavor wise. And tasted like they had been sitting there for a little too long, way past their peak of freshness.<br><br>Shout out to the staff for holding it down with class. Everyone is extremely attentive and upbeat, and knows their stuff when it comes to food and wine. Just enough attention from the servers to make sure your dinner is going well without feeling like they&#39;re breathing down your neck. Â Even the security guard at the door is awesome and warmly wishes you a good night as you&#39;re leaving. San Antonio winery has a special place in my heart, and every time I go it&#39;s an adventure.

You can add shots of bee pollen, protein or wheatgrass among other things to your smoothies too. <br><br>Staff is very friendly and they know their product. Ask them what their favorites are and give this place a try!

They prefer the traditional Chinese medicine with herbs to cure their sickness. What is cool about this place is that they actually do have a doctor who gives you a check-up like a regular doctor. You tell them all their symptoms and they will tell you exactly what you need. I tried this plenty of times when I got sick before. When I drank the herbs (of course you will need to prepare the medicine first; they will teach you how) that they provided me, I was cured within 3 days! However, I recommend calling them first to see if the doctor is there. You can also ask them to put your name on the waiting list if the doctor is there!<br><br>For a Chinese store, I must say that their customer service is great! I usually get one or more workers at the other stores in Chinatown following me or staring me down like I am a criminal! However, at this store they will leave you alone.

Oh wait, apparently in LA they do. All joking aside though, maybe they should be a little more discriminatory about who they let in here, or at least who they don&#39;t kick out. I recently went here for dinner and even though we had an amazing time we were seated in the main dining area, in the vicinity of a room that was closed for a private party which sounded like it had about 50 loud and kind of obnoxious drunk people in it. Fair enough, this *is* a winery, but seriously, tone it down a few notches. We all don&#39;t need to hear your conversations...I promise you, you aren&#39;t that interesting. Yet the noise level just got louder and louder, until finally the party left the room. All 6 of them. Yep, 6 people making enough noise in there for basically everyone in the main dining room to hear their yelling and SUPER loud drunk cackling laughter. They must have paid a helluva deposit. Anyway, I don&#39;t fault the winery for this, they aren&#39;t here to baby-sit their patrons.<br><br>Though Los Angeles is a young city compared to some others, there is a lot of history here. This winery is a little piece of that history, owned by the Riboli family since 1917 it&#39;s the oldest operating winery in Los Angeles. The layout and decor are still reminiscent of classic, elegant times. Too bad some of that class couldn&#39;t be transferred to certain clientele, but I digress.<br><br>I have been many times to Maddelena restaurant, and always enjoy the food. Their menu is fresh and seasonal, and visual rather than written down. There is nothing quite like a good seasonal menu, when everything is at it&#39;s peak of freshness and not just thrown on, but beautifully arranged on the plate. All the dishes are prepared and wrapped for examples, and you just choose the one that looks best to you. They give you crusty bread, butter, and a salad and a sign with the name of the entree you chose, which is freshly prepared and brought out to your table.<br><br>The salmon lasagna...definitely the show stopper. I wouldn&#39;t have ever thought that combination would work, and actually thought my dad was weird for ordering that. Until I tried a bite...it&#39;s hands down the best lasagna I&#39;ve ever had. Whoever made the sauce, pasta, and tender chunks of salmon into that masterpiece is a culinary genius. My chicken Marsala was good but paled in comparison to this lasagna, it was amazing. The desserts are touch and go...we got the tiramisu and the dessert trio. Most tiramisu tastes like soggy cake to me so I wasn&#39;t a huge fan, and the dessert trio looked a lot better than it tasted. <br><br>I like the gift shop, but everything besides the wines is a little pricey. That&#39;s pretty typical of any winery though, so I can&#39;t knock them for that. What I can and did knock them a star for is the actual taste of some of the food. Though it looks pretty, I found the salad to be more of an afterthought...sad looking lettuce and some carrots, reminiscent of school lunch type of salads. Also the desserts look sinfully good, but they missed the mark on flavor. Of the dessert trio we got (Chocolate filled chocolate cupcake with strawberry icing and a (dry) brown heart on top, a cannoli (tasted old/stale), and a raspberry tart abomination) everything was sub-par flavor wise. And tasted like they had been sitting there for a little too long, way past their peak of freshness.<br><br>Shout out to the staff for holding it down with class. Everyone is extremely attentive and upbeat, and knows their stuff when it comes to food and wine. Just enough attention from the servers to make sure your dinner is going well without feeling like they&#39;re breathing down your neck. Â Even the security guard at the door is awesome and warmly wishes you a good night as you&#39;re leaving.

I&#39;ve been here twice before- once to get help with setting up my groupon and mindbody account- to just get into a class, and once to fill out the waiver and see f I couldn&#39;t try the wait list.

I&#39;m here tonight trying to take a class that I am signed up for- but was just told I had to buy a $15 pair of socks. WHAT!? I was here twice before and no one mentioned that this was mandatory- I would have brought my own pair had I known I needed them. I tried to talk to the kid at the juice counter, but it&#39;s so loud I couldn&#39;t really understand him and all he kept repeating was &#34;I don&#39;t know- I&#39;m new here.&#34; It&#39;s pretty obvious that the kids working the counter don&#39;t really know what&#39;s going on with the classes, but they schedule classes so close together that the teacher didn&#39;t have enough time to give me the proper information to prepare myself for this class when I tried to speak to her last time I was here.

Oh wait, apparently in LA they do. All joking aside though, maybe they should be a little more discriminatory about who they let in here, or at least who they don&#39;t kick out. I recently went here for dinner and even though we had an amazing time we were seated in the main dining area, in the vicinity of a room that was closed for a private party which sounded like it had about 50 loud and kind of obnoxious drunk people in it. Fair enough, this *is* a winery, but seriously, tone it down a few notches. We all don&#39;t need to hear your conversations...I promise you, you aren&#39;t that interesting. Yet the noise level just got louder and louder, until finally the party left the room. All 6 of them. Yep, 6 people making enough noise in there for basically everyone in the main dining room to hear their yelling and SUPER loud drunk cackling laughter. They must have paid a helluva deposit. Anyway, I don&#39;t fault the winery for this, they aren&#39;t here to baby-sit their patrons.<br><br>Though Los Angeles is a young city compared to some others, there is a lot of history here. This winery is a little piece of that history, owned by the Riboli family since 1917 it&#39;s the oldest operating winery in Los Angeles. The layout and decor are still reminiscent of classic, elegant times. Too bad some of that class couldn&#39;t be transferred to certain clientele, but I digress.<br><br>I have been many times to Maddelena restaurant, and always enjoy the food. Their menu is fresh and seasonal, and visual rather than written down. There is nothing quite like a good seasonal menu, when everything is at it&#39;s peak of freshness and not just thrown on, but beautifully arranged on the plate. All the dishes are prepared and wrapped for examples, and you just choose the one that looks best to you. They give you crusty bread, butter, and a salad and a sign with the name of the entree you chose, which is freshly prepared and brought out to your table.<br><br>The salmon lasagna...definitely the show stopper. I wouldn&#39;t have ever thought that combination would work, and actually thought my dad was weird for ordering that. Until I tried a bite...it&#39;s hands down the best lasagna I&#39;ve ever had. Whoever made the sauce, pasta, and tender chunks of salmon into that masterpiece is a culinary genius. My chicken Marsala was good but paled in comparison to this lasagna, it was amazing. The desserts are touch and go...we got the tiramisu and the dessert trio. Most tiramisu tastes like soggy cake to me so I wasn&#39;t a huge fan, and the dessert trio looked a lot better than it tasted. <br><br>I like the gift shop, but everything besides the wines is a little pricey. That&#39;s pretty typical of any winery though, so I can&#39;t knock them for that. What I can and did knock them a star for is the actual taste of some of the food. Though it looks pretty, I found the salad to be more of an afterthought...sad looking lettuce and some carrots, reminiscent of school lunch type of salads. Also the desserts look sinfully good, but they missed the mark on flavor. Of the dessert trio we got (Chocolate filled chocolate cupcake with strawberry icing and a (dry) brown heart on top, a cannoli (tasted old/stale), and a raspberry tart abomination) everything was sub-par flavor wise. And tasted like they had been sitting there for a little too long, way past their peak of freshness.<br><br>Shout out to the staff for holding it down with class. Everyone is extremely attentive and upbeat, and knows their stuff when it comes to food and wine. Just enough attention from the servers to make sure your dinner is going well without feeling like they&#39;re breathing down your neck.

I recently went here for dinner and even though we had an amazing time we were seated in the main dining area, in the vicinity of a room that was closed for a private party which sounded like it had about 50 loud and kind of obnoxious drunk people in it. Fair enough, this *is* a winery, but seriously, tone it down a few notches. We all don&#39;t need to hear your conversations...I promise you, you aren&#39;t that interesting. Yet the noise level just got louder and louder, until finally the party left the room. All 6 of them. Yep, 6 people making enough noise in there for basically everyone in the main dining room to hear their yelling and SUPER loud drunk cackling laughter. They must have paid a helluva deposit. Anyway, I don&#39;t fault the winery for this, they aren&#39;t here to baby-sit their patrons.<br><br>Though Los Angeles is a young city compared to some others, there is a lot of history here. This winery is a little piece of that history, owned by the Riboli family since 1917 it&#39;s the oldest operating winery in Los Angeles. The layout and decor are still reminiscent of classic, elegant times. Too bad some of that class couldn&#39;t be transferred to certain clientele, but I digress.<br><br>I have been many times to Maddelena restaurant, and always enjoy the food. Their menu is fresh and seasonal, and visual rather than written down. There is nothing quite like a good seasonal menu, when everything is at it&#39;s peak of freshness and not just thrown on, but beautifully arranged on the plate. All the dishes are prepared and wrapped for examples, and you just choose the one that looks best to you. They give you crusty bread, butter, and a salad and a sign with the name of the entree you chose, which is freshly prepared and brought out to your table.<br><br>The salmon lasagna...definitely the show stopper. I wouldn&#39;t have ever thought that combination would work, and actually thought my dad was weird for ordering that. Until I tried a bite...it&#39;s hands down the best lasagna I&#39;ve ever had. Whoever made the sauce, pasta, and tender chunks of salmon into that masterpiece is a culinary genius. My chicken Marsala was good but paled in comparison to this lasagna, it was amazing. The desserts are touch and go...we got the tiramisu and the dessert trio. Most tiramisu tastes like soggy cake to me so I wasn&#39;t a huge fan, and the dessert trio looked a lot better than it tasted. <br><br>I like the gift shop, but everything besides the wines is a little pricey. That&#39;s pretty typical of any winery though, so I can&#39;t knock them for that. What I can and did knock them a star for is the actual taste of some of the food. Though it looks pretty, I found the salad to be more of an afterthought...sad looking lettuce and some carrots, reminiscent of school lunch type of salads. Also the desserts look sinfully good, but they missed the mark on flavor. Of the dessert trio we got (Chocolate filled chocolate cupcake with strawberry icing and a (dry) brown heart on top, a cannoli (tasted old/stale), and a raspberry tart abomination) everything was sub-par flavor wise. And tasted like they had been sitting there for a little too long, way past their peak of freshness.<br><br>Shout out to the staff for holding it down with class. Everyone is extremely attentive and upbeat, and knows their stuff when it comes to food and wine. Just enough attention from the servers to make sure your dinner is going well without feeling like they&#39;re breathing down your neck. Â Even the security guard at the door is awesome and warmly wishes you a good night as you&#39;re leaving.

Chanel, the owner, responded in just a short time, and wanted to know what I had in mind and she would see if she could accommodate us. <br><br>Long story short, Chanel agreed to open the Cafe just for us ladies for an exclusive bridal shower, and the experience was just off-the-chart amazing.<br><br>1. We came up with a menu of 3 choices of sandwiches and panini. Chanel made so much food that not only did everyone feel full, but she was able to pack the left overs in individual boxes. Our guests were able to grab some afterward for themselves and their significant others!<br><br>2. In the price that she quoted us, she mentioned that she would make sure that everyone has more than enough beverage to drink. And boy was she right! There were plenty of sodas, black tea and passion tea on the counter, hot and cold water on the side. I think our guests barely touched any of the soda because the tea was amazing.<br><br>3. Chanel gave us the freedom to rearrange all of her tables and chairs, and we could hang/tape our decorate on the wall as long as it doesn&#39;t damage her arts. She was also able to accommodate us 1 hour ahead of the bridal shower to decorate. We came a bit early (15 mins) and she still let us in right away!<br><br>4. She was able to send us pictures ahead of time of the venue so we had a good idea how to arrange stuff (although we did most of that on the spot). She also gave us good information about parking, and even let us temporarily park in the employee lot so we could unload all of our stuff in the easiest way possible.<br><br>5. The venue itself really is very great. Our bride&#39;s color is coral, so the red in the store really helped w/ the decor. Because there is already art work, a lot of the wall decor was kept to the minimal for us! 2 reasons we chose this place was the exclusivity that we could enjoy, as well as those amazing floor to ceiling windows on an entire side of the wall. We had such great sunlight and the view was great pleasant too. Also, she let us use her pandora list so we could have some music ;)<br><br>I know that this is not your usual review since it was for an exclusive event, but it really was a great experience for us.

Oh wait, apparently in LA they do. All joking aside though, maybe they should be a little more discriminatory about who they let in here, or at least who they don&#39;t kick out. I recently went here for dinner and even though we had an amazing time we were seated in the main dining area, in the vicinity of a room that was closed for a private party which sounded like it had about 50 loud and kind of obnoxious drunk people in it. Fair enough, this *is* a winery, but seriously, tone it down a few notches. We all don&#39;t need to hear your conversations...I promise you, you aren&#39;t that interesting. Yet the noise level just got louder and louder, until finally the party left the room. All 6 of them. Yep, 6 people making enough noise in there for basically everyone in the main dining room to hear their yelling and SUPER loud drunk cackling laughter. They must have paid a helluva deposit. Anyway, I don&#39;t fault the winery for this, they aren&#39;t here to baby-sit their patrons.<br><br>Though Los Angeles is a young city compared to some others, there is a lot of history here. This winery is a little piece of that history, owned by the Riboli family since 1917 it&#39;s the oldest operating winery in Los Angeles. The layout and decor are still reminiscent of classic, elegant times. Too bad some of that class couldn&#39;t be transferred to certain clientele, but I digress.<br><br>I have been many times to Maddelena restaurant, and always enjoy the food. Their menu is fresh and seasonal, and visual rather than written down. There is nothing quite like a good seasonal menu, when everything is at it&#39;s peak of freshness and not just thrown on, but beautifully arranged on the plate. All the dishes are prepared and wrapped for examples, and you just choose the one that looks best to you. They give you crusty bread, butter, and a salad and a sign with the name of the entree you chose, which is freshly prepared and brought out to your table.<br><br>The salmon lasagna...definitely the show stopper. I wouldn&#39;t have ever thought that combination would work, and actually thought my dad was weird for ordering that. Until I tried a bite...it&#39;s hands down the best lasagna I&#39;ve ever had. Whoever made the sauce, pasta, and tender chunks of salmon into that masterpiece is a culinary genius. My chicken Marsala was good but paled in comparison to this lasagna, it was amazing. The desserts are touch and go...we got the tiramisu and the dessert trio. Most tiramisu tastes like soggy cake to me so I wasn&#39;t a huge fan, and the dessert trio looked a lot better than it tasted. <br><br>I like the gift shop, but everything besides the wines is a little pricey. That&#39;s pretty typical of any winery though, so I can&#39;t knock them for that. What I can and did knock them a star for is the actual taste of some of the food. Though it looks pretty, I found the salad to be more of an afterthought...sad looking lettuce and some carrots, reminiscent of school lunch type of salads. Also the desserts look sinfully good, but they missed the mark on flavor. Of the dessert trio we got (Chocolate filled chocolate cupcake with strawberry icing and a (dry) brown heart on top, a cannoli (tasted old/stale), and a raspberry tart abomination) everything was sub-par flavor wise. And tasted like they had been sitting there for a little too long, way past their peak of freshness.<br><br>Shout out to the staff for holding it down with class. Everyone is extremely attentive and upbeat, and knows their stuff when it comes to food and wine. Just enough attention from the servers to make sure your dinner is going well without feeling like they&#39;re breathing down your neck. Â Even the security guard at the door is awesome and warmly wishes you a good night as you&#39;re leaving.

Once that became clear, I pulled over to search Yelp for an alternative, and I am so grateful that Tart Bites came up. I didn&#39;t want to make the same mistake twice, so this time I called ahead.<br><br>Imagine picking up the phone to hear a customer ask, &#34;You&#39;re open, right? And I could come in and purchase things from you? What I mean is, you exist, right?&#34; That sounds insane, but that was what I asked them, and I was blown away by how friendly and professionally the woman at the other end handled it. With great humor she confirmed that they existed, and when I explained why I had asked such a strange question, she was completely sympathetic and told me to come on over there and she would give me a cup of coffee and help me put together something great for Valentine&#39;s Day. She managed in mere seconds to make me feel like a valued customer and an old friend. It was utterly unlike any other phone conversation I have ever had with a business.<br><br>When I got there, it was no different. She shook my hand and introduced herself, allowed me to try one of the tarts so I could get a sense of what they were like (because their tarts concept is so different from all the myriad other bakeries and cupcakeries out there), and answered my questions as if she was as interested and invested in them as I was. Once again, I felt I was conversing with a friend. For me, this kind of customer service--not abandoning kindness and humanity in the name of business--can transform not only a shopping experience but really a whole day. Kindness has that effect, and that&#39;s what I got at Tart Bites.<br><br>Of course, the product itself is equally important. Fortunately, the tarts live up to the service. There is none of that too hard, one-note shortbread tart shell here. They are amazing in both texture and taste. The fillings are silky smooth and taste as if only the best, natural ingredients went into them (which I&#39;m told is the case), and the ratio of crust to filling is totally balanced. And the best part is how subtly sweet they are. I am still in awe of how they managed to make a caramel and chocolate ganache-filled tart so mellow. The red velvet and the raspberry cheesecake both have the same restrained touch of sweetness as well. Each one is two or three perfect bites.

Oh wait, apparently in LA they do. All joking aside though, maybe they should be a little more discriminatory about who they let in here, or at least who they don&#39;t kick out. I recently went here for dinner and even though we had an amazing time we were seated in the main dining area, in the vicinity of a room that was closed for a private party which sounded like it had about 50 loud and kind of obnoxious drunk people in it. Fair enough, this *is* a winery, but seriously, tone it down a few notches. We all don&#39;t need to hear your conversations...I promise you, you aren&#39;t that interesting. Yet the noise level just got louder and louder, until finally the party left the room. All 6 of them. Yep, 6 people making enough noise in there for basically everyone in the main dining room to hear their yelling and SUPER loud drunk cackling laughter. They must have paid a helluva deposit. Anyway, I don&#39;t fault the winery for this, they aren&#39;t here to baby-sit their patrons.<br><br>Though Los Angeles is a young city compared to some others, there is a lot of history here. This winery is a little piece of that history, owned by the Riboli family since 1917 it&#39;s the oldest operating winery in Los Angeles. The layout and decor are still reminiscent of classic, elegant times. Too bad some of that class couldn&#39;t be transferred to certain clientele, but I digress.<br><br>I have been many times to Maddelena restaurant, and always enjoy the food. Their menu is fresh and seasonal, and visual rather than written down. There is nothing quite like a good seasonal menu, when everything is at it&#39;s peak of freshness and not just thrown on, but beautifully arranged on the plate. All the dishes are prepared and wrapped for examples, and you just choose the one that looks best to you. They give you crusty bread, butter, and a salad and a sign with the name of the entree you chose, which is freshly prepared and brought out to your table.<br><br>The salmon lasagna...definitely the show stopper. I wouldn&#39;t have ever thought that combination would work, and actually thought my dad was weird for ordering that. Until I tried a bite...it&#39;s hands down the best lasagna I&#39;ve ever had. Whoever made the sauce, pasta, and tender chunks of salmon into that masterpiece is a culinary genius. My chicken Marsala was good but paled in comparison to this lasagna, it was amazing. The desserts are touch and go...we got the tiramisu and the dessert trio. Most tiramisu tastes like soggy cake to me so I wasn&#39;t a huge fan, and the dessert trio looked a lot better than it tasted. <br><br>I like the gift shop, but everything besides the wines is a little pricey. That&#39;s pretty typical of any winery though, so I can&#39;t knock them for that. What I can and did knock them a star for is the actual taste of some of the food. Though it looks pretty, I found the salad to be more of an afterthought...sad looking lettuce and some carrots, reminiscent of school lunch type of salads. Also the desserts look sinfully good, but they missed the mark on flavor. Of the dessert trio we got (Chocolate filled chocolate cupcake with strawberry icing and a (dry) brown heart on top, a cannoli (tasted old/stale), and a raspberry tart abomination) everything was sub-par flavor wise. And tasted like they had been sitting there for a little too long, way past their peak of freshness.<br><br>Shout out to the staff for holding it down with class. Everyone is extremely attentive and upbeat, and knows their stuff when it comes to food and wine. Just enough attention from the servers to make sure your dinner is going well without feeling like they&#39;re breathing down your neck.

Oh wait, apparently in LA they do. All joking aside though, maybe they should be a little more discriminatory about who they let in here, or at least who they don&#39;t kick out. I recently went here for dinner and even though we had an amazing time we were seated in the main dining area, in the vicinity of a room that was closed for a private party which sounded like it had about 50 loud and kind of obnoxious drunk people in it. Fair enough, this *is* a winery, but seriously, tone it down a few notches. We all don&#39;t need to hear your conversations...I promise you, you aren&#39;t that interesting. Yet the noise level just got louder and louder, until finally the party left the room. All 6 of them. Yep, 6 people making enough noise in there for basically everyone in the main dining room to hear their yelling and SUPER loud drunk cackling laughter. They must have paid a helluva deposit. Anyway, I don&#39;t fault the winery for this, they aren&#39;t here to baby-sit their patrons.<br><br>Though Los Angeles is a young city compared to some others, there is a lot of history here. This winery is a little piece of that history, owned by the Riboli family since 1917 it&#39;s the oldest operating winery in Los Angeles. The layout and decor are still reminiscent of classic, elegant times. Too bad some of that class couldn&#39;t be transferred to certain clientele, but I digress.<br><br>I have been many times to Maddelena restaurant, and always enjoy the food. Their menu is fresh and seasonal, and visual rather than written down. There is nothing quite like a good seasonal menu, when everything is at it&#39;s peak of freshness and not just thrown on, but beautifully arranged on the plate. All the dishes are prepared and wrapped for examples, and you just choose the one that looks best to you. They give you crusty bread, butter, and a salad and a sign with the name of the entree you chose, which is freshly prepared and brought out to your table.<br><br>The salmon lasagna...definitely the show stopper. I wouldn&#39;t have ever thought that combination would work, and actually thought my dad was weird for ordering that. Until I tried a bite...it&#39;s hands down the best lasagna I&#39;ve ever had. Whoever made the sauce, pasta, and tender chunks of salmon into that masterpiece is a culinary genius. My chicken Marsala was good but paled in comparison to this lasagna, it was amazing. The desserts are touch and go...we got the tiramisu and the dessert trio. Most tiramisu tastes like soggy cake to me so I wasn&#39;t a huge fan, and the dessert trio looked a lot better than it tasted. <br><br>I like the gift shop, but everything besides the wines is a little pricey. That&#39;s pretty typical of any winery though, so I can&#39;t knock them for that. What I can and did knock them a star for is the actual taste of some of the food. Though it looks pretty, I found the salad to be more of an afterthought...sad looking lettuce and some carrots, reminiscent of school lunch type of salads. Also the desserts look sinfully good, but they missed the mark on flavor. Of the dessert trio we got (Chocolate filled chocolate cupcake with strawberry icing and a (dry) brown heart on top, a cannoli (tasted old/stale), and a raspberry tart abomination) everything was sub-par flavor wise. And tasted like they had been sitting there for a little too long, way past their peak of freshness.<br><br>Shout out to the staff for holding it down with class. Everyone is extremely attentive and upbeat, and knows their stuff when it comes to food and wine. Just enough attention from the servers to make sure your dinner is going well without feeling like they&#39;re breathing down your neck. Â Even the security guard at the door is awesome and warmly wishes you a good night as you&#39;re leaving.

Oh wait, apparently in LA they do. All joking aside though, maybe they should be a little more discriminatory about who they let in here, or at least who they don&#39;t kick out. I recently went here for dinner and even though we had an amazing time we were seated in the main dining area, in the vicinity of a room that was closed for a private party which sounded like it had about 50 loud and kind of obnoxious drunk people in it. Fair enough, this *is* a winery, but seriously, tone it down a few notches. We all don&#39;t need to hear your conversations...I promise you, you aren&#39;t that interesting. Yet the noise level just got louder and louder, until finally the party left the room. All 6 of them. Yep, 6 people making enough noise in there for basically everyone in the main dining room to hear their yelling and SUPER loud drunk cackling laughter. They must have paid a helluva deposit. Anyway, I don&#39;t fault the winery for this, they aren&#39;t here to baby-sit their patrons.<br><br>Though Los Angeles is a young city compared to some others, there is a lot of history here. This winery is a little piece of that history, owned by the Riboli family since 1917 it&#39;s the oldest operating winery in Los Angeles. The layout and decor are still reminiscent of classic, elegant times. Too bad some of that class couldn&#39;t be transferred to certain clientele, but I digress.<br><br>I have been many times to Maddelena restaurant, and always enjoy the food. Their menu is fresh and seasonal, and visual rather than written down. There is nothing quite like a good seasonal menu, when everything is at it&#39;s peak of freshness and not just thrown on, but beautifully arranged on the plate. All the dishes are prepared and wrapped for examples, and you just choose the one that looks best to you. They give you crusty bread, butter, and a salad and a sign with the name of the entree you chose, which is freshly prepared and brought out to your table.<br><br>The salmon lasagna...definitely the show stopper. I wouldn&#39;t have ever thought that combination would work, and actually thought my dad was weird for ordering that. Until I tried a bite...it&#39;s hands down the best lasagna I&#39;ve ever had. Whoever made the sauce, pasta, and tender chunks of salmon into that masterpiece is a culinary genius. My chicken Marsala was good but paled in comparison to this lasagna, it was amazing. The desserts are touch and go...we got the tiramisu and the dessert trio. Most tiramisu tastes like soggy cake to me so I wasn&#39;t a huge fan, and the dessert trio looked a lot better than it tasted. <br><br>I like the gift shop, but everything besides the wines is a little pricey. That&#39;s pretty typical of any winery though, so I can&#39;t knock them for that. What I can and did knock them a star for is the actual taste of some of the food. Though it looks pretty, I found the salad to be more of an afterthought...sad looking lettuce and some carrots, reminiscent of school lunch type of salads. Also the desserts look sinfully good, but they missed the mark on flavor. Of the dessert trio we got (Chocolate filled chocolate cupcake with strawberry icing and a (dry) brown heart on top, a cannoli (tasted old/stale), and a raspberry tart abomination) everything was sub-par flavor wise. And tasted like they had been sitting there for a little too long, way past their peak of freshness.<br><br>Shout out to the staff for holding it down with class.

I checked on yelp to see what time sweet lady jane was closed and saw that chaumont had 4.5 stars at 97 reviews! I couldn&#39;t miss this opportunity and dragged the manfriend back!!! <br><br>I&#39;m so happy I came back.<br><br>This lady next to me told me the pastries are to die for. I&#39;m not gonna lie...the chocolate-almond croissant looked delectable. And OMG, it was great!!!! Flakey, crispy, perfect amount of gooey chocolate with nice touch of almond here and there. I was terrified that the price was going to be over $5, but it was around $3.25? Definitely over $3!! I loved the croissant and wished I bought more. <br><br>Since I&#39;m hardly ever in LA, I couldn&#39;t stop staring at the cakes. There was this round chocolate cake...last one &amp; all by it&#39;s lonesome self...so I asked the cashier what was it. I just heard hazelnut mousse something and I was sold. Hahaha! I asked her what was the white cake with strawberries and she said it was a flourless strawberry shortcake &amp; said it was very good. Ahhhhh...I love strawberry shortcake...and hazelnut anything. Due to the price, I only wanted to get one. At this point, I was in a huge pickle! I wanted both!!! I kept asking the cashier for her opinion and I opted for the hazelnut since it seemed really popular! I was sooo excited that I didn&#39;t even notice the cashier took out a second box and put in the strawberry shortcake. She told me she&#39;ll only charge me for one!!! The fat kid in me seriously lit up like a Christmas tree! I could not contain my excitement &amp; just went cuckoo! Thanked her and flashed a million smiles in her way on my way out!! <br><br>Verdict of the two cakes? Both very yummy! I&#39;ve never had a flourless strawberry shortcake so I was pleasantly surprised and it has a nice texture to it! Spongy, creamy and juicy due to the strawberries! It&#39;s not very sweet, so I absolutely adore that! <br><br>As I mentioned before, I love hazelnut everything! But sometimes the hazelnut flavor in desserts isn&#39;t my cup of tea. I don&#39;t know how to describe the taste but it&#39;s ar those times I rather just eat an actual hazelnut. I&#39;m also not a huge fan of mousse either but I was willing to try this dessert. So, I was extremely happy &amp; surprised that their hazelnut mousse cake exceeded my expectations. Its not overly sweet and the mousse isn&#39;t bad at all...great texture! Loved the thin layer of spongy cake &amp; the chocolate. <br><br>Yesterday there was 97 reviews and today there&#39;s now over 100 including me! I&#39;m glad to see Chaumont is doing well and I hope to see you guys soar! :) <br><br>Thank you, thank you cashier lady for being so helpful, kind and patient with me! I wish I knew your name cuz cashier lady sounds rude. I hope the little kid in me did not scare you away!!! Thank you, again! Btw, I liked the flourless strawberry shortcake more than the hazelnut! <br><br>Will definitely be back when I&#39;m in the area to try their foods! Sounds healthy too!

Oh wait, apparently in LA they do. All joking aside though, maybe they should be a little more discriminatory about who they let in here, or at least who they don&#39;t kick out. I recently went here for dinner and even though we had an amazing time we were seated in the main dining area, in the vicinity of a room that was closed for a private party which sounded like it had about 50 loud and kind of obnoxious drunk people in it. Fair enough, this *is* a winery, but seriously, tone it down a few notches. We all don&#39;t need to hear your conversations...I promise you, you aren&#39;t that interesting. Yet the noise level just got louder and louder, until finally the party left the room. All 6 of them. Yep, 6 people making enough noise in there for basically everyone in the main dining room to hear their yelling and SUPER loud drunk cackling laughter. They must have paid a helluva deposit. Anyway, I don&#39;t fault the winery for this, they aren&#39;t here to baby-sit their patrons.<br><br>Though Los Angeles is a young city compared to some others, there is a lot of history here. This winery is a little piece of that history, owned by the Riboli family since 1917 it&#39;s the oldest operating winery in Los Angeles. The layout and decor are still reminiscent of classic, elegant times. Too bad some of that class couldn&#39;t be transferred to certain clientele, but I digress.<br><br>I have been many times to Maddelena restaurant, and always enjoy the food. Their menu is fresh and seasonal, and visual rather than written down.

Of course I craved food, but I looked forward to every bottle of juice even on the final day of my cleanse. My juices were all packaged and ready for pick-up two days after I placed the order. I had 7 juices and 1 aloe vera water for each day of my cleanse. All together, they&#39;re heavy! Keep in mind how far your walk is to the car because you&#39;ll have to carry them out in a paper bag. Bring a sturdier bag to carry them if you have to. There&#39;s little to no parking in this area (no parking at meters before a certain time) unless you valet it behind the building. The valet guy let me park in the spot for a few minutes since it was early and I told him I was going to be quick :)<br><br>Back to the juices.. none of them were overly sweet (which is what I was afraid of), they varied in flavor enough to not feel tired of drinking them-- two of their juices (for the master cleanse) have ginger in it, which I LOVE, but I know it&#39;s a bit of an acquired taste so be warned. In the end, I would totally do a cleanse with Juice Crafters again or come back for a healthy breakfast/lunch drink. <br><br>P.S.

Oh wait, apparently in LA they do. All joking aside though, maybe they should be a little more discriminatory about who they let in here, or at least who they don&#39;t kick out. I recently went here for dinner and even though we had an amazing time we were seated in the main dining area, in the vicinity of a room that was closed for a private party which sounded like it had about 50 loud and kind of obnoxious drunk people in it. Fair enough, this *is* a winery, but seriously, tone it down a few notches. We all don&#39;t need to hear your conversations...I promise you, you aren&#39;t that interesting. Yet the noise level just got louder and louder, until finally the party left the room. All 6 of them. Yep, 6 people making enough noise in there for basically everyone in the main dining room to hear their yelling and SUPER loud drunk cackling laughter. They must have paid a helluva deposit. Anyway, I don&#39;t fault the winery for this, they aren&#39;t here to baby-sit their patrons.<br><br>Though Los Angeles is a young city compared to some others, there is a lot of history here. This winery is a little piece of that history, owned by the Riboli family since 1917 it&#39;s the oldest operating winery in Los Angeles. The layout and decor are still reminiscent of classic, elegant times. Too bad some of that class couldn&#39;t be transferred to certain clientele, but I digress.<br><br>I have been many times to Maddelena restaurant, and always enjoy the food. Their menu is fresh and seasonal, and visual rather than written down. There is nothing quite like a good seasonal menu, when everything is at it&#39;s peak of freshness and not just thrown on, but beautifully arranged on the plate. All the dishes are prepared and wrapped for examples, and you just choose the one that looks best to you. They give you crusty bread, butter, and a salad and a sign with the name of the entree you chose, which is freshly prepared and brought out to your table.<br><br>The salmon lasagna...definitely the show stopper. I wouldn&#39;t have ever thought that combination would work, and actually thought my dad was weird for ordering that. Until I tried a bite...it&#39;s hands down the best lasagna I&#39;ve ever had. Whoever made the sauce, pasta, and tender chunks of salmon into that masterpiece is a culinary genius. My chicken Marsala was good but paled in comparison to this lasagna, it was amazing. The desserts are touch and go...we got the tiramisu and the dessert trio. Most tiramisu tastes like soggy cake to me so I wasn&#39;t a huge fan, and the dessert trio looked a lot better than it tasted. <br><br>I like the gift shop, but everything besides the wines is a little pricey. That&#39;s pretty typical of any winery though, so I can&#39;t knock them for that. What I can and did knock them a star for is the actual taste of some of the food. Though it looks pretty, I found the salad to be more of an afterthought...sad looking lettuce and some carrots, reminiscent of school lunch type of salads. Also the desserts look sinfully good, but they missed the mark on flavor. Of the dessert trio we got (Chocolate filled chocolate cupcake with strawberry icing and a (dry) brown heart on top, a cannoli (tasted old/stale), and a raspberry tart abomination) everything was sub-par flavor wise. And tasted like they had been sitting there for a little too long, way past their peak of freshness.<br><br>Shout out to the staff for holding it down with class. Everyone is extremely attentive and upbeat, and knows their stuff when it comes to food and wine. Just enough attention from the servers to make sure your dinner is going well without feeling like they&#39;re breathing down your neck. Â Even the security guard at the door is awesome and warmly wishes you a good night as you&#39;re leaving.

I checked on yelp to see what time sweet lady jane was closed and saw that chaumont had 4.5 stars at 97 reviews! I couldn&#39;t miss this opportunity and dragged the manfriend back!!! <br><br>I&#39;m so happy I came back.<br><br>This lady next to me told me the pastries are to die for. I&#39;m not gonna lie...the chocolate-almond croissant looked delectable. And OMG, it was great!!!! Flakey, crispy, perfect amount of gooey chocolate with nice touch of almond here and there. I was terrified that the price was going to be over $5, but it was around $3.25? Definitely over $3!! I loved the croissant and wished I bought more. <br><br>Since I&#39;m hardly ever in LA, I couldn&#39;t stop staring at the cakes. There was this round chocolate cake...last one &amp; all by it&#39;s lonesome self...so I asked the cashier what was it. I just heard hazelnut mousse something and I was sold. Hahaha! I asked her what was the white cake with strawberries and she said it was a flourless strawberry shortcake &amp; said it was very good. Ahhhhh...I love strawberry shortcake...and hazelnut anything. Due to the price, I only wanted to get one. At this point, I was in a huge pickle! I wanted both!!! I kept asking the cashier for her opinion and I opted for the hazelnut since it seemed really popular! I was sooo excited that I didn&#39;t even notice the cashier took out a second box and put in the strawberry shortcake. She told me she&#39;ll only charge me for one!!! The fat kid in me seriously lit up like a Christmas tree! I could not contain my excitement &amp; just went cuckoo! Thanked her and flashed a million smiles in her way on my way out!! <br><br>Verdict of the two cakes? Both very yummy! I&#39;ve never had a flourless strawberry shortcake so I was pleasantly surprised and it has a nice texture to it! Spongy, creamy and juicy due to the strawberries! It&#39;s not very sweet, so I absolutely adore that! <br><br>As I mentioned before, I love hazelnut everything! But sometimes the hazelnut flavor in desserts isn&#39;t my cup of tea. I don&#39;t know how to describe the taste but it&#39;s ar those times I rather just eat an actual hazelnut. I&#39;m also not a huge fan of mousse either but I was willing to try this dessert. So, I was extremely happy &amp; surprised that their hazelnut mousse cake exceeded my expectations. Its not overly sweet and the mousse isn&#39;t bad at all...great texture! Loved the thin layer of spongy cake &amp; the chocolate. <br><br>Yesterday there was 97 reviews and today there&#39;s now over 100 including me! I&#39;m glad to see Chaumont is doing well and I hope to see you guys soar! :) <br><br>Thank you, thank you cashier lady for being so helpful, kind and patient with me! I wish I knew your name cuz cashier lady sounds rude. I hope the little kid in me did not scare you away!!! Thank you, again! Btw, I liked the flourless strawberry shortcake more than the hazelnut! <br><br>Will definitely be back when I&#39;m in the area to try their foods! Sounds healthy too!

Oh wait, apparently in LA they do. All joking aside though, maybe they should be a little more discriminatory about who they let in here, or at least who they don&#39;t kick out. I recently went here for dinner and even though we had an amazing time we were seated in the main dining area, in the vicinity of a room that was closed for a private party which sounded like it had about 50 loud and kind of obnoxious drunk people in it. Fair enough, this *is* a winery, but seriously, tone it down a few notches. We all don&#39;t need to hear your conversations...I promise you, you aren&#39;t that interesting. Yet the noise level just got louder and louder, until finally the party left the room. All 6 of them. Yep, 6 people making enough noise in there for basically everyone in the main dining room to hear their yelling and SUPER loud drunk cackling laughter. They must have paid a helluva deposit. Anyway, I don&#39;t fault the winery for this, they aren&#39;t here to baby-sit their patrons.<br><br>Though Los Angeles is a young city compared to some others, there is a lot of history here. This winery is a little piece of that history, owned by the Riboli family since 1917 it&#39;s the oldest operating winery in Los Angeles. The layout and decor are still reminiscent of classic, elegant times. Too bad some of that class couldn&#39;t be transferred to certain clientele, but I digress.<br><br>I have been many times to Maddelena restaurant, and always enjoy the food. Their menu is fresh and seasonal, and visual rather than written down. There is nothing quite like a good seasonal menu, when everything is at it&#39;s peak of freshness and not just thrown on, but beautifully arranged on the plate. All the dishes are prepared and wrapped for examples, and you just choose the one that looks best to you. They give you crusty bread, butter, and a salad and a sign with the name of the entree you chose, which is freshly prepared and brought out to your table.<br><br>The salmon lasagna...definitely the show stopper. I wouldn&#39;t have ever thought that combination would work, and actually thought my dad was weird for ordering that. Until I tried a bite...it&#39;s hands down the best lasagna I&#39;ve ever had. Whoever made the sauce, pasta, and tender chunks of salmon into that masterpiece is a culinary genius. My chicken Marsala was good but paled in comparison to this lasagna, it was amazing. The desserts are touch and go...we got the tiramisu and the dessert trio. Most tiramisu tastes like soggy cake to me so I wasn&#39;t a huge fan, and the dessert trio looked a lot better than it tasted. <br><br>I like the gift shop, but everything besides the wines is a little pricey. That&#39;s pretty typical of any winery though, so I can&#39;t knock them for that. What I can and did knock them a star for is the actual taste of some of the food. Though it looks pretty, I found the salad to be more of an afterthought...sad looking lettuce and some carrots, reminiscent of school lunch type of salads. Also the desserts look sinfully good, but they missed the mark on flavor. Of the dessert trio we got (Chocolate filled chocolate cupcake with strawberry icing and a (dry) brown heart on top, a cannoli (tasted old/stale), and a raspberry tart abomination) everything was sub-par flavor wise. And tasted like they had been sitting there for a little too long, way past their peak of freshness.<br><br>Shout out to the staff for holding it down with class. Everyone is extremely attentive and upbeat, and knows their stuff when it comes to food and wine. Just enough attention from the servers to make sure your dinner is going well without feeling like they&#39;re breathing down your neck. Â Even the security guard at the door is awesome and warmly wishes you a good night as you&#39;re leaving.

Oh wait, apparently in LA they do. All joking aside though, maybe they should be a little more discriminatory about who they let in here, or at least who they don&#39;t kick out. I recently went here for dinner and even though we had an amazing time we were seated in the main dining area, in the vicinity of a room that was closed for a private party which sounded like it had about 50 loud and kind of obnoxious drunk people in it. Fair enough, this *is* a winery, but seriously, tone it down a few notches. We all don&#39;t need to hear your conversations...I promise you, you aren&#39;t that interesting. Yet the noise level just got louder and louder, until finally the party left the room. All 6 of them. Yep, 6 people making enough noise in there for basically everyone in the main dining room to hear their yelling and SUPER loud drunk cackling laughter. They must have paid a helluva deposit. Anyway, I don&#39;t fault the winery for this, they aren&#39;t here to baby-sit their patrons.<br><br>Though Los Angeles is a young city compared to some others, there is a lot of history here. This winery is a little piece of that history, owned by the Riboli family since 1917 it&#39;s the oldest operating winery in Los Angeles. The layout and decor are still reminiscent of classic, elegant times. Too bad some of that class couldn&#39;t be transferred to certain clientele, but I digress.<br><br>I have been many times to Maddelena restaurant, and always enjoy the food. Their menu is fresh and seasonal, and visual rather than written down. There is nothing quite like a good seasonal menu, when everything is at it&#39;s peak of freshness and not just thrown on, but beautifully arranged on the plate. All the dishes are prepared and wrapped for examples, and you just choose the one that looks best to you. They give you crusty bread, butter, and a salad and a sign with the name of the entree you chose, which is freshly prepared and brought out to your table.<br><br>The salmon lasagna...definitely the show stopper. I wouldn&#39;t have ever thought that combination would work, and actually thought my dad was weird for ordering that. Until I tried a bite...it&#39;s hands down the best lasagna I&#39;ve ever had. Whoever made the sauce, pasta, and tender chunks of salmon into that masterpiece is a culinary genius. My chicken Marsala was good but paled in comparison to this lasagna, it was amazing. The desserts are touch and go...we got the tiramisu and the dessert trio. Most tiramisu tastes like soggy cake to me so I wasn&#39;t a huge fan, and the dessert trio looked a lot better than it tasted. <br><br>I like the gift shop, but everything besides the wines is a little pricey. That&#39;s pretty typical of any winery though, so I can&#39;t knock them for that. What I can and did knock them a star for is the actual taste of some of the food. Though it looks pretty, I found the salad to be more of an afterthought...sad looking lettuce and some carrots, reminiscent of school lunch type of salads. Also the desserts look sinfully good, but they missed the mark on flavor. Of the dessert trio we got (Chocolate filled chocolate cupcake with strawberry icing and a (dry) brown heart on top, a cannoli (tasted old/stale), and a raspberry tart abomination) everything was sub-par flavor wise. And tasted like they had been sitting there for a little too long, way past their peak of freshness.<br><br>Shout out to the staff for holding it down with class. Everyone is extremely attentive and upbeat, and knows their stuff when it comes to food and wine. Just enough attention from the servers to make sure your dinner is going well without feeling like they&#39;re breathing down your neck. Â Even the security guard at the door is awesome and warmly wishes you a good night as you&#39;re leaving.

Oh wait, apparently in LA they do. All joking aside though, maybe they should be a little more discriminatory about who they let in here, or at least who they don&#39;t kick out. I recently went here for dinner and even though we had an amazing time we were seated in the main dining area, in the vicinity of a room that was closed for a private party which sounded like it had about 50 loud and kind of obnoxious drunk people in it. Fair enough, this *is* a winery, but seriously, tone it down a few notches. We all don&#39;t need to hear your conversations...I promise you, you aren&#39;t that interesting. Yet the noise level just got louder and louder, until finally the party left the room. All 6 of them. Yep, 6 people making enough noise in there for basically everyone in the main dining room to hear their yelling and SUPER loud drunk cackling laughter. They must have paid a helluva deposit. Anyway, I don&#39;t fault the winery for this, they aren&#39;t here to baby-sit their patrons.<br><br>Though Los Angeles is a young city compared to some others, there is a lot of history here. This winery is a little piece of that history, owned by the Riboli family since 1917 it&#39;s the oldest operating winery in Los Angeles. The layout and decor are still reminiscent of classic, elegant times. Too bad some of that class couldn&#39;t be transferred to certain clientele, but I digress.<br><br>I have been many times to Maddelena restaurant, and always enjoy the food. Their menu is fresh and seasonal, and visual rather than written down. There is nothing quite like a good seasonal menu, when everything is at it&#39;s peak of freshness and not just thrown on, but beautifully arranged on the plate. All the dishes are prepared and wrapped for examples, and you just choose the one that looks best to you. They give you crusty bread, butter, and a salad and a sign with the name of the entree you chose, which is freshly prepared and brought out to your table.<br><br>The salmon lasagna...definitely the show stopper. I wouldn&#39;t have ever thought that combination would work, and actually thought my dad was weird for ordering that. Until I tried a bite...it&#39;s hands down the best lasagna I&#39;ve ever had. Whoever made the sauce, pasta, and tender chunks of salmon into that masterpiece is a culinary genius. My chicken Marsala was good but paled in comparison to this lasagna, it was amazing. The desserts are touch and go...we got the tiramisu and the dessert trio. Most tiramisu tastes like soggy cake to me so I wasn&#39;t a huge fan, and the dessert trio looked a lot better than it tasted. <br><br>I like the gift shop, but everything besides the wines is a little pricey. That&#39;s pretty typical of any winery though, so I can&#39;t knock them for that. What I can and did knock them a star for is the actual taste of some of the food. Though it looks pretty, I found the salad to be more of an afterthought...sad looking lettuce and some carrots, reminiscent of school lunch type of salads. Also the desserts look sinfully good, but they missed the mark on flavor. Of the dessert trio we got (Chocolate filled chocolate cupcake with strawberry icing and a (dry) brown heart on top, a cannoli (tasted old/stale), and a raspberry tart abomination) everything was sub-par flavor wise. And tasted like they had been sitting there for a little too long, way past their peak of freshness.<br><br>Shout out to the staff for holding it down with class. Everyone is extremely attentive and upbeat, and knows their stuff when it comes to food and wine. Just enough attention from the servers to make sure your dinner is going well without feeling like they&#39;re breathing down your neck. Â Even the security guard at the door is awesome and warmly wishes you a good night as you&#39;re leaving.

Oh wait, apparently in LA they do. All joking aside though, maybe they should be a little more discriminatory about who they let in here, or at least who they don&#39;t kick out. I recently went here for dinner and even though we had an amazing time we were seated in the main dining area, in the vicinity of a room that was closed for a private party which sounded like it had about 50 loud and kind of obnoxious drunk people in it. Fair enough, this *is* a winery, but seriously, tone it down a few notches. We all don&#39;t need to hear your conversations...I promise you, you aren&#39;t that interesting. Yet the noise level just got louder and louder, until finally the party left the room. All 6 of them. Yep, 6 people making enough noise in there for basically everyone in the main dining room to hear their yelling and SUPER loud drunk cackling laughter. They must have paid a helluva deposit. Anyway, I don&#39;t fault the winery for this, they aren&#39;t here to baby-sit their patrons.<br><br>Though Los Angeles is a young city compared to some others, there is a lot of history here. This winery is a little piece of that history, owned by the Riboli family since 1917 it&#39;s the oldest operating winery in Los Angeles. The layout and decor are still reminiscent of classic, elegant times. Too bad some of that class couldn&#39;t be transferred to certain clientele, but I digress.<br><br>I have been many times to Maddelena restaurant, and always enjoy the food. Their menu is fresh and seasonal, and visual rather than written down. There is nothing quite like a good seasonal menu, when everything is at it&#39;s peak of freshness and not just thrown on, but beautifully arranged on the plate. All the dishes are prepared and wrapped for examples, and you just choose the one that looks best to you. They give you crusty bread, butter, and a salad and a sign with the name of the entree you chose, which is freshly prepared and brought out to your table.<br><br>The salmon lasagna...definitely the show stopper. I wouldn&#39;t have ever thought that combination would work, and actually thought my dad was weird for ordering that. Until I tried a bite...it&#39;s hands down the best lasagna I&#39;ve ever had. Whoever made the sauce, pasta, and tender chunks of salmon into that masterpiece is a culinary genius. My chicken Marsala was good but paled in comparison to this lasagna, it was amazing. The desserts are touch and go...we got the tiramisu and the dessert trio. Most tiramisu tastes like soggy cake to me so I wasn&#39;t a huge fan, and the dessert trio looked a lot better than it tasted. <br><br>I like the gift shop, but everything besides the wines is a little pricey. That&#39;s pretty typical of any winery though, so I can&#39;t knock them for that. What I can and did knock them a star for is the actual taste of some of the food. Though it looks pretty, I found the salad to be more of an afterthought...sad looking lettuce and some carrots, reminiscent of school lunch type of salads. Also the desserts look sinfully good, but they missed the mark on flavor. Of the dessert trio we got (Chocolate filled chocolate cupcake with strawberry icing and a (dry) brown heart on top, a cannoli (tasted old/stale), and a raspberry tart abomination) everything was sub-par flavor wise. And tasted like they had been sitting there for a little too long, way past their peak of freshness.<br><br>Shout out to the staff for holding it down with class. Everyone is extremely attentive and upbeat, and knows their stuff when it comes to food and wine. Just enough attention from the servers to make sure your dinner is going well without feeling like they&#39;re breathing down your neck. Â Even the security guard at the door is awesome and warmly wishes you a good night as you&#39;re leaving.

Oh wait, apparently in LA they do. All joking aside though, maybe they should be a little more discriminatory about who they let in here, or at least who they don&#39;t kick out. I recently went here for dinner and even though we had an amazing time we were seated in the main dining area, in the vicinity of a room that was closed for a private party which sounded like it had about 50 loud and kind of obnoxious drunk people in it. Fair enough, this *is* a winery, but seriously, tone it down a few notches. We all don&#39;t need to hear your conversations...I promise you, you aren&#39;t that interesting. Yet the noise level just got louder and louder, until finally the party left the room. All 6 of them. Yep, 6 people making enough noise in there for basically everyone in the main dining room to hear their yelling and SUPER loud drunk cackling laughter. They must have paid a helluva deposit. Anyway, I don&#39;t fault the winery for this, they aren&#39;t here to baby-sit their patrons.<br><br>Though Los Angeles is a young city compared to some others, there is a lot of history here. This winery is a little piece of that history, owned by the Riboli family since 1917 it&#39;s the oldest operating winery in Los Angeles. The layout and decor are still reminiscent of classic, elegant times. Too bad some of that class couldn&#39;t be transferred to certain clientele, but I digress.<br><br>I have been many times to Maddelena restaurant, and always enjoy the food. Their menu is fresh and seasonal, and visual rather than written down. There is nothing quite like a good seasonal menu, when everything is at it&#39;s peak of freshness and not just thrown on, but beautifully arranged on the plate. All the dishes are prepared and wrapped for examples, and you just choose the one that looks best to you. They give you crusty bread, butter, and a salad and a sign with the name of the entree you chose, which is freshly prepared and brought out to your table.<br><br>The salmon lasagna...definitely the show stopper. I wouldn&#39;t have ever thought that combination would work, and actually thought my dad was weird for ordering that. Until I tried a bite...it&#39;s hands down the best lasagna I&#39;ve ever had. Whoever made the sauce, pasta, and tender chunks of salmon into that masterpiece is a culinary genius. My chicken Marsala was good but paled in comparison to this lasagna, it was amazing. The desserts are touch and go...we got the tiramisu and the dessert trio. Most tiramisu tastes like soggy cake to me so I wasn&#39;t a huge fan, and the dessert trio looked a lot better than it tasted. <br><br>I like the gift shop, but everything besides the wines is a little pricey. That&#39;s pretty typical of any winery though, so I can&#39;t knock them for that. What I can and did knock them a star for is the actual taste of some of the food. Though it looks pretty, I found the salad to be more of an afterthought...sad looking lettuce and some carrots, reminiscent of school lunch type of salads. Also the desserts look sinfully good, but they missed the mark on flavor. Of the dessert trio we got (Chocolate filled chocolate cupcake with strawberry icing and a (dry) brown heart on top, a cannoli (tasted old/stale), and a raspberry tart abomination) everything was sub-par flavor wise. And tasted like they had been sitting there for a little too long, way past their peak of freshness.<br><br>Shout out to the staff for holding it down with class. Everyone is extremely attentive and upbeat, and knows their stuff when it comes to food and wine. Just enough attention from the servers to make sure your dinner is going well without feeling like they&#39;re breathing down your neck. Â Even the security guard at the door is awesome and warmly wishes you a good night as you&#39;re leaving.

Here&#39;s the low down:<br><br>Start at the far end with Free Range LA for the best homestyle biscuits you&#39;ll find on the west coast! The biscuits with their homemade honey butter are a Southern Belle&#39;s dream come true! Trust me, y&#39;all, I know me a good biscuit when I see one -- Paula Deen couldn&#39;t do it better herself. <br><br>From there, follow your nose to the stall of freshly baked bread. The cranberry walnut rolls are my favorite!! ($1/each) They are crispy on the outside due to the caramelization from the sweet cranberries (I always buy 4-5 of these rolls and as I eat these babies throughout the week, I&#39;ll toss them into my toaster oven for a minute or two to crisp up again) Prior to this, I had no idea that bread could be so complex with so many different flavors and textures. The crispy skin and crunchy walnuts give it a nice bite, the plump cranberries add a delicate sweet flavor, and the soft moist bread provides reassurance that the rolls were taken out of the oven just that morning. This guy sells his rolls to all the local hotels in town so you know it HAS to be good! <br><br>After you pick up a few items from the bakery, make a pit stop at the tamale stand. Order the pork tamales with the mild verde salsa. ($3/each) Just a warning that the salsa can sometimes be a little salty so you can also ask for it on the side. Another favorite of mine are the pineapple tamales which are sweet, unique and equally as delicious. Regardless of what you decide to order, beware -- Â these tamales are massive so don&#39;t go overboard!<br><br>The last stop is, of course, the fruit stand. I can&#39;t remember the name of my favorite one, but it&#39;s located on the left side closest to La Cienaga and it&#39;s run by a friendly Taiwanese family. They offer a wide array of samples outside their stall ranging from freshly prepared guacamole to sliced apples. You never have to worry here since all their produce is fresh and incredibly sweet.

Oh wait, apparently in LA they do. All joking aside though, maybe they should be a little more discriminatory about who they let in here, or at least who they don&#39;t kick out. I recently went here for dinner and even though we had an amazing time we were seated in the main dining area, in the vicinity of a room that was closed for a private party which sounded like it had about 50 loud and kind of obnoxious drunk people in it. Fair enough, this *is* a winery, but seriously, tone it down a few notches. We all don&#39;t need to hear your conversations...I promise you, you aren&#39;t that interesting. Yet the noise level just got louder and louder, until finally the party left the room. All 6 of them. Yep, 6 people making enough noise in there for basically everyone in the main dining room to hear their yelling and SUPER loud drunk cackling laughter. They must have paid a helluva deposit. Anyway, I don&#39;t fault the winery for this, they aren&#39;t here to baby-sit their patrons.<br><br>Though Los Angeles is a young city compared to some others, there is a lot of history here. This winery is a little piece of that history, owned by the Riboli family since 1917 it&#39;s the oldest operating winery in Los Angeles. The layout and decor are still reminiscent of classic, elegant times. Too bad some of that class couldn&#39;t be transferred to certain clientele, but I digress.<br><br>I have been many times to Maddelena restaurant, and always enjoy the food. Their menu is fresh and seasonal, and visual rather than written down. There is nothing quite like a good seasonal menu, when everything is at it&#39;s peak of freshness and not just thrown on, but beautifully arranged on the plate. All the dishes are prepared and wrapped for examples, and you just choose the one that looks best to you. They give you crusty bread, butter, and a salad and a sign with the name of the entree you chose, which is freshly prepared and brought out to your table.<br><br>The salmon lasagna...definitely the show stopper. I wouldn&#39;t have ever thought that combination would work, and actually thought my dad was weird for ordering that. Until I tried a bite...it&#39;s hands down the best lasagna I&#39;ve ever had. Whoever made the sauce, pasta, and tender chunks of salmon into that masterpiece is a culinary genius. My chicken Marsala was good but paled in comparison to this lasagna, it was amazing. The desserts are touch and go...we got the tiramisu and the dessert trio. Most tiramisu tastes like soggy cake to me so I wasn&#39;t a huge fan, and the dessert trio looked a lot better than it tasted. <br><br>I like the gift shop, but everything besides the wines is a little pricey. That&#39;s pretty typical of any winery though, so I can&#39;t knock them for that. What I can and did knock them a star for is the actual taste of some of the food. Though it looks pretty, I found the salad to be more of an afterthought...sad looking lettuce and some carrots, reminiscent of school lunch type of salads. Also the desserts look sinfully good, but they missed the mark on flavor. Of the dessert trio we got (Chocolate filled chocolate cupcake with strawberry icing and a (dry) brown heart on top, a cannoli (tasted old/stale), and a raspberry tart abomination) everything was sub-par flavor wise. And tasted like they had been sitting there for a little too long, way past their peak of freshness.<br><br>Shout out to the staff for holding it down with class.

Macarons are my favorite dessert ever-and I've been eating them for years. I've been really let down at the macarons everyone raves over at Bottegas, Lette, etc. especially after having had the real deal in Paris at Laduree and Pierre Herme. <br><br>These are right up there with the big French dogs. Seriously amazing-the texture is perfect, with fillings that actually taste like the flavors they say they are (gasp!). They are never dry and crunchy, like some that look pretty but taste like nothing. <br><br>I've had nearly every flavor, and while they are all good, the standouts are the red velvet, lavender blueberry, and fleur de sel. <br><br>Please keep them as a staple item at Whole Foods!!
