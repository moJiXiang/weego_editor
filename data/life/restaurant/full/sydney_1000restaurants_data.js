It&#39;s like Paris Hilton&#39;s bung eye that nobody ever seems to mention) and he knocked it clear out of the ballpark and into I&#39;m-now-the-favourite-son-based-on-that-meal-dom. <br><br>It&#39;s a damn cool fitout, long and warm and kind of steampunky, with chandeliers and smoked steel and exposed fittings and such. They dished out a complimentary Bellini for the old girl for Mum&#39;s Day but she sent it back from a mocktail. Gonna take a lot more than a bellini to knocked her off the wagon. We ordered:<br><br>1. The fish plank ($13.50pp) - wild salmon croquettes with aoli were nice but needed more of a punch and pretty much everything else from the beetroot-cured smoked salmon to the anchovy and mackerel ricotta bruschetta with chilli and caper berry to the mussels and garlic clams to the pecorino with chilli jam was both delicious and faultless. <br><br>2. Truffle tagliatelle with portobello mushrooms - ohhhh, dat truffle. Smear it all over me and call me a taxi, quick. <br><br>3.  Jamie&#39;s famous porchetta - for me, the highlight. A giant slice of perfectly rolled and roast pork, sumptuous stuffing, crispy crackling with salty, chewy fat beneath, oh man this was good, not just good but great. The best, actually. I die. <br><br>4. Lemon meringue pie with candied lime and crushed pistachios and mint leave and butterscotch dusting. Light, tangy, sweet, fresh, more words that mean things but can&#39;t convey to you how well we chose this dessert.<br><br>Ten pounds of win stuffed into a five pound bag.",

Here&#39;s the skinny:<br>- You sign their register (in pencil mind you) <br>- You add the number of peeps that will be joining you to eat <br>- You fall to your knees and send up a giant prayer to every deity you can think of that it&#39;ll be a short wait<br>- You wait for the ultra-mega-hyper waitress to call your name<br><br>Some background: 2 chums and I tried to eat here last Friday and upon spying the line around the corner and halfway down the next street, the three of us chorused a rather loud WTF, before disappearing up the hill to somewhere less great. BOOOO! <br><br>Today, however, was a different day. I was the golden child, and the almighty one&#39;s saw fit to bestow upon me a glorious midday gluttony... For, no sooner had the pencil left the paper, the graphite shavings still trickling like amber autumn leaves to the asphalt, the u-m-h waitress arrived and began bellowing my name Alan Partridge style down the street. Yo, I&#39;m here honey, chill, Winston!<br><br>So, in we sauntered, and we were promptly plied with water from a hipster, so hip, he was square. We ordered in rapid fire and within minutes were being served hot, fresh dishes with appetising appeal. I had the Kao Pad Kra Pao with Pork and the taste was like a sexy San Chow Boy performing a lap-dance on Kung Pao --- and yup kapow tastebuds!<br><br>The 2 waiters must have had hoverboards they were at our table so often, as my water mug never fell below halfway before it was promptly refilled. Now, some people might not like ever present waiters, but this porky pig was insipidly spicy (which I love!) and requires plenty of the aqua.<br><br>Our waiter, who we dubbed The Waterboy after his 5th refill of the aych-two-oh! (p.s. there&#39;s only one h in aych! don&#39;t even get me started!) was courteous, fast, and ensured we had menus promptly and that we were treated like the kings of lunchtime.<br><br>At bang on a tenner this was a complete meal that had my tastebuds singing and soaring and the generous portion distended the dunlop!<br><br>Would absolutely come here again. Tomorrow... But please... no line!",

Entrance is rather enchanting, like there&#39;s a hidden world beyond- and the most certainly is.<br>Not cheap, but well priced for what you get. A bit of pub food gone hipster. For $32 I got 2.5 wonderfully cooked Balmain Bugs, flavoured with butter and herbs and a hint of chilli- not overpowering, just enough to compliment and enhance the bugs.<br>There wasn&#39;t a complaint about the food around the table- fish of the day with scallops, golden beetroot and cucumber balls, steak, salads, chips and the salt and pepper squid.<br><br>Why am I only giving it 4 stars then?<br><br>2. Our booking was for 7 people, not the 5 they had listed<br>3. The downstairs bathrooms were constantly occupied, with a queue<br>4. Once they took our card to pay the bill, it took them more than 15mins to return with it for a signature (and after we went inside and checked on it).<br>5. They stuffed up our order (chicken salad not sandwich), but they did give it to us for free, and the salad was amazing<br><br>My sister has been there dozens of times and says this is the first time she has had any issue with the staff and that they staff are always right on the ball- perhaps it was just &#34;one of those days&#34;.<br>I WILL BE GOING BACK!!",

I came here to end my long day touristing around Sydney. It was perfect. Though it was bustling, we found a corner table right by the brewery edge. The decor fits, and staff are super friendly. I ordered the Old Admiral, the beer comes out of this awesome looking stein. We got a little hungry, and ordered a pizza, sometimes, that is the best combo for beer. <br><br>The atmosphere was great. I could&#39;ve stayed here all night. And, it&#39;s genuine; a pub producing beer on tap served exclusively only at Lord Nelson.",

I thoroughly enjoyed the Tiger Pie and my accompanying ginger beer. The meat and pie crust were not the best, but the mashed peas and potatoes really hit the spot.<br><br>I walked over from the Cathedral via the botanic gardens and thought I got lost a couple times. However, there are maps along the way within the gardens and so I was able to confirm that I was going the right way.  It took me about half an hour to get there.  After my pleasant meal overlooking the water, the employee directed me to a nearby bus stop which took me to Town Hall.  It took another 30 minutes on the bus route to get to closer city attractions, but I got the chance to see more Sydney neighborhoods so I was not bothered.",

Both were fantastic so we were off to a good start!  <br><br>Then, we ordered the kedgeree of quinoa (w smoked ocean trout -- smoked in-house-- egg, cauliflower) and the avocado toast on 5 grain sourdough and they both had really unique flavors and were just plain AMAZING.  <br><br>We&#39;re trying our best to abstain from being boring food eaters and coming back right away but we&#39;ll def drop in at least one more time before we head out :)",

Rich and flavoursome soups, great for slurping up some ramen! <br>4. Super friendly waiters <br>5. Lastly, they open until late (most nights last order&#39;s around 10:30) <br><br>They&#39;re pricey. So check your account balance and try it if you value all those things I just mentioned.",

"reviewcomment":"My boyfriend used to attend QANTM College down the street (and works there now) and brought me here when I was asking for good Thai food. He comes here pretty often for lunch and had fond memories of the location and the food while he was a student and wanted to share it with me.<br><br>This place is absolutely, hands down amazing in pretty much every way. I don&#39;t care if it is crowded, or a hole in the wall (those are the best places though), or loud or whatever.  The food is awesome, the people working here are friendly (they do want to turn the tables, which is understandable for a small place), and I love this place as much as he does.<br><br>I&#39;m a massamun curry fanatic, and the massamun here didn&#39;t not disappoint. I call it Thai pot roast, and this stuff is aromatic, flavorful, and rich. Perfect for a cold winter&#39;s day. The pra ram chicken is also lovely here.<br><br>Spice I Am is hands down the best Thai food I have had in my lifetime, and I have eaten quite a bit of Thai in my nearly 30 years!",

"reviewcomment":"Original Review: I ordered the wagyu brisket sandwich and my partner ordered the fried chicken. The sandwich was quite tasty. A bit heavy on the pickled slaw (had to scrape half of it out) and the horseradish was a tad strong - but overall, a tasty sandwich. The fried chicken on the other hand was really sub standard. Not much more to say really - majorly disappointing. My coffee was ok-ish (skinny flat white), but my partner did not like his at all (macchiato - he tried both the house blend and the ethiopian). We both concluded it was not the best we&#39;ve had (especially for Surry Hills standards) but it was slightly above average. Ambiance and decor was very cool and trendy, service was decent too. I would recommend this place, so that you can tick it off the list (especially after the Tobey Maguire plug), but that&#39;s about it. We may return one day for another breakfast - but will probably grab coffee elsewhere. <br><br>Updated Review: Ok, so we returned to give Reuben Hills another try. Am so glad that we did. I ordered the &#39;dirty chicken&#39; (grilled chicken and slaw on brioche) and my partner order the &#39;broken omlette roll (omlette with bacon jam). Mine was just average. Not bad, not great. My partner&#39;s brekky was amazing - the best breakfast he&#39;s had in a long time he claims. I had a bite. The bacon jam is the standout in this dish. Brilliant. Coffee was the same as last time - good but not fabulous. We&#39;ll certainly be returning regularly to try their other menu options.",

"reviewcomment":"As Casinos go, this is no Vegas kiddos, but if you&#39;re looking for good eats, some high end shops and a go a more than just the pokies, the STAR is your spot.  Parking can be expensive, about 20$ flat, so if you&#39;re staying in the Astral Towers, take the train in. Once you&#39;re there, there&#39;s no need for a car.<br><br>Oh and by the way, make sure to book to Astral Towers directly, they may upgrade you...we were lucky to be upgraded to a king suite! After settling in, if you&#39;re a bit peckish, head down to the food court.  You&#39;ll be pleasantly surprised by the choice and presentation, maybe not so much the value. The STAR is fancy, make no mistake, I paid 10$ for a falafal kebab but it was entirely tasty. And whats more, happily paid my 3$ a scoop for Messina which has the best flavours of icecream. We had Pistachio and Guiada, and Coconut with Mango Salsa and Roasted Figs and Masala which were creamy, full of decadence and delicious flavor. <br><br>These are just a couple of the yummy eats in the food court, and amongst them are some high end rollers like Adriano Zumbo (desserts and cakes) and David Chang&#39;s Momofuku. But if you&#39;re looking for good food with out the fuss of 30 day in advance booking, check out Luke Nguyen&#39;s Fat Noodle inside the casino. You may wait 20 minutes or so, but the tables have a decent turn over and the food is tasty.",

"reviewcomment":"I&#39;ve been here a few times... It&#39;s seriously one of my favorite bars in Sydney, and I&#39;m not a bar person, to be honest. It doesn&#39;t get as crazy busy or too noisy that it&#39;s impossible to talk, and the other patrons don&#39;t get as drunk/sleazy as other bars.<br><br>The last time I went here was last Saturday to celebrate a friend&#39;s birthday. I hadn&#39;t been in a while (over a year), and they&#39;ve had some big changes. Namely, they got rid of their existing kitchen, which served standard bar food to a dumpling bar (!!) I don&#39;t know how I feel about this. I love dumplings, but as bar food...? Though they did have things like fried calamari and chicken wings. But the menu had stuff like cheeseburger gyoza (good), pepper and wagyu gyoza (too salty), and some dessert gyozas (good.) The food is a little pricy for what you get, though they are pretty tasty.<br><br>I like staying inside on the first floor with all the couches -- good for catching up with friends! The dance floor is upstairs, and the DJs are usually pretty good too.",

Make sure you book a table as this place is always packed!<br><br>I haven&#39;t had a bad dish, but my recommendations are that you get a double order of the duck pancakes, the beef and black bean main, the steamed fish with ginger and shallots and that you save room for the fried icecream. <br><br>If you only ended up with the duck pancakes and the fried icecream you&#39;d be doing juuuuuuuust fine as these are both to die for dishes!<br><br>Be prepared for overly attentive servers (seriously, I think they have a stopwatch to come and check on you every three minutes) but an overall fantastic dining experience!",

We had the ricotta hotcakes AND the sweet corn fritters, their signature dishes, which were both divine. The ricotta hotcakes were light and fluffy and came with the most perfect honeycomb butter. The sweetcorn fritters were crisp and delicious... The waitress gave us a recommendation for avocado salsa though (she said that it would go perfectly with the sweetcorn fritters) but I didn&#39;t really like that as much.<br><br>Still, by far the best pancakes I&#39;ve had in Sydney (and anywhere, really).

I&#39;ve tried about 20 different places and there are 4 that have made me a repeat customer. Le Monde would be top of this list. For realz. Coffee is really really good, and consistently so.  In addition to serving up a wonderful cup of java, I like Le Monde &#39;cos:<br><br>- It has a slightly tatty and unassuming exterior (substance over form, yo)<br>- Staff always make me feel like a valued customer in their cafe.<br>- Magazine and newspaper selection is plentiful<br>- Coffee orders get out FAST<br>- Big tables to spread out your paper or accommodate a work meeting <br>- Brunch is a cut above what you&#39;d expect, and pretty affordable.",

They happened to be staying at the hotel, so this restaurant was a convenient choice. The decor is rustic and cozy with muted lighting and rich, dark leather booths. The staff were pleasant, knowledgable, and very helpful. <br><br>Our order consisted of lamb shanks, lamb chops, and two steak sandwiches. My sandwich was tender and very tasty, but a little messy...

It&#39;s been a long time since I was there in the daytime) serve fantastic crepes (banana &amp; chocolate was the best) during the day, along with Little Marionette coffee (one of my favorite blends).<br><br>It&#39;s a small venue, and can easily fill up on the busy nights, and they definitely enforce the limit for number of people allowed inside at once.",

I was not disappointed! The Rocks Cafe is directly across from the MCA(Museum of Contemporary Art). The place is small but  that&#39;s good! Old hardwood floors are always a bonus in my book for decor.  The staff were very friendly and the service was excellent.  I ordered the Spicy Mexican Burger and it was so GOOOOOD!<br>The burger was big and thick with peppers, tomato salsa, jalapenos and cheddar cheese! The burger matched the bun size!  The fries were crunchy and just right! The meal was so good I was singing Desperado on top of the table like Antonio Banderas. (in my mind of course) :)   Overall great food and great service! I will probably hit this place again tomorrow night because I will be out most of the day sightseeing!",

The open plan makes it feel relaxed and comfortable, the big, glass French doors and windows that make up the back wall provide lots of sunlight. You eat looking out to a lush, green garden space. <br>Now the food. Even the flatbread is perfect? The seafood just MELTS in your mouth, the share plates are a great novelty. The vegetables and salads are healthy and flavoursome, a nice addition to any of the mains. The desserts are delicious and rich. The fig tart is sickly sweet but nothing a nice  cup of coffee can&#39;t break up. <br>I will be back again. Service is great too. An upmarket restaurant where the food is great and atmosphere is unpretentious. Love.",

The front shop is set for takeaway, but the queue out front for a table on the back patio is a signal that this is no ordinary Turkish joint. Once you&#39;re seated in back you&#39;ll get a true feel for what this restaurant is all about. <br><br>Tables are set for larger parties but there were a few couples enjoying dinner together. We had a group of 7 and started with the medium sized mixed dip plate, the zucchini fritters, and the chicken Pide. There was more than enough food to get us going, but we needed more bread for the dips. <br><br>Being BYO made it nice and easy to relax while we waited for the next set of mains to arrive. We shared the mixed grill kebabs, chicken kebabs, and grilled lamb kebabs along with a couple other small dishes.  All of the food was well presented and tasted amazing.  We all walked out of there completely stuffed wishing we had room for desert. When the bill came we were blown away and thought they got something wrong. For 7 people to gorge themselves it was only $108 total!<br><br>We will be back!",

There is seriously ALOT of mayo in this burger, not something favourable to someone who doesn&#39;t love mayo all that much. But after a bit of a scrape off, it was perfect!<br><br>I went for the standard beef burger because I was craving pickles! I even asked for extra pickles just in case they were stingy with it - didn&#39;t end up NEEDING it but there was definitely no harm in adding more pickles to your burger. YUMMMMMMM.<br><br>When my husband and I dined here, it was Notorious Big night which meant AWESOME music. Also meant you couldn&#39;t do much speaking because the music was loud but it wasn&#39;t too bad. They had specials on that night and we tried the &#39;Salt and Pepper Prawns with Lime Mayo&#39;.

"reviewcomment":"I think people are being a little harsh on Hard Rock Cafe Sydney. I think if you go there with the expectation that it&#39;s not going to be fine dining, but just overpriced American diner type food served in a touristy type restaurant (in an equally touristy location), you won&#39;t be disappointed. <br><br>The only real difference I noticed with this Hard Rock Cafe and the others I&#39;ve been to is that the one at Darling Harbour is massive. It was a Monday night when we visited and there were at least two large rooms which were curtained off, presumably to be opened at weekends and busier times. There was a live band playing, and the area we were sitting in was full with a mix of groups of locals and smaller tables of tourists. <br><br>The service was fine -  probably wasn&#39;t as good as you&#39;d find in some of the other Hard Rock locations, but that&#39;s because it&#39;s Australia and the waiters aren&#39;t expecting to get the American sized tips their colleagues in other countries receive.",

I&#39;ve also had several of the salads which are lovely and worth trying. <br><br>I wouldn&#39;t rate it as my favourite meal in Sydney by any means, but it&#39;s good food and an awesome option for takeout.

Best of all, the bartender happily chose them for me, after a bit of a chat about what I like/don&#39;t like.<br><br>The Local is great if you like beer, and like to try different beers. The beer they have on tap changes frequently, so there is always something new to try, although by the same measure you can&#39;t necessarily assume they will still have the same great ale you tried the last time you were there.

My friend however, is of Italian lineage and has grown up on it and loves it more than life itself possibly. She is the pasta queen as far as I&#39;m concerned. <br><br>It just so happens we were walking back to our hotel in Potts Point and whilst she was craving good pasta for dinner, we stumbled upon Fratelli Paradiso. Back at the apartment we looked it and and set our sights on it for dinner and drinks later that night. Not realising how popular it was we got there around 8 and found it to be packed. The waiter kindly took our name and number and pointed us in the direction of some nice bars not too far away for a pre-dinner drink, vowing to call us when a table freed up soon. <br><br>Needless to say, the wait was completely worth it. Authentic italian staff, who were very attentive and helpful at explaining the very minimalist menu, and authentic italian faire. I had a pasta dish with mussels that was perfectly portioned and full of flavour. <br>my friend had the scampi with spaghetti and considers it up there amongst the best she has ever had, with plans to marry chef. We were in food heaven, and would rate this as the best meal I&#39;ve had in Sydney to date, and pasta no less!<br><br>In the middle price range, Fratelli&#39;s isn&#39;t something for your average night out, but it&#39;s probably best saved for a special occasion or a romantic date. That being said, if I could, I would eat there a lot. <br><br>Thanks Fratelli for a great night!",

I only finished all the rice because I&#39;d paid for it! The salmon was a tasty flavouring for the rice (remember these are rice bowls, not protein on a bed of rice) and the egg and seaweed add that delectable yumminess that only cholesterol and umami can. As main was only $3.90 I splashed out 90c on a seaweed side salad. Luxury and nice temperature contrast.<br><br>--Side note, the mildly rotund couple infront of me ordered 2 large curries and 2 curries to go, presumably in anticipation of midnight munchies.

"reviewcomment":"We went here to celebrate my new job. Increased cash flow means we can pig out more often and at this place, the pigs were lined up like ducks. We ordered a huge share platter for two. Cost $70 but was well worth it. The crackling on the pork belly was perfectly crisp and salty. The schnitzel tender and well crumbed. The sausages had that mmm, maybe we started life in a tin taste and the pork knuckle, well...<br><br>Obviously they pre-cook these monsters, waiting for the inner city sloshes to roll in after work, demanding to be fed. All we can say is go easy on the heat when keeping the beasts warm in the oven. Ours came out looking super yum but a tad dry to the point of dusty. A dusty pink pig is a sight to behold but not to taste. And the apple sauce and beer &#39;jus&#39; servings were ridiculously small. <br><br>Oh, in the interests of stopping the European Union descending into anarchy, can a humble Irishman like me please beg the proprietors to treat the mash not as the dark underbelly for those tinned sausages but with the love and care that the glorious potato deserves? Whack in some butter, hot milk and chopped onion to show that Germany still loves Ireland.<br><br>I had read that the waiters had that Sydney disease real bad, that is, &#39;aloofitess&#39; but we got the opposite. Lots of attention, friendly smiles and speedy service. Not sure what all the rituals were, like with cow bells, shot glasses on sticks and punters getting it on in the booths. The noise level was pretty high so not really the place to go for a romantic dinner but perhaps a good place to break up.<br><br>&#39;What did you say...?&#39;",

I has a salmon curry while I was there and it&#39;s one of the best fish dishes I have ever had. Amazing flavor and the salmon was cooked SO perfectly. Cannot say enough.<br><br>Had a kingfish sashimi dish as well that was well balanced. Betel leaf was tasty.

"reviewcomment":"Bottom Line - Simple and delicious Italian food. Lovely atmosphere. Reasonable prices.<br><br>I don&#39;t know how we haven&#39;t written about Il Baretto sooner. It&#39;s been one of our favourite neighbourhood dinner spots since we moved here (nearly a year ago!!). With pastas that are exactly the kind of thing you crave when you want good Italian food - we&#39;ve never had anything that didn&#39;t hit the spot. Nothing too fancy - just bowls of simple and delicious food at a very reasonable price.<br><br>Our two favourite dishes are the Beef Lasagna and the Duck Ragu - signature dishes that are always on the menu. And you must get the Panna Cotta for dessert, though the Tiramisu is pretty amazing also. <br><br>Things to note:<br>- Il Baretto is BYO. They don&#39;t serve any alcohol at all so hit up the clock bottle shop just one block up on Crown street before hand. <br>- It is also CASH ONLY. There&#39;s an ATM inside the Carrington just across the street.<br>- It&#39;s also quite small so there is often a wait, but they will take down your number and give you a call when they have a table for you. Go across the street and have a drink at the Carrington while you wait.",

The degustation is very swanky and there is a lot of seafood on it. <br>You can see Mr. Best come out of the Kitchen and do the final preps to your plate. He seems very into his work.<br>You don&#39;t HAVE to play it by their rules if you don&#39;t want to. The name of the game is to not see the menu until after the meal. This means they can serve you their choice of accompanying wines etc.  but if you say you want to choose your own, they wont stop you seeing it, and besides it&#39;s on their webpage anyway. <br>The use of some Aus native ingredients was excellent.  <br>It&#39;s the 4th best restaurant in Sydney. <br>The soundtrack is awesome. Radiohead, The Smiths, The Shins. I have a feeling Mr. Best and I are from the same era. We asked him who&#39;s choice of music it was.. he was proud to say it&#39;s his own. <br>If you are a wine connoisseur their wine list is like a novel, as in.. many pages... <br><br>The bad- Posh. It&#39;s unusual for me to feel the need to conceal my tattoos in public, but at Marque I didn&#39;t think it would go down too well with the other diners.  Then realized it&#39;s really really dark in there, and forgot about it.. I couldn&#39;t even see me, so how would anyone else. Take your phone to the bathroom, because you will need the assistant light app to see where to step. <br><br>When walking in we were announced by the maitre d&#39; by the booking name and she pointed to our table. We were standing in the walk way and were kind of waiting to be ushered over, but she pointed again as if to indicate hurry up and stop clogging the thoroughfare.Hmm.. K. <br>She was also very good at interrupting our conversation to offer us things like bread. She did offer an apology immediately after interrupting, but it was not very sincere. <br>I think she may have been Mr. Best&#39;s other half as we saw them leave together before the night was through.  Maybe someone needs a holiday. <br><br>The ugly - Nothing inside the restaurant is ugly. Except maybe the OCD placement of tables and their decorations. I have a photo from the night in which you can see a row of candles behind my head that are in military precision straight lines. <br>The real ugly was outside. It was a Saturday night and just you try to get a cab on Crown street at 11pm. <br><br>Very very expensive. Save this one for proposing to your other half or a birthday.",

After scanning the menu, we decided to do the Greek sampler (can&#39;t remember what it&#39;s called). <br><br>It was fantastic!  Our dinner started with some warm olives and warm pita bread. Then we got a caviar spread that was actually delicious. I&#39;m not one for fishy tasting things and this spread was really good!<br><br>Then we had my favorite course, the grilled cheese with honey. This was absolutely to die for.  Words can&#39;t even do justice. Just make sure you get it no matter what. <br><br>For the main course we had lamb with a side salad of tomatoes, cucumbers, and feta and roasted potatoes. The salad and potatoes were good but the lamb was FANTASTIC!  I don&#39;t love lamb but I would go back for more at Apollo. <br><br>Lastly we had baklava for desert which I have to admit was my least favorite course. <br><br>Regardless, this meal costs $55 per person, a bargain for Sydney and Potts point!  Highly recommend.",

"reviewcomment":"Went here on a Thursday date night. I enjoyed the corn chips and dips and thought the sliders were so-so. One the night of the week we were there they had a $5 beer of the day, which was pretty good (we are still used to American prices, so that seems reasonable). The atmosphere was fun, and I like that they have boardgames to play while you&#39;re waiting for your food. The most delicious item on the menu we had was dessert - the nutella and banana toastie!<br><br>We will definitely come back - it&#39;s my new local favorite.",

"reviewcomment":"Oh.My.Word. Come hungry, and with several hours to spare, and leave in the perfect food coma, ready for a nap to dream about all of the amazing food you just had.<br><br>I&#39;ve been to 4Fourteen a few times now and haven&#39;t been disappointed yet with any of their dishes. The food is designed to share and for the full experience definitely think about getting the tasting menu- it&#39;s a great reflection of all of the different tastes the restaurant has to offer and that way you don&#39;t have to make any tough decisions.<br><br>If you don&#39;t do the tasting menu, make sure you get the miso smoked salmon and that you try the ham and cheese croquettes. You&#39;ll also want to try the lamb ribs as I&#39;ve never seen meat that falls off the bone that easily and that is so tasty.<br><br>For the main event, I&#39;ve had the roasted lamb shoulder three times now. Each time I&#39;ve gone I&#39;ve thought to myself that I really should try something else, but then I wonder why I should mess with the perfection that is this dish!<br><br>The lamb shoulder comes with mashed potatoes that have been infused with several sticks of butter as well as a nutty quinoa dish, and you&#39;ll want to lick your plate clean, even though at this point with all of the other wonderful dishes (not to mention the killer homemade bread and butter to start with) that you&#39;ve had already.<br><br>And don&#39;t even think about skipping dessert- the white chocolate sandwich with dulce de leche will change your world.<br><br>Wash it all down with a cocktail or two- the Rude Boy is a favourite of mine- and just roll yourself out the door when it&#39;s all said and done.<br><br>Do expect to sit for 3 hours or so if you opt for the tasting menu so make sure you&#39;ve got the time to really savour the experience!",

"reviewcomment":"3.5 stars. This restaurant has a great location in Darling Harbour. It&#39;s large enough for a Karaoke event, a small dinner for 2, and definitely large enough to accommodate our tour group of 40 people. One of the best parts was the free wifi of course! The kiddos were happy to Instagram and text their friends and family from the other side of the world. We had a set menu and were given choices of pizza, fish and chips, or pasta. Obviously I chose pizza topped with fresh tomatoes. The portions were large... I took my leftover pizza home and ate it later as a snack. Our meal came with salads as well. We also had the option of ordering off the set menu. They&#39;re more allergy conscious, which the US needs to catch up on. <br><br>Decor of the restaurant is trendy, dark, upscale, but unpretentious. The servers were patient and friendly with our large group. You definitely pay for location, but the views are pretty sweet.",

"reviewcomment":"First thing you should know, this restaurant is split into two separate dining experiences. The canteen located upstairs serves more conventional Thai food like pad thai etc. but downstairs in the restaurant, called the Dining Room, is where the good stuff is. Needless to say, we ate downstairs.<br><br>The menu itself is pretty comprehensive with dishes for everybody: fish, pork, chicken, vegetarian and many different flavors. Our table of four ordered a smorgasboard. <br>I cannot recommend our first started enough: Miang Betel leaves with prawns, peanuts and toasted coconut. I am a huge fan of betel leaf to begin with but the star of this dish is whatever tamarind peanut sauce accompanies the prawns. It was fantastic but pretty spicy. My mother-in-law went into a sneezing fit after her first bite. Other starters included the salmon green mango salad and the soft shell crab. Both were delicious and something a little different from other Thai places I&#39;ve eaten at.<br><br>For our mains we ordered the green curry with chicken, yellow curry with barramundi, pork belly, and vegetables with rice. I wanted to drink the yellow curry. The fish was cooked perfectly and the flavours were spot on. I think they took the hint that the appetizers were maybe a too spicy for our table because the mains were all very mild and delicious. Perfect to let the aromatic herbs shine in the dish. The green curry was nice too.<br><br>Even though our table was not that into dessert we couldn&#39;t help but order the &#39;son in law&#39;: deep fried coconut ice cream with a tamarind caramel sauce and we loved it. I need to buy coconut ice cream, stat.<br><br>Thoughts on service: The service was at a relaxed pace which gave us plenty of time between courses to talk and enjoy our wine. I think if we hadn&#39;t been seated in the corner the dishes would have come out sooner but it was fine either way.<br><br>Really give this a try if you enjoy Thai food and don&#39;t mind a large bill.",

"reviewcomment":"Dawes point was just voted Sydney&#39;s best suburb for its close proximity to the city but without that hustle and bustle feel and with great waterviews. Ventuno is then lucky to be located within this prime real estate location.<br><br>What makes Dawes Point so popular is always why I like Ventuno. The food is great but it&#39;s really the atmosphere of this restaurant that makes me keep coming back.  I love alfresco dining but so often you&#39;re enjoying your food with a bit of car fumes alongside or a rush of people walking past checking out what you&#39;re eating.  At Ventuno you can enjoy your meal and company with minimal interruption by the surrounds overlooking apartments and boats you probably can&#39;t afford but desperately wish you could.",

"reviewcomment":"Had a great night of karaoke here. <br><br>We had one of the (many) private rooms booked for a 4 hour karaoke sesh on a Saturday night. Now 4 hours is definitely too long for karaoke in my book and things were starting to get a bit messy at the end but the fact that the song selections kept us happily going for this long is a good sign. I&#39;m still a bit miffed about the limited Bruce Springsteen selection and outrageous omission of Mr Big, but really it&#39;s as good as you could hope for.  <br><br>The touchscreen system for queuing up songs is easy to understand and works well. There&#39;s also a second touchscreen for ordering food and drinks. This system worked well and the service was very prompt (which is particularly important for the drinks). The drink selection was good and given that we had a big group we stuck to ordering the 2 or 3 liter towers of beers. These were great value at approx $40 for 3 liters with a few different varieties on offer (Kirrin, Asahi, Tsingtao and some others).<br><br>The food was decent without being anything special, the takoyaki, karage chicken and flavoured edamame were the standouts. My main complaint was the lack of sufficient chopsticks and soy sauce however if I&#39;d actually bothered to ask this probably would have been easily rectified.",

"reviewcomment":"The flying fish - what can I say? This was the best seafood meal I have had in Australia and I must also tell all of you the service was impeccable! <br><br>We had a party of four for lunch and all had a great bottle of red and white - entrees included the oysters - several types available if you are picky where they harvest yours. They were simply perfect. Additionally, we indulged in some sashimi and a fine order of foie gras --- wow!<br><br>For our mains, we all indulged  on the blue eye trevalla with a delicious white curry. The fish was so light and melted like butter. Nothing short of amazing. <br><br>The sides, like the flying fish hand cut fries (potato logs) were perfectly fried with chili salt doused on the top of them. You simply could not eat just one. I caught myself going back a couple of times as they were irresistible. <br><br>Granted, the flying fish will cost you a pretty penny, you will be satisfied that it was worth it!",

Music playing, clean tables, and really attentive/friendly staff. Very willing to work with you/provide extra dish, etc.<br><br>For the food, the sweet and spicy fried chicken was phenomenal. At $18 for a half or $32 for a full, the prices were on-par with other Korean Fried Chicken joints, but the taste here is so much better. Yes, it is more &#34;Korean Fusion&#34; than traditional Korean, but their clientele is more 18-27, so they seem more willing to experiment than wanting strictly traditional items.

"reviewcomment":"Wow.<br><br>So this experience just blew me out of the water. I picked this restaurant because I wanted the view of the opera house across the harbour. I thought it would be very expensive due to the location, despite being in the international ferry terminal. There are standard main meals on the menu, as well as a sharing option - the churrasco.<br><br>Now, because I like a bit of everything, the churrasco, which I assumed would be charcoal grilled meats sliced onto a shared meat platter, was a no-brainer. I. Was. Not. Prepared.<br><br>The waiters take skewers straight from the grill and carry them around the tables of those who ordered this option -woe be to those who chose standard mains and looked on in green eyed jealousy! <br><br>They carve directly onto your plate then return them to the grill to cook for a while longer on a rotisserie. Everybody gets an edge piece! And the food just kept coming and coming and coming. We ate 13 different meat dishes that night, as well as vegetables and grilled pineapple (pineapple with cinnamon was an amazing discovery!) and dessert. It was quite uncomfortable afterwards but so worth it. The highlight was the maple glazed pork neck. But then our highlights usually involve pork of some description.<br><br>I had a cool dry ice infused cocktail in a re-used crystal skull vodka bottle, which was very cool, but sadly a little disappointing. And for dessert, the 2 person creme brulee! Served in a sort of flying-saucer contraption. It was very nearly a 1 person creme brulee as I had to pry it away from Mister to be able to get any. I think he might have run off and married it.<br><br>Don&#39;t bother coming here and ordering off the standard a la carte menu... the churrasco is the way to go.",

"reviewcomment":"This place is definitely one of the highlights of Darling Harbour, amazing steaks on the water with a good option of wines and entrees. I have been here a few times but on this occasion I was here for an important VIP dinner and was very impressed with the response to very specific seating requests. The service was also excellent but was slightly confusing as every waiter seemed to do everything. I&#39;m more a fan when restaurants having a hosting waiter and then helpers. <br><br>On this occasion I had chicken liver parfait which was very nice and filling, followed by perfectly cooked fillet mignon  and very crispy chips. Will definitely be back!",

"reviewcomment":"Of the Glebe Point Road cafe cluster, Clipper remains my favourite. There are three reasons for this. <br>1. The light: it&#39;s not as dark as the old Badde Manors, and although Clipper is small, it always feels airy. <br>2. The smoothies: these are always filled up with fruit, yogurt and ice-cream - they really don&#39;t skimp out on them. <br>3. On weekdays, it&#39;s a good place to sit and read, and the staff are pretty happy for you to hang around doing this (though they may ask if you want another coffee). <br><br>Clipper&#39;s coffee is pretty good too (not exquisite, but pretty satisfying). I like the tall tables with stools, if you&#39;re lucky enough to get one. The staff are quite friendly and the atmosphere is relaxed and not tooooooo trendy. <br><br>Clipper&#39;s baked eggs are filling &amp; tasty (though not really extraordinary creations, if you&#39;re a foodie you may not be that impressed). The salads are filled with proteiny goodness too. <br><br>Prices are fairly moderate. Also, they have a nice little display shelf at the back, which previously held all manner of cactuses, but right now has little ceramic trinkets. Very cute.",

Loved trying the emu and crocodile but as other reviews have said all the meat was dry. Flavour was there and it could&#39;ve been great had the meat not been dry. And worst part was we were the first sitting at 5pm for dinner so if our meat was dry I can&#39;t imagine what may have happened for the rest of the night. Seafood and dessert however were fantastic and we enjoyed that. Views were fantastic and the kids loved the novelty that we were moving as it was their first time in a revolving restaurant. Overall if I didn&#39;t eat seafood or dessert I probably would not have enjoyed it but I do and I did for the most part.",

"reviewcomment":"I really wanted to try Kangaroo while I was visiting Sydney for work, and a bit of Yelping led me to King St Brewhouse. We came around 5:30 on a Sunday (not looking for the senior citizen special, just dealing with jet lag) so I know it was early but I was a bit put off by the few number of patrons. We braved on nonetheless.<br><br>It was difficult to tell what the situation was... Turned out to be a seat-yourself-order-drinks-and-food-at-the-bar kinda thing. Cool, we figured it out.<br><br>I eat a paleo diet now, and that can be difficult, especially while traveling. The craft brews appealed to me, but since paleo means no beer, I went with the draft cider instead. Nothing to write home about, though the name, DirtyGranny, was pretty funny. My friend went with a bottled pear cider, and seemed to enjoy it.<br><br>Now, the &#39;roo... It was to die for! I&#39;ve since heard that it can be tough or gamey, but this was neither. It was perfectly seasoned, which let the unique flavor shine without overwhelming, and the sides rounded it out nicely (broccoli, asparagus, sweet potato mash, and red wine jus). It was also a HUGE portion. My paleo, carnivorous self was in heaven. It was pricey, about $30AUD, but worth it. My friend had the fish and chips - she claimed it was delicious too.<br><br>Don&#39;t let the odd ambience of this place fool you (it reminds me of a horrible dive bar in my college town), the food and drinks make it definitely merit a visit.",

"reviewcomment":"Food only review: EFFING AMAZING. Pub food just cannot get any better than this, and we weren&#39;t even drinking. Wanted to get in on some incredible deals, which were all over the place, but we were too early for the $10 schnitzels which started at 6. So me and my fellow fogey got ourselves an early bird dinner with the gigantic share platter of bbq pork, chips, Korean salad and dinner rolls. The platter was $30 but well worth it, and I walked away thinking we got a better deal than $10 schnitzel even...<br><br>The pork: falls off the bone, bbq sauce not my ideal flavor profile but still really yummy and sweet enough to go with everything else on the plate it slipped onto. The meat itself was tender, barely any fat, clearly cooked lovingly by a pro all day long The Korean salad was the surprise on the plate for me...cabbage, bean sprouts, pineapple, and some raspberry-eque vinaigrette that shouldn&#39;t have tasted right on it all but really went perfectly. The dinner rolls were crispy on the outside and opened with a puff of steam, really soft and ready for butter on the inside. The crinkle cut chips were good with the extra pork bbq sauce, or with some of the sidebar of sauces in bottles nearby, including sweet chili sauce, among others. By the end of it I was so stuffed, I pretty much had to be rolled down Riley Street to get home.<br><br>I will definitely be back, for drinks, for trivia, for $10 schnitzel, for other deals, possibly even to stuff my face with the exact same magnificent platter all over again.",

My top picks are the steak chipotle and the veggo tacos. The veggo comes with beans, mushrooms, capsicums and a side of guacamole. The guac actually resembles real guac and not mashed up avocados like some chains serve you.  You&#39;ll be set with 2-3 tacos, depending how hungry you are. <br><br>Bonus: love that you can grab extra hot sauce at the counter!",

Try the Mariniere (white wine, garlic broth) or Provencale (tomato/vegetable base) for lighter palates, otherwise go for the creamy white wine (top-seller). Mussels are served with chips. <br><br>Service was good, handled our party of 15 without a hitch. Great vibe, nice lighting and decor.

"reviewcomment":"One word: COCKTAILS.<br><br>DD has some of the best damn cocktails I have ever had. BF went to the bar to get cocktails for our table for 4 and returned 20 mins later. When asked about the wait, he explained that all the mixers and juices for the cocktails were made FRESH TO ORDER. How&#39;s that for dedication to mixology and quality? All four of us passed around our drinks to everyone else for taste testing. All were so, so, so good. My fave was mine, some concoction of passionfruit and Frangelico- sounds a bit weird, but I&#39;m telling you it could possibly be THE best cocktail I&#39;ve ever had. <br><br>Cocktails are priced around $18 but you get a big glass filled with only the freshest ingredients. I can see why you&#39;d come here for happy hour- what a bargain for the quality. Vibe is laid back and cool. Food was OK, but who cares when they make the cocktails ever?",

"reviewcomment":"I have extraordinarily high standards for Mexican food since I hail from an area of California with more Mexican restaurants than you can shake a stick at. I usually don&#39;t seek this type of cuisine while I&#39;m traveling. It&#39;s almost always a disappointment and I don&#39;t want to experience an &#34;attempt&#34; at authentic Mexican food.<br><br>Mejico comes pretty close, but not quite. I will preface this review by stating that I love good salsa and also make my own. I am picky about the combination of flavors. The average salsa consumer would probably think the ones served at Mejico are good. My dining partner hails from the Mid West but he also loves Mexican food. We agreed that the Mango Habanero Salsa was very good. The tomatillo salsa that came with our tacos was not. It looked like what green salsa but tasted about as mild as baby food. The Mango Habanero Salsa also was a bit mild. I wish there was an option to make your selection SPICY. I want my lips to have a slight tingle after consuming something with an item like an habanero pepper...The plantain chips that accompanied our starter were beyond the pale. I preferred them to corn chips as they weren&#39;t overloaded with salt or texture. They were an unbelievable for my salsa to lay it&#39;s head. I will definitely copy this food item when I return home and make my last batch of salsa for the year.<br><br>Our pulled pork tacos were delicious, but I thought pulled pork was just that--P U L L E D. These were chunks for pork that looked like they were cut off from a pig. Nothing wrong with that, but I was expecting more of a shredded meat experience. I will reiterate that the tomatillo salsa that came with it was WAY too weak. I know the Aussie&#39;s can handle it.<br><br>Overall the atmosphere was delightful. It&#39;s a little odd to be in a Mexican restaurant and not see any Mexicans but I get that&#39;s a little difficult being on a different continent. It still felt odd to see an entirely Caucasian cooking staff in the kitchen :P.",

"reviewcomment":"Khaosan was a trend setter on Pitt st, where cheap Thai food was aplenty. But with trendy decor, tuktuk at the front, and streetstall style dessert offering, you know this was different.<br><br>The food is just as cheap but the menu is brave, with lots on offer and flavours that satisfy the tastebuds. No white people Asian food here, its sweet spicy sour and salty, just how it should be done.<br>We had the intestines, pad se ew, som tum,chicken satay, stir fry pork belly and crazy chicken. Tip. The chicken wings are individual servings, we chose the crazy chicken which is a plate of wingettes. <br>The som tum with pickled raw crab is a must try but watch the spiciness ;)<br><br>The Thai ice tea is a must have as it will be the only thing that can sooth all that chilli ;)<br><br>The only downside is with such great Thai food, the service was overwhelmed and very slow, and miscommunication on orders can happen easily.",

It&#39;s Chinese haute cuisine at its best, which still manages to have shades of the best of peasant food, and it offers the perfect combination of visual stimulation, olfactory overload and an utter taste sensation.<br><br>The menu is always exquisite and the execution flawless without exception. It&#39;s a small place so don&#39;t plan for a &#39;romantic&#39; night here in the traditional sense. But if you are after a Chinese gourmet journey, this is definitely a spot to add to your list ...",

"reviewcomment":"It&#39;s not bad but its not fantastic.<br><br>I&#39;d really only recommend this place on a Sunday or Monday night where they have an all you can eat special for $25.50 a person. In the all you can eat special you get unlimited chips and bread, mussels on white wine or tomato sauce, grilled platter which includes steak, chicken, ribs and sausage and a fried seafood platter including prawns, fish, squid and calamari.<br><br>The seafood platter was very nice, the prawns were amazingly king prawns and the salt and pepper squid was very flavoursome, the fish is also worth eating the first few times. The grill platter had great ribs however, the steak was much too overdone and the chicken didn&#39;t taste quite right. The mussels are generally quite tasty, however, the sauce at times was a bit watery. The white wine mussels taste best for eating by themselves whilst the tomato sauce mussels are great eaten with the free bread. <br><br>The staff are quite friendly and attentive and are happy to take as many orders for items as you want. The time between ordering and food arrival is also much shorter than expected based on the reviews. Although, you dont really order more than 2 or 3 plates of new items as eventually diminishing marginal utility kicks in and you soon learn that more does not always mean better.<br><br>Worth going with lots of people, havent tried it outside this time as I dont yet have an extensive amount of money to throw around.",

Once you pay you get a receipt with your number and a small plastic bag. Once you receive your chicken you will understand why the plastic bag is needed :P<br><br>The chicken breast is massive! As seen in the picture it was twice the size of my hand. This is so boss!  I also got the sweet potato fries which tasted really sweet, almost like they had sprinkled chocolate on it? How, Why?

I&#39;m a huge fan of different breakfast menus - it gets a bit tired seeing the same menus constantly (I know, FWP). <br><br>I do love the venue, its got a great atmosphere and the US type service of having a hostess take you to the table is always nice.

"reviewcomment":"The service is amazing at Sokyo. The menu can be a bit overwhelming but the overall experience is made so much easier by your waiter designing your menu for you (taking into account your budget and food preferences). <br><br>However this would all be pointless if the food wasn&#39;t any good. We ended up having about 6 or 7 courses and it was excellent with a few dishes standing out above the others. <br><br>The DengakuMan (caramelised miso cod, Japanese salsa, cucumber salad) was amazing with so much flavour packed into the soft, tender fish. Our waitress explained that it is marinated for 3 days. The asparagus tempura and the spicy tuna crispy rice were also excellent.<br><br>The service was so attentive throughout the night, constantly checking in to see how we were enjoying the dishes. It was a great night.",

"reviewcomment":"My returns to this place have not ever been quite as spectacular as the first time I stumbled upon this gem but I still love the place. <br><br>I&#39;d been to hooters for dinner. Outback Sydney. It was for a birthday and we were all wearing Hawaiian shirts, though I&#39;d bought mine from the Bahamas in cringingorange (possible actual colour). Anyway, in the taxi between Hooters and Liverpool St I crossed the threshold between &#39;charming and witty Luke&#39; to &#39;imbalanced swaying swagger and OTT-flashy-hand-gestures Luke&#39;, possibly due to the unhealthy mix of spiced rum and absinth. This was the condition I was in when I discovered Goodgod. And I do believe it was the most appropriate condition to be in.<br><br>Goodgod is an early sixties Acapulco cafe/country club, complete with a shuttered-off DJ booth playing sixties psychedelia and the pervading smell of toasted cheese sandwiches. I was dressed and behaving like a young and alive Hunter S. Thompson in his natural environment, minus the hallucinogens but including the Singapore slings. This was absolute heaven! The air-con was set to &#39;Svalbard, Norway&#39; and the staff were set to &#39;efficient and tolerant&#39;. I&#39;ll never forget my first time. Those Ice cream mountains!

For Australia the prices are rather cheap for a bookstore, there is a wide variety and the books are usually ranging from 7 AUD to as much as 11 AUD per book (this is how much I have paid anyways). I have bought a lot of travel books here used, also language books too, great place for these in particular because they tend to be very overpriced new.  They also have a really cool music room upstairs with a piano and sheet music to buy if thats your interest. <br><br>Their cafe is very cool, and outdoors but still connected in the back to the bookstore building. In general the staff is nice but don&#39;t expect much besides after you paying for your coffee they bring it to a table for you.  They also have empty water pitchers you can take off of one table and also glasses to take for having water at your own table. Also beward bathroom is outside...so as you can imagine creepy crawling friends will be joining you for your after coffee pee break.",

"reviewcomment":"Stumbled upon this place last night as we were wandering down streets of Surry Hills looking for a dinner spot. At first we were told it would be an hour wait but once we said we were willing to sit outside, we were immediately seated. <br><br>Our waiter was as Italian as they come. It&#39;s always impressive when there are actual Italians working in an Italian restaurant. Gives you faith that the food might actually be authentic and delicious.<br><br>It was definitely delicious. We got 3 pizzas- the prosciutto, a pumpkin and goat cheese and something wish sausage and mushroom. I loved the crust, I loved that it wasn&#39;t drowning in oil and heavy cheese. I loved that the pumpkin was thinly sliced and covered most of the pizza rather than having big fat chunks scattered around. I loved that when we asked if we could get buffalo mozzarella instead of regular, the waiter said it was no problem and it wouldn&#39;t be an extra charge. Allowing customers to make changes without charging them is one thing that always makes me give bonus points to any restaurant in Australia. It&#39;s just so rare to find.<br><br>I will say that we had to wait an extremely long time for our pizza. The people next to us who ordered maybe 5 minutes early got their pizza probably 20 minutes earlier than us. Our waiter said there were probably a lot of to go orders but apologised and even offered us free shots of limoncello to make up for it. <br><br>The restaurant inside was REALLY busy and quite noisy. To be honest I think I preferred to sit outside where it was quieter and less crowded.<br><br>If I&#39;m ever in the mood for pizza in surry hills, I&#39;d definitely go back.",

"reviewcomment":"I can confirm the other good reviews of this establishment. Disclaimer: this is my first trip to Sydney as well as my first encounter with Ramen and Udon (Japanese equals sushi up to now).<br><br>The restaurant was easy to find thanks to the review descriptions and photos on Yelp. The lift is old and slow and is called by an alternate button since the main button is missing. Once the lift opens you enter the world&#39;s smallest waiting area. If you arrive after 18:00 it can get real packed. Many patrons see the throng and turn around and go right back down without even leaving the lift!<br><br>We arrived at 18:15 and were seated at 18:30. The service is brisk and the food arrives incredibly quickly.<br><br>The food was awesome both in quantity and quality, especially considering the price. I had a Chicken Karaage starter (only $3!) followed by the Teppan Wagyu Steak (good meat although a bit well done) and a large chunk of my wife&#39;s Chicken Teriyaki Udon (great broth, great chicken). Add a Lychee cocktail and the tab ended up below $25 per person. We were out of there by 19:30 feeling happy and stuffed.<br><br>I strongly recommend Ramen Kan for the whole experience, the snappy service, the great food and the affordability. It&#39;s not the kind of place to sit and stare into your dressed-up date&#39;s eyes, but rather a place were good friends can have a great meal before a night on the town.<br><br>Just arrive before 18:00. And use the fire exit as a shortcut on the way out.",

"reviewcomment":"Excellent Italian cuisine (although my neighbors whispered the owners are Croatian). I had a cotechina sausage (never heard of, but made inhouse and quite good) in green lentils with spinach stew, followed by one of the best pannacotta&#39;s I ever had: pannacotta seems easy but to get it really right takes the hand of a master (and a lot of time: it took a while to come): it was surrounded by a sort of caramelized crumble which was superb. Even the housewine was worth the visit. The owner - or who is this hand clapping madman who wishes everyone a good week - certainly helps the atmosphere, as did the music from Marisa Monte and European jazz.<br><br>I will go back.

"reviewcomment":"Atmosphere is a tricky thing, in cafe&#39;s many things can create or a collection of many things may comprise an atmospere which gives you that feeling of being as comfortable and relaxed as you would at home, providing a place of escape. Sometimes it relates to the location, the decor, the friendliness of staff, the quality of the food and coffee, <br>sometimes it may be a particular experience you associate with the cafe. I think usually it is a combination of several of these qualities.<br><br>Ampersand Café &amp; Bookshop on Oxford Street manages to succeed in creating the rare quality of this relaxing environment (at least for me). The coffee is excellent, but I don&#39;t think that is it, I think it is location and layout in which the cafe opens onto the little side street and the way they have incorporated the books shop approach, with the books in the walls around the coffee shop, with a sense of them overflowing creates a nest like environment, which I enjoy. It is the sort of place where I could sit four hours and relax and read, write or whatever.<br>Not too many places successfully achieve this for me, but Ampersand does it to perfection.",

"reviewcomment":"Good food..tick!<br><br>Great atmosphere... tick!<br><br>Great service. .. tick!<br><br>Came here as part of a group of 17 to celebrate a birthday.  We were able to reserve the lounge area for pre dinner drinks which was a great little area of couches and chairs. There was also a great bar area where you are able to sit and watch the bartenders make their concoctions.<br><br>As we were a large group we had to select the $45 pp set menu. The menu was great with the grilled corn a definite star of the menu. The churros were also delicious and I couldn&#39;t help but smother the churro in the chocolate sauce! Only gripe would be that we could have done with more food!<br><br>There was a great selection of drinks including a large selection of tequila! The sangria however was a bit disappointing as it was a bit weak and on the watery side.<br><br>The service here was faultless- the wait staff was attentive and very accommodating with our large group. Food came out promptly and wait staff were on the ball with taking drinks orders leaving no one dry! They happily helped with my requests for pre dinner drinks and organising the birthday cake. Also there was no cakeage which is a bonus!<br><br>Perfect place for a celebration, for groups, or drinks at the bar and a fun night out!",

Google &#34;Newtown Jugglers,&#34; hehe -- sorry, I had to put that in there) we always end up at Cafe C for a meal. They&#39;ve been nice enough to keep the kitchen open for us at that relatively late hour, so yay.<br><br>First and foremost, their cakes are amazing. I&#39;ve last sampled the chocolate cake it was so moist and chocolate-y. Yum.<br><br>Second, their food is really good. I&#39;ve had a variety of soups and specials and their food has consistently tasted above average for me. Lately they&#39;ve been having $10 specials. I had the $10 rump steak and it was really yummy. I can honestly say it was the best $10 steak I&#39;ve ever had. I think I&#39;ll have it again next week!",

"reviewcomment":"After eating as Yoshii the previous night, I spontaneously decided to get lunch at sushi e the next afternoon. I made reservations, but the restaurant wasn&#39;t too crowded. I&#39;m not sure how crowded it gets for dinners, but you could definitely make last-minute reservations for the lunch scene (at least on weekdays).<br><br>The restaurant&#39;s located on the 4th level of the Establishment Hotel, located in Sydney&#39;s CBD. There are a bunch of sushi bar seats as well as some small, more intimate tables that are located near the windows. There&#39;s a lot of sunlight (almost too much for photography!).<br><br>I was seated near a sushi chef named Jin, and he turned out to be a great guy--as well as a great sushi chef to pair with me. I generally like being able to talk with my chefs a lot when at sushi bars, and he was really friendly! We talked about where he worked in the past, why he&#39;s in Sydney, what he wants to do in the future, and so on. I really should have gotten his card or something... Oh well!<br><br>Notes on the sushi:<br>1. The fish selection is MUCH better than Yoshii&#39;s. I think the fish might be fresher, too.<br>2. There was a lot of fish in proportion to the amount of rice per piece. I personally would have preferred a more balanced proportion, but I can see that some people would like the proportions here. (Most of my friends generally complain about too much rice and rarely complain about too much fish--however, that might be because the former is much more common.)<br>3. The rice was a little grainy. The temperature was fine for the most part, though at times it was slightly cold.<br><br>Overall, I thought the sushi was better here than at Yoshii.<br><br>Sushi:<br><br>1. Madai (snapper) with shiso leaf.<br>2. Hotate (scallop).<br>3. Cuttlefish.<br>4. Bluefin ōtoro (fatty tuna).<br>5. Yellowfin ōtoro (fatty tuna).<br>6. Hamachi (yellowtail) from the United States.<br>7. Tasmanian sake (salmon) with sesame, chives, and lime juice.<br>8. Seared sake (salmon).<br>9. Seared hotate (scallop).<br>10. Katsuo (bonito).<br>11. Uni (sea urchin) from Tasmania.<br>12. Scampi / langoustine (akaza-ebi).<br>13. Spicy maguro (tuna) with tobiko (flying fish roe).<br>14. Kuruzima crab. (That&#39;s just what it sounded like he said, but the spelling is wrong.)<br>15. Seared ocean trout with seared spicy mayo, sea salt, and lemon juice.<br>16. Paradise prawn from New Caledonia.<br>17. Ikura (salmon roe).<br>18. Unagi (freshwater eel).<br>19. Seared uni (sea urchin) from Tasmania.<br>20. Aji (jack mackerel / horse mackerel).<br>21. Prawn tempura with tobiko (flying fish roe) hand roll.<br>22. Sake (salmon) belly.<br>23. Seared sake (salmon) belly.<br>24. Hiramasa (kingfish) belly with spicy daikon radish and chives.<br>25. Dashimaki-style tamago (egg).<br>26. California roll.<br><br>I was still hungry and also told my friend I&#39;d order California rolls because I was craving them, so... here they are hahaha. I love Edomae sushi and all, but I&#39;ll always have a soft spot in my heart for California rolls--just like some of my friends have soft spots in their hearts for McDonald&#39;s!<br><br>Dessert:<br>Vanilla panna cotta with raspberry coulis.<br><br>This was a great end to the meal. It&#39;s not as great of a dessert as tamago is for a sushi dessert; in my opinion, I think tamago&#39;s the perfect way to end a sushi meal. It was silky and soft, and the raspberry coulis added just the right amount of sweetness--the panna cotta itself was good but not too sweet (fortunately).<br><br>Conclusion:<br>This was a really enjoyable meal, and I&#39;m happy Jin was my sushi chef. I think that, if I lived in Sydney, sushi e would be my go-to sushi restaurant, with Jin as my go-to chef! I&#39;ll definitely go back when I&#39;m in Sydney again.<br><br>I gave this a 5-star rating on Yelp because I think it&#39;s a five-star place RELATIVE to the other sushi places in Sydney. (My favorite sushi places in Japan, HK,  and the US are much better, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;d be fair to lower the rating for this restaurant by comparing it to restaurants in other countries...)<br><br>Note: If you want to check out pictures of my meal, check out my blog in my profile!",

"reviewcomment":"Cool funky little bar, just off the main thoroughfare in Oxford St., but it feels like so much further away from that chaos &amp; mayhem. Having had dinner earlier in Phamish (also well worth a trip), we stopped into this converted Laundromatte-come-bar for a cool beer... and it was great!<br>Lovely chilled out vibe &amp; decor (all the original laundry signs are still there), soft lighting &amp; a good indie mix on the sound system.<br>Drink wise, cocktails are there order of the day, and there is also a decent selection of wine plus a rotating craft beer choice. Service with a smile, and definitely somewhere to go if you want to be able to have the chats! More of these types please Sydney!",

"reviewcomment":"I saw the baker in the back literally bashing the life out of the bread dough he was making (with a baseball bat) and that has since absolutely confirmed my love affair with this Patisserie. My stomach told me the eclair I was eating was the best it has ever had, and the coffee is great every time I&#39;ve been here. And the sourdough bread, well, words fail me in describing it. You may have gathered I&#39;m a little something akin to bread obsessed (well I used to be before I got caught up in lo-carb diets etc. Yeuch!) and you would be right. The bread is un-effing-belieavable from this place. amazingly good, and on par with Brasserie Bread, and Sonoma.<br><br>Oh, and I hear the mark of any good patisserie goes down to the nitty-gritty - the simplest yet hardest of all pastries to master - the citron tart. 100% perfect in my book.

"reviewcomment":"Good salsa dancing clubs are hard to come by in Sydney, what with local men&#39;s general lack of rhythm and the scarcity of Latin American types living in the city. <br><br>La Cita is one of the best I&#39;ve found so far. Unlike cheesy themed spots like Vivaz in The Rocks or regular bars that host weekly salsa nights like Establishment and Cruise Bar, this bar felt true to places in Spain and South America - cocktail bars and clubs where partner dancing is a natural part of the evening.<br><br>Free from tacky decorations and massive hen&#39;s night crews, the few times that I&#39;ve been here on Friday and Saturday nights have always had a live band playing. The dance floor takes up a generous portion of the floor space, while the lengthy bar has some communal tables and stools nearby. When the dancing gets too much, you can take to their balcony overlooking Darling Harbour for a break, mojito in hand.",

"reviewcomment":"I&#39;m still in a little bit of shock about how awesome my meal here was. I was expecting it to be good, but this place totally blew away my expectations.<br><br>SERVICE<br>We arrived at around 6:30 PM on a Friday night. Our booking was initially at 6 PM, but we were running late. Fortunately, we were able to move our booking to 30 minutes later -- the place wasn&#39;t busy then, but it started getting really busy around the 7:30 PM mark, and it became downright full.<br><br>The only thing I&#39;d comment is that it&#39;d be best to make a preference for a table. When we got there, we were showed a table in the middle of the restaurant, but there were other really nice tables nearby. Since the place was still empty we asked if we could be moved, but the staff told us that those tables had been booked for a later time.<br><br>The staff was super friendly, recommending food and topping up water and drinks quite efficiently.<br><br>AMBIENCE<br>A little bit dark, but not in a bad way. A great place to spend hours chatting over food and wine (which we did!)<br><br>FOOD<br>We ordered:<br>1. Pan Con Tomate - Toasted ciabatta rubbed with garlic, tomato &amp; sea salt. Drizzled with basil infused Spanish Olive oil - good.<br><br>2. Sardines - this was a special (so couldn&#39;t find the actual name and description on the online menu) - This was nice and garlicky. We matched it with the pan con tomate. :P<br><br>3. Paella - Traditional rice dish containing seafood, chicken &amp; traces of chorizo - good! Sadly we&#39;d ordered this last, so it came when we were already pretty full and couldn&#39;t finish it. We got a single serve to share since we&#39;d ordered a lot of other dishes, and I was impressed by the amount of stuff on it. Some places that sell paella have tons of rice and just a few pieces of meat or seafood. This was the opposite. Best paella I&#39;ve had in Sydney so far.<br><br>4. Patatas El Bulli - Deep fried chat potatoes served with emulsion of fritas &amp; bravas dressing - yum! We wanted a spicier patatas bravas, and the waiter recommended this<br><br>5. Gnocci con Picos Azul - Homemade crispy gnocci in a serrano ham, blue vein cheese &amp; white wine cream sauce - this was the runaway winner of the night! We ended up ordering two plates of this. Even if you don&#39;t like gnocci, order this. It&#39;s a bit rich though, and after the second plate I think my tastebuds were wee bit too saturated, but it was really good.<br><br>- Chorizo a la Cidra - Crispy panfried chorizo &amp; Spanish onion in a cider glaze - good. I was initially wary about the &#34;a la cidra&#34; bit. For some reason I thought that would make the chorizo sweet? But these didn&#39;t come out sweet at all, they tasted pretty much like good ol&#39; chorizo.<br><br>- Churros - Donut fingers rolled in cinnamon sugar, with dulce de leche (caramel), whipped cream &amp; fresh strawberries - this was good, though a little unusual. Unlike typical churros which are quite skinny and served with chocolate, these were a bit fatter and served with dulce de leche. According to the waiter, it was because the owner was Argentinian and this was his twist to the dish. The churros being thicker, they were a bit doughy inside, and this texture might be a turn off for some people. The combination of the dulce de leche with the whipped cream was awesome, though.<br><br>I&#39;d rate the food from a 4.5 to a 5. Great service, great ambience. A little pricier than some of the restaurants along the Spanish Quarter but well worth the price point and trek out to Surry Hills.",

The drinking is good - loads of dark, obscure, monk-brewed drops - but I come here for the mussels. They&#39;re astonishingly tasty. Enormous pots of red curry flavour, or Provencale, or white wine, chili and coconut, or blue cheese, or . . . look, just get some mussels up ya, okay? They&#39;re eighteen kinds of awesome. <br><br>Clutches of bright-eyed mid-twenty-somethings prop up the tables on lazy weekend afternoons, and there are always a couple of attractive girls in floral summer dresses nursing raspberry beers for a reason I don&#39;t understand but don&#39;t feel like questioning.",

The food just kept coming!<br><br>If you want to go here on a Friday or Saturday night make sure you book in advance.

"reviewcomment":"Lovely atmosphere. Nice blend of friendly staff, great food and very comfortable layout. Seating ranges from informal high bar stools, more formal inside table seating and more relaxed lounge style tables in a shaded outdoor setting. Perfect for long summer lunches. <br>Food is a small range of well thought meals.  Good light and tasty salads to accompany everything from gourmet steak sandwiches to larger meals like pasta or spatchcock. Nice range of beers and wine to accompany any choice. 2 of us ate and drank for a long lunch for $100.<br>Staff were attentive and friendly.  Of the bars in North Sydney this the pick for food and atmosphere for a get together.",

"reviewcomment":"Ah, Cafe Giulia, the heart of Chippendale. Things may have changed a lot over the past few years, industrial has turned residential, other cafes have moved in, but this local institution remains as consistently excellent as ever. There&#39;s always a brilliant breakfast bagel to be had -- I recommend the haloumi with avocado and mushroom ($10.50-ish), eaten with your hands -- and Sydney perennial, the breakfast roll, finished with house-made tomato relish ($7.90-ish). <br><br>Those with a sweet tooth should try the Belgian waffles, served with rhubarb, ricotta, and a whole bottle of maple syrup ($16.90), if eaten correctly, manage to toe the line between rounded meal and sweetness overdose. Juices, burgers, big breakfasts and pastas, they&#39;re all recommended. I&#39;m yet to have a dud meal.  <br><br>The staff has remained as unchanged as the menu. This seems to have been a problem for other reviewers, but I&#39;ve never found them to be unpleasant. Brief, yes, but when you&#39;re being consistently slammed as they are, it&#39;s not hard to understand why.",

"reviewcomment":"What a surprise to find such a great restaurant in a shopping centre. It was a popular night too with our booking we were able to miss the lineup waiting for a casual booking. The ambiance I buzzy and it is a seating plan that is tight so be aware of the closeness of the tables not a problem for our family outing. A very good waiter and quick service for drinks and food. Nice to be able to taste the wine before selection of the bottle too. I have had my favourite dish Massaman Curry in a lot of  towns including Bangkok and this was the best yet for me so good I went to the Haymarket branch as well!!What a treat it was and with the rice glorious. I loved this venue such a great place bigger than Haymarket and and a Sydney delight.",

We wanted to book the main dining room where the live music is but the upstairs terrace was only available. Fortunately this was a blessing as the main dining room seemed a bit crammed and it was only a guitar player and a piano, but upstairs had loads of room and was a much nicer setting. <br><br>The food presentation was wonderful and everything was very tasty. We shared some entrées; ahi tuna guacamole, shrimp cocktails and seaweed salad...all delicious. All of the various sushi roles were delicious with a good variety. Full bar upstairs meant we didn&#39;t have to wait long for out drinks, and the service from all the friendly staff was great.

We had &#34;jamon&#34; in all varieties (Espanol for ham, mate). I had a mushroom tart topped with jamon &amp; truffle oil... I mean, it was sex on a plate. I also had the scallops with morcilla...  this was me being open-minded about morcilla (morcilla is blood sausage). I can say I don&#39;t like morcilla. It just tastes like plain, gross animal fat to me. But honestly, the scallops were exquisite in taste and presentation. <br><br>My friends got this epic potato dish I was super jealous of, I had a bite and I am definitely getting one to myself next time and also the witlof dish, which was different and interesting, but really really good (witlof, blue cheese and roasted hazelnuts).<br><br>THEN THERE WAS DESSERT!<br><br>We got 3 and shared. The chocolate terrine with salt and olive oil (dense and rich, but perfection), the dulce de leche tart and the prune and brandy cheesecake.... seriously all luscious and delicious.<br><br>Hands down my favourite tapas experience, ever.

"reviewcomment":"I&#39;ve enjoyed myself at Kazbah every time. I can&#39;t say I&#39;m a regular visitor, but over the years, I&#39;d probably visit twice or three times a year, sometimes to catch up with friends and other times for work functions.<br><br>I must say that I&#39;m never disappointed. No wonder they manage to start with just one restaurant and expand.<br><br>I&#39;ve visited Kazbah for brunch before but unlike other times, this time I was part of a breakfast banquet rather than order a la carte. I didn&#39;t know what to expect - forgive my ignorance - as I have no knowledge of what North Africans would have for breakfast.<br><br>Most of the items were a lot of grains - muesli, cous cous and other grains. I think of most note is the sweet cous cous - I&#39;ve never imagined cous cous being anything other than savoury, and even though it wasn&#39;t like a &#34;wow this is how I&#39;ll have them from now on&#34;, it still brightened my day (and it was already pretty bright given I&#39;ve finally managed to get back into regular sport through dragon boat paddling) with a fresh idea.<br><br>The breakfast tagine is something I&#39;ve enjoyed every time, and am glad that it was part of the banquet. It can be a little spicy if you&#39;re not the spicy type. Interestingly, I had the same tagine in their Balmain shop a few years ago and it was different... less spicy and entirely delicious. This one&#39;s still delicious but could be a little less spicy.<br><br>They also put on a sausage, bacon and haloumi platter (maybe to please the Australians/us) - I didn&#39;t go there for bacon, so I just focussed on gorging on the haloumi.<br><br>Rounding off the banquet were these massive pancakes (photos to be posted)... they were really delicious, but we were full already! Somehow we managed to finish them too.<br><br>So, my conclusion is, for $30, you get both quality and size... well worth it everyone!",

I highly recommend the jelly G+T and the Abbies Fruit...I also suggest just sitting closer to the bar to watch these guys in action...this is art afterall (and bears the price tag to prove it!).

Located in Newtown, Clem&#39;s isn&#39;t fancy by any means, but their food is legit.<br><br>I have yet to try their charcoal chicken, but their fried chicken is amaze balls. Perfect seasoning and fried to perfection. The skin is crispy and delicious with the meat being juicy and tender. Great chips as well with that damn addictive chicken salt. Australia you have made chips crack with that seasoning. The sides are all pretty good and there are lots to choose from...veggies to yummy casseroles. <br><br>It&#39;s worth the trip to Newtown alone and the prices are more than fair for what you get.",

I&#39;ve been here twice -- once for a banquet maybe 2 years ago, and another time a couple of weeks ago.<br><br>I don&#39;t remember much of the banquet except for a few things:<br>1. it was yummy<br>2. they had these adorable clam-shaped buns to go with the duck<br>3. we were supremely stuffed<br><br>If you can gather a group of at least 6 people, the banquet menu is a great deal. Options range from $25.90 to $39.90 (we got the Gold one that time.)<br><br>My latest visit was over the Easter break. They&#39;re open on public holidays (yay!!) so we dropped by here for dinner. We ordered:<br>- pan fried pork buns (I&#39;m so addicted to these, it&#39;s not funny any more)<br>- soft shelled crab - this was amazing. They were a lot bigger than the usual soft shelled crabs we&#39;d gotten before, and the breading was great. I loved biting into these<br>- fried rice - good<br>- seafood stir fried with rice cakes - this was good but... BUT! The bad thing about this dish was that the seafood to rice cake ratio was a little off. Too many rice cakes, not enough seafood<br><br>Overall, food would be a 4 out of 5 stars (maybe the soft shelled crab and pork buns would be a 5.) Service was a wee bit slow, probably owing to the fact that it was a public holiday and most of their staff would&#39;ve been on break.",

"reviewcomment":"Full disclosure: my two friends work here, one as a manager. So I&#39;m a tad biased perhaps. But being a &#39;Murcan I&#39;m also a Mexican food snob and their lamb burritos are the best burritos I&#39;ve had in Sydney by a long shot. <br><br>The lamb is slow cooked, tender, has hints of oregano (not really Mexican, but tasty) and layered onto a flour tortilla which has been warmed on a griddle, topped with the typical guac (which I thought was pretty good), and all the other usual burrito suspects, including a good range of different salsas. The burrito is assembled and wrapped up nicely, lending itself to minimal spillage upon consumption. But the best part for me is the end bit, where you&#39;re asked which type of SAUCE you&#39;d like drizzled all over your meat, beans, guac, rice, cheese and veg. <br><br>I LOVE THAT. <br><br>Any opportunity to add more sauces to my life is an automatic win. There are 6 kinds- BBQ, creamy chipotle, garlic and herb, chilli, verde, and basilo (again, totally not Mexican, but yum.) Who was the genius who said, &#34;You know what burritos need? A creamy sauce on top!&#34; Because, really, they do. <br><br>The best part? You can get ALL the sauces you want- yup, all 6- for the same price, resulting in an amalgamation of Mexican-y burrito-y goodness, oozing with loads of different and tasty sauces. <br><br>I&#39;ve tried their &#34;chips and dip&#34; and it was nothing special. Stick with the burritos, and go to town on the sauces. You won&#39;t be disappointed. <br><br>It&#39;s still fast-food-esque, cheap and cheerful, but it sure beats spending upwards of $25 in most of Sydney&#39;s Mexican establishments on a burrito of lesser quality. Hooray for Zambreros!",

"reviewcomment":"I love the thin crust pizzas... Which are even better value during the 5-7pm happy hour ($7 down from $15) - you can&#39;t get a better pizza in Sydney for $7. And, that&#39;s not all, The Comedy Lounge on Monday nights (weekly), Nerd Nights on Wednesdays (monthly), and free music nights on other weeks make it one of the best places to hangout in the hippest suburb in Sydney. The pizzas, comedy/nerd nights, music and decor really make it a very unique stand-out place in Sydney. Highly recommended!",

"reviewcomment":"We were in Sydney for only one night this past weekend and good old Yelp pointed us in the direction of Lumiere for a breakfast treat. It was a Sunday morning and it was relatively busy inside, which was fine with us as it was also quite stuffy in there and the tables outside made for some perfect people-watching.<br><br>As soon as we sat down we were greeted by a friendly waiter bearing water and taking our coffee order. As we perused the menu our coffees promptly arrived, and I dove into mine. It was good! <br><br>For breakfast my wife ordered the muesli, which looked great...but I can have muesli  at home any day, so I ordered the Brioche French Toast with maple syrup, banana and bacon...wow! My towering breakfast came out in no time, swimming in syrup with a ridiculous amount of bacon on top. Wait..that&#39;s impossible, you can never have too much bacon. The french toast was quite amazing. The bread was soft and the bacon crispy and it all went together incredibly well. If we&#39;re back in the Surry Hills area again any time soon we&#39;ll definitely head back here for brekkie. Yum!<br><br>Aw man...now I want some bacon.",

"reviewcomment":"I&#39;d heard so much about Zanzibar from Newtown regulars, so upon finding myself in the vicinity, I had to give it a try.<br><br>I went in at about 430pm, when it was, understandably, very quiet. Which is fine, I don&#39;t quite yearn for noise at 430 in the afternoon anyway.<br><br>I took advantage of the relative calm and went exploring! There are three levels to Zanzibar; <br><br>On the ground level, there&#39;s a bar, some tables seating up to 6, and a pool table. A pool table is what makes a bar complete, in my books. <br><br>On the second level, there is (also) a bar, and some rather more comfortable looking seating arrangements. Some red plush mini-sofas, if you will! Looked quite a bit more inviting than the hard-backed wooden chairs downstairs.<br><br>The third level features a rooftop beer garden, which I didn&#39;t get to explore to my heart&#39;s content because on that particular day, it was all booked out, but it looked nothing short of lovely. I can imagine spending a delightful evening up there. <br><br>They also feature $8 cocktails. I had the Fruit Tingle.. and no matter how drunk it made me (very), I wouldn&#39;t recommend. It did not taste nice, fruity, or tingly, in any way, shape, or form. Now I realise people just concoct cocktail names out of thin air... but they should really stop that. <br><br>They had some other cocktails which sounded nothing short of delicious, so try one of them instead!",

"reviewcomment":"I first came to this place with a friend and although that friendship has been and gone this cafe hasn&#39;t! I fell in love with it instantly because of the great selection of music they play softly in the background, stuff like The Beatles, Radiohead, other classics and some new stuff like Beach House. <br>The coffee here is great too, strong hard hitting stuff. I usually just order a flat white but when I&#39;m feeling fancy I get the affogato - so delicious! I&#39;ve also tried a mint and pineapple frappe and it was so yummy and their other ones are too. On the few occasions I&#39;ve ordered food it was very good, though a tad overpriced. <br>The decor is low key and dark so it&#39;s good if you want some privacy to study, with your laptop or without since they have free WiFi that you just ask the password along with your food/drink order. Very friendly service and they don&#39;t judge you for prolonged studying or WiFi usage - something I appreciate a lot and have taken advantage of. There&#39;s an upstairs patio that is quieter, has better lighting and which immediately head for when I come here.<br>Hot tip! If you&#39;re a Sydney uni student they offer Access discounts for transactions over $10!",

In fact, we came back again a few days later. <br><br>The iced chai is extraordinary. Perhaps it&#39;s because it&#39;s made with ice cream, but it&#39;s served iced cold and is so refreshing.

"reviewcomment":"What an experience! We got a table right at the front overlooking King Street Wharf and we were looked after superbly by the wait staff from start to finish. You can tell the level of service matches the extraordinarily pricey meals. We were really lucky to be given a rather generous gift certificate so we indulged on a set menu for 2 with accompanying wines.<br>Amazing food and wine! The only let down was the dessert, I think it was Green Tea Creme Brule (can&#39;t be sure, we drank a lot of wine!) <br>Definitely the type of place for a superfancy meal with a special friend or lover.<br>Also, look out for those groupon vouchers if the menu is way out of your price range, but watch out they will get you on their drink prices.",

"reviewcomment":"This place was packed when we walked in just after midday, and I guess that should tell you something about the quality of food on this highly competitive food strip which has been my (and yeah your&#39;s as well, right??) go-to for good-food for years. Citrus Cafe appears to run on a ferocious energy, by a skeleton staff of highly motivated, switched on workers. The thing with this great cafe was the service, and it was outstandingly good.<br><br>We were greeted upon entrance and ushered immediately without pretence to a nearby (one of only two left) table/booth with high backed cushiony, luxurious chairs. A few moments to consider a generous menu and our orders were again taken, which including some breakfast staples. I had the eggs benedict (yum!) and my partner had scrambled eggs on toast, and coffee for both of us. The coffee was almost instantaneous! - hot (but not burnt) and masterfully made. Not long after we were tucking into simple, well made and typical &#34;breakfast&#34; fare that was just as you would expect, with lusciously large toast amongst a generous helping of scrambled eggs, and thin slices of ham weighted down by a perfectly poached egg, all perched atop a muffin. The salad garnish was unnecessary, but I imagine the two halves of Eggs Benedict would have looked sparse on such a huge serving plate.<br><br>Claims that Citrus can metamorphose into a bar and/or a restaurant are easily believable with the modern and stylish (but typical and a bit of a yawn) decor, however I guess for the time being I&#39;ll leave others to evaluate them on that score.<br><br>Finally, paying the bill was great! Cheap, a quick conversation prompted from being asked &#34;Was everything up to standard?&#34; and a smile at my response.... and ending with &#34;thanks very much, we&#39;ll see you again&#34; . Gotta be happy with the really top notch service of this place.<br><br>Well done Citrus",

"reviewcomment":"A lot of these reviews seem to be first impressions.  I&#39;m a big fan of The Townie, and perhaps it says something about the friends I keep,  but I actually feel the most at home at this pub out of the many that I frequent in Sydney&#39;s Inner West.<br>For a girl covered in Tattoos who likes to dress like a Country and Western starlet, I would never feel alienated, self conscious or worried about Hipsters or scene kids invading this space and passing judgement with their Brosies.  It&#39;s an alternative people safe zone. <br><br>The Townie has seen a few changes since I started frequenting it back in 2005. It has had it&#39;s out door smokers area refurbished, and an upper smokers deck added off to the side of the Restaurant. <br><br>The restaurant is still, I believe run by the same owner and the food is fairly standard pub fair, and I believe they do a Sunday roast. I love the Vego burrito and it goes down a treat after eleventy beers while participating in Thursday night music trivia with &#34;The Cheif&#34;....  Music Trivia! We fancied ourselves as pretty au fait with the music world. How wrong we often are!  When faced with teams with names like &#34; A flock of C words&#34; ( those guys are guns at trivia) you can rest assured your behind is swiftly kicked.  It is, as it modestly claims to be &#34; The best trivia....... in Newtown&#34;<br><br>But it&#39;s the venue itself that continues to seduce me back into it&#39;s sticky arms.<br>With the ever growing list of obituaries for pubs with live music, I am happy that the Townie has managed to hang on. That doesn&#39;t mean the bands are always good, or that the sound is very good either, but sticky carpet and swinging  fists make for that quintessential  Rock pub experience that seems to be dying away. <br><br>And despite some comments here, I have actually found the Townie one of the harder pubs to get into depending on the time of evening the bouncers get pretty strict, the later it gets.  And yes it&#39;s true, I have been ejected from the premises once, I promise you it was just a joke though. ... promise!",

Served in a metal wok, a la all hipster cafes circa 2012, the baked egg literally put a smile on my face. I took it with the mixed juice featuring passionfruit and a small flat white. The perfect combination for a Bourbon brunch.<br><br>I never dreamed that I&#39;d one day be eating brunch at The Bourbon, once a club on the KX strip. I&#39;d spent the odd night bustin&#39; a poorly thought out move there, but now a live smooth musician isn&#39;t even a little out of place in this new groovy cocktail bar and eatery.<br><br>The service needs polishing. Staff are distracted in a nearly empty cafe, standing in hidden corners and staring off into the early morning gloom.<br><br>The bill figuratively stopped my heart. Eating for one is expensive, I wouldn&#39;t recommend trying to feed 3 kids and a puppy on your easy Sunday morning. <br><br>The menu is also extremely boutique(read: limited), and not necessarily child appropriate. <br><br>Definitely not the place to go for a greasy big breakfast and a coke, but the food packs a punch.",

"reviewcomment":"From the outset, we were behind the 8 ball. We turned up on a Tuesday night expecting we could walk in and snare a table. Alas, Rice Paper is a little more popular than that. <br><br>This, dear reader, is where the skill of customer service enters the scene, stage left. The Rice Paper staff couldn&#39;t accommodate us then and there, but probably could in around 20 minutes and they would call us when ready. As a group of 5 we said ok and headed off for a beer. True to their word they called us when a table was available and we walked straight in. <br><br>Let&#39;s get to the crux of it. The food. Wonderful. Just like in Vietnam the food is fresh, succulent and dances around the palette like Natalie Portman wished she could have in Black Swan. Sorry, I digress. <br><br>If you want conversation on a busy night, this isn&#39;t the place. There is no sound dampening so even soft conversation for each table mounts to a deafening crescendo fairly rapidly. They would be wise to look into this. <br><br>It&#39;s not, however, a deal breaker. The excellent food and the wonderful staff make the place.",

The menu isn&#39;t really super expensive nor is it inaccessible...it&#39;s rather home style Italian across a wide range of things.  Portions are nicely sized so you can get a bit of this and that.  <br><br>So, for me, this all adds up to a lovely spot to show up, wait a bit for a table, and have a lovely Italian meal in an unpretentious environment; this place has no analog in San Francisco...that&#39;s my only regret here; it&#39;s a bit far for me to hop over for another dinner.",

The coffee is great (can&#39;t recall the beans they use), and the food is even better.<br><br>The big breakfast is the most expensive I&#39;ve had ($25!) but it could easily be shared between two (or three) people, so the value for money is there; It came with a big pile of bacon, a whole (fried) tomato, a couple of (delicious) breakfast sausages, a (huge) hash brown, toast, bread, and some eggs. I&#39;ll be getting it again.<br><br>I couldn&#39;t eat anything else after all that, but cakes they had on display had me sorely tempted (cue restaurant scene from Monty Python&#39;s The Meaning of Life).",

I didn&#39;t realize that steak in the US was so good but after a year in Australia I finally understand I had a great thing going. It is definitely pricey, but the service is actually the best I&#39;ve seen in Australia, and the mix drinks are without equal. There is a steak sampler for $56, do not pass this up. It is the perfect example of what steak is like on a low medium and high-end. Unfortunately the low and at this restaurant is better than most restaurants high-end in Australia. <br><br>Call to make a reservation, show up early and head to the bar for a great drink, and get the cherry dessert to finish off the night. Quite a wine selection as well but again pretty expensive.",

"reviewcomment":"Stopped here for a quick late lunch.  Surprised to have found this place because it&#39;s so tiny (as everyone else has seemed to mention).<br><br>FOOD<br>Given practically everyone that worked there was Asian I opted for the Asian burger.  Teriyaki Chicken Burger with Wasabi Mayo, Pineapple and Pickled Ginger. ($10.50)<br><br>When eating Teriyaki Chicken you don&#39;t normally put wasabi/mayo/wasabi mayo on it.  Well I don&#39;t anyway.  Wasabi and pickled ginger are usually reserved for sushi not teriyaki.  On this occasion it seemed to work though!  Pineapple was a bit iffy though.  Not very Japanese like.<br><br>Good serving of Peri-Peri sauce with my small chips ($3).  Nice and spicy.  Some of the chips unfortunately spent a little too long in the deep fryer for my liking.  I&#39;m picky with chips.  These were unfortunately not the perfect balance of crispy on the outside soft on the inside.<br><br>OVERALL<br>Decent burger place.  Was debating between a 3/4 star during my meal.  Last minute save by the delivery boy.  As I left I saw him hop on one of their awesomely decorated delivery bikes.  <a href='http://www.yelp.com.au/biz_photos/7Dp_kuCO295Neo2oRxjuoA?select=ta7XzREoxqKSIsror7Q5Gw#ta7XzREoxqKSIsror7Q5Gw'>yelp.com.au/biz_photos/7…</a>  Love the environmentally friendly nature of the delivery.  Well done!",

"reviewcomment":"Wandering along Kirribilli trying to decide where to eat is a regular past-time of old, and I was pleasantly surprised to see a new (to me) arrival, Batch Burgers.<br><br>In literally a hole in the wall, this little counter-serve type spot does a range of burgers, sandwiches and such accompanied by coffee and beers.<br><br>It follows the current retro trend with all the gang fitted out to match the &#34;boiger joint&#34; feel, and chips served in a trendy little wire basket, boigers on a board.<br><br>Sitting watching them cook was a mixed blessing - open kitchens are good when the processes going on are all something we want to see - watching our pulled pork get dug out of a plastic container and dropped on the hotplate was a little unappetising, and their storage facilities seem inappropriate for an open kitchen, I thought. Maybe it&#39;s just me...<br><br>Anyhow, in due course a couple of pulled pork rolls were produced - with a bit of slaw in the bottom, and in a pretty standard, although fresh, torpedo roll, and some nice crunchy fries.<br><br>Nothing wrong with anything here, wished I had a boiger though in hindsight - perhaps next time. I do think that compared to say Grill&#39;d or Burgers and Ribs, they are a little off the game, although Grill&#39;d can be very patchy depending on the one you go to.<br><br>Worth a try.",

Honestly, the best take away salad ever - it makes Sumo Salad look like Maccas! It also came with half a slice of sourdough, which was a nice touch.<br><br>I&#39;ll definitely become a regular here, because they have the ingredients that I love, and it&#39;s amazingly fresh and delicious.",

I ordered a soup on one of my low carb kicks and asked for no noodles, just extra veges if you don&#39;t mind. Never a problem anywhere at the million Asian places I&#39;ve asked for the same substitution at before and after. I probably even had it at Happy Chef a time or two before! But no, no... that day, I found the Asian Soup Nazi who was insisting on charging me $2 extra, lol. I was like, piss off, I&#39;m not having a soup here then. <br><br>And I stayed away for YEARS!!! :)<br><br>If I&#39;m honest, they make good food here. Someone else described the decor as a little hospital-like. Yes, its white and sparse and dreary. No frills. It&#39;s not a place you sit and hang out. You have a cheap meal and then go about your business on  King Street. <br><br>The wontons are a little flavourless, to nitpick. But pretty much anything you order will be good. The seafood here is always super fresh, plentiful and you get big, fresh, plentiful prawns in your soup... I have to give them kudos for that (are you listening Gazebo, bloody wankers).",

This is true soul food, and you can taste every bite of an Iku meal regenerating cells killed by booze and nachos and restoring an overall sense of well-being. Yes I realise how wanky that sounds but I don&#39;t care, it&#39;s true! <br><br>Iku is macrobiotic has always used only organic and where possible, local and seasonal ingredients, and if you like your food fresh, wholesome and nutritious you don&#39;t need to look much further. Another thing I appreciate here is that Iku always used to seem quite expensive to me as a struggling student, but as the kind of ingredients they use have become more readily available the prices haven&#39;t changed that much over the years, meaning that you can spend under ten bucks and get a decent meal.",

And that&#39;s not just because Newtown is completely lacking in the brunch scene, it&#39;s because Vargabar is absolutely adorable and damn good! <br><br>Right off King Street, yet tucked away into darling Wilson Street, Vargabar is an &#34;open-air&#34; style place that&#39;s all about sustainable food and delicious coffee. They roast their own beans, known as &#34;The Marilyn,&#34; which have picked up some street cred in the coffee world. Their caps are therefore great, and they also have delicious frappes and frozen specialty drinks that they serve out of, what else, mason jars. <br><br>I&#39;ve only ever had the pan baked eggs, which while a bit expensive, were undeniably fresh and a refreshing flavour combination: a tortilla covered in melted cheese, mushrooms, mango chutney, cheese, and more, it was a filling breakfast that you definitely didn&#39;t walk away feeling guilty about. <br><br>They also have wi-fi, which is fantastic, making it not only the best brunch spot, but in my opinion, the best computer hangout spot, in Newie.",

"reviewcomment":"I dropped by Ramen Zundo to get some dinner takeaway. I&#39;d heard awesome things about it and and was pleasantly surprised to discover that it was easy to get to, tucked inside World Square.<br><br>Now, I&#39;m one of those people who can&#39;t have ONLY ramen. I don&#39;t think there&#39;s enough stuff in it for me. I don&#39;t consider actual noodles as real food, so I always order something on the side, like gyoza or karaage with my ramen, otherwise it&#39;s just a couple strips of meat and some veggies.<br><br>The nice thing about this is that I was able to order a smaller size, which is $1.20 less, so I was able to get less noodles, which I then topped up by ordering their karaage. Less noodles, more meat = win for Mela. I ordered the Zundo Red, which is a tonkotsu soup with spicy chilli oil.<br><br>My takeaway took a couple of minutes. Once I got home, I saw that the broth had congealed a bit (it&#39;s a pork bone broth, after all) which I gladly scooped up and mixed back in. Hehe. It was really tasty -- filled the room with a delicious aroma. The karaage was good, but not great. The ramen was a definite standout.",

"reviewcomment":"This place was pretty darn cool. As everyone else has said YES AMAZING VIEW!! <br>but the spinning was the fun part. If you went to the bathroom you kind of lost your barrings when you returned because your table would be elsewhere! ha, it was fun though. <br>I had a pretty great time here. I must say that chocolate martinis are impossible to find in Sydney and nobody even knows what they are but after asking around nonstop, i found TOBLERONE&#39;s here. Toblerone is like the same thing as a chocolate martini but just called differently. I wasn&#39;t aware that they called it that until i read the drink menu and said HEY, that sounds just like one. <br>Anyway, came here for dinner and had the scallops which were great. Then The beef fillet was amazing, and for dessert chocolate mousse. I really don&#39;t have anything bad to say about my experience here. It really is A+<br><br>NOW GO!",

FOr a team of 9, we ate like kings and only ended up paying $20 a head for he food (drinks were extra and purchased form the pub next door). On price alone, it was 5 star. <br><br>I wasn&#39;t comepletely taken by every dish, but that probably says more about my tastes than the quality of the dishes. Case in point, I like larb gai. I like larb gai A LOT. We also tried the same dish with duck, and while most others thought it was better, I disagree. <br><br>Curries were tasty, stir fries were delightful, and the company good to, but for some eason I was left a little disappointed.  <br><br>I&#39;ve heard a lot about House.... It is one of Sydney&#39;s favourite Thai restaurants, and it has a staunch following. I&#39;m not here to buy into the Sydney House vs Homevs Chat Thai vs SomeOtherPlace debate, but I wasn&#39;t convinced it was the best Thai I have ever been to. I would go back, especially with a large group, but I have enjoyed Thai more elsewhere.",

Not that I have a boat, but I&#39;m glad to know in case I get the urge to buy one.<br><br>It can be hard finding really good vegetarian/vegan food at the high-end restaurants. Often even very good restaurants will have just a single vegetarian option. Usually risotto. So it&#39;s always nice to find a nice restaurant that has more than one choice of meal.<br>The food itself was very good, although the vegetarian main I got didn&#39;t blow me away. But from the reactions of my companions, 2 of whom ordered the Wagyu beef, 1 of whom got lamb, and one who got a whole barramundi, my meal was the only one that didn&#39;t. <br>But the five stars comes from the dessert, which was AMAZING. Tiramisu with espresso jelly that was one of the greatest things I&#39;ve ever eaten. Balsamic figs. And a shared chocolate dessert that had a bit of everything, all of which was fantastic.<br>I would go back just to try the often desserts.<br><br>Service was good but a little slow at times. The servers were friendly and helpful (one even helped us with a crossword puzzle). Generally they were exceptionally pleasant to deal with, but there were a few times when we had to wait for service.<br>Overall a great experience.",

Mexican food in Australia is usually a game of hit and miss, with way more misses than hits.<br><br>But let me say, watch your back Guzman and Gomez, Cantina Mobil is incredible and delicious; and so very fresh. The sauces and salsas taste homemade, the salad is crisp and delicious, and if you ask for guacamole, you get a decent amount of it which is great (why are Australian businesses so stingy with their guac?!) <br><br>On my two visits, I tried the chicken (great, perfect amount of spice, lovely pieces of chicken) and the vegetarian (beans). I&#39;m so used to bland vegetarian fare that I had to add my own chilli to that I was not anticipating such a flavoursome offering. It was amazing - except the fact that some coriander made it into mine, despite my request for it to be left off. <br><br>And their Spanish Cola tastes like heaven. It&#39;s what Coke and Pepsi wish they tasted like. <br><br>I am crushed that the Crown St location is closing, especially since the discovery of decent veggie burritos.

I was not wrong. <br><br>We rocked up about 1pm on a Friday afternoon and grabbed a seat at the bar. Started with Iberian ham which was just as good as we remembered. We then had pig cheek with scallops and cumquat marmalade. Jiminy Cricket! So, so good. Last, some duck leg with pickled cabbage. Also a treat. <br><br>What was great about Movida was their detailed level of knowledge about the food and wine. I was at a cafe in Newtown the previous week and they couldn&#39;t even tell us whether a cake they were serving had nuts in it! At Movida, the staff had very specific knowledge about everything on the menu. A brilliantly sublime Friday afternoon.",

I would have liked things a tad more crazy/adventurous but thats just me.  Oh! They also offered drink pairing, 1/2 pairings (which is different from the full pairing), and juice pairings (which is also awesome to see).  <br><br>I wouldn&#39;t say it&#39;s a once in a lifetime sort of thing because if I lived in Australia, I would have been back by now.  Come in good company and just sit back and enjoy the food and conversations and awesomely chill vibe.",

So we shared the Tiramisu, pineapple carpaccio, and another one which I think involved chocolate cake.

"reviewcomment":"We came here for breakfast on a Saturday morning, and with greatly reduced traffic noise - it was quite pleasant sitting outside. I imagine during a busy weekday it would be hard to hear yourself think.<br><br>We ordered the French toast and the corn fritters and a couple of coffees. In general, I would describe the food as &#34;OK&#34;.<br><br>Nothing wrong with it, nothing great about it. Likewise the coffee. It tasted OK without being awesome.<br><br>The French toast brioche was light and fluffy, and the caramelised banana was slightly over done and on the edge of being too mushy - but still acceptable. The main issue was the gallon of thick maple syrup - I&#39;d probably go for a lighter blend if I were the chef. The vanilla ice cream that was supposed to come with it, didn&#39;t. So maybe that would have cut through the syrup.<br><br>The corn fritters I am told we&#39;re slightly dry but still edible. The suggestion from the critic across from me was that maybe a creme fraise would have gone better than the goats cheese crumble - again the balance the textures.<br><br>As you can plainly see - we&#39;ve been watching way too much Masterchef.<br><br>The staff were friendly and polite and the service was very efficient - so top marks for that. <br><br>On the weekends there aren&#39;t many breakfast options in the city. If I was in the area, I&#39;d come here again - but probably wouldn&#39;t make the hike on purpose.",

"reviewcomment":"Today Ladies and Gentleben (Google it) I&#39;d like to talk to you about breakfast. <br><br>We all know the cafe culture in Sydney is pretty good, we&#39;ve all been disappointed when going to other cities and finding that they don&#39;t quite reach the standards of the simple Sydney Cafe staples we know and love. <br><br>I&#39;d wager that some of you may well as I do, order the poached eggs on toast with a side of Bacon, &#34;Please can you ask for the Bacon to be extra crispy?&#34; some salt some pepper and we&#39;re away right?<br><br>But what if you are hungrier than usual? Perchance you may have had what could only be described as an EPIC night out and have slept for a mere two hours thirty three minutes and sixteen seconds... You&#39;re veritably starving... You can&#39;t concentrate... you&#39;ve ordered your coffee and its half drunk due to dehydration the wait staff return, you need to order, your eyes arrive upon the Big Breakfast...<br><br>Eggs - Check<br>Toast - Check<br>Snags - Check (Not pork but I am hung-over remember so will let this slide)<br>Beans - (I love beans) CHECK<br>Bacon - {it&#39;s all here; you gently murmur whilst the wait staff start to look mildly concerned} Check<br>Token Greenage to make me feel better about the terrific Calorific intake - Roger That!<br><br>{Radio Crackles} &#34; uh ten four we have a Green Light on Big Brekky, we are going in Weapons Hot {More Radio static}<br><br>&#34;Do you want another coffee&#34; the fugue state broken as I crash back to the reality of this review.<br><br>So I had the Big Brekky. It was good, I recommend you give it a whirl, usual Potts Point Table getting strategy apply (i.e. don&#39;t rock up at 1030 on a Sunday thinking you&#39;ll be able to sit straight down, this place is in constant high demand) , friendly staff who are attentive and the coffee ain&#39;t half bad neither.",

"reviewcomment":"Famous for their brunch, especially their scrambled eggs with truffle oil, is Dank Street Depot in Waterloo.  Some friends took me there on a Saturday morning so I could try these purportedly amazing eggs.  When we got to the restaurant, it took about five minutes to be seated.  This was nice since we all expected a long wait.  Our waitress was very kind and accommodating.  We all ordered our coffees, which were sublime, and we all ordered the scrambled eggs with truffle oil.  <br><br>When the plates arrived at the table, we were all disappointed.  For $20, there was a small pile of scrambled eggs, half of a roasted mushroom, and one thin piece of toast.  Giving the chef the benefit of the doubt, I was hoping the taste would make up for the portion.  I was wrong.  The eggs were tough and didn&#39;t have that profound truffle flavor I expected.  Just out of concern, one of my friends let the manager know that the last time he tried the dish, it was infinitely creamier and tastier than it was now.  She mentioned that the chef had changed and was grateful for the feedback, which we thought was nice, until she started justifying the price of the plate.  This was unnecessary.  Since we didn&#39;t enjoy our meal so much, we weren&#39;t charged for our coffees.  We appreciated this gesture.",

The service were efficient, attentive and perfectly timed without being imposing. <br><br>My husband and I ordered a salad, a bottle of wine (all bottles very reasonably priced), the Bufala pizza and the ricotta e spinaci calzone. We told them they were sharing and, again, the pizza and calzone were perfectly timed and delicious. The calzone especially was probably one of the best I&#39;ve had- the crust was crispy but not over-dry or hard to cut, and every item had the right proportion of cheese, sauce and dough.<br><br>For dessert we had the Nutella bombolone- DELICIOUS!

For only $1.60 you get a piece of pastizzi which is a golden, flaky pastry with warm gooey yummy filligs such as chicken,  bolognaise,  peas, cream cheese,  tandoori chicken, etc, etc. At any time of the day, even if they only have 5 kinds on display,  they can magically pull out any of the many flavours on the blackboard out of thin air!<br><br>When you eat the pastizzi, its serioisly heaven. The crunch from the pastry is just deafening and will make your chewing as loud as Lily&#39;s loud chewing from How I Met Your Mother. <br><br>If you&#39;re on a budget, I recommend you go to this store as you can get more from your budget constraint here, all other stores charge $2 or $2.50. Looking at the price differences, you could profit from these price differences by buying from the crown street store and selling the same pastizzis for an amount between 1.61 to 1.99 in front of the oxford Street store. You could do this everday until, they either made the prices the same between stores or they chase you away with an angry maltese grandma with a broom.",

"reviewcomment":"Coffee: Mecca (Dark Horse Blend)<br>Passion: 10/10<br>Crema: 10/10<br>(Top 10 in Sydney)<br><br>Coming to a cafe and getting schooled on what a coffee can do in the right hands is a wonderful thing. Having tried the Colombian single origin from Mecca before I made the mistake of bad mouthing it here, and was then delivered a fantastic coffee. Since then, I know that when I come here I&#39;ll be served by someone with the passion to squeeze the best out of the beans.<br><br>Today I started with a El Salvador Grand Reserve espresso which, in the words of Shoji &#34;just tastes like coffee&#34;. To be honest.... it did... It was robust, it was smooth, it was a whole lot of coffee, but it still kept something for the end. While not cutting through the aroma or the full body, as the flavours developed in the after-taste, a lighter, somewhat nuttier flavour appeared. Very enjoyable.<br><br>I then grabbed the filter coffee of the day which was an Ethiopian Duromina. which started with an amazing spicy aroma, somewhat citrusy. As it opened up however, the flavour started to degenerate and leave a sour after-taste. While not a bad coffee, it was no where near as good as the El Sal.<br><br>All up, this busy cafe is a brilliant representation of what Mecca beans can do. And by all accounts, that is a good thing indeed.<br><br>N.B.<br>There is #powerwhoring available inside towards the coffee bean display.<br>No public WiFi available.<br>Single origin coffees are always available",

"reviewcomment":"Amazing Thai place! Looking for something convenient and tasty a bit later at night, Yelp guided me to this shrine of the delicious and awesome. First impression, it was small but cleanly decorated with wooden tables and the clientele seemed to be primarily Thai and was bustling with people. I took that as a good sign! After being sat down almost immediately, I had a look through the menu and became deliriously happy at the fact that almost every dish had a picture of what it was supposed to look like! As a non-expert at Thai food, and with a extensive menu full of delicious sounding meals this was a godsend. Also the dishes have a detailed description and a chili/hotness rating. Just so helpful! <br><br>Having trouble choosing between items was a slight problem, but only due to my eagerness to try so many yummy looking things. The waitress left me alone while I was looking, picking up on the fact that I obviously had no idea what I wanted yet, but when I got her attention she was super helpful, answering all my questions with a helpful and positive attitude. I ended up with the crispy pork belly and rice (with morning glory spinach and a bit of chili), and a coconut ice slushie. Both tasted amazing and came out quickly, with a hefty portion size! Although very full, I couldn&#39;t resist the sticky rice and mango dessert so got it take away for later on. Again, it was so tasty, with fresh mango. Super impressed, I had to go back for more, so visited for take away lunch two days later before heading to the airport. Had the same dish and dessert, and both were exactly the same in quantity, quality and taste despite being takeaway. This place is just so awesome, in so many ways.<br><br>Only downside: they only accept cash.<br><br>Fun fact: on my second visit I noticed the staff dress like a cartoon version of a building site. Male chefs wear yellow hard hats and light blue overalls, with the girls just wearing the overalls. Just made me love this place even more.",

They&#39;re bitter and chewy and better off avoided. The rolls are, of course, divine. The meat is grilled in front of you and slapped together with tangy humus and fresh tabbouleh in minutes flat. <br><br>For a guaranteed winner, the chicken is the go-to, so too is the Lebanese sausage, my lamb meanwhile, was sinewy and not entirely pleasant.

"reviewcomment":"Here&#39;s a first world problem for you- deciding on a Thai restaurant in Newtown.  <br><br>Thai Riffic stood out due to its slightly upscale decor and muted colour scheme, in addition to $5 menu specials and comfy-looking seats. Settling in BF and I checked out the lunch menu. Much to my delight, they deemed it their &#34;Bangkok Backstreet Menu&#34; complete with a snapshot of a makeshift restaurant in a Bangkok back alley. <br><br>The breakdown:<br><br>-The Thai ice tea ($5): fab. If you&#39;re a connoisseur, this place does not disappoint. <br><br>-Chicken satay: YUM. It came served with lettuce leaves as garnish, a sizable star-shaped portion of rice, three skewers of definitely-marinated-beforehand chicken that were flavourful and juicy, and a large puddle of peanut sauce that was to die for- clearly made from scratch in house.<br><br>-BF&#39;s meal ($10): One of the Pin-To on offer: its the Thai version of those little tin tiffin boxes Indians use for lunch. His Pin-To featured minced chicken cooked with garlic, chilli, basil and green bean, rice topped with a fried egg, and clear soup. The minced chicken dish- wow. Redolent of anise and other spices. Truly delicious. The egg was cooked perfectly as well- runny yolk for all! The portion was small but just right if having a starter.<br><br>My meal ($8): I chose the &#34;Bangkok Chicken Noodle&#34; dish for $8, which was described as chicken with market vegetables and wide rice noodles. Accompanied by a dish of sweet chilli (not really necessary as the dish ended up being quite sweet), it arrived looking like a lighter version of Pad See Ew, crowned with crispy wonton noodles and again, a perfectly cooked fried egg. I happily busted the runny yolk all over the noodles.<br><br>The only drawbacks: the &#34;market vegetables&#34; promised in the dish turned out to be bits of lettuce leaf. Not sure how lettuce qualifies as a stir-fry veggie. No me gusta.<br><br>The other bit is the chicken in my dish was your average Asian-y variety. What is it about every single Asian restaurant serving the exact same, dry, slightly stringy meat in stir-fried dishes? Is there one Asian shop that has a monopoly? I wouldn&#39;t have marked them down, but their chicken satay was so darn delicious that after having that dish, I really would have preferred tofu than eat substandard meat.<br><br>We&#39;re definitely coming back for dinner- Massaman lamb shanks, served with mashed potato?? The menu looked different than most other Thai places, which is a breath of fresh air given that I&#39;ve yet to be to a Thai place in Sydney with a menu different to the joint down the street. Maybe that&#39;s because I only go to cheap places. Don&#39;t judge me.<br><br>Don&#39;t waste your time pacing up and down King Street, muttering to yourself that you JUST. CANT. DECIDE. between Thai, Thai, and Thai. I&#39;ve made your decision for you.",

(a bit too pricey I thought)...<br><br>For mains we struggled..... craving a pizza we decided to go for the Margherita as there were no other vegie options - which was super disappointing.... not the pizzza - the pizza was good but the lack of options was bad...we also shared the pan fried gnocchi - which was quite yummy...<br><br>I kind of wish restaurants like this would allow Vegeterians to have a few more choices.... not everyone loves meat.",

The atmosphere and the decor take me back to another lifetime ... all that before you even think of food!<br><br>From the outset you will notice that service is low key yet attentive and impeccable. Make it a weekend visit (booked in advance) so you can treat yourself and that special someone to Sepia&#39;s degustation menu crowned by their signature dessert the chocolate forrest.<br><br>The menu is well balanced, ranging from subtle flavours to big ticket items that seem to pop with a firework of flavour. The menu changes over time, but it&#39;s always a journey worth taking. There is a reason why Sepia is both loved and awarded.<br><br>I would suggest a very light, if any, breakfast or lunch on the day of your visit as the degustation menu builds and is overall very substantive.",

"reviewcomment":"Fantastic.<br><br>Leichhardt has its share of quality Italian eateries, that&#39;s for sure. It can be hard to choose. That&#39;s what I thought on my first night out for dinner in this neighbourhood.<br><br>Until I saw that Caffe Moretti, away from the street a little bit (and easy to walk past) was full of people with more queuing to get in. Good sign.<br><br>The place is incredibly loud, family-friendly, and BYO (yay!). The ambience is simple Italian eatery. There are far more large tables for groups than small tables for two. No romance here, it&#39;s lively. They don&#39;t make you feel rushed. We had to wait quite a long time for our mains, but they warned us of this and we expected it, given the crowd.<br><br>Bruschetta was a good starter, with very ripe tomatoes.<br><br>Mains were exceptional. My wife had seafood spaghetti that was chock full of clams and mussels and prawns, and well-seasoned. I had king prawns ($35) that had been marinated and grilled. There were just five, but they were meaty and filling and perfectly cooked.<br><br>Next time we&#39;ll have to try one of the many pizzas from their wood-fired brick oven (which you can see from your seat). Most people were having this; apparently it&#39;s what they&#39;re known for.",

"reviewcomment":"So, after suggesting to go to Smash with friends what seems like a million times, I finally got the chance to go. So very glad I kept nagging. SO glad.<br><br>When we arrived we were greeted by two very lovely, sassy waitresses, Renata and Victoria. We were quickly seated and before we knew it, delicious drinks and nibblies were whooshing towards us. I&#39;ll just say it now - some of the best service I&#39;ve seen on King Street.<br><br>The decor was lovely. Very retro and colourful. I&#39;m no good at explaining this bit, so I&#39;ll leave it up to you to check it out!<br><br>As the name would suggest, the place serves Sausages. It&#39;s not all they serve, but, why on earth would you go to a &#39;Sausage Kitchen&#39; if you didn&#39;t want sausages? You don&#39;t want sausages? Get out. Just kidding. Their schnitzel looks good...<br><br>For entree I ordered the table a Caramelised Onion and Goats Cheese Tart. HNNNNGH! Incredible. Beautiful puff pastry topped with loads of, you guessed it, caramelised onion and goats cheese. This was topped with fresh rocket and drizzled with a tangy balsamic glaze. Highly recommended. They have a couple other nice looking entrees, including a Fish Fingers and Aioli, and a Sausage Tasting Plate with Chutney. All on my list to try.<br><br>So, this is how it works. Choose your sausages, choose your mash and choose your gravy. Simple, no? And what a choice! Nine types of sausages and maybe 10 different combinations of mash. Then, to complete the experience, 4 different Gravies.<br><br>Together with my friends I managed to get a taste of their Lamb Mint &amp; Rosemary, Moroccan Lamb &amp; Raisin, Old English Pork, Honey Chicken &amp; Macadamia, Beef Wild Mushroom &amp; Garlic and Vegetarian Sausages. All of them were fantastic, but my recommendation is the Beef Wild Mushroom &amp; Garlic Sausages.<br><br>The mashes are incredible. Again, so many choices! Potato or Sweet Potato? Then mix it with Parmesan? Caramelised Onion? Maybe Bacon and Leek? Trust me, they&#39;re all good.<br><br>You know it&#39;s a good meal if you feel compelled to stay for dessert. And compelled we were. So compelled that we bought 2 dessert tasters, each consisting 3 desserts. Conveniently, enough to try every dessert on the menu. I won&#39;t spoil the whole menu, so I&#39;ll leave you with the one dessert that I enjoyed the most. Banoffee Pie.<br><br>Is it expensive? I don&#39;t think so. The Tart was $10, but was big enough to hold the table back from eating me alive before their mains were done. For three snags, mash and gravy it&#39;s only $21. And there&#39;s a lot of food. Desserts are roughly $9, or $20 for the tasting plate of three.<br><br>Chatting with the waitresses after I finished my meal, I overheard that the Sydney Harbour Bears had been in recently and sold them out of t-shirts. What was on the t-shirts, you ask? &#34;I love sausage.&#34; I will be back to claim one for myself.<br><br>I&#39;m really glad to say that this is the first restaurant on King I&#39;ve given 5-stars. Well done guys on a fantastic experience. I can&#39;t wait to go back... Wait... I already have. =3",

"reviewcomment":"I&#39;ve known about this café for years, however after 7 years in the area, I finally paid my first visit a few weekends ago. Why have I never come here before?<br><br>While the wait was exceptionally long for food-  my friends and I weren&#39;t in any great rush so we didn&#39;t mind at all. Between three of us, we ordered two serves of the corn fritters because after spotting the mammoth servings at the table next to us- we knew we wouldn&#39;t be able to finish one each (even with my insatiable appetite). Pretty impressive considering Aussie café portion sizes usually leave a lot to be desired.<br><br>The fritters are fried... and by fried I mean deep, oily, morsels of heart attack material- but I mean that in the best of ways. Maybe they are not the healthiest fritters I&#39;ve eaten, but definitely tasty. A generous scoop of avocado was the perfect accompaniment. We took Ben&#39;s advice and ordered a side of the jalapeno relish and the spicy kick was a nice touch. <br><br>Oh and anyone who has read my café reviews knows that I&#39;m a big chai latte critic. I actually prefer the sweet, fake, powder mix variation of the chai- rather than the fancy, fresh brewed leaves (I think it&#39;s the American in me craving fake processed stuff). Chaos serves one of my top three fave sweet, syrupy chais in all of Sydney. Sharing the fritters amongst friends meant I had enough room in my stomach to order two of them. <br><br>Definitely glad I finally tried this place out. Will be happy to visit again.",

"reviewcomment":"One Liner: generous fillings, tasty pesto, double cheese (what the ?), all hammed up!<br><br>I ordered my sambo from the nice old lady (p.s. they are all nice old ladies) and waited in anticipation to enjoy the construction of my soon-to-be-consumed lunch. At first my sandwich artist looked a little confused, as she reached for battered chicken, when I had clearly ordered a #1 whose hero is ham. She correctly avoided the foul then promptly banged on a slice of cheese - interesting, my quizzical side pondered, let&#39;s see where this goes - then I saw her grab a miserable looking slice of ham and a cynical part of me lamented that lunch was ruined and it then proceeded to have an epic meltdown inside sook session... suddenly, as if sensing my sadness, she went and grabbed 3 more hearty slices and my optimistic side thought, hold the phone (and my Dumb and Dumber side knew that she&#39;d &#34;totally redeemed herself!&#34;). Pesto went on next, followed by rocket, salt &amp; pepper (she asked) then a second slice of cheese - at which point my adventurous side began doing jumping jacks - wait... what the? double cheese.... oh YEAH baby! Tops &#39;n&#39; tails! 64 slices of american cheese, 63... that&#39;s right folks she pimped my already medium pimpin&#39; sambo.<br><br>When I sauntered back into work with my big pimpin&#39; sambo, congregations of peeps parted like I was Moses rockin&#39; through with the tenner tablets. Sitting at my desk now I am satiated (read: fat &amp; happy).<br><br>In closing, get to Lime, but get in the right line! (1st counter sambos, 2nd counter salads --- don&#39;t make the rookie mistake, there&#39;s nothing worse than being green in a sandwich bar... nothing)",

"reviewcomment":"This is one of our favourite spots to take people who are after a cafe experience with a difference. The Israeli food they have is amazing and each time we come we have our &#39;go to&#39; dishes that are sure to please.<br><br>Try the Shakshuka with eggplant &amp; haloumi. The signature Shenkin wrap is definitely a must. Their felafel is possibly the most authentic I have had. Be warned though, you may not want to have several close quarter discussions after eating here or just be sure to bring some mints ;)<br><br>They use Mecca dark horse as the house and will have some nice single origins from time to time. Baristas are well trained and I know that they strive for excellence in their coffee as they have changed blends a few times in the years I have gone there. Coconut hot chocolate is a must try. Hot chocolates are not my drink but I will crave this one from time to time. If you&#39;re after something cold, the frappes they serve will hit the spot or have a freshly squeezed juice.<br><br>The venue is surprisingly deep so don&#39;t be fooled by the front entrance as there are plenty of seats in the back of the cafe with some great big share tables and a sun light which is lovely during the day.<br><br>Atmosphere here is good, service is always high and the owners are almost always here which gives it that added touch of a small business doing great things.<br><br>So if you are after a great lunch go to, a taste of Israel or something different to bring some visitors to then Shenkin comes highly recommended!",

There are great beers on tap, truly colourful regulars, a Thai kitchen in back that does decent laksa, and of course the theatre. It only holds a few dozen people but they put on fun, quirky, professional productions.<br><br>Great spot.",

For the busier customer, take to work some great home-made sandwiches, salads, or dried meats. <br><br>Although the prices can be a little steep in comparison to a supermarket, it&#39;s worth it for the imported and hard to find fresh cheeses, meats, and great service you get - ask for a taste test, and you&#39;ll know why.",

While the fish available changes daily, the menu as a whole hasn&#39;t really changed in the last decade- and that&#39;s not a bad thing.<br><br>Sooo there&#39;s a menu, but basically what you do is you pick:<br><br>1. A Fish<br>2. A Sauce/Topping (eg. hollandaise and asparagus or avocado salsa or cajun crust)<br>3.A Potato (eg. chips or gratin or wedges or gnocchi)<br><br>and order that. 90% of the time I get the tuna, with avocado salsa and chips)<br><br>There is very limited seating, but the turnover is quick and high. Just give your name or number when you arrive and pop over the Shakespeare Hotel for a drink. They&#39;ll come drag you out or phone you when your table is ready (normally about 1 drink&#39;s wait).<br><br>P.S. the tartar is tangingly perfect.<br>P.P.S the chairs are all stools, so don&#39;t wear a short skirt<br>P.P.P.S if you like your tuna pink, as for RARE not medium rare.",

"reviewcomment":"Thai on Wok is your standard cheap-and-cheerful Thai joint. Food is above-average standard, good for the price and comes out lightning fast. I like to eat in here if I can snag a table because:<br><br>1) They have hoisin sauce for your dipping pleasure, which I&#39;m fairly sure is Japanese. But who cares? The more dipping sauces the better!<br><br>2) Thai on Wok has a dual action ice and water machine to quench your thirst after scoffing down all that yummy Thai food! Set the dial to &#34;ice and water&#34; and stick your cup underneath for a healthy dose of chilled water with a dang good ice-to-water ratio!<br><br>Sometimes it&#39;s the little things in life...",

"reviewcomment":"Great German food! I was expecting sausages but there was so much more. Of course the sausage platter had a great variety and the sweet mustard went well with the white sausage. I would have been happy right there! <br><br>The schnitzel was crisp and delicious and thin! The potatoes and sauerkraut with it was perfect. But that&#39;s not all. What I found surprising was the spiciness in the spatzle! The pulled pork spatzle was excellent - Germany&#39;s pasta. For the pork knuckle, the meat fell apart beautifully yet the outside was crispy - a perfect combo. <br><br>You might think there is no room for dessert after all that but no - actually managed to try the strudel. It was warm and delicious. <br><br>The beer selection is enough to bring you to Essen as well! The wait staff know their beers (real Germans!) and i described what I liked and they came up with two suggestions. I liked the first one so much I had a second and didn&#39;t deviate from the decision. Obviously I have to go back to try more beer. <br><br>I&#39;ve been disappointed with other German restaurants in Sydney in the past so I set my expectations low and the experience at Essen was great! I didn&#39;t think I could eat that much so really glad to have been sharing and sampling. I will definitely be back for the beer and especially the food!!!",

The first room you enter is indeed a bar but the restaurant out the back is a hidden gem, and so friendly. <br>I had the good fortune to eat here with my family this week and got to sample many of the dishes. The Berkshire pork starter was amazing: breadcrumb crusted block of two different pork dishes with rhubarb purée. Although they are simple the pizzas and Tuscan bread and haloumi salad are also really good. Don&#39;t leave without ordering the salted caramel tart. <br>The atmosphere was perfect for a relaxed but gourmet dinner.",

The layout and design of the place is awesome, the vibe is a good mix of casual eaters and lively drinkers and the food is relatively decent. Prices can be a little high for what you get, but it is double bay...<br><br>I guess the only downside would be that although it&#39;s a sexy spot, it definitely knows a little too well how sexy it is. This in turn produces service that isn&#39;t entirely the friendliest and a crowd that can be a slight pretentious at times. In my mind, it&#39;s a good place to chill will a few friends and take in the crowd vs. a place to try and strike up a friendly convo with strangers. <br><br>3.5 rounded up to 4.",

A nice new addition to the bar scene along King Street, Miss Peaches has a great atmosphere whether you want to simply chill with friends or are planning on having a big night out.<br><br>They have some interesting and fairly reasonably priced cocktails(peanut butter and Jelly?!), as well as a selections of other beverages. There&#39;s always some retro music playing (Elvis, etc) as well that goes down a treat.<br><br>The outside balcony that looks over Missenden Road is a nice place to sit and grab some fresh air (or some secondhand smoke depending on who you&#39;re with. Not that I&#39;m complaining, it nice to go somewhere where I can have a conversation with my chain smoking friends that isn&#39;t on the street or in a beer garden). <br><br>I&#39;ve noticed most of the negative reviews on here are regarding the food. I&#39;ve never eaten here so I can&#39;t comment on that.<br><br>Overall Miss Peaches is a great bar with a lot of retro and southern Americana :)",

"reviewcomment":"Loved it.<br><br>I&#39;m transiting through Sydney en route to home (Virginia, USA). Looked around for some good Italiano before flying tomorrow, and found this gem via community reviews.<br><br>It&#39;s a bit confusing to find, for starters. Almost an unmarked for in an alley, but do press on.<br><br>I dined alone, but the wait staff were wonderful. They didn&#39;t hover or make me feel either freakish or unwelcomed.<br><br>Started off with a glass of prosecco and the prosciutto di San Daniele with &#34;gnocco fritto&#34;. Odd, but sure. The gnocco are basically pasta noodles quick fried. Not oily, but certainly fried. Strange, but it worked.<br><br>For my secondo piatto, I had tagliatelle in a spicy tomato sauce (almost an arrabiatta) with capers, blanched spinach, and shaved parmigiana cheese. Paired with a rosso delba from Sicily, it was fabulous.<br><br>I rarely get dessert, but the orange sorbetto with Campari called me. Not a big fan of Campari, but the combo worked. Paired with a simple grappa biancha, the dolce was just right.<br><br>Really glad I followed the reviews. Henceforth, I will plan a &#34;Sydney staging night&#34; whenever I&#39;m heading home from biz trips, and Berta is a MUST stop for me. Thanks!",

"reviewcomment":"AUSSIE IN NEW YORK<br>Just wow! one of the best assembled breakfast I had in a long long time. Everything is right about this meal, great ingredients that compliment each other and most importantly the flavours were balanced too. The level of attention to detail is high, small pieces of red onion and picked white onion give that tangy hit. Bagel is soft but has that dense bite to it with a crispy outer shell. The cream cheese on the bagel is just heavenly on its own and of course the salmon that tasted pure and fresh.<br><br>JUST EGGS WITH A SIDE OF SAUSAGES<br>Simple dish but every element on the plate is presented and cooked to perfection. Great sausages and yolk porn moment guaranteed.<br><br>BANANA SHAKE<br>Delicious shake great alternative to a hot beverage. Natural tasting that makes you wanting more.<br><br>Conclusion<br>Creative bistro that seems to be experimenting and updating their menu seasonally. Great combination of quirky dish names, accessible location, friendly service and delicious seasonal dishes makes this one of the best all-day breakfast/brunch style meals in Sydney. Ten times better than overrated Baroque at The Rocks.<br><br>@thesydneynoob",

There were big glass windows facing Campbell Street (but no sign and no door onto the street, you have to come in through the laneway at the back) and it was all quite dimly lit and elegant with long wooden tables and plush white chairs and a musician playing unobtrusive guitar.<br><br>Before dinner, i believe it was Michael Fantusz came out and welcomed us all and explained the concept a little bit (communal, family style meals) and the fact that a portion of the proceeds are donated to Surry Hills community initiatives. Food and philanthropy. What&#39;s not to love about that?<br><br>We had an antipasti platter served first and it was quite possibly the best antipasto I have ever had in my life. Every little detail was perfect. Perfect chargrilled veges, perfect cheese, perfect involtini, perfect, perfect, delicious!<br><br>Next was a papardelle pasta in a veal ragu. It was definitely good, but otherwise unremarkable. <br><br>Last was a lemon custard tarty creme brulee-ish thingamibobby cake type thing. IT WAS AMAZING. I wanted 5 slices. I only got one. So sad.<br><br>I thought it was a brilliant evening overall and I&#39;d very much like to do the same thing in a few months. We booked this about 2 months or more out (I can&#39;t remember, but it was ages ago). I&#39;m not sure how far out they&#39;re booked, but I imagine you can&#39;t just decide on Wednesday that you&#39;d like to come with a bunch of people the same Friday, if you know what I mean.",

"reviewcomment":"I&#39;ve come across Kura countless times on Yelp searches for something cheap and nearby. It&#39;s taken me about 2 months to finally set foot in that place. It was definitely worth the wait. <br><br>The place is a tiny (and I mean tiny) closet. So if you have claustrophobia or hate sharing oxygen with people, just order take away. I took a seat at the counter around 715pm on a Friday evening. Within a matter of minutes the placed filled up and I had other patrons literally stacked all up in my personal space. Not cool, but I was hungry. The menu is extensize and somewhat overwhelming. It ranges from rice bowls to sushi, noodles to BBQ, vegan friendly to carnivores. Take your time and look at all the pictures. <br><br>I ordered the Chef&#39;s Special: Kura Bibim Don (Minced beef, veggies, egg w/rice) for $10.90. What a great choice! The portion size was comparable to Oidens large rice bowl, but you don&#39;t get free miso soup at Oidens. The minced meat was surprisingly tasty. I say surprisingly because it looked kinda blah. The veggies were fresh and the egg was a perfect touch. Add a little (or a lot) of chili powder to your bowl for a nice little kick. <br><br>I&#39;m knocking off one star for (2) things:<br>1. Price - you basically can get the same bowl at Oidens for $3 less. It&#39;s good, but it&#39;s not $11 good.<br>2. Seating - I&#39;m all for saving space and filling the counters and tables w/patrons, but when you have the chairs soooo closely spaced together.. It&#39;s hard to enjoy your meal.",

"reviewcomment":"First impression of this place is that it&#39;s very simple.  First off when you get in,  no one will entertain you,  but that&#39;s not a bad thing though lol. You just have to pick you&#39;re order on the computer near the entrance.  That for me, seems very cool, only few restaurants has that. <br><br>About their food choices. They don&#39;t have lots of variety of food choices on their menu.  It&#39;s not a typical Japanese restaurant with all those sushi and stuffs. They have a few varieties of noodles and bentos and some small stuffs too.  On the front counter, they have another varieties which are not included on the menu. <br><br>Food taste.  Well I ordered a salmon bento.  First I notice is the hot miso soup with it.  It&#39;s very tasty,  but the rest are pretty good too,  I liked what I ate. <br><br>Space and seats.  Space is alright for a small group of peoples that&#39;s it. They only have few chairs too.  So yeah. <br><br>Parking.  The parking is just depends on the situation.  You can park on the nearest parking station or park on the street. Just to let you know it&#39;s just beside Paddy&#39;s market so when it&#39;s busy it&#39;s difficult to find a parking.<br><br>Oh and yeah the toilet.  NO TOILET so if you need to go then you better go run to Paddy&#39;s market.",

"reviewcomment":"We&#39;ve only just begun... to live! White lace and promises, a kiss for luck and we are on our way! -- So sang The Carpenters (and Carl Weathers in Happy Gilmore!) and I may as well have been the lead vocalist in the band this morning so rich were my yearning tones... and this my friends is the after effects of a coffee from Vella!<br><br>Seeing Vella Nero&#39;s signage after bookmarking yesterday (hat tip to James F.) my heart began its purple palpatations. I didn&#39;t think I would see it there, as Clarence Street is notorious for hiding things (I still don&#39;t know where Grandma&#39;s Bar is, despite actually going there recently... though the Fender sign triggers some sort of memory).<br><br>I sauntered into Vella and it&#39;s quite a big space, well. It&#39;s narrow and long, but the walls are adorned with coffee paraphernalia from roasting machines, to drip technology, to espresso cleaners, to all manner of beans. The girl that served me was very attractive, and I was hoping my coffee was just as hot. I kind&#39;ve forgot my order (and my name) when she spoke, glancing over her black glasses giving me that sexy &#34;I know you&#39;ve been naughty&#34; librarian look *gulp* but I quickly regathered myself, gave her the YL order and handed over my four-fifty. Now, Vella has 3 sizes. Small, Medium and Large. If you go to most other places, the small would be a regular and the medium would be a large. Their large is in fact a jumbo, and for $4.50 it&#39;s a Pirmin Zurbriggen (that&#39;s rhyming slang for a &#34;biggen&#34; for the uninitiated - PZ was a legendary downhill skier back in the day, you young whipper snappers wouldn&#39;t know that of course).<br><br>Anyhoo, so the coffee is memorable, the first sip hit me like a velvet vanguard - it was both strong and creamy. I was inhaling that wicked brew like an addict, and there was still plenty of good sips left when I arrived at my desk. No other &#34;large&#34; I&#39;ve had so far in Town Hall has made it back to my desk, so this truly is a big boy.<br><br>Not one to settle prematurely, I will still try the other recommendations that have been floated my way before I return to Vella. But, for now, it is the front runner and the president elect. Unless there is a Game of Thrones style coup I can&#39;t see Vella being beheaded. But then who saw [insert GOT spoiler here] coming?",

(Hmm, I seem to  love giving 0.5 ratings lately...) so this averages to around 3 stars, methinks.<br><br>Had dinner in Darling Harbour on a Monday night. We wanted to go to another dessert place but turns out it closes by 7 PM, so here we went. Now, I do love those Guylian chocolate boxes... very yummy, so we had high hopes for this place.<br><br>The dessert, as I mentioned, is a 3.5. They do have desserts on the menu, but unfortunately they&#39;d sold out except for the last 2, so instead we had to choose desserts from the display. Alrighty then.<br><br>We ordered:<br>- hot chocolate + peppermint: this was supposedly really good, wasn&#39;t able to taste it though<br>- eclair  - this was good but just OK, maybe a 3/5<br>- I had something called the &#34;diplomat,&#34; maybe a 4/5<br>- and something like a chocolate brownie but with a cheesecake in it? It was maybe a 3.5<br><br>While the desserts were generally good, none of them really tasted like the Guylian chocolate seashell/seahorse thingies. Sadface.<br><br>As I mentioned, service would be a 2.5. Not that they were rude or mean or anything like that, but they appeared to be severely understaffed. It was surprisingly busy for a Monday night, and they were always all busy clearing tables/taking orders/delivering drinks and desserts. It would be pretty hard to get their attention. It was seriously impossible to get water for our table, for example. Whilst making our initial order we asked for water... maybe 45 minutes later (I kid you not) after repeated requests for water and &#34;yes, sure!&#34; from the waiters we finally got water. One waiter even told us, &#34;OK, but if I don&#39;t give you water in 5 minutes just ask me again, because I&#39;m really busy doing other things.&#34; Ummm OK.<br><br>Maybe they should have self serve water instead.",

"reviewcomment":"My first introduction to Polish food and culture was through my partner and at first it took a while to adapt to Polish food (and Polish pronunciation). My second time at Na Zdrowie was was just as delightful as the first, although I did manage to embarrass my poor boyfriend as I attempted to order using my best Polish accent (to which I said everything incorrectly oi-vay).<br><br>For the entree the order was Wedliny, a cold meat platter with a side of rye bread and horse radish (I have fast learned that hose radish is a popular condiment among the Poles). The selection of hams was of high quality and I did manage to down 2/3rds before the boyfriend got his hands on it (only fair as he has lived a life on Polish cusine and I need to catch up).<br><br>The two mains ordered Golabki (fun fact, the word means pigeon, Im still trying to figure that one out), which is Polish cabbage rolls stuffed with mince and (as a lover of all things meaty) Szaszlyk, &#39;Char-grilled beef, pork loin, chicken breast (thats right! Beef!, Pork and Chicken, for all you indecisive individuals) and vegetable (not as important as the meat) skewer served with kopytka (that&#39;s a potato dumpling) and salad (slightly less interesting)&#39;. The food didn&#39;t disappoint my only pitfall was lack of gluten free options and the strange fascination with the spice simply known as &#39;Dill&#39;.<br>The biggest highlight was the Polish cocktails, any nation that has a million ways to make a vodka based cocktail that doesn&#39;t have one flavor is awesome in my books. The cocktails used a verity of the leading polish vodkas with a range of flavors and colours. The Polish beers have a creamy smooth flavor that&#39;s not to heavy on the stomach and the service is highly knowledgeable about the product (plus its a great place to demand boyfriend speak in polish, purely for amusement!).<br><br>Highly recommend!",

True to form, Fu Manchu came through. <br><br>I love the atmosphere in this restaurant, always busy and vibrant within its beautifully designed mess hall style. The food never fails to impress - it&#39;s always consistent and delicious.<br><br>And it&#39;s terrific how they have a sense of humor with the names they give the dishes. Where else can you get Lucky Lobster, Auspicious Beef, Prosperous Fish or Longevity Noodles?",

I was on my way towards one of the many brunch places in Surry Hills, when I saw this and made a mental note to come back.<br><br>The nice thing is that they&#39;re open during public holidays. The place isn&#39;t too big, but we were lucky enough to get a place for our group of 5 people inside.<br><br>Service was good, food was great. I ordered the buttermillk pancakes with blueberry and rhubarb compote and vanilla mascarpone. Now, I&#39;m a HUGE pancakes fan and I think these are the best pancakes I&#39;ve ever had in Sydney. They had a really good flavor without being too empowering, and the different ingredients went well together. Serving was generous.<br><br>Another runaway winner was a dish with chorizo -- chorizo was super tasty. All in all everyone in the table enjoyed their meals, with one person commenting he enjoyed it more than breakfast at the Grounds of Alexandria. I&#39;d love to order something different next time, but now that I&#39;ve tried the pancakes I don&#39;t know how I can order anything else!",

"reviewcomment":"A nice location and a relaxed vibe, but the food? Meh it&#39;s ok I guess. <br><br>It&#39;s your typical burger joint (which is a good thing) with a bit of a South American influence. I went straight for the burger menu and picked out the gaucho burger and a 4 pines hefeweizen to go with it. <br><br>The gaucho has a dry aged Angus and wagyu beef patty with chimmichurri sauce, lettuce, cheese etc. It&#39;s also billed as &#39;some like it hot&#39; with a spicy patty, chilli and hot pepper sauce. I liked the tang given by the spiciness, but don&#39;t get too excited spice lovers, I&#39;m notoriously soft when it comes to spice so if I can handle it it&#39;s not that spicy. <br><br>My main issue though was my burger was just too dry, maybe this was the patty I ordered, maybe it&#39;s healthier cooking style? Whatever it was though I missed those flavoursome juice/sauce you get in a good burger. Oddly the dryness also extended to the bun. <br><br>I like the idea of this place and it does a job, I just wish the burgers were a bit tastier.",

Also couldn&#39;t really hear what they were saying when introducing the dishes. <br><br>So here&#39;s what we had:<br><br>1. Trio Entree: Tofu with apple, mandarin and prawn, Chicken with sweet chilli sauce and (epic) seared scallop with raw salmon and teriyaki sauce<br>2. Mullet Sashimi with Fish Roe<br>- Sashimi Trio: Tuna, Kingfish and Salmon<br>- Prawn and Squid Salad with cucumber, carrot and bean sprout strips on sweet soy dressing<br>- Grilled Swordfish<br>- Sushi Platter<br><br>The highlight was definitely the seared scallop and the rest are quite normal - something you can order elsewhere. There was also the option of having matching sake (it&#39;ll def overwhelm the plain flavours of the fish) but we choose the normal set. I did have the Kirin apple cider though @$14 .. so expensive! <br><br>Will I do it again? Yepssss and this time will order dishes from the a la carte! <br><br>p.s. Loved the interior design!",

"reviewcomment":"Looks can be deceiving, the street entrance is just a tiny lobby to an old lift but once you&#39;re on the restaurant floor its pretty spacious. Ample space to walk around no backrest to backrest situations happening over here.<br><br>Ambience is cool with K-pop music videos attempting to make the vibe more Korean! I can&#39;t tell since I&#39;ve never been but all the waiters look Korean so this is as close as it gets. They are pretty friendly unlike Chinese restaurants.<br><br>We ordered the pork BBQ set and a seafood pancake. Wow it was pork overload, various cuts of pork hmm so good though, although most of them were seasoned with Korean based sauces and the one with Soju that might not be to everyone&#39;s taste. The servers are really attentive, either they really care about the customer or just are afraid that you set the place on fire. We can give them the benefit of the doubt. On top of that, they have the buzzer waiter summoning system although there was always someone checking on us for the BBQ, helping us cut up the meat or flipping them, adjusting the heat. It was borderline intrusive but much better than the other extreme.<br><br>Seafood pancake was a little bland won&#39;t be having that one again. They are very generous with the sides, and refillable as well. Too bad I&#39;m not keen on any of them. The BBQ was the best though, I&#39;ve never seen the egg and sweet corn around the BBQ. It kind of a K-surprise! both of them go well with rice and of course the cooked pork. The sides cook much slower making the egg become a different texture each time you dish out. Careful not to leave them in there too long, they might dry out or burn.<br><br>Conclusion<br>I don&#39;t eat Korean food much but have to say the service here is spectacular. This means that this is a good place to try out Korean BBQ as you will not be left stranded and hungry. The BBQ is self-cooked so you can cook it to taste whilst they still have other dishes on the menu too. Definitely worth another visit. Warning your clothes will be smelly after this. This setup is good for big groups as you can start eating relatively quickly compared to having single dishes each causing a kitchen nightmare.<br><br>@thesydneynoob",

"reviewcomment":"Whether you grab the long or the short end of the grain, you won&#39;t be disappointed with what you&#39;re chewing on at this humble canteen on the outskirts of Surry Hills. A little sister to Longrain, Shortgrain proved to be the perfect walk-in lunch location with incredibly fresh dishes in a humble venue (think 32 seats). The emphasis is clearly on amazing food in the spirit of a fast and friendly Asian street-style canteen, and they pull it off with pure class. <br><br>So the atmosphere&#39;s great... but the food, you ask? My dining partner and I barely came up for air in between our sharing dishes of stir fried chinese broccoli, crispy skinned chicken with green curry, salt &amp; pepper silken tofu, lamb yellow curry, squid and pumpkin salad... and when we did, it was to order the most incredible dessert of vanilla tapioca with jack fruit &amp; pineapple.<br><br>Truly, this is a lunchtime treat where a glass of wine, dessert and an half hour extra are necessary indulgences.

"reviewcomment":"I used to be a regular at Taste Baguette when I worked in the Market St/QVB area and I went there so often, the staff knew my order by heart!<br><br>It&#39;s rare to find a good croissant anywhere these days (I once ate a &#34;croissant&#34; which was called a croissant but tasted like bitter ciabatta), but these guys have nailed it - almost. You&#39;re not going to get your typical Parisien fresh melt-in-your-mouth light pastry, but at Taste, it&#39;s as good as it gets. I would always pick up a fresh croissant in the morning to go with my coffee and it made all the difference. The chocolate croissant is very good too.<br><br>Out of all their sandwiches, I loved the tofu on white baguette. The baguette is excellent (again, not your baguette you&#39;d pick up at the boulangerie in your French neighborhood, but still pretty damn good!), and comes with fried tofu, carrots, cucumber, and coriander. Taste used to have this delicious sour-ish sauce they used to put in this particular sandwich, but they&#39;ve since changed it to mayo - I&#39;m not sure why!<br><br>I don&#39;t particularly care much for their teacakes. I tried the lemon teacake and it was literally DRIPPING with butter. I felt a bit ill after a couple of bites and had to put it away. I thought it just might be this particular teacake flavor, so I tried another one (I think almond?) and unfortunately it was of the same texture. The cakes are delicious, but could be less rich. <br><br>I know they do a full breakfast (eggs, etc), but I have never had enough time to stay that long. I definitely recommend this place for the busy office worker. Their service comes with a smile, and the food is cheap and delicious. <br><br>Coffee is around $4, and sandwiches average around $8/9.",

Staff were all helpful and polite and the conference facilities are beautifully decorated. From what I could tell, the projectors and screens were retractable and the sound was great (no mic feedback). There were conference staff in the room throughout the conference which was super handy if you needed a water refill.<br><br>The food served was delicious and substantial. Healthy options were available and to be frank, none of it was overly unhealthy.<br><br>If we come to Sydney to stay, I&#39;d definitely consider this place to try out the accommodation.",

That was something we learnt fast when the server looked at us awkwardly after we ordered...<br><br>This was the only place open early enough for breakfast too and it was good!<br><br>We had the tofu soup, green onion pancake with egg (because egg screams breakfast), Xiao long bao (soupy dumplings) and seaweek salad.

The flat whites I&#39;ve ordered from here  have always been excellent without exception. <br><br>The place itself seems a bit soulless and surgical with a minimalist fit out but once you walk in you&#39;re whacked in the face by that aroma and you remember what you&#39;re here for. The staff are also exceedingly positive and friendly. <br><br>They only do coffee here, but they do it well.  If only it was a little more convenient for me it&#39;d surely graduate from once every now and then to regular.",

"reviewcomment":"Main tip for this place - plan in advance and book a table! This place is great for groups, but apparently books up early. My friend and I turned up at about 7pm on a Wednesday and all tables were booked for the night, so we made to huddled at the bar.<br><br>I don&#39;t mind the bar, so this was not a drawback at all for me, and it meant we were close enough to the waiter to order our margaritas (they have quite the variety and make them well)... and actually, speaking of margaritas, they also have a really good tequila collection. I don&#39;t actually remember the last time I saw such a good collection of good tequila (if you&#39;ve only ever done tequila shots you should at least once try good tequila, and for the love of all that is good please don&#39;t just shoot it!)<br><br>The Mexican food was quite good, we had the fajitas, and I was pleased to see that before we even ordered we were given a side of chips with salsa. We ordered the plate for two, and it was more then enough food for the both of us.",

(We had initially planned on Mamak but they had closed for lunch already, and Wagaya Tapas hadn&#39;t opened yet.) However, hunger won out and we ended up ducking into this place. They advertised yum cha til 4 PM, and the place was maybe 2/5 full, and at 3 PM it seemed promising.<br><br>My entire experience was... OK. I wince as I type this. There were 3 of us, and we were ushered to a large table near the front, which was awkward. The yum cha trolley ladies seemed a bit disinterested in peddling their wares and just stood around chatting with each other. Every now and then, someone would come to our table, but more often than not they chose not to approach us and just parked their trolleys off to the side.<br><br>We were a bit disappointed at the lack of dishes coming our way so we decided to order. The staff seem friendly if you ask them something, but due to the language barrier we were confused if they understood our orders or not.<br><br>The dumplings average an &#34;OK.&#34; Some were pretty standard dumplings, some I thought were a bit below average, and some were quite good (like the deep fried scallop one we ordered separately -- that took a while to arrive though. Twenty minutes? Maybe they make it by hand?) I&#39;m not sure I&#39;d come back here though. It was a bit stressful for average food.",

"reviewcomment":"I was in Japan  last year and I didn&#39;t even see this kind of touch screen ordering there.  What ho? This is the business, especially for someone as impatient as I am, and it takes the possibility of a waiter screwing up my order right off the scene. <br><br>It&#39;s &#39;bout bloody time if you ask me and more places should adapt this method! Let&#39;s be honest it&#39;s not like it&#39;s fine dining where you need to be taken through the menu and wine selections. If you&#39;re coming here, it&#39;s because you know and love good Japanese food when you see it. <br><br>There can be no confusion  over what you ordered, you can go to a screen that shows you everything that you have ordered and it&#39;s status. A little animated chef in the corner shows you that it&#39;s being made right now!  Service was super fast. Ordered a beer and Blam, it appeared like a rabbit in a hat trick. <br><br>Sashimi Entree was on the money. Fresh Salmon and Tuna.  King Shitake Mushroom with garlic butter was one of the evening&#39;s specials for a starter. Very hard to go wrong there.<br>$5 Sapporo. してくださいはい ( Yes please!)  They aren&#39;t even that cheap at the bottle shop. <br>Okonomiyaki - which literally means whatever you like, fried in an omelet style. We got the seafood. It was full of delicious Japanese Mayo and BBQ sauce. Bonito flakes on top to boot. <br>But the best thing I had was a single $5.80 Wagyu skewer. I cannot stress enough how good Waygu is. I reckon the marble score was 8 billion on this little baby.  I called it a meat lolly.  droooool. <br><br>Sake.. Yes. All the kinds. Hot and cold and even Japanese moonshine as I call it. It&#39;s made from Potato... come on!! <br><br>Spent a cool hunjy between me and my man, but we were very happy with that.  It reminded us of a sweet ass Izakaya in Harijuku. <br>Open late.",

"reviewcomment":"Cruise Bar is a great stop for a reasonably priced meal with a stunning view or a cheeky little after work beverage with someone you&#39;re sweet on. <br><br>I went to Cruise first on a date. It was a Friday night and I was fairly new to the city. My suitor chose the spot and we met in front of the Contemporary Art Museum. I remember it being particularly balmy and me being equally nervous, so I was glad the walk to the restaurant was a short one. I could have easily ended up in a puddle of hairspray and makeup on the Circular Quay walkway. <br><br>We grabbed a seat at one of the high wooden tables out on the patio facing the magnificent Opera House. The drinks were decent and the conversation was alright, but I couldn&#39;t help feeling like vibe was magical. Don&#39;t tell my date, but I was actually busy lusting after Sydney itself. It&#39;s beauty and charm, especially from that sparkly vantage point, stole my little beating heart.",

Breakfast was lovely. Lots of salmon, a perfectly poached egg, lots of spinach, some fresh and some lightly blanched. Good coffee. <br><br>My coffee took longer than expected to come out, but then my food took over 20 minutes. It was 20 minutes from when I started counting! The place was empty - one other table filled. The service was inattentive, but my waitress was nice enough when she spoke to me. The chick behind the counter was pretty surly.<br><br>It&#39;s a great location, very central and unmissable - right on the point where Enmore Rd and King Street meet, but otherwise unremarkable.

The fish was three large pieces, each of which were perfectly battered (not too thick or too thin) and extremely tasty.  <br><br>Service was fast, friendly, and efficient.  Prices were very reasonable.  Indoor and outdoor seating was available, and it was really quite pleasant outside. Folks were reading and snacking, or having a glass of wine, and just hanging out. We would definitely return and highly recommend trying this place out for lunch or a quick snack.",

We usually get a zataar pizza which is a thin pizza covered in spices - oregano, sesame etc and add haloumi - I thinks it&#39;s only about $5 and also grab a tabouli . This is a great place to grab a quick meal before a comedy show. There are seats both inside and on the pavement but don&#39;t expect anything fancy. This is definitely no frills with great taste.",

Ah well more time to there again soon. <br><br>Called about 4pm to check if there were any spare tables and got a spot for 4 people at 6.30pm. Place was already buzzing when we arrived, considering its still the school holidays we were seated near the doorway on the right. <br><br>Staff are efficient and friendly. Our entree of buffalo mozzarella cheese, prosciutto and warm bread sticks were a hit! <br><br>Followed by the Rocco, Fungi and boscaiola which was on the special board arrived not too long after we had finished our entrees. <br><br>This place is BYO which is great as you don&#39;t have to worry when you have 2 or more bottles of wine to share :D<br><br>I purposely did not fill up on the main just so we could order the Nutella calzone, this is the most delicious, gooey chocolate dessert you will ever have. complete with some flaked almonds and dusted sugar. hmmmm yum!   <br><br>Third time i have been here and it has been a pleasure as usual.",

"reviewcomment":"Nestled in a quiet street in Paddington just off the bustling Oxford Street, The London is one of my favourite pubs in the area. Whether you&#39;re there for the big screen to watch whatever match might be on, or just there to chill out and have a couple of beers, this is an ideal venue. The front bar area has a number of high tables with stalls while out the back there is a small garden area and another indoor area - this one with low tables and seats. <br><br>The pizzas are pretty damn good here too, my most recent outing there seeing me try the prawn and chorizo ($22) - didn&#39;t need any help finishing it (and not because I&#39;m a fat b*stard). They&#39;re a bit pricey, but nevermind, they&#39;re good! As long as you like your thin and crispy pizzas. There&#39;s plenty of other menu choices if you&#39;re not in a carb mood. I&#39;d highly recommend this as an establishment to pop into if you&#39;re in the area!",

Having ignored Chinese food for a long time, it was time to get back in the game with dumplings, dumplings and more dumplings. <br><br>We ordered the streamed prawn dumplings to share. 10 per serve for about $12, they were excellent, the prawns tasted really fresh and the dumplings themselves were quite large. Vegetarian dumplings were also a must, as was the short soup- really tasty pork dumplings. <br><br>Veggo friend, and Dumpling King regular, ordered the eggplant in garlic sauce which was amazing, served in a hotpot it was just the perfect amount of sticky sweet with garlic savouriness. <br><br>My shared dumplings, short soup and jasmine tea cost less than $15.

Nevertheless, such a good cider! Not too sweet, crisp and delicious with heaps of apple-y flavour. Must have been so popular they had to move to keep up with demand and I&#39;m not surprised. The gent at the bar was super friendly, the bar menu looked good and reasonably priced (although limited) and the older couple next to me said everything they ordered was delicious. Decor was dimmed lighting and dark woods, and I loved it. Very comfy and homey without being old or must feeling.

When I have a hamburger I want a big thick slab of quality beef mince and I want a pile of onion and BEETROOT.<br>Today I was in Newtown and had a hamburger craving so I went to Burgerlicious and had the Newtown Burger. At $9.00 it is a bit expensive for a hamburger but honestly for what the burger is it is worth it. It comprises of Angus beed, grilled onion, bacon, free- range egg (I like happy chooks), tomato, lettuce and most importantly beetroot, the perfect ingredients for the perfect hamburger. <br>Burgerlicious is delicious!",

"reviewcomment":"The decor makes me think of a diner out of a Flintstones cartoon. And just like the Flintstones era, when electricity hadn&#39;t been invented yet, this place is dark. &#34;Dimly lit&#34; is a nicer way of putting it, I guess. But this place is d-a-r-k, even though my friends and I arrived earlyish at 7 PM for dinner.<br><br>I ordered:<br>- Confuse Di Mouth. I got it because I&#39;m a sucker for cheese and this is one of the few dogs with cheese. It was really good. Though the chef forgot to put ketchup on mine so it arrived on the side, which is actually perfect because I don&#39;t like ketchup.<br><br>We shared:<br>- double bean nachos<br>- salsa fries<br>- hot wings<br>All really good but hallelujah for the hot wings!!! I miss my chicken wings! I don&#39;t want to go all the way to Parramatta for Hooters and I&#39;m desperately missing my wings. Will definitely have wings again the next time I visit.<br><br>The best place to experience this place is with a group of friends, because having a hotdog on top of wings AND nachos AND fries by yourself is a little too much...<br><br>Service is pretty good. We didn&#39;t have reservations but we were able to get a table pretty quickly. Though we table-hopped quite a bit when other (better) tables became free. Finally ended up in a booth (which was nice because it wasn&#39;t as dark) which we had to vacate later on because someone had reserved it.<br><br>Meals ordered at around 7-7:30ish came surprisingly quick, though when another friend arrived later that night her hotdog came in around 40 minutes. It was busier than, but they did apologize for the long wait.<br><br>Also when my friends and I were taking, um, group selfies, the chef (who was chillin&#39; nearby) offered to take our photos for us. Now that&#39;s service! Thank you, kind sir. :P<br><br>Later that evening, they cleared some of the tables to make way for a dance floor.",

"reviewcomment":"Finally got a chance to check this place out after having walked past it every day for a month.  It&#39;s got a great look to it, sort of a mash of hispter cool and 1920&#39;s art deco.  Anyway, we swung in for a late breakfast on a Saturday, and grabbed a table inside because all of the outside perches were full.  The vibe and the decor in here are perfect for a lazy Saturday, although if I were hungover, it might have been a little bright to my liking.  The seats against the wall were reclaimed theater style chairs, which were super comfortable. So much so that I broke my usual rule of not sitting on the same side as the wife, and plopped down next to her.<br><br>Anyway, we ordered up a couple of coffees which were done just right, a flat white for me and a long black for Gwen. Nothing crazy, but well done.  The menu is sparse, but has something for everyone, and I prefer a tight menu where you know they&#39;re confident in the items they serve up.<br><br>I had the smoked salmon something-or-other, which was beautiful. Lot&#39;s of delicious smoked salmon over sturdy toast with some kind of creme-fraiche type topping. It was recommended by the waitress, and it was just what I needed, not too heavy, but really filling. The wife had the mushroom salad and added some chicken to it, she said it was A-ok, so we were both stuffed. I also threw in a croissant because they were calling my name from across the restaurant through the glass case. Toasted up nicely, it was probably more than I needed, but who cares.<br><br>All in all, friendly place that&#39;s laid back, but takes their food and drinks seriously, a winner just up the road from home.",

Our group was beyond disappointed, but we decided to give the place a go anyways. <br><br>Glad we stayed, because I had a fantastic seafood chowder in a bread bowl. Yes folks a proper bread bowl. First time I&#39;ve seen this in Australia and it was delicious. So much flavor in the chowder and so much seafood! I would go back just for the chowder. <br><br>Still disappointed that I never got to try the ramen, but glad I finally stopped by to try the food.",

We got the vegetrian DIY rice paper rolls and the stir fried tofu &amp; mushrooms with lemongrass and chili for two to share. The rolls were plenty (12) and the fillings were just enough. The tofu &amp; mushrooms were great but way too spicy for me! My bad, forgot to tell them to go easy on the chili. It got served with rice which was good cos of the chili but we didn&#39;t order it and got charged $3 which I thought was weird.<br>In the end we were pretty stuffed and probably  the rice paper rolls would have been good enough. The total was about $60 including a glass of wine each.<br>We had a great night with great friends and yummy food and would totally come back when back in town!",

"reviewcomment":"If you like a good simple baguette you&#39;ll like this place. If however, like me, you like plentiful amounts of delicious meat, coupled with an equally delicious cheese in an awesome roll you&#39;ll LOVE this place. <br><br>Encasa Deli is a great lunch option in the CBD. While it&#39;s not in the most glamorous location it is nicely fit out and inviting. There&#39;s a small deli with ranges of cheese, chorizo and hams but the main appeal here is the Boccadilo&#39;s. These are fairly minimalist baguettes but those few fillings are amazing. <br><br>I went for the Canario (roast pork leg, queso fresco, roast capsicum mojo and tomato). The capsicum &#39;mojo&#39; and the tomato are mixed in with the pork so it&#39;s essentially just flavoured pork + cheese. I say &#39;just&#39; which definitely doesn&#39;t do the roll justice, the pork was juicy and flavoursome, the lightly salted baguette good and  the cheese probably the highlight which took the roll to another level.<br><br>I&#39;ve already got my eye on the calamari roll or chorizo roll for my next visit.",

"reviewcomment":"We attacked I Thai en masse two days after Christmas for a giant banquet with family, extended family, and one guy who we realised afterwards was probably a hobo because it turned nobody in our party had ever laid eyes on him before. Fortune favours the hungry.  <br><br>We cherry-picked from the menu and ordered only a few dishes, but a tonne of them. The satay skewers (tender &amp; smothered) and the curry puffs (moist, in the best sense of the word) started us off, followed by the penang curry (creamy), the pad thai (noodly) and the salt &amp; pepper calamari, which went largely uneaten as we were so full from its predecessors. I&#39;m a Thai freak, and had no complaints with the food, although we didn&#39;t the more adventurous stuff thanks to some of the more conservative in-laws present (I&#39;m looking at you here Nanna. C&#39;mon, grow a pair why don&#39;t you?) My fave dish was the coconut ice cream, served in a (plastic) drinking glass. I&#39;m a sucker for this dish though, so . . . <br><br>Only one whinge, and its a minor one - when we asked to take some of the food home they dumped plastic takeaway containers on the table and made us shovel the leftovers into them instead of doing it for us in the kitchen. Oh, and the waitresses didn&#39;t get some of my jokes. So, two complaints.",

Slightly crispy on the outside and flaky on the inside.  Not too thick or thin, and had that coal fired bottom that I love.  <br><br>The pizzas here are the perfect size for sharing (if you&#39;re not that hungry) but I ate this whole pizza by myself. Yum!<br><br>Definitely go here and check this place out.<br><br>The interior is amazing as well and the people who work here are very friendly and the service is great.<br><br>The whole restaurant is open and you can actually see them cooking the pizzas which is awesome.",

"reviewcomment":"Good ol&#39; Benny B huh? He knew I was going to love this place and made sure it was on our eating schedule when I paid a quick visit to Sydney. <br><br>Maybe it was the delightful wine list featuring loads of European drops and unusual varieties including a number from the Jura and some orange/cloudy wines. Maybe it was the chalkboard menus with a diverse selection of drinks by the glass, or the olive trees upstairs on the balcony. Maybe it was the cosy atmosphere, tables almost touching one another and a feeling in the air that everyone was there for one big dinner party. Or perhaps it was the food menu, small in comparison to the wine menu but certainly just as impressive. From anchovy dip with pretzels to fried calamari, olives, beetroot/ricotta salad and plates of puttanesca spaghetti; the food really hit the spot. Was it the Fernet (!) icecream we had at the end that pushed me over the edge in to downright love for 10 William, or a combination of all these things?<br><br>Either way, I wish I lived around the corner so I could pop in here for quick snacks, leisurely meals or late night glasses of wine.

SUSHI SUMA DID IT !<br><br>The set dinners are good for 2 people (guarantee that both of you will leave the restaurant with smiles on your face!) and it costs less than $40 ! (without any drinks) How awesome is that? <br><br>Reason #2 - Good food<br><br>Agedashi tofu : Tofu is lightly battered and deep fried , served with the warm soy-based sauce, YUM <br><br>Sashimi : Take a bite and you know it&#39;s fresh. <br><br>Tonkatsu - YUM YUM<br><br>Reason #3 - Service<br><br>Service is FAST. This helps especially if you were starving !<br><br>The negatives include 1) Tables are slightly *too* close to one another. It is difficult NOT to hear the conversation at the table next to you 2) The couch seat is kinda worn out....hence not very comfortable to sit on. <br><br>Highly recommended , two thumbs up !",

There are three branches of Bill&#39;s laid back, rustic-chic and delicious restaurants. The Woollahra version, although not the original, is arguably the best for a lazy Sunday morning brunch because of its outdoor courtyard. I&#39;d say that it&#39;s good to get here early - but even then, you&#39;re like to encounter a queue. The reason for this is that it&#39;s just so damn wonderful. Icy cold and refreshing fruit juices and smoothies are just the beginning of a perfect breakfast. Followed by freshly roasted coffee, crisp and light corn fritters with sweet tomatoes and vitamin-bursting spinach, there&#39;s fewer healthier and more enjoyable ways to start the day. The only tough part to this experience is the agonising dilemma between the ricotta hotcakes, served with banana and honeycomb butter that oozes lavishly between the layers of fluffy hotcake, and the aforementioned corn fritters. So it&#39;s quite expensive for breakfast - $18 for the corn fritters. But, considering this would well do for lunch too, it&#39;s an absolute bargain.<br><br>Bills also has a lunch time menu, which I&#39;m sure is no less delicious than the breakfast feast. However, as a traditionalist, the first visit should be at breakfast time for brunch. Lunch is the reason you come back.",

"reviewcomment":"This is a pretty good alternative to Makoto .. 2nd best sushi train in Sydney perhaps ?<br><br>I went here today because I didn&#39;t want to wait for a seat at Makoto during the dinner rush. It&#39;s a nice looking place right opposite the Capitol Theatre. There is decent variety and it&#39;s certainly fresh and not far off Makoto standards. They have all the good stuff, salmon sashimi, scampi sashimi, all types of fish sashimi and also have a varied a la carte menu. The soft shell crab roll was pretty good, they have some original combinations here that set them apart from your average sushi train.<br><br>The prices are on par with Makoto and you would be satisfied with this place if you&#39;re super fussy. It is close to the Makoto but just not quite better !",

"reviewcomment":"Ricky Ocambo use to own Carabella a Spanish restaurant that specialised in tapas, paella and other Spanish regional dishes.  After a 3 year break he has returned with Ricky&#39;s cafe under the bridge.<br><br>Ricky&#39;s claims to have sourced the best suppliers of organic food and the perfect sourdough which is a great combination of crusty and sour sourced by a French artisan.  Another artisan creates the exquisite pastries seen in Ricky&#39;s.  <br><br>The coffee is perfect for the purists and for the foam milky lovers like myself.  Jams are interesting too with flavours like Strawberry and Pinot Noir and Rhubarb and Rasberry.  The honey is from Piedmonte in Italy but I have yet to indulge in a jar.<br><br>We have been at Milsons Point at 7am and still have not managed to get seating but its on the cards every weekend to beat that crowd and enjoy the food treasures we have only observed while waiting in line for our takeaway.",

Not for the faint hearted this one , there are spicy Sichuan peppers and chillies floating in the broth which is as flavourful as it&#39;s spicy.. The mixed hotspot options gets you two soups and we chose the white soup and the hot soup combination.. If you love spice and not the Nando&#39;s variety mind you, you have come to the right place.. Order your sides of meat, seafood, vegetables as you please and drop them in the hotpot in the centre of your table , and then blissfully watch it bubble away, with the aroma of mouth watering anticipation filling you.. Oh and they do free refills of soft drinks from their machine, which you would need when downing those chillies.. A big thumbs up from me for delicious hotpot fare..

"reviewcomment":"Everything about Chinese Noodle Restaurant is bizarre but it&#39;s an experience. It could be the ceiling adorned in fake plastic grape vines bulging with bunches of plastic grapes? Maybe it&#39;s the violin playing owner who does string renditions of popular songs to entertain the line of people out the front? Or maybe it&#39;s the restaurant&#39;s proximity to Chinese Noodle House, a neighbouring restaurant that&#39;s an almost a mirror image of it?<br><br>Embrace the crazy and you will be rewarded with some of the best dumplings in the city. I have tried all of the types of dumplings they serve and they are all so tasty. Order at will, but don&#39;t go overboard, most are a serve of 12!",

"reviewcomment":"Wow wow wow what a surprise this place was.  A really yummy find.  I dont normally like a too heavy meat meal but I&#39;d happily eat here every day!<br>Went there for dinner last night with my boyfriend.  For starters we had criolla and pollo empanadas and they were sooo delicious they set the whole evening off lovely.  For mains we had a grill plate with rump steak, pork neck and chicken thigh.  Its worth noting that I am a very plain eater and very fussy with meat.  I thought I would only eat the chicken but the rump steak was absolutley the winner.  And the chimichurri that goes on top of it... Hmm salivating thinking about it.  <br>We got Papas estrelladas as a side dish and being Irish I have high potato standards :)  they did not disappoint.  Drink wise I had a sangria and he had a litre of argentenian beer.  We skipped dessert.  We were so glad we found this place.  The staff were great; attentive without being overbearing. And the atmosphere there was lovley.  Fun decor too with some really great old photos about.  I will definitely be back!",

I imagine this place would be quite busy during the working week with numerous office buildings nearby but during the weekend it is laid back and they supply daily newspapers and current magazines so it is good place to catch up on current affairs. They advertise free wifi but I haven&#39;t had a chance to use it.<br><br>The menu is quite varied but I&#39;ve yet to try anything more than a pastry so I can&#39;t really comment.

"reviewcomment":"L&#39;etoile is definitely a star restaurant in Paddington.  Just the venue is enough to make any hopeless romantic swoon.  It&#39;s housed in a Victorian Terrace on a quiet Paddington side street, with a quaint outdoor seating area of white tablecloths and white umbrellas.  I&#39;m quite picky when it comes to French food, but I had reigned in my hesitation when I found out that celebrity chef Manu Feildel runs the kitchen.  Though I truly don&#39;t buy into the celebrity chef trend, this restaurant was recommended to me by someone who knows Manu personally.  The ambience is great.  There isn&#39;t an ostentatious display of a wannabe Parisian attitude, but there is a palpable French presence.  <br><br>L&#39;etoile is open for both lunch and dinner, though I had the opportunity to enjoy the latter.  Yes, it&#39;s expensive.  Entrees are around $20 for a small portion of salad or chicken terrine.  I had the beetroot salad with goat curd, which was phenomenal!  As for my plat principaux, I had a fantastic pork belly with roasted fennel and a jus au cidre.  It was around $40, but so worth it!  The service was very attentive, but nothing exceptional.  I would surely return.",

This time we tried to tone things down a notch by &#39;only&#39; ordering the mixed dips ($15), the chicken shawarma ($17) and the lamb mansaf ($24) with no dessert. It was still way too much food and a lot of it went to waste, but we loved every bite of what we did manage to eat.

"reviewcomment":"This is an area of Sydney populated by a lot of locals and less tourists, great! I had a very generous portion of really good Bruschetta, nicely spiced a looooot of fresh tomato on it, couldn&#39;t finish because I wanted to try a pizza. Ordered a Napolitana, nothing spectacular, but just good.<br>Service was friendly and quick, prices also fine, 35$ including a cappuccino and an Espresso, plus soft drink. They have a BYO bottle service for just 5,50 corkage fee, bottle shop just some meters down the road if you want to save some bucks on the vine...<br>I would come again, but in this little corner are so many nice places I want to try...so it has to wait a bit...",

"reviewcomment":"The Landsdowne is an iconic pub on City Road opposite Victoria Park at Broadway. Clientele range from locals, tradies, uni students and people following the live music scene so emo kids, punk rockers and heavily tattooed heavy metal fans along with those dressed entirely in black - (not to be too specific, trying to paint a picture here!) Another great live music venue just check the schedule online so you don&#39;t turn up wanting melodic indie tunes and end up with heavy metal. Or vice versa.<br><br>Upstairs is another bar, bistro and courtyard/deck, with seriously cheap food. Like $7 steaks and whatever the current equivalent may be. The menu is actually organised according to price, with $7 meals, $10 meals, $12.50 meals or wait, step back, $16 meals. With most pubs in the area and their swanky bistros, $16 would be considered cheap. Not at the Landsdowne, serving up pub meals the way they are supposed to be served - with lots of change left for beer.",

Really, I should have seen it coming from the moment we ordered succulent fried chicken as an entree. Throw in soft Arancini balls, homemade fusilli with truffle oil and individual banoffee pies, and clearly I am lucky the seams of my dress didn&#39;t just spontaneously split. We were also treated to an experimental desert - upside-down pumpkin pie. Hopefully this dish makes it to the menu, because the mix of creamy pumpkin, cinnamon and toffee flavours is something special. <br><br>Bootleg is dark and cosy, the perfect place to grab a cocktail or enjoy a feast.

"reviewcomment":"Holy. Cake. <br><br>I&#39;ll admit it, I went in for a savory snack (it&#39;s tough to avoid this picturesque cafe on Queen Street), but was immediately diverted by the large window of cake. It practically reached up, smacked me around, then hugged me in a warm, buttery embrace. And I couldn&#39;t get enough. Seriously, I picked up three (THREE!) slices of cake to take away - the gluten-free almond orange cake, the lemon-lime tart and the tiramisu. Okay, so I also got a soft, almond finger biscotti dipped in chocolate. <br><br>Let&#39;s be honest  - I was completely blinded by their dessert science, so don&#39;t expect this to be a balanced review by any means.

The whole menu is fairly rich but doesn&#39;t amount to too much guilt if you&#39;re sharing...or focusing on the liquid part.",

"reviewcomment":"I used to work down the street from Berkelouw&#39;s and it was a costly exercise. Every time I was bored, I would slip out for five minutes and come back with a handful of paperbacks. They would mount in a pile of shame as my bank balance decreased into a much smaller pile of shame. The store is divided into two halves, with the ground floor housing the new books and various cute notebooks, housewares, and other items. The upper floor contains the secondhand and antiquarian books and a large collection of extremely obscure secondhand CDs. There are some fairly interesting albums up here, if only for pure &#34;how did this ever get pressed?&#34; value. Not to mention the potential of spurring a curio purchase and finding a new favourite.<br><br>This upper floor also houses a relaxed wine bar which features live jazz vocal performances. The quality of the performers is a mixed bag, with one night bringing a piano and vocal duo and another bringing a woman singing as she played an upright drum. My tastes skew far more to the former than the latter, but perhaps the upright drum might be your thing. The bar serves wine (obviously) along with a basic selection of spirits and beer for those inclined for something a little different.",

"reviewcomment":"Grill&#39;d reminds me so much of my time in Melbourne, the vibe inside is definitely a little hipster. They were one of the first posh/alternative fast food places to fill that gap at the time with only real competition of Nandos. As a student, it was a real treat compared to Maccas or Hungry Jacks and still is today.<br><br>GRASS FED LEAN BEEF WITH CHEESE, MUSTARD &amp; PICKLE<br>Crisp bread that melts in your mouth, juicy but lean patty and sourness of the pickle go well together. The cheese melted on the patty does add flavour and texture. Great slider.<br><br>GRASS FED LEAN BEEF WITH POMEGRANATE &amp; MILD WASABI SLAW<br>Slaw was fresh and crisp and a sauce pleasant with a light wasabi kick well balanced with the pomegranate flavour which didn&#39;t overpower the essence of the burger. I really like the combo.<br><br>GRILLED CHICKEN BREAST WITH POMEGRANATE &amp; MILD WASABI SLAW<br>I would not say that chicken is one of Grill&#39;d&#39;s fortes. The chicken one was my least favourite on my first visit and did not order again as you can see in the photo, breast tends to dry out when grilled specially off the bone. Just as tasty as the beef version but beef is still much better.<br><br>CHIPS<br>These fat chips are among the best from a food franchise. Always crispy on the edges with smooth potato centres. Combined with their herb and Mayo sauce, these are so yummy. This is the regular size, more than enough for two to share! order the snack size if you&#39;re not that hungry specially if you&#39;re having a burger too.<br><br>Conclusion<br>The sliders are a welcome addition to an aging menu. Although I would still come to grill just because of the nostalgia, confidence of quality every time and the bonus of it being healthier than the norm. <br>Grill&#39;d is one of the most consistent franchises in terms of execution of the menu and service across NSW and VIC. All the branches that I have been to have varying levels of quality but all still above a very good benchmark. My all time favourite is the Almighty a.k.a The Lot (or I like to remember it as the Mighty Melbourne which I think is its original name). <br><br>@thesydneynoob",

The food is delicious. We had the Melitzanosalata (eggplant dip), the Spanakopita (spinach leek fetta dill pie)- YUM!! And the slow roasted lamb shoulder - freaking delicious!! Wild greens as a side and for dessert the Hazelnut Baklava #drooling . I&#39;ve heard great things about the Greek Doughnut balls - will definitely try this next time.<br><br>Loved: Everything about this place- second to Chiswick - It&#39;s become one of my favourite Sydney restaurant. It&#39;s so impressive when you walk in, I was expecting it to be a lot more expensive then it was and the staff were very honest and helpful with our order (they deserve a mention).<br><br>Love Bangers x",

"reviewcomment":"Met friends who were travelling from the UK here. As locals, we found the food to be reasonably good for this side of Darling Harbour. They were offering a special for $37 that included a starter and main or main and dessert with a glass of wine or beer. Quite a bargain really. For a mid-week meal/special, it was good value considering you could order anything off the standard menu (except the oysters). Our travelling friends really enjoyed the meal and with the backdrop of a sparkling Sydney harbour skyline, we all left happy. <br>Meals that were had included garlic prawns, steak, barramundi, pasta and cheesecake. In short, it was good without being a gastronomic delight.",

"reviewcomment":"Great location. Love the layout of the main floor: sandstone walls, with a clear view into the open kitchen. Despite a good amount of tables and other patrons, the place was not noisy.  <br><br>The service was outstanding, but not overbearing. Staff were there when I needed them but didn&#39;t pester me. <br><br>Food was a mix of amazing (pork belly starter $18.90 - best I&#39;ve had), really good (chocolate mousse cake with chili ice cream), to really good after seasoning (300 g rib eye surf and turf $39.90 and 400 g NY cut striploin for $42.90).  Both steaks were tender and cooked to perfection - but just calling our for some salt and pepper. <br><br>Their beer selection was limited, but good quality. I had two Mexican beers I hadn&#39;t tried before (Day of the Dead - both a blonde and a Heffe for $9.90/bottle). <br><br>Honestly, if the steak had been seasoned a bit before hitting the grill, this would be a 5 star review, but it just wasn&#39;t there. Sorry, Dan, it&#39;s another 4 star from me.",

"reviewcomment":"Cheap, predictable, quick. Perfect for lunch, takeaway, or a snack later in the day. The service is friendly, and they&#39;re eager to seat you so waiting isn&#39;t too bad...mostly during the day the line in the door seems to be split for takeaway and seating, so don&#39;t be put off by the size of the queue. On the down side, it can be claustrophobic because it is such a tight space and having ten people waiting in the doorway behind you is a bit off-putting. Edamame are always tasty and I really like their eggplant tempura. Some of the rolls with chicken schnitzel bits in them are surprisingly yummy too, and the kewpie mayo they put on or you can buy to go is a nice addition.<br><br>I really need to figure out what the appropriate response to their enthusiastic greeting is though...feel awkward and kind of rude never replying to such an energetic welcome.",

It&#39;s relatively cheap ($12-15 per plate), and the food comes out quickly. <br><br>All that being said, I don&#39;t feel like raving about this place. The service was pretty terrible (just two really unobservant blokes - I think the waitress is better but she was working just in the other room). As a large table we went through a bottle of water very quickly, and it took a loooooooong time to get another one. Thirsty work. <br><br>The vegetarian food was pretty good - great Fattoush and the foule (bean moosh) was tasty too. The meat isn&#39;t anything to write home about - it was dry and a little overcooked. The vine leaves were also a bit dry. For dessert they brought us complimentary sweet tea and turkish delight (which probably isn&#39;t called turkish delight in this restaurant), which was a nice touch. I can also recommend the baklava  - a well balanced mix of honey and pastry. <br><br>All in all, It&#39;s cheap and cheerful, but nothing special.",

I have never had a more sugary dessert in my life. I felt a little sick after eating it. The passionfruit flavour was overwhelming and I think the flavour of the souffle should have been balanced out by a sorbet flavour other than passionfruit. To be honest I would have preferred some kind of chocolate dessert at the end of the meal. I saw some chocolate tarts being brought out to other tables that had ordered a la carte, and they looked fantastic.<br><br>Service was mixed - some waiters were very jovial and laid-back while others seemed to take themselves a bit too seriously.

"reviewcomment":"With a couple of outdoor seats and not many more inside, this small Japanese restaurant doesn&#39;t look like much, but when the food comes out you don&#39;t care about that! In an area with a number of Japanese restaurants, you have to do something special to make people come back, and this Masuya has nailed it. <br><br>I decided on the mixed sashimi don along with a serving of the teriyaki salmon to share. The salmon was delicious if a little sickly with the thick sauce, but the freshness of the sashimi helped compliment this, combining into one fine meal! <br><br>The service was prompt but not rushed which I always appreciate if I&#39;m not settling in for a marathon meal. I&#39;m all for trying different places, but this place will definitely be getting a visit from me again. Lucky them!",

"reviewcomment":"I was searching for lunch in Balmain and wandering the streets when I heard the word &#34;Reuben&#34; and was stopped in my tracks. While in NYC recently I had fallen in love with these pastrami filled beasts with their oh so tender and flavourful meat *drools*.<br><br>So when I started enquiring inside about if the sandwich was served on rye bread, I noticed to my dismay that they used.corned beef and not pastrami .... :-(<br><br>But... I had already sat down, and still needed lunch, so as is my way, I ordered their burger. I had intended as a backup plan to try their kransky hot pot special, but it appears it had already sold out. AND THE BURGER WAS DELICIOUS!!!<br><br>Next to the mass of thin fries (that were so plentyful I could not get through them all) was a burger consisting of a juicy burger lavished with bacon, cheese, caramelised onions and plenty of love. Even the bun was awesome, giving me good purchase as I demolished this amazing lunch item. Even thinking about this burger now just makes me drool...<br><br>I them finished off the meal with a nice little mac. It was pretty damm nice (though not as good as the burger...). That said... it was still one of the better cafes I have found in Sydney, and so well worth checking out if in the area.<br><br>Cafe Summary<br>------------------------<br>Passion for Coffee                - 7/10<br>Coffee beans                        - Morgan&#39;s coffee<br>Crema (1=burnt, 10=velvet)  - 7/10<br>Special coffees avail?           - N/A<br><br>Special Features<br>------------------------<br>Toilets",

Let&#39;s just say I politely disagree with Mad Mex on this one :)<br><br>I would say the food is a health oriented version of stereotypical mexican staples much like what you would eat at a decent mexican restaurant polished up for white people in Southwest USA, quite nice indeed, specially for a chain restaurant. <br><br>Hubby loved his own barbacoa burrito so much he actually convinced me to go back a few hours later for a top up. <br><br>Note to self: gotta get back for churros con chocolate one of this days.",

Everything seems crazy expensive in Sydney but this place is a gem for sure. 6 bucks for an out of this world Indian wrap? Hell yeah.",

"reviewcomment":"I&#39;m sorry, who do I talk to about getting wagamama in California? I&#39;ve known about it for a very long time (I swear on my life there was one in NYC but I can&#39;t seem to dig up any info on it) and was excited to learn that there was a location immediately next to my hotel.  So, one rainy evening, I walked over to have some ramen and beer.<br><br>I wasn&#39;t overly concerned with authenticity as I&#39;ve seen in a couple other reviews, I just wanted to go to a wagamama and eat some ramen.  It wasn&#39;t very crowded so I found a spot right away.  I ordered the Chili Beef Ramen and an Asahi.  Both came out quickly and the ramen hit the spot.  It was flavorful, very spicy and warmed me up.  The cold beer was the perfect complement to wash it all down.<br><br>I decided to treat myself to dessert.  I wanted to try the Lychee ice cream, but it didn&#39;t come with a wasabi chocolate sauce like some of the other dessert options had.  My waitress though was gracious enough to give me a side of the sauce, at no extra charge, with the ice cream.  Have you ever tried Lychee ice cream with chocolate wasabi sauce? Probably not, cause I&#39;m pretty sure I&#39;m the only person that&#39;s done it, or at least I&#39;m going to claim that.  But you should do it cause it&#39;s UH-MAZING.<br><br>Please Wagamama, please expand beyond your East coast US locations!",

The owners are very friendly and if you are lucky (and have children like I do) you always get a little extra with the coffee in the shape of a Freddie Frog or Smarties!<br><br>The food is good, the coffee is great and the staff are friendly. The only drawback is early morning when the place is literally flooded by groups of cyclists. Trying to get a table is a nightmare. As a result, if I want to drink in between 7-8am, I will go elsewhere because of this. I don&#39;t have anything against the cyclists, but the cafe is not big enough to accommodate everyone. Either that or a take-away.<br><br>But if you are in this area of Oxford Street, it&#39;s the best coffee on Oxford Street from the Paddington Town Hall right up to the top by Centennial Park.

This Japanese isn&#39;t your typical sushi and bento box joint.<br><br>I like that the chef has actually allowed classic Japanese dishes be influenced by other various cuisines just like the population of Sydney. I would say the menu is pretty unique. The sashimi was very fresh great starter for two.<br><br>Ordered safe with the chicken it wasn&#39;t fried to crispy ash, still was moist in its textured shell. The chilli mayo was a great dip was tasty accompanied with some Japanese style white rice.<br><br>As the adventurous choice, the duck soup on noodles was a good gamble.  Rich broth with great depth of flavour with mushroom and with a subtle smokey after taste. Noodles had some bite to it and the top half was fried Chinese style giving it a good mixed of textures. Each spoon made me beg for more, add a mushroom here, a piece of tender duck there. Its a dish with personality that allows for the diner to personalise it making the experience pretty unique.<br><br>Just a side note, I don&#39;t know for sure if they usually play a set of romantic tunes but if they don&#39;t great awareness of the staff to do so as there were mainly tables of two at the time.<br><br>Conclusion<br>Finally,  great presentation,  ambience and Japanese hospitality at its best. Can&#39;t wait to try the other dishes on this creative menu.<br><br>@thesydneynoob",

"reviewcomment":"I would rate two Italian restaurants in the city, Machiavelli and Intermezzo (the &#39;newcomer&#39;). <br><br>Machiavelli is the old classic and it has been around since the late 80s and it has seen politicians, business men and everything else in between. I&#39;m sure many political and business plots were hatched here ;-)<br><br>A classic touch is added by the Italian meats and salamis hanging in the centre of the room and you will meet those meats and salamis again on your antipasto plate. The stuffed zucchini flowers are and absolute delight and chicken soup is the perfect dish for me during the colder months.<br><br>Their pastas are delicious and I am a fan of their Saltimbocca, make sure you try it!<br><br>The service is impeccable and if you need to impress old or new business associates, this is the perfect spot.",

"reviewcomment":"Pay no heed to the odd number of weapons adorning the restaurant, this place means you no harm. The staff are sweet and non-judgmental, and happy to suggest dishes if you can&#39;t decide. <br><br>This is not your average Indian restaurant. For starters, they say it&#39;s Indian and Pakistani, and you can taste the difference. The curries have a delicate flavour, not heavy and oily, but packed with flavour and fresh with a variety of herbs and spices. <br><br>I can never decide what to order because there is SO MUCH on the menu that looks amazing. The only solution is to keep coming back. I&#39;m a big fan of their okra dishes, and the chicken claypot special is always amazing. The seafood is fresh and the meat is tender. A lot of the dishes have coriander, lamb, okra and ginger, things like that. Often together. Just writing this review is making my stomach all grumbly. The serving sizes look small at first, but the curries are rich and filling. The jasmine rice has lemon zest and other goodies hidden within. <br><br>It&#39;s rare for me to get so excited about having dinner that I start thinking about it at breakfast time. But Lal Qila has that effect on me. Oh the anticipation...",

A variety of dishes were devoured by the seven of us (a green curry, several spicy pork belly dishes, a pad thai, a spicy steak dish, and a massaman curry).  All of them were great.  Prices seemed pretty reasonable, the food was quickly at hand, and our water glasses never ran empty. The only reason I&#39;m not giving a full five stars is because the table was kinda sticky and probably need a wipe down, but otherwise the place seemed super clean.  Weird that they missed the table, but sometimes that&#39;s life.  Come here - you&#39;ll like it.",

"reviewcomment":"Awesome little cafe on Alison road.  Read some good reviews and was meeting some friends for lunch, one of which is Gluten Intolerant and decided to come here as the menu had GF and Veggie Options.<br><br>We met here on a Saturday afternoon and sat outside. The view isn&#39;t great as its just cars passing by but it was still a nice day out.<br><br>I ordered a chai latte and it was yummy.  My friends ordered the salmon benedict breakfast and the gluten free fields mushroom bruschetta - which was mushroom and cheese. I ordered the field mushroom eggs benedict.  We all decided on the half portion sizes.<br><br>The food came out within ten minutes and we were all pretty hungry by then. I cut into my mushroom and noticed that where there was supposed to be egg was cheese.  I realized that they gave me the mushroom bruschetta instead so I told the waitress. She apologized and took it back. My friends had already started eating so I just had to wait another 6-7 minutes before getting the right order. <br><br>When it came out my friends were also done but the egg was nicely poached and the hollandaise was creamy and delicious.  The field mushrooms were nice and flavorful and the multigrain bread was also very tasty.   Overall a very good, healthy and filling meal. Can&#39;t imagine how full we&#39;d be if we had gotten the full portions!  Definitely will come back.  Good service, good food.",

"reviewcomment":"Ultimo has always had a serious lack of good cafes. Well, that was until Project 8 was born. <br><br>Recently opened, Project 8 has that part relaxed part hip and all awesome vibe going on that other cafes strive so hard to achieve. They do it so effortlessly that it almost seems to have come about by happy mistake. They are in their opening few weeks and the service is refreshingly enthusiastic and friendly. Eugene and Mariana were both lovely to talk to and will genuinely make you feel right at home. Here&#39;s hoping the service continues to remain upbeat as the café&#39;s popularity grows but I don&#39;t doubt that it will.<br><br>The breakfast and lunch menu offers open toasties, a mix of sandwiches, healthy salads and baked hot pots. Freshly baked treats, such as brownies, almond biscuits and banana bread, line the front cabinets and you can also find coffee, tea, frappes and smoothies. The mango and coconut smoothie ($4.50) with real mango chunks and the right amount of sweet was spot on to the way I like it.<br><br>Timber benches with stools deck out the main area, a few couches can be found in the back and a quieter study nook upstairs is perfect for the local uni students. There is also free wifi. <br><br>A loyalty card with a free cup of coffee after every nine bought will help to encourage regulars.<br><br>Project 8 definitely has me intrigued and I can&#39;t wait to get back to try their food.",

She has no part, not a skerrick, of anything that ends with &#39;oodle&#39;. <br>Thing is, GK is the smartest, fastest, funniest, playful, gentle, loving little creature that any geneticist could invent. She took the best of whatever went into the mix. If she didn&#39;t shed so much that our house now has carpet where there used to be floor boards then she&#39;d be perfect. Actually she is perfect.<br>Thats what Vietnam did with its cuisine. It absorbed and refined whatever was thrown at it. Pate on a bread roll? - thanks France, with asian flavours mixed with BBQ chook that any Texan would be proud of. Coriander, hot chillies, sweet pickled carrot, crack meth or what ever else they put in that hooks you like an addict. Nothing like it anywhere else in the world.<br>This place is packed every day. The chook rolls are fantastic. They take some eating and if you can finish one without spilling sauce and dribbling something down your chin then you are a better man than me Gunga Din. <br>And, $5 for a chook roll and even cheaper for a pork roll. I reckon Vietnamese is the best cuisine anywhere. Word.",

"reviewcomment":"My friends and I were looking to eat something different - something other than Thai food, so we decided to get Lebanese.  We came here on a Wednesday night, was relatively empty. It&#39;s BYO and Obama just won the presidency, so I had to buy some champagne to celebrate. What&#39;s great is there&#39;s no corkage fee!<br><br>There was so much to choose from on the menu so we decided on the Mixed Mazza Banquet menu for $30.  You get Humous, Tabouli, Baba ganouge, Falafel, Lady Fingers, Vine Leaves, Mixed Veges, Shish Kebabs, Garlic Chicken &amp; Kafta and you finish with Lebanese Coffee &amp; Baclava.  There was a ton of food and it came out fairly fast.  The food was delicious and filling.

"reviewcomment":"When you head to Rushcutters Bay, you are more than likely heading for the picturesque setting of the leafy park overlooking the pricey yachts on the harbour, as opposed to next to a main road overlooking a box hire shop and the local brothel, however on this occasion I, like many others it appears on this Saturday morning, have made an exception.  <br><br>Opened in mid-2010 by friends Daniel Bloom and Mark Glatter following the demise of previous tenant, Ash&#39;s, Bay 88 may not seem like the obvious choice for a relaxed Saturday morning breakfast (the also serve lunch and dinner, but they can wait until the next review), what with its proximity to one of the busiest roads in Sydney&#39;s Eastern Suburbs, but the passing traffic is quickly phased out as I and my eating partner (aka my girlfriend) peruse the unfussy menu. Glatter, a permanent fixture aside the coffee machine, whips us up a couple of textbook flat whites ($3.50) with the compulsory milk-froth art that is synonymous with good coffees in this age of caffeine-snobbery.  <br><br>When it comes to the food, I decide on the Breaky Bruschetta with a poached egg ($12), while the girlfriend decides on the Bacon &amp; Egg Roll ($8). We have a bit of a wait, which doesn&#39;t come as a surprise considering the crowd that is gathered inside and out, but pretty soon our plates are delivered. A bacon and egg roll is a staple of Aussie breakfasts around the country, and this one has a distinctly Sydney feel to it, featuring rocket as well as a tangy tomato relish and a distinctly garlicky aioli. It seems to please the eating partner, so much so, that she&#39;s unwilling to let me try a morsel. Must&#39;ve been good. The bruschetta comes as a thick slice of sourdough topped with a generous layer of thickly diced tomato and avocado along with some healthy chunks of fetta and a few leaves of fresh basil. It all combines into an interesting flavour, which works well after taking a couple of seconds to work out!  The poached egg with satisfyingly, runny yolk is a fine accompaniment and helps moisten the thick bread. <br><br>Plates polished, we head off down to the picturesque park to look out, jealously, over the pricey yachts.",

Because I could not leave the store without buying some. :-)<br><br>On the hunt for yet another cafe, I stumbled upon a store front that almost seemed boarded up with news clippings and other laminated articles, and if it was not for the &#34;Chocolate&#34; that caught my eye, I may have missed out entirely. The shop maybe quite small, but it is packed with so many varieties of deliciousness that you&#39;ll be hard pressed to choose.<br><br>I decided that I should try to find the ultimate match for a couple of the smoky Islay single malts I have at home. The desire therefore was to find something 80+% cocoa solids, giving a rich comparison to savour the smoky peat. At this request I was presented a sample of the perfect dark choc. Within seconds I had found what I was after.<br><br>Not to stop there I was then presented a sample of tobacco chocolate which contained heavily caramelised cocoa which was then mixed in with 60% choc. The result was a crisp, almost nutty result which while delicious, was not as good as the 80% I then purchased.<br><br>No this is not the cheapest chocolate you will find, but it has to be close to the best in Sydney. I would certainly recommend them if good quality choc is what you are after.<br><br>By the way, they also serve Sacred Grounds coffee here which I can not review as I did not drink any here, but you might want to should you drop in.",

The coffee is also very well done, no burnt after taste and just frothy enough so that you don&#39;t feel as though you have rabies after consumption.<br><br>The service, my oh my it is amazing!!! The hobbit sized Italian waiter mentioned earlier is sooooo gorgeous!! He&#39;s from<br>Sicily and treats everyone female like Richard gere did in pretty woman, always introducing himself and even giving freebies of raspberry sorbet the last time I went. We felt so loved, you can&#39;t leave without falling in love with how adorable he is.<br><br>I plan to go back for food soon! Just meet the little waiter, you will see why this place is great!",

They don&#39;t feel as naughty and are great for a snack. <br>It&#39;s a strange thing, but they do a mean tuna wrap. Its in a soft tortilla and is really creamy and light. Not expected from the experts in pastry right? It&#39;s the healthier option and it does not disappoint. I haven&#39;t been brave enough to try a coffee from here yet, I think sticking to their bottled drinking options is best.

"reviewcomment":"We started our evening with a weave through the rambunctious crowd having Friday night drinks at Hotel CBD, just below the Bistrode CBD restaurant. In stark contrast to the floor below, It&#39;s classy up here with Romanesque ornamental architecture finely complementing its black and white décor.<br><br>To start, we had the Rock Oysters &amp; Merlot Vinegar that resembled a flower, with the oysters as the petals and the sauce as the pollen. Despite appearances, the merlot vinegar provided a delicate tang and sweetness to the oyster&#39;s creamy taste and smooth texture. <br><br>Closely behind was the Saltfish Croquettes &amp; Smoked Garlic Mayonnaise which was an absolute treat. Crispy on the outside and soft as a cloud on the inside, the saltfish just melts in your mouth with that smoky sauce.<br><br>Following up, came the Octopus, Fennel &amp; Chilli with its mélange of flavors. Adding depth to the naturally sweet crunch of the octopus was the chilli with the dill bringing complexity to the table and the fennel refreshing our tastebuds readying us for the next bite. <br><br>While intimidating at first, the Black Sausage, Crumbed Pigs Ear &amp; Soft Boiled Egg was hands down the highlight of the entrees! Soft on the tongue and gentle on the taste buds, the black sausage is a provincial gem with a delicious herby flavor. The crumbed pig&#39;s ear tasted as if it was a delectable thinly sliced chicken schnitzel while the egg was absolutely perfect with its runny yolk slivering across the plate making its way to the refreshing coriander salad. Eating this dish was akin to listening to symphony playing in harmony!<br><br>Any menu that serves Cape Grim steak has my attention and this restaurant was no different. Then I lamented about the menu lacking eye-fillet - my preferred cut. However, this quickly dissipated when my Cape Grim Scotch Fillet Steak with Fresh Green Peppercorn Sauce came. Chargrilled to perfection, the steak was soft and tender and had a proper smoky aftertaste. The salad though plain with no dressing didn&#39;t need any as it would have just interfered with the beautiful steak. As beautiful as it was, there were places where it wastough to cut and chewy. My lament haunts me.<br><br>My partner opted for the Ocean Trout &amp; Clams which came with a thin pool of creamy sauce that was rich but neutral. Again, despite appearances, the sauce never overpowers the star of the dish: the trout. The clams had a bit of bite that contrasts with the tender trout and becomes somewhat of a palate cleanser for the trout.<br><br>For dessert, we shared the Ricotta Cheesecake, Crumble Crumb &amp; Glazed Quince that served as the perfect crescendo to our meal. The cheesecake was more like a panna cotta in that it&#39;s not that sweet and had an almost mousse-like texture to it. Encasing the cheesecake were finely salted caramelized crushed nuts that gave the dish pop and crackle. Countering this was the glazed quince covered in a syrup with undertones of cinnamon and tea while remaining refreshingly tangy.<br><br>Lit by candlelight, this restaurant has the makings of being romantic but marred by the occasional DJing the floor above and below. But as with all romantics, the attentive staff are quite charming as much as they are self-deprecating. Like an impressionist painting, the dishes are presented with artistic flair that delight your tongue as well as your eyes.<br><br>~ Jambon Cochon",

"reviewcomment":"This place was great! It was packed when three of us arrived for dinner last night, the first instinct we all had was never mind lets go somewhere else, but I asked the girl working there, who didn&#39;t seem worried about the crowds at all. Sure enough they had us seated by the bar in a matter of moments and drinks in our hands not long after.<br><br>I have to pause at this point and stress what a difference the attitudes of the girls working there made! They were so chilled out relaxed and friendly, that we instantly felt at ease. I hate writing unnecessarily wordy reviews but I think that this first part of the night just really set the mood. So different from so many other places where the staff get a bit crabby if it gets busy! The two girls who looked after us, were great, attentive and friendly all night. Despite the fact it was chock full of people.<br><br>Ok so on to the food, one word: Awesome. I find a really good gauge for Mexican is to see what people from the US think of it, as most Mexican in Australia is pretty sub standard compared to the US. My American friend loved it. It&#39;s a really basic, but really good menu and I want to go back already and have more! Highlight of the night was the Chorizo Hot Dog Sliders, I must stress it was all great though. Last little detail: love the look of the place and the movies projected in the wall.<br><br>Ok this is getting long, you get it: I liked this place a lot.",

"reviewcomment":"If you work in the Sydney CBD near Martin Place, it is highly likely that you would have eaten a Little Vienna sandwich. No matter which one you get, its all so delicious. I have a craving for one as I write this - and its only 7am in the morning! Italian grilled sausage on brown vienna bread, here I come!<br><br>Although there are 3 branches in the city, they are all located within one city block which is kinda weird. The Pitt St and Barrack St stores are less than 150m of each other! But all of them are super busy during weekday lunch hour. <br><br>My recommendations? Apart from the Italian sausage, the grilled chicken and the poached chicken breast are particularly good. The obligatory chicken schnitzel is ok, but not as good as Via Abercrombie. You also get to choose the type of bread...and you have to get either white or brown vienna. Oh and the foil-wrapped sandwich is huge! You&#39;ve been warned...<br><br>If you haven&#39;t tried Little Vienna, get yourself to one quick smart. The PItt St branch is particularly cosy and they also do a great banana bread &amp; toast in the mornings. Love this place!",

"reviewcomment":"A friend recommended Low 302 and said let&#39;s go try it. So we went here on a Sunday night around 10:30 and there was still a lot of people inside and that looked like a good thing. <br><br>When I walked inside and looked around, I felt the place would be a great place to have a drink and chat. The place inside looks good and when we found ourselves sitting at a table, one of the staff came asking if we were here for food or drinks and then gave us some menus which is I think was nice of them to do. We got some cocktails which were a bit pricey but I guess it&#39;s also normal in other places as well. <br><br>The drinks were great, the atmosphere and the service was good. I think I would stop by again if I&#39;m in this part of town looking for a good place to go after 10 pm.",

Regular drinks are $5 and their cocktails are $10 - you want to pay $10 for the cocktails, cause they&#39;re really nice (plus you usually don&#39;t get cocktails for less than $15 in Sydney - gotta take advantage of these precious moments).<br><br>We had 4 cocktails each and left the place quite tipsy. Nice atmosphere, good service, decent appies (small portions though, if you&#39;re hungry just order a regular meal).<br><br>Highly recommend the fairy floss and the white chocolate passionfruit martinis.",

"reviewcomment":"&#39;round midnight. <br>The autumnal air outside is crisp. <br>But in here...it&#39;s sizzling hot. <br><br>A single Winsletian hand slides down the fogged-up car window - &#34;Titanic&#34; style. Groans of pleasure follow. Then the excited exclamation from the backseat, &#34;Wow. That&#39;s a whole lotta meat!&#34; <br><br>Closing time meant we couldn&#39;t eat our piping hot pizzas in the 1950s style diner, which is why we ended up devouring them nearby in the car. That&#39;s OK; rest assured we didn&#39;t entirely miss out on Dough Box&#39;s &#34;step-back-in-time&#34; appeal. We sufficiently soaked it all up while we sat on one of the tables outside and waited - a short time - for our gourmet pizzas to cook; admiring the photos of icons like Marilyn Monroe, Liz Taylor, Billie &#34;Lady Day&#34; Holiday, and Judy Garland as well as cute little vintage signs everywhere you looked, candy-coloured décor and uniforms, and bright neon lighting. (Just don&#39;t go thinkin&#39; ya can record their crêpe-making process ya delinquent! There&#39;s a big-ass sign tellin&#39; ya not to!)<br><br>We ordered the meat lovers and a vegetarian one that had haloumi and tomato (among other things). I&#39;d love to tell you exactly what was on them and what these two pizzas were called. Alas! I didn&#39;t make a note of these things at the time and the website is currently being revamped. But no matter! Because all you really need to know is this...<br><br>For 3 people who had been craving pizza for a few hours, these babies were everything our tastebuds had longed for. The crust was as crispy as the afore mentioned autumnal air, the toppings were generous - but not disproportionately so - and the flavours were truly spectacular. DId i mention that they were only $9.95 each? No? Well I bloody should have.<br><br>I can&#39;t wait to go back and try the other pizza flavours, those closely-guarded crêpes previous yelpers have mentioned, shakes, gelato, frozen yoghurt, ice cream and waffles. I reckon I&#39;m going to be hittin&#39; this place up quite a lot! <br><br>Go!!!!!!!",

All the standard bar food is on the menu - burgers, fish and chips, wedges, etc. <br><br>I think it&#39;s probably a great place for groups and to just hang out, have some beers and chat.

"reviewcomment":"I don&#39;t agree with the whole &#34;best coffee/cafe in the city/country/universe&#34; tag often thrust upon places. The enjoyment of coffee, like anything, is subjective and incredibly variable. Even objective scoring measures fail at really telling the whole story. Sadly, the search for the wonder-cafe in a place like Sydney is futile... But it sure is fun. <br><br>Every once and a while, you just have the perfect coffee. The stars align, the beans were harvested while in sync with the orbit of Jupiter&#39;s moons, the milk came from a cow who woke up on the right side of the barn and your barista is at just the right level of hung over. You sip and your mind expands, and you never want that coffee to end. <br><br>I like to call it a &#34;white unicorn coffee&#34;. That glorious white unicorn is a cross-breed with that weird brown Indonesian forest creature that poops out the most expensive coffee in the world. Their colours join, like white milk with brown coffee, to make that mystical thing that the futile search is all about. <br><br>That happened to me on my first visit to The House. I wanted to sell all my stuff and live in a little cardboard box shrine outside their door. <br><br>The thing about the white unicorn though, is that it&#39;s so hard to ever find again. I returned many times, only ever to receive a &#34;good coffee.&#34; There have been no more white unicorns. <br><br>That said, I still love The House. The vibe is awesome, everyone is welcome and it feels like hanging out at a mate&#39;s unruly share house. The food is simple but solid and the coffee is great. You never know, maybe you&#39;ll find yourself a white unicorn there. <br><br>If you do, tell it I said hi.",

If you are looking for atmosphere this is not the place for you. However, if you want good pizza come along!",

But I have actually been one of the people inside and in reality it&#39;s quite boring and the service is just okay.<br>I am sure they think they are doing a good job but they are doing  passable job.<br>Prices are quite reasonable but most of the meals are talked up on the menu and a disappointment when they arrive. Don&#39;t get me wrong, the food is tasty it just doesn&#39;t have the wow factor that you expect.<br><br>This spot has never quite taken off as a restaurant even though it&#39;s away from the shops. It used to be an old chemist and some of the original features are still there. It used to be Three Clicks West then Da Gianni before its last reincarnation.<br>They do have a private dining which is good if you are planning a party or have a corporate function in mind. They also do wine dinners and breakfast on the weekend.",

"reviewcomment":"Standard cafe, but with so much eclectic choice in Surry Hills, I guess I expect more in ambiance and quirkiness. Coffees were average, albeit the large coffees were served in huge mugs. <br><br>The Eggy Benny comes with eggs, toast and hollandaise- that&#39;s it. If you want ham, salmon or spinach, be prepared to pay for the privilege. The price of the dish is only $13.50, but hikes up to $17.50 with the addition of ingredients (like ham) which are actually PART of the original dish itself. No me gusta. I ordered the meal sans extras, and it was actually pretty good- hollandaise was above average. <br><br>BF had the Moroccan breakfast, consisting of poached eggs, a little bit of sauteed spinach, a few tiny garlic lemon potatoes, hummus, and flatbread sprinkled with dukkah. He (and I after scrounging a few bites) found the meal tasty, but for $17 thought there was just nothing spectacular about it.<br><br>However our Canadian waitress was lovely and chatty and the rest of the staff appears as friendly and smiley as she was.<br><br>This place seems like it&#39;s a &#34;safe&#34; bet for breakfast, where you&#39;d take your parents to when they visit for the weekend.

The tea was very nice (had Assam while my partner had wild cherry). Overall, the food was tasty with a couple of minor exceptions where a couple of biscuits were too sugary for me but others with a more sweet tooth may like this. <br><br>I found my experience to be contrary to the reviews, great service and good experience. The only pitfall for me was I dressed too casual (thongs, tee and unshaven) while all the other patrons seemed in more formal getup.

"reviewcomment":"Im torn for this review. In summary, food was good (and bad) but service was terrible. Hence this is a 3 star for me. <br><br>There was a special promotion of 50% discount on all food items, hence my mates and I (4 of us) went there on a Wednesday night.<br><br>Entree was extremely disappointing. We wanted to order the seared scallops, but the waitress told us that there would only be 3 scallops. So we changed it to a &#34;main&#34; size, with 5 scallops. However, when the dish came, the scallops were so tiny, and is probably the size of your thumb !! And it cost $36 !!!!! (without the 50% discount)<br><br>Mains were good, especially the steaks. The grilled duck breast was a little disappointing as the skin was not as crispy as I wanted it to be, but nonetheless it was cooked to perfection.<br><br>If you can, definitely save some room for desserts<br><br>Valrhona Chocolate - Good but not spectacular.<br>Caramelized Banana - Highly recommended ! The popcorn goes really well with the dish, giving it a different texture.<br><br>In terms of the service, it was BAD. For a high end restaurant like Steel Bar, I was extremely disappointed. After our water was served, I checked with the waitress to ensure the menu was 50% off, she said &#34;no&#34; and walked away. And when we asked to order, she said &#34;no. manager&#34;. TWO WORDS AND SHE WALKED AWAY AGAIN ! (seriously?!) <br><br>Finally the manager came to take our orders. She was very nice.<br><br>When we were ready to order our desserts, no waitress/waiter was to be seen anywhere...it took us a good 10 mins to flag the same manager to get our orders taken.<br><br>Im guessing the waitress was new (first day perhaps?) but still ! For a high end restaurant, any new employee should be able to walk you through the menu/ take orders on his/her day! There is no excuse !",

"reviewcomment":"My favourite Sydney food truck. They&#39;re usually selling their souls to one corporate sponsor or another (Master Chef, CITI Bank) but they manage to remain consistently spectacular, so I&#39;m not bothered (also managed to score some free meals when they were under the MC banner). <br><br>Their menu changes and isn&#39;t updated in their website, but is usually accurate on Facebook. The main staple is the pulled pork bun, which you can get spicy (not very) or not. I&#39;ve also been fortunate enough to sample the beef brisket, beef burger, ocean trout, and I&#39;m sure a couple other items. I have never been disappointed with anything I have sampled, and, truth be told, am a bit excited to see what the next corporate sponsor does with these talented truckers.",

They&#39;re also extremely vegetarian friendly and have three or four vegetarian rice paper variations that have faux meat, as well as a faux meat salad roll. While I&#39;m not typically one to go &#34;meaty,&#34; I tried the faux prawn roll which was packed with pepitas and apples - items definitely not conventional for a salad roll.<br><br>They&#39;re still experimenting with their vegetarian pho, which I cannot wait for, by my partner claims the pho and the pork rolls are among the best hes had! <br><br>And now for the hate .... While I think it&#39;s fantastic for businesses to &#34;run out&#34; of items, as it means they&#39;ve sold well that day, I can only recall one time I visited Great Aunty when they had everything in stock. As the vego options are already limited, it has been frustrating to head for a late lunch and find the only thing still available is one flavor of spring roll. <br><br>But again, this is nothing to fret about, and Great Aunty is a feel-good, street food cafe that you&#39;ll feel good walking into and even better walking out of! Definitely worth the five minute walk from Newtown Station down Enmore!",

"reviewcomment":"I think I got too worried after reading the Yelp reviews. I was practically shaking in my shoes while I was waiting for my turn (and it took a while, too, there being a line and everything). I was rehearsing my order over and over in my head, anticipating a talking-to over Not Having My Order Down Pat.<br><br>I needn&#39;t have worried. The owners are a bit gruff, and not overly effusive, but they were nice enough. In fact, the two girls behind me, first-timers as well, struck up a conversation with them.<br><br>I ordered a toasted sandwich - salami and cheddar, with lettuce and tomatoes on brown bread. Salami and cheddar went on first, toasted til the cheese melted, then lettuce and tomatoes after. Grand total: $10.50.<br><br>Not gonna lie, the toasted sandwich was good -- better than the toasted sandwiches I make myself, heh -- but didn&#39;t seem as good value for money vs. the other large sandwiches I&#39;d seen being constructed, which I think came out for around the same price. Oh well! There&#39;s always next time. And I&#39;ve taken a copy of the menu with me, so now I&#39;ll know Exactly What to Order.<br><br>This place is a bit hidden -- you&#39;ll have to go into a small lane off Elizabeth Street, and the facade is pretty plain. If you spot a line during lunchtime, that&#39;s probably it.<br><br>==<br><br>Edit: 24-Feb-14<br>So I went here again, and I ordered a ginormous sandwich this time. Brown bread + chicken schnitzel + fresh tomatoes + lettuce + mayo came to $13. This sandwich was HUGE... I couldn&#39;t finish it in one sitting, and saved the other half for the next day.<br><br>I came at 1 PM and the long lines were gone -- there was only one guy ahead of me. The wife wasn&#39;t there, but the husband was, and he was really nice, even wishing me a nice weekend after I paid.",

"reviewcomment":"We came here one day for lunch. I was with my coworkers who had eaten here previously.<br>First thing I noticed was how small the area to dine is. During the lunch time it is rather busy and crowded, the seating is not terribly comfy (I assume this is why people tend to shuffle in and out rather quickly). <br>I ordered the Thai Basil Chicken, my coworkers ordered the #4 Savory Roti as an entree (this is an appetizer to those of us from the US) and the spicy Thai fried rice. Mine was the first one to come out, then the fried rice dishes and then the Roti. Everything was a nice portion, and tasted good. The staff was pretty attentive for being so busy. <br>I feel like this place could be more easily enjoyed in the evening when it isn&#39;t as busy for them. But once again the seating isn&#39;t the most comfortable unless you get lucky enough to get one of the booths.<br>The food was good and it was moderately priced, I will most likely try it again before I leave.",

"reviewcomment":"Walking along George Street, you pass by several food establishments. I was on a hunt, looking for somewhere that sold kangaroo meat. Lo and behold, Oz Turk Pizza and Kebabs had a huge chalkboard sign in front of their store with the word &#34;kangaroo&#34; in large font. And it was just around the corner from my hotel too!<br><br>I walked in on a Wednesday evening, roughly past 9pm. The place was empty and unbearably hot. I couldn&#39;t imagine how the people working here don&#39;t suffer from a heat stroke. Although Oz Turk has an extensive menu including pizza, kebabs, pastas, salads, burgers, etc, I skipped browsing the menu on the wall and asked for a kangaroo burger with chips.<br><br>For my first time trying kangaroo meat, I was quite impressed. It wasn&#39;t as gamey as I anticipated, and it tasted a little bit like beef. The meat was so tender and juicy I almost forgot how dry and stale the bun was. The thick-cut chips were fresh, not overly salted, though borderline undercooked because the center was a little grainy and chewy.<br><br>Service was quick and friendly. I appreciated how my burger and chips were made fresh, because the pizza slices under a heat lamp all day didn&#39;t look so appetizing. Oz Turk is open 24 hours a day, which seems to fit nicely on the George St scene.",

Carry on inside however and you&#39;ll find the best kept secret on the block - the courtyard. Drenched in sunlight (when of course the sun is shining) and covered in tables and chairs this is a really cool spot to stop for a Campos coffee. The food here is really, really good. The breakfasts are hearty enough to cure even the worst hangover and lunch has great choices, my pick being the tomato, prawn and chilli linguini. This place is worthy enough of a visit, even if you&#39;re not planning a shopping trip",

This brooding feel is aided by the deep red that the shop is painted in, the customers come here to lurk and nurse hangovers with big cups of coffee and a paper. <br>For those in the mood for something more substantial there is a tantalising menu of quite sophisticated twists on typical bar food such as a steak sandwich or Portugese Chicken burger all of which comes in satisfyingly huge portions. There is also a chalk board of specials behind the bar which is always being updated to keep the regulars coming! <br><br>There&#39;s a real homely feel to this place and with such a friendly service and relaxed atmosphere I&#39;ll most certainly be hobbling along here on a Sunday morning again!",

"reviewcomment":"I have just returned from a Christmas lunch with a bunch of old work colleagues and friends at Le Pelican.  It was chosen by one of these on the basis of a &#39;friend-of-a-friend&#39; so I was somewhat cautious when I arrived.  <br><br>Initial impressions were positive.  I imagine it&#39;s hard to have a different look when there are so many other Surry Hills restaurants working hard to look interesting and stand out.  Instead of trying to rise above it, Le Pelican&#39;s decor leverages the original building and blends 100 year old Sydney with traditional French restaurant cues.  I felt welcome and relaxed as soon as I walked in.<br><br>We had a table in the courtyard at the rear, which was perfect for the sunny weather.  In order to cater for our group we had agreed a limited menu.  Starters included a delicious looking scallop dish and my choice: one of the best homemade, French-style terrines I&#39;ve ever had.  Mains included an awesome fish pie with the most exquisite, structured flavour including, I&#39;m told, grated truffle.  My &#39;onglet&#39; steak was a simpler dish, but still first class.  There was also some kind of vegetarian number which my vegetarian friend pronounced &#39;delicious&#39; but I cannot comment further.  Desserts included perfect stawberry souffles, a decadent, but sensibly sized choclate cake with a liquid centre, or a selection of cheeses.  The souffles and chocolate were accompanied by a homemade Thyme ice cream which was not less than admirable.<br><br>Our wines were chosen by our group&#39;s wine tragic, and were (and I&#39;m aware this is becoming repetitive) terrific.  Sorry I can&#39;t list them here, I was too busy having a good time.<br><br>After an excellent coffee, the bill split out to $120 a head, including a moderate tip.  This represents excellent value for a restaurant I&#39;d match against the very best in Sydney.",

Anything written up by hand on the wall is excellent.<br><br>BBQ pork is fabulous and the long beans with mince Hong Kong Style are not to be missed. They do magic with those beans. One of the best versions of this dish in Sydney. The shan tung chicken is amazing, and they do a really good laksa. Special fried rice or Singapore noodles if you&#39;re looking for a cheap, quick meal to take away. Extra points for bringing tea to the table before you ask, and when you order rice, it comes out in a big bucket, as it should.",

"reviewcomment":"Finally a coffee shop near Town Hall worth mentioning. I was reluctant about entering because I just wasn&#39;t sure they&#39;d be on their coffee game as they appear to be more of a restaurant from first observances.<br><br>However, after spotting the familiar La Marzocco Espresso Machine I knew I&#39;d made a wise decision and I strode confidently to the counter. The service was lovely, both the barista and waitress appeared to be gentle souls, happy to serve with a smile.<br><br>My coffee was rich, creamy, and of a decent strength. It took a little longer to get to me, but I am happy about waiting for a good end product.<br><br>Could be my new go to, unless I happen to stumble across something better in a closer vicinity to work (which isn&#39;t really likely since I have tried everything within a stones throw and they are all 3-star jobs).<br><br>Now to compile a list!",

"reviewcomment":"Bar Mattino is our favourite local cafe! The food is consistently good and the service is great - really personal. They know our names and coffee orders now! We started going for the lovely breakfasts. My favourite is the small breakfast with your choice of eggs, which is just enough - I can never finish most big breakfasts at cafes around here. Then we started going in for their Sunday roasts, which are beautiful. Also worth trying are their monthly themed evening meal events, such as Christmas in July and a street food themed one with 8 courses which were a taste sensation. if I could give these guys 6 stars I would!",

"reviewcomment":"Old school Italian. This is one of the oldest Merivale restaurants (which tend to turn over every few years). We came here for the Easter Weekend on a whim after a couple of other places were booked out. It is a lovely venue, which faces out to the Pool Bar. Now, on a Saturday they had a set price of $100 for 3 dishes and $150 for four, so we went the $100 and I ordered hare ragu with tagliatelle as a starter and lamb shoulder as main. It was incredibly tasty and I highly recommend either dish. Wait service was excellent and attentive and the wine list is, frankly, awesome. Pinot noir&#39;s from Mornington Peninsula make me so happy. The only downside was that pascha (some nightclub thing) was held in the Pool Bar as well - which Uccello faces, which meant it was very noisy and people were smoking, Otherwise this would be a great five star. By the way, having pascha there also means random dancers which was amusing. You can solve this by simply seating further back in the restaurant rather than close to the pool Bar. Lesson learnt!",

"reviewcomment":"I recently had the best dinner I&#39;ve ever had in Sydney at Duke Bistro. We made a booking (I suggest you do) for 8pm on a Saturday night. My date and I scaled the stairs to our table and were seated underneath the rice patty hat lamps. Good thing we didn&#39;t opt for a bar seat because one of five was occupied by a pig bust (or a cow bust?). Vintage bird cage lamps softly lit the dining room and I couldn&#39;t help but feel like part of a secret society. <br><br>Menus came next and we both hunched over like we were reading a creative work of fiction. Salads of peas and honeydew mellon? A dish of radishes in a butter soup? Nothing was commonplace and for that I loved Duke early on... and it only got better. We ordered both the aforementioned dishes and both were amazing. I suggest you don&#39;t skip the radishes, if you know what&#39;s good for you. <br><br>For the mains we chose the bonito and char siu pork neck. The bonito came seared atop a pumpkin puree with- brace yourself- coffee grounds and macadamia nuts. It was a wildly creative and utterly perfect dish. The young chefs behind the Duke menu have really stepped outside the Mod Aus / Asian Fusion box and for that we can certainly thank them. <br><br>After mains we opted for dessert and chose the macaroons and donuts. Four tiny macaroons came in a row, two raspberry and two green tea. The donuts were a work of genius. With a custard-y inside and sitting on brown cinnamon sugar and a banana puree, it was the most decadent and delicious dessert I&#39;ve had in a while.",

"reviewcomment":"Wow, what a great Italian. Modelled after a restaurant in Milan, we&#39;re told, La Pesa Trattoria does a great job emulating an eatery from that area. It&#39;s a small warren of rooms, busy and bustling, everyone having a good time.<br><br>The service was friendly and attentive. The bread and oil and salt to start were just the right size, not overdone to the point where you risk filling up. A couple of shots of creamed cauliflower got the taste buds fired up.<br><br>We could see the main portions were generous, so we only shared an order of olives to start. That was enough, with lots of those green Sicilian olives that are so yummy, plus a few small black ones, and all warmed up. That small touch makes a big difference.<br><br>You&#39;ll not find pizza here: this is all about pasta and hearty dishes of meat and fish, as they do in Milano. The ossobucco - one of the house specialities - was delish, with very high quality meat. It was perched atop just the right amount of tasty risotto. I nearly got the veal cutlet; next time.<br><br>My wife had the twice-cooked duck, and pronounced it the best she&#39;s had in recent years.<br><br>Even the side dish of green beans in butter and almonds tasted amazing.<br><br>The wine list was heavily Italian, with some very special choices, but there are still several Australian choices (and good ones!) for those who are concerned about the air miles earned by your plonk.<br><br>Proper Italian atmosphere, top-notch service, and hearty meat-and-fish dishes are what you&#39;ll get. The table next to us had come back two nights in a row. That says something.",

I don&#39;t remember the names of everything which we&#39;ve tried and they don&#39;t have a website where one could look up the menu, so I can&#39;t help you there. But if you visit their facebook page, you will see many of their mouth-watering specials. Or check out a few blogs. And I&#39;ll give you a tip, the more funky the description/ingredients, the more likely the dish will taste fantastic.<br><br>For example, the Sashimi Tacos, Torched Sushi, Popcorn Shrimp, Cucumber Pops, Jalapeno Poppers all may sound pretty corny, but you will surely love the new flavours and taste sensations. <br><br>They do have regular sushi and sashimi, but I still feel that boring people should stay away!",

We settled in an area near the entrance, which was cozy and quite comfortable accommodated a group that ballooned to around a dozen people.<br><br>If there&#39;s one word for the place, it would be that: cozy. Lights dimly lit, oak decor (it IS called Redoak, after all), with the sound a comfortable level -- not quiet enough to make it seem dead, but not noisy enough that you have to shout to make yourself heard.<br><br>I ordered:<br>OVEN ROASTED BARRAMUNDI FILLET $28<br>- sustainably farmed Barramundi, char-grilled asparagus, baby cos leaves, heirloom tomatoes, grilled haloumi cheese<br>and it was really good. I wanted something else but convinced myself that I needed to get something &#34;healthier&#34; than what I originally wanted.

Oh, and the Turkish bread. It&#39;s a very close tie.<br><br>The dips are ridiculously good. You can just drop in and buy them by the container, which I&#39;ve done on a number of occasions for house parties and BBQs. The hommus, babaganoush and beetroot are all fantastic. (Heavy on garlic, but damn delicious.) The Turkish bread is also cooked to perfection. You can take one away for a couple of bucks and they&#39;ll wrap it up in butcher&#39;s paper for you. Grab one of these (they&#39;re huge), plus a few small dips and you&#39;re set for a picnic in the park.<br><br>If you&#39;re dining in, treat yourself to a bunch of yum vego sides like stuffed vine leaves and falafels. There&#39;s also a huge selection of pides. Seriously huge. The flat kusbasili with diced leg of lamb, onion, tomato, capsicum, parsley and spices is brilliant, as is the folded potato with onion, spinach and cheese. I&#39;d also recommend trying a few bits and pieces from the grilled menu (the mince kofte are good) and of course a few traditional desserts. (Hey, you need to try them out, right?!)

I could barely open my eyes and my mind was a fug, but even in that state I knew good coff-coff when I Taste-d it (eh? eh?). Also, their bacon and egg rolls are just marvelous - you know when you get one greasy, filmy egg and one Lilliputian rasher of bacon in a roll that would leave a toddler hungry? These were the antithesis to that, big damper-style flour-topped rolls stuffed with at least 5 or 6 rashers of juicy bacon and fresh eggs. And there&#39;s a deal where a cofee &amp; B&amp;E roll is just $8.00, or $10.00 on weekends.<br><br>Is it sacrilegious to call these chaps saviours? Because they are.

"reviewcomment":"I ordered a coffee ten minutes ago and it&#39;s still not here. Not cool if I were in a rush but as it happens I&#39;m not. So instead I take the opportunity to sit back and soak up the atmosphere of this outdoor-only cafe. It&#39;s a bit of a nippy day and it looks like rain is coming but thankfully there is a decent stripey orning covering most of the tables. <br><br>It has a distinct European feel to it. With the round tables and comfy red and white chairs and a cave like counter where the barista stands. The counter is raised so the staff stand behind there doing their things - polishing cutlery, heating milk etc - but as they are quite jovial and playful with one another it&#39;s a little bit more like a puppet show. <br><br>This place is pretty busy for a Wednesday morning - the busiest on the strip at least. I assumed the coffee would be good for this reason. It is strong, hot and tasty but it&#39;s not exceptional. Expectations get me in trouble every time.  <br><br>Breaky highlights include:<br>Greek omelet with haloumi <br>Baked eggs on white bean, chorizo and tomato ragout with Turkish bread. <br>Buttermilk pancakes.<br><br>Sign hangs reading Sangria $15 by the jug. I&#39;ll come back - just in case it&#39;s the specialty is the red stuff rather than the brown. Sign also says... &#34;men are like wine: some turn to vinegar but the best improve with age&#34; - the cheeky character of this cafe shining through.",

"reviewcomment":"I wouldn&#39;t have known about Yokozuna if my friend, Viv (shout out!), hadn&#39;t pointed it out to me. It&#39;s definitely a hidden gem and easy to miss as you head towards Taylor Square down Oxford. <br><br>Ambiance:<br>-Yokozuna&#39;s a small, sort of hole-in-the wall sort of place. No thrills -- just a long corridor of a restaurant with the kitchen at the back<br>-Next to a porn shop -- make sure you enter the restaurant and not the shop upstairs. Talk about awkward.<br>-Authentic - when we arrived, there were a couple of tables with Japanese patrons. It&#39;s always a good sign when people who know the food are eating it.<br><br>Food:<br>-First off, this place is BYOB. So, already good.<br>-We started with Gyoza - cooked and plated in a way I&#39;ve never seen before. The gyoza are still connected by their skin and you have to break them apart. Delicious crispy morsels. <br>-We then followed up with salmon avocado rolls, fresh salmon sashimi (they ran out of the other fish by the time we arrived - I took this as a good thing. I&#39;m glad they want to keep things fresh), this amazing tempura mushroom dish, lemon chicken, and a toro kama.<br>-The tempura mushroom dish was definitely yum. Crispy, chewy, and juicy all at once, drenched is amazing ponzu sauce and fresh cut onion.<br>-I&#39;ve had the privilege to try kama (fish neck/collar) at a few places in Japan and San Francisco.Yokozuna was able to deliver here with their toro (tuna) version. This one dish was what pushed them over to 5 stars for me. Succulent, flavorful, fleshy fish. Grilled through to perfection. A must try - esp. for those who have never tried kama before :) <br><br>Need-to-know:<br>-Yokozuna is family run. So you literally have the father, mom, and son working in the kitchen and giving full TLC to the food you order. Their daughter is the waitress. Due to this, service is low on resources and slow. <br>-Do not come here if you&#39;re hangry (hungry + angry) or in a rush. Rather, enjoy your BOYB and relax. Dishes will come.<br><br>Let&#39;s just say, we were so happy with our meal, we tipped. I can&#39;t wait to come back and try more assortment of fresh sashimi - bought straight from the fish market.",

It is $7.50 for lunch - that&#39;s pad thai, pad see ew (however that&#39;s spelt) and so forth. Awesome stuff. Minimal wait time too.<br>The important thing about restaurants, and I find particularly Thai restaurants, is that they are consistent in the taste of their food.

"reviewcomment":"This place is fun! It&#39;s like cheap sushi on a merry go around. There&#39;s plenty of places to sit and lots to eat. The selection is your usual that you would find in the stores rolled up but there are some other cool things like grilled scallop. You can also order items fresh off the menu in case you&#39;re a hypochrondriac, but I ensure you things seem to go through a UV filter each round, so have trust in the technology.<br><br>My favourites are the grilled scallop (watch them blow torch it in the making), prawn tempura, udon noodles and salmon avocado. My favourite person to bring is a student as student prices provide you with a 16.67% discount as each plate is $2.50.",

And by god, it was delicious. Probably the best I&#39;ve had. That said, I&#39;ve had some nasty mole poblano since. <br><br>It was a fairly quiet night when we went in, but the place had a good atmosphere, and the owner, José (more on him later) is very friendly. <br><br>The menu was quite varied. José explained that while he has all the tex mex people expect here, they also have plenty of other authentic mexican foods. It&#39;s not just the food that&#39;s varied. Tequila, anyone? Apparently José goes back to Mexico every year to buy some good tequilas. None of the rat poison you get in most bars here, this stuff is smooth and delicious. While there was salt and lemon slices brought out, they were not needed.<br><br>So. José. He was definitely a big part of the experience. Telling jokes, coming out with his guitar to sing, he also sat down with us after our meal and did tequila shots with us, explaining the difference types of tequilas.

"reviewcomment":"We went to Sugaroom on a Ouffer voucher. Despite being rather difficult to find (around the corner once you get to bottom of Harris st) we were warmly welcomed on a rather miserable night. <br><br>The set menu had a tea smoked salmon starter but they also offered an (off menu) onion tart as an option- which was delicious! The salmon starter was light and fresh.<br><br>Mains gave the option between a filet of beef and gnocci dish and a fish (breem) dish. Both were superb. We weren&#39;t expecting much from the fish but its was a rather pleasant surprise.<br><br>Desserts were a chocolate creme brulee with marshmallows and rasberries. And a passionfruit pavlova of sorts. Both again were real tasty!!<br>On the vouchers were a bottle of wine between 2 too. <br><br>Overall, an absolutely delicious meal, in a great and beautiful location right on the water (despite it being a rather miserable night we went on), with excellet and very attentive service. My only concern would be the prices of their full price/ a la carte menu (based on their prices on their website). The portions were generous and really scrumptious but did seem a little overpriced.<br><br>All up though, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",

"reviewcomment":"After being rejected by Flying Fajita Sisters on a quiet Saturday night, my boyfriend and I ventured down the road in search for something to eat. Saigon Saigon immediately caught our eye with its bright red lights, fancy ambience and the amount of people in the restaurant. <br><br>Upon entering the restaurant we were immediately greeted and seated by a friendly waiter. The initial table we were provided with was a little too large for two and seated in an awkward area of the restaurant. Unhappy with the table we were provided with we asked the waiter if we could move to another location. Usually most restaurants will say no or will loathingly allow such a request, but not Saigon Saigon, the staff were more than happy to accommodate our request and we were moved to a much nicer table for two in the corner under the romantic red lanterns.<br><br>The food is not as authentic as you would get from the local restaurants in Bankstown, Cabramatta or Marrickville, the prices are also more expensive. However, given the location of the restaurant and the ambience, this is expected. The food is still very tasty with the mix platter being large enough to satisfy two as a main meal and the soft shell crab is very delicate, flavoured and crunchy. The fried ice cream dessert was presented immaculately with lovely messages iced onto to serving plate. The wine was also cheap, tasty and plentiful for a romantic Saturday night dinner.<br><br>I will definitely visit the restaurant again for the food, wine and friendly service. I absolutely recommend it for a first date or a romantic dinner.",

There are some lounges by the big open windows and there are a few seats on the sidewalk as well. During the week, they have live music one or two nights a week, nothing too heavy which is good if you&#39;re just chilling after a long day at work.<br><br>The place does get packed and rowdy on Friday and Saturday nights when the people from the burbs come in. The stench of stale beer and vomit is quite off putting come Sunday morning/afternoon.<br><br>The bistro is popular here and the food is pretty solid - decent enough pub grub although a little pricier than average. <br><br>There is a pokie room down one end which is separated from the rest of the pub, a bit of an escape really! The servers that tend to the pokie room are quite sociable.",

"reviewcomment":"Hidden away in an alleyway is just as I like to keep this review hidden away from you.<br><br> Coming here a number of years I&#39;ve tried so hard to come here on every important occasion to share with family and friends over an excellent menu with what I love. Excellent company over superb food. <br> Introduced by a friend and again paid forward to my friends, this place is what an intimate dining experience is without being intimidating. Having an authentic italian feel to the place with only 12 or more tables, walk-ins are always welcomed but I recommend booking. There is a bar when you walk in but never have seen anyone there as you are seated promptly upon entering. I too enjoy my table being step up in front of me as all cutlery is presented as both clean, new and the skill with setting up. <br><br> The menu is big. I mean size of this thing would be an A2 sheet. The space only filled with options but I always go by recommendation of our waiter for the entrées. Every time something is new. Recently having Figs stuffed with Blue Cheese melted with a side of Prosciutto is what had to mentioned by the reason for writing this review. <br> The mains are the prime example of excellent italian fine dining. Again, when ordered the running &#34;did you know&#34; is the pasta. Always in house made &#34;on the day&#34; so always pushed forth. My return upon picking a main of any pasta, red meat or fish is their imported Italian chianti...&#34;the one with the bamboo around it&#34;. Always delighted to hear &#34;how you know about this bottle?&#34; and &#34;We only bring this out once a year!&#34;. Um... yeah! That&#39;s me that always orders this! Always enjoyed. I always recommend the pasta dishes. The sauce is extremely divine with all. A thick &#34;sticks to your pasta&#34; sauce. Naming so many dishes that stood out would make this review a menu for so.<br> Come here a Friday or Saturday night, they have the owner come around to your table and ask for music you wish to be played on the piano. Classics only my choice. These days seem the most popular. <br> The desserts are simple from what the majority of the menu offers but they are exact on taste and taste perfect. <br><br> I do not understand how such a beautiful place has stayed hidden since 1990s could be Sydney&#39;s best kept dining secret. Italian speaking waiters to explain the menu only adds to it all. You have to come upon this place for any occasion. <br><br>Mark My Words",

You can&#39;t hold a conversation, and have no idea how you&#39;ll make it through the morning without keeling over and dying somewhere awfully public.<br><br>That was me a few weeks back.

Eating it was like the flavour-filled fountain of youth had welled up inside me, rejuvenating my busted organs and wan skin with delicious, life-affirming goodness. Far out. My new go-to hangover assassin, right here.<br><br>Also good? The corn fritters smothered with chipotle (you gotta ask for that) and tomato and avocado salsa, and the fat hash stack, with a poached egg on top and jacked with buttered spinach and corned beef. <br><br>Inside can get a little hot and sweltery, stalk one of the breezy pavement tables but be warned, they&#39;re hot property.<br><br>Cash only.",

"reviewcomment":"So I called this place to make a booking and the dude was all &#34;we don&#39;t take bookings but come in 15 minutes before your group arrives and we&#39;ll work it out&#34;. Normally when I&#39;m going out for a client lunch, that doesn&#39;t cut the mustard but after reading the reviews on this place, I took a leap of faith and trusted the phone dude. <br><br>On the day, phone dude stayed true to his word and a table was put together and I looked uber organised when my party arrived. <br><br>The wait staff are turbo attentive but not annoyingly so, coffee is almost forced upon you and you&#39;d be a fool not to accept. If you only take one thing from this review, make it this: The coffee is good, no, wait, the coffee is grand. <br><br>I had the B.R.A.T sambo, others had the cheese burger and eggs benedict (that&#39;s right, all day breakfast - FTW). Everyone raved about their meals and we all had another coffee before leaving.<br><br>There were 5 of us, we drank bottled water and paid $120 which was freaking awesome. There&#39;s this big old rad mural on the left side wall, you can&#39;t miss it and don&#39;t want to - it made me want one in my house. <br><br>The atmosphere is casual, organic and a teeny but grungy. The wait staff fit the atmosphere, their knowledge and professionalism makes it a no brainer for me to take clients here for a casual meeting. <br><br>I love this place and will defo be back.",

"reviewcomment":"In a nutshell: impressive. Vietnamese beers I had not tried (both 333 and Hanoi were delicious), adventurous cocktails (traditional also available), and impressive food (Banh Bot Chien is a must). <br><br>Went here with 4 other girls for a ladies dinner. We wound up having a couple drinks in the cocktail bar at the back (Red Lily) as the wine bar we had planned for was bursting at the doors. <br><br>Red Lily is dark and tiny, with all but a handful of the seats being at the bar. We arrived shortly after 7 for our 8.30 sitting. There were maybe 6 other patrons and 3-4 friendly bar tenders. By the time we received out first round, the place was packed. Service was friendly and informative. Cocktails were delicious (one of mine included tequila and mango with a Chili salt rim. Loved it!)  <br><br>As we were in the building already, the staff came to collect us when the table was ready, with the added bonus of us being able to transfer our unfinished drinks - and our tab - to our dinner table. <br><br>We decided against the tasting menu and split 3 entrees, one mid course, and 3 mains between the 5 of us, which provided more than enough food. With the addition of dinner drinks (3 beers and a bottle of wine) the tab came in at a very reasonable $80/pp (remember there were at least 7 cocktails @ $17/per that were carried over). <br><br>As mentioned above, the Banh Bot Chien (rice cakes with prawn and pork) is a must. The Muc Raing Muoi (fried chilli salt squid) was delicious, and a generous serve. The Goi Du Du Tom Thit (green papaya salad with twice cooked pork belly and prawns) is also not to be passed over. <br><br>For mains we had the Ca Kho (salmon in a caramel, chili, and black pepper sauce) which was outstanding. We refused to let our server take the bowl away as we each had an extra serve of rice soaked in the remaining sauce. <br><br>The Vit Sot Man Gung Keo (duck with plumb sauce and candied ginger) was delicious, and again, a very generous portion - which is always a surprise with duck. <br><br>The Bo Luc Lac (beef with garlic, sesame and black pepper) was probably the least favourite, despite not having any faults. The beef was perfectly tender, but was simply out shined by the salmon and the duck. <br><br>Service was again friendly and knowledgable, although the waitress had to be reminded of a beer that had been ordered, but hey, that happens. <br><br>I had no idea what to expect coming here, and was very happy with the outcome. I have no problem recommending this place, and am excited for my next visit.",

Their money bags (minced chicken marinate with meat crab, carrot, peas and sweet corn and deep fried in pastry) is definitely right on the money. Their Pad Thai is delicious and their Massaman Curry (beef) is so tender and tasty, you&#39;ll want to keep eating it and ordering more jasmine rice. Along with their food, their service is excellent with really friendly waitresses that were just icing on the cake. The restaurant has a relaxed atmosphere that certainly adds to the enjoyment of eating. Highly recommended!",

I&#39;ve stumbled around the area  a few times, but never have I landed feet first at the Exchange. <br>We found ourselves here with a crew of about 6 on Aus day and let me say I was pleasantly surprised.<br>Bar person Nick, is a cool hipster type who let me carve my very own ice sculpture out on the frozen beer tap whilst my friends played the &#34;monster from the deep&#34; themed Pinny. <br>The staff seem pretty chilled out. <br><br>Upstairs they had imported some sand with the anticipation of having a beach bar, but Aus day was cloudy and not so beachy. I can see how it could have been rad if it was a hot day.<br><br>Down stairs is C-lassy! The Pool table room has bookshelves and fancy lamps. They have Chaise lounges and a Deer antler Chandelier. The Exchange is not afraid of deluxe furnishings. Even Red velvet Curtains. <br><br>It is the largest and most fancy hotel in Balmain, was built in 1885 and is Heritage listed<br>There are a couple of bars, one with a Balcony and a new Bistro that looks like something from the Great Gatsby. <br><br>Didnt try the food, but they seem to have regular promos, like the screening the superbowl with $12 Bud and Chilli dawg and 50c Spicy chicken wings.  Sounds cool!<br><br>Side note: The thing I liked most of all, was the $2 pay per use Hair straightener for the Ladies, and the fact the loos were fully enlosed, proper lockable and proper fancy.

"reviewcomment":"Where the hell did this come from?!<br><br>The other night as I drove along Victoria Rd I passed the sparkling lights of Ruby&#39;s new courtyard.  Impressed, I decided to check it out - might be nice for an afternoon drink, I thought.  Looks pretty, not too busy.  In this statement I was both very right and very wrong.<br><br>Ruby L&#39;otel is extremely pretty.  I&#39;d never been here prior to the renovations, but any money says that it&#39;s a world above what it was.  What&#39;s more, the staff are ridiculously attractive as well, so the entire joint is easy on the eye.  <br><br>As for quiet, I was way off.  It seems that my friends are I were the last to find out about Ruby&#39;s, as the entire place was full by 8pm, swarming with crowds of all ages, most notably Balmain, Rozelle and Lilyfield&#39;s younger generation.  The area&#39;s future MILFs seem to flock here in hoards, snagged by The Ruby&#39;s schmancy renos and the extensive and good-looking cocktail list, including $30 cocktail jugs and $8 cocktail slushies.<br><br>The menu is pretty attractive too, hooking me simply with the snack food (Kumera chips with spiced sour cream and chilli fries with aioli and chilli sauce).  This moved on to an equally attractive bar menu, followed by &#39;mains&#39;, sides and tacos ($3 on Trivia Tuesdays).  Whilst there&#39;s to be no drinking or eating in the outside area after 6pm, luckily the back indoor courtyard feels as if you&#39;re outdoors, so you don&#39;t loose the beer garden experience.<br><br>The eye candy alone makes frequenting Ruby L&#39;otel an extremely good idea.  However, an added incentive is that they sell pints of Monteiths Cider for only $7.50 (only 50 cents more than a schooner) and a sip of this elixir tastes like biting into a crisp Granny Smith.  It is thus no surprise that Ruby L&#39;otel quickly rises to &#39;local&#39; status.<br><br>Judging by the number of people at Ruby&#39;s you probably already know it exists.  But, if you&#39;re like me and it has somehow managed to evade you, don&#39;t go another day in the dark.  This place is great.",

"reviewcomment":"The cafés in and around World Square are usually pretty hit and miss (that is, unless you&#39;re headed to the top floor dumpling mecca that is Din Tai Fung). Sushi Roll sushi train on the ground level, on the other hand, is a safe bet for freshly made, interesting sushi combos, meal deals and fair prices.<br><br>The place isn&#39;t too big - just the central train filled with hard-working sushi maestros, plus a few tables and a couple of fridges dotted around the place. The CBD lunch rush means service here is fast, but they always take the time to farewell customers properly on their way out the door.<br><br>I used to work close by and would regularly stop in for lunch. While the inside-out salmon and avocado roll speckled with bright orange roe and the freshly deep-fried, crispy tempura prawn roll are consistently tasty, I&#39;ve got a much better inside tip: if you arrive for a late lunch after 2pm, they start serving up a freshly made, special dish. I have no idea what the name is, but basically it&#39;s a piece of salmon wrapped around mushed up avocado with a dollop of mayo and fish roe on top, then they lightly char the salmon with a blow torch.

"reviewcomment":"Cheap all you can eat buffet Korean bbq is not something you usually go to and usually cheap places with buffet or all you can eat have lower quality ingredients for you to cook from.   <br><br>This place is quite ok considering its cheap price. The price is cheap being $21 for dinner and being able to eat as much as you can but with a time limit of how long you can stay (during busy periods). I have been here a few times in the last couple of years and recently a few weeks ago. When I go here I think it&#39;s usually packed even on a Monday night.   <br><br>The food they have here are good enough and good for the price you pay. And of course it will depend on how you cook it as this is a bbq place. I find the quality of the meat and seafood quite good but you would get better quality at other bbq restaurant. The grapes they have are good as I ate a lot of grapes after having enough meat and seafood.  <br><br>You would come here if you want to eat a lot and to pay cheap price for bbq. If you want better quality ingredients to cook from, you would go to other non-buffet places or to more expensive all you can eat bbq places.",

Just because they&#39;re there, and they look so damn good. Oooo, what about that $7 a pannet of luscious organic strawberries, $15 for a little tub of delectable toasted muesli? (It&#39;s really good muesli) Dammit, those olives look good too. Don&#39;t even let me look at the cheese. Do NOT let me look at the cheese. <br><br>It&#39;s AAAALLLLL good, my friends. There is so much Italiany goodness at this place, it&#39;s overwhelming. I don&#39;t know what to do with myself. Downside: You don&#39;t shop here regularly unless you&#39;re on a very healthy salary. <br><br>I&#39;ve had good customer-service experiences here but a friend of mine has had a bit of a hard time with the staff, who admonished her for not calling them before she arrived to inform them that she was buying a selection of goods to make a &#34;hamper&#34;. This was totally unnecessary, as my friend was arranging &amp; selecting the goods herself, so maybe the staff were a bit control-freaky about it.<br><br>PS: It&#39;s kind of a deli, kind of a green-grocer, and also has a nice place to eat upstairs.

"reviewcomment":"The East Sydney Hotel is consistently one of the best &#34;old style&#34; pubs in Sydney. Sitting on the edge of Woolloomooloo, it can be a little tricky to find, but it&#39;s basically just down the hill from that seediest part of William Street. It&#39;s a classic old pub that hasn&#39;t undergone a refurb in a good handful of decades, and it fills is walls with antique beer advertisements and other Australiana, rather than flat screen tvs. Even better - the place has a staunch no-pokies policy, which is bloody great. While I wouldn&#39;t recommend the East Sydney&#39;s own food, you can order pizza from the place across the road and eat it at the pub, no questions asked. <br>They have several James Squire beers on tap, though the drinks selection is otherwise unremarkable. And this is as it should be, in an unpretentious, proper Aussie pub, right? Make sure to watch out for the darts board, as many a stray dart has been thrown in this joint, and the bar staff will not be sympathetic if you come to grief.<br><br>This place is a favourite for when my mates are trying to have a low key party without booking a venue. Hipster small bars are often over-full on weekends, and the big-business pubs rort you with $25+ pub meals. But the East Sydney always has enough space to squeeze us all in, and the music selection has a 1970s vintage, pleasing the oldies, the GenX and GenYers, and generally keeping things chilled. Apparently dogs can drink beer for free here, although I&#39;ve never seen that in action.",

Once with an arrogant know it all d-bag and the second quite by accident with an arrogant know it all d-bag who ended up on reality tv. The two other couples though, doing just fine.<br><br>This really is the perfect place though to bring a group of friends or a few couples. The lay out of the tables are such that you can hear and speak to everyone without breaking off into little pockets. <br><br>The service is always super friendly and keen to please. Very helpful when deciding what to get as well. Both times we went with a banquet and we just sat there and picked at our food in dribs and drabs - it really made for a relaxing atmosphere. I can&#39;t recall the prices now, but I do remember thinking that it was great value for the quality and the amount of food that was served.<br><br>I would definitely like to go here again, just to see if I can break my bad luck!",

I think they love this place because it&#39;s fancy, exclusive, delicious and close enough to work that they can &#34;get away&#34; without &#34;getting away&#34;.<br><br>I find this place to be gorgeous - simple Japanese decor, Azuma is all about understatement.  All the food is fantastic and if you can afford it, I&#39;d suggest it all...<br><br>Now I know this is a bit strange, but I strong recommend their salts and peppers - that come in an array of colours and flavours when you order the Tempura - in fact that&#39;s a good enough reason to order the Tempura. They add an additional something special to this place which you can&#39;t get anywhere else (highly recommended)<br><br>All the food is fresh, the staff wonderful..... I&#39;m just grateful that my rich banker friends feel inclines to take a struggling artists to such fancy places - i like to call it Karma Offset.",

"reviewcomment":"I must be the only person who can&#39;t understand Google Maps. I was originally aiming for another brunch spot, thought this was it, and went in. It wasn&#39;t, but I had a good meal nonetheless!<br><br>I ordered the haloumi breakfast which consists of tomatoes, mushrooms, sourdough bread, and, of course, grilled haloumi. The serving was quite substantial and made for a pretty hefty brunch. Good food, I found it a bit too buttery, though that may have been personal taste. I would come back to try the other things on the menu. It&#39;s the kind of place where you can stay and have a good chat, or read the newspaper and chill out.<br><br>The place was busy on a rainy Sunday morning -- though not as busy as the other more popular brunch places in Surry Hills like The  Book Kitchen and Four Eight Five, which I had originally intended to go to. I ended up sharing the large table (so it didn&#39;t feel too awkward) with 2 girls, which ended up being a couple, who ended up fighting, and that was awkward.<br><br>Service was good. One girl seemed a bit indifferent but it seemed like her indifference was because of newness, she seemed a bit unsure how to handle some things but another girl was more take-charge and kinda directed her with some stuff and handled things quite well.",

"reviewcomment":"Most impressive decor (both interior and exterior) I have ever seen in a Thai restaurant and possibly in any restaurant full stop. Really made me feel like I was sitting in a quaint little eating house in South East Asia in the 1960s (or at least what I imagine what such a place would be like).<br><br>The food was delicious although a tad too expensive for Thai food. I know the rent in this building is really high but this restaurant is going to risk alienating its customers unless it lowers its prices a little - $2 across the board should do it. Otherwise, people will just go over to Home Thai on Sussex St, where the food is just as good (if not better) and the prices significantly lower.<br><br>We ordered the tom yum prawn soup ($16); the larb gai salad (minced chicken with lemongrass, coriander, roasted rice, cabbage/lettuce etc) ($16); and the grilled chicken with lemongrass ($18) and steamed rice ($3). Loved the first two dishes but the third was dry and overcooked.<br><br>The larb gai salad was so spicy I had tears running down my face by the end of the meal. Our waitress actually asked us when we placed our order whether we wanted the salad &#39;spicy or non-spicy&#39;. We asked for &#39;medium&#39;, so I can&#39;t imagine what the &#39;spicy&#39; version would be like. Would probably burn a hole in my stomach like what happened to this dude: <a href='/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.smh.com.au%2Fworld%2Fspicy-soup-burns-hole-in-mans-stomach-20121230-2c13m.html&amp;s=9185e0e882ca397ecae9f529ca00cc2a6eb268d3836543b8a3a7be94bfcbf74b' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>smh.com.au/world/spicy-s…</a><br><br>Service was very good. The waitresses were clearly mindful of how killer-hot the food was because they were constantly hovering around our table, ready to refill our cups of water whenever they became even the slightest bit less than full.",

It was light and crisp and perfect with the Mediterranean dishes we ordered to share. Also seeing as one of my favorite restaurants ever is Pylos in New York, I was definitely looking forward to this meal...<br><br>First up was the spanikopita, perfect amount of filling and the filo wasn&#39;t doughy at all which is always a plus. We also had the prawns wrapped in  some flaky strands which added some texture to the dish. I think my favorite dish was the grilled octopus and the fish wrapped in, dare I say vine leaves?<br><br>Of course the company made the meal all the better but good company, good wine and good food made for an excellent meal at George&#39;s.

You may have heard of this place for their amazing rendition of KFC (Korean Fried Chicken). The original fried chicken is crispy and flavourful, as well as being moist on the inside- all without being oily on the outside. I&#39;m sure The Colonel would approve.<br><br>Tried and tested many other flavours but I will say my favourite at this underground eatery is the sweet chilli coated chicken. Red sticky caramel like sauce coats each piece of fried chicken evenly, and every bite hits you with a balance of sweetness and chilli.<br><br>The various hot pots here are tasty and full of what they say they will be full of. Seafood hotpot is packed with real seafood (mussels, pipi&#39;s, octopus) and real flavour (not the powder flavor we&#39;re often subject to). The beef bulgogi hotpot is warming and hearty with a whole chunk of raw bulgogi and plenty of mushrooms placed in the hotpot to cook.<br>If you&#39;re game, you gotta also try their pork bone soup (hyejjanggook). Next level.<br><br>Not the place to go if you&#39;re on a diet. Life&#39;s short- Just go.",

"reviewcomment":"One of the first places we ate at in Sydney while we were on our hunt for a place around Darlinghurst.  He actually stumbled upon it after we waited for Bills for about 10 minutes and decided we were too hungry to wait.  Thanks as always to the power of Yelp, we saw this and it fit the bill perfectly.<br><br>It&#39;s a perfect distillation of the Parisian cafe. Low key, unassuming, and the waitress was French too, so it was perfect. We sat at one of the tables that fronts the place, and had a great view of everyone rolling by.  There was even a guy smoking at the table next to us, which might bother some, but I thought it added a little, &#34;je nais sais quoi&#34;<br><br>Anyway, I had a delicious special of chorizo monsuier, and the wife a salad.  Both were fresh, and filling. She had a glass of wine that was on some kind of special, but I don&#39;t remember it being particularly cheap, but she liked it so I shut up.  My baguette was perfect, warm and soft with a perfect crunchy exterior.  Unhurried service, a nice view, and an amazing Gellateria just down the street? European perfection in the heart of Sydney!",

"reviewcomment":"With a name like this I was expecting some spicy Latin American food, but this place is actually a Thai restaurant. Located near China town on Campbell Street in the city, Chilli Cha Cha is a place thats hidden from the crowds circling dixon and market streets at night. The fact that it was nearly full on a wednesday night however made me feel that this place wasn&#39;t such a &#39;hidden&#39; gem after all and for good reason too. All the dishes that were ordered here were flavoursome, interesting dishes and most of them had quite a spicy hit to them as well, which is probably why this place had the word chilli in its name. One of the dishes definitely worth trying here is the the barbecued meats, so tasty you&#39;ll never want to eat the meat you prepare on the barbie again. The salads here are also mouthwatering and some of them can be tear-jerking and have you reaching for the water and a re-fill on the rice. <br><br>Do yourself a favour next time you&#39;re in the city and by pass dixon and market streets and head to Chilli Cha Cha, just make sure to have a jug of water handy, or if you&#39;re really not good with chilli ask them to recommend some dishes that aren&#39;t too spicy.",

"reviewcomment":"Ah, it is so refreshing every time I find a restaurant on King Street that isn&#39;t Thai. The name of this place, which loosely translates to &#39;cuddles&#39; in English, is also the nickname for one of Italy&#39;s most famous porn star/politicians.  I&#39;m not 100% sure if this was intentional, but the sexy purple exterior of the restaurant is surely not an indication of a grandma-style Italian restaurant.  Cicciolina is a modern trattoria and pizzeria and tries hard to distinguish itself as such.<br><br>When I went for dinner, my table shared the garlic pizza as a starter.  It was crusty and perfectly garlic-y.  When it came to the mains, I had the pasta marinara with seafood for around $30.  It was pretty good.  The portions were adequate and the food came quickly.  Though the décor of the restaurant is trendy, hip, and modern, the menu itself isn&#39;t particularly avant-garde, and features many classic Italian dishes.  Nothing to rave about, but still satisfying.",

"reviewcomment":"A steak is just a steak, right? Wrong. For a sophisticated twist on a classic meal, head down to Steersons where you can enjoy the perfect, most tender steak in a stylish venue, boasting arched ceilings and chandeliers, and situated right on the water. <br><br>You can tell how much thought they put into their specialty from the menu which explains the different types of steaks and how they are best cooked. I chose the Riverina fillet steak with bacon and garlic butter, well done ($37.50 for 220grams). Served with my choice of chips, baked potato or mash, it was probably the best steak I&#39;ve had in a while but considering it&#39;s quite expensive, I was a bit annoyed it didn&#39;t come with salad and the mushroom sauce was extra. <br><br>For those wishing to satisfy a whooping appetite for an equally whopping price, try the famous Wagyu rib-eye steak ($69.50) which has been scoffed down by a few boys I know, though I haven&#39;t attempted it yet.  <br><br>Be prepared to spend money but for a succulent steak lunch or dinner in a stunning setting, nothing beats Steersons.",

"reviewcomment":"This fantastic little French café is my favorite recent discovery.  Le Depot is situated in Ultimo, close to the Ian Thorpe Aquatic Centre.  Unfortunately for me, I was late in joining the bandwagon of people that love this place.  It is always crowded!  Perhaps it is just too small, but that just adds to the charm of this place.  The atmosphere can be described as slightly industrial, yet it is dim and cozy as well.  The cafe is furnished with small tables and chairs and a bar and with high stools.  They have a great selection of French on-the-go snacks like baguette sandwiches, a variety of quiches, and some pastries.  All the food here is reasonably priced, something I really appreciate since similar places in Sydney seem to love overcharging for French food.  <br><br>Aside from making amazing coffee, this place has consistently provided me with satisfying lunches.  Try a baguette ($7.50) that comes with different fillings.  I really recommend the croque monsieur or the lamb baguettes.  Le Depot also makes savory crepes.  For some on-the-go indulgence, definitely take home some of their pastries or croissants.  The almond croissant was top-notch (around $4).",

A couple of times a week (ok, often more) I&#39;d trundle down for one of their sumptuous sandwiches.

Those were happy times.<br><br>Now I simply have to make a point of going back to the Point! After some time overseas I was delighted to note the shop&#39;s simple makeover (love the stripy cushions outside), but more thrillingly, my eyes went straight to the blackboard declaring Allpress coffee! Squee! I didn&#39;t think The Point Deli could get any better. <br><br>Aside from the happy couple of tables outside, there are a few stools by windows and a large table to pull up a pew. But if you&#39;re coming for a lunchtime sandwich, you&#39;ll have to fight the hoards of hungry workers who all make similar pilgrimages to the point each day. Instead, I&#39;d recommend taking your sandwich and your coffee and following your nose down the hill to Blues Point Reserve.

And Stanley Street, of course, a gluttons paradise with a ton of restaurants and bars and restaurants masquerading as bars. <br><br>This time &#39;round I discovered Third Village, which is a terrace-style joint that closely resembles a warm, inviting nook that I want to smoke cheroots and read Edgar Allen Poe in. Although that&#39;s not really altogether practical, so instead I looked across the table at a big round-bottomed beaker full of something fascinating and told the waiter &#34;I&#39;ll have that.&#34; It was chai, delicious, warm chai, with that glorious layer of froth and spice sitting on top that looks as good as it tastes. <br><br>Then I got hungry. Although the omelettes looked damned appealing, it was getting closer to lunch than it was to breakfast and I feel weird eating brekkie outside the allotted hours (7-10:30) so I went for the roast beef roll, which came on a soft bun on a plate smeared artfully with seeded mustard, and which and was loaded with pickles and butter lettuce and tasted like the thinking man&#39;s Reuben.

People cross the road and come from streets away to get a hot injection of happy humanity on a shitty cold morning on their way to work. The staff here are the greatest. Laid back and funny in way that cuts through even the gruffest morning fug, they&#39;ll send you on your way with strong, bold coffees and a smile like a freaking unicorn. <br><br>Big, thick, banana bread will run you $4.50, and a regular latte $3.50. Sit on the little cube chairs outside and watch the world go by and grin and gloat because you&#39;re in like a little coffee-themed house party with a bunch of friends you just met and they&#39;re not.",

Every dish was unique and delicious. <br>With only two of us we probably could have stopped there, but the pork was calling us, and a serve of French blue cheese for dessert couldn&#39;t be overlooked. <br><br>We ate and drank ourselves onto a coma for $194.

"reviewcomment":"In 2005, while visiting Portland, OR, I ate a  raw tuna and avocado salsa called &#39;Guacapoke&#39; that I&#39;ve maintained steadfastly - until now - was the best thing I&#39;ve ever eaten. It was at a Japanese/South Seas fusion restaurant, so I suppose it&#39;s only appropriate that another Japanese fusion chef would be the guy to finally match it. I&#39;m talking about Big Stone&#39;s Aburi Ocean Trout Sashimi, a delicate, warm dish of delicious trout pieces garnished with salty seaweed and dressed with a perfect ponzu. Rarely is an ingredient done such justice - I can&#39;t imagine a better context for that amazing trout.<br><br>And so Big Stone earns its fifth star. The other four come from its warm atmosphere, surprising confidence - the Spanish theme that runs through it somehow feels authentic once you get inside - its service and, of course, remaining, mostly delicious menu. It&#39;s certainly adventurous, and as such it may throw off more traditional palates - the icy-cold tofu in a leaf salad took a while to convince - but when adventure leads to treasure the journey is always worthwhile.<br><br>Such is the journey here. And there&#39;s one easily-answered question that surely redeems Big Stone&#39;s Japan-o-tapas concept, and validates its clever execution: Who the hell out there is too special to wash down a perfect Japanese-inspired creation with a big glass of sangria and a crispy-chewy Churro dipped in cream?

I have gone to most of the big name locations in Sydney and I personally love Palace Chinese the best.<br><br>They offer all the standard Yum Cha fare, but excel at a few amazing dishes;<br><br>1) Salt &amp; Pepper Squid - cooked fresh to order, you have to ask them to get you some - but it&#39;s really worth it. As a bonus the waiter that brings you this dish is really nice and probably the only staff member that laughs.<br><br>2) Gin Chong Fun (aka, Fried Rice Noodle w/ Peanut sauce) - you can&#39;t find this dish at every restaurant, but Palace does it and it&#39;s quite good. Marigold might do a better version imo.<br><br>*Protip*: If you park downstairs in the Picadilly Parking lot (entrance on Castlereigh St, near 133) you can get your parking validated after you finish your meal. Just hand your parking ticket in with your Yum Cha card and they should give you voucher.<br><br>NB: We are still unsure about what the spending requirement is for this, but it seems to be that you have to spend a certain amount to get this offer. It&#39;s well worth it as you are already paying for awesome food, why not enjoy free/cheaper parking?",

Everything looked good - grilled salmon, cooked tuna, kingfish, prawn, katsu prawn, chicken teriyaki - so we just ordered that. Two massive plates came out with a bunch of different yummy rolls.  Some were raw and some were cooked.  We both started noshing down and had to remind ourselves to slow down.  <br><br>Although we were full, we ordered a few more rolls because we wanted to make the most of it.  We got the salmon belly, squid and inari, spider roll and some more grilled salmon.

Extremely delicious and dangerous but so tasty. <br><br>They finally have somewhere to sit out front but it is a little rough - think boxes to sit on. But still nice since their coffee is decent when you are munching on the pastries. A better coffee is up the street at Bar Coluzzi but you will have to sneak the pastries from Infinity.",

"reviewcomment":"I have eaten breakfast at a diverse range of places around the world and have come to anticipate a very predictable array of offerings, eggs, cereals and occasionally a creative twist on the same. Petrol, a small restaurant situated in the grungy heart of Pott&#39;s Point, proves to be the delectable exception! Using many of the ingredients with a refreshingly artistic twist, they manage to impart a certain delicacy to their dishes. Choosing between the baked eggs and pecan crepes becomes an almost exquisite dilemma! The faint buttery taste of the mushrooms lingers sensually long. The selection of teas is sufficiently impressive. Dining on the porch is an intimate and somewhat genteel backdrop, to the never ending parade of curious characters that saunter past. The staff, in particular, the very gracious &amp; sweet Sara, are always attentive and friendly. Petrol is an unusual name for a restaurant and perhaps it sets the tone for the hybrid mélange of tastes one experiences there. It is a place that adds fuel to the fire of anticipation, for one&#39;s next encounter with breakfast there.",

I really like this place, I went in here with my wife at about ten pm when they were about to close and were really nice and stayed open for us slightly longer than usual. Their garlic pizza which costs an extra $2 when you buy a large pizza was incredibly tasty-I think I enjoyed this more than the pizza itself, crusty, light and full of flavour. The pizzas were good and the staff incredibly helpful to find a tomato based alternative for my wife who&#39;s allergic to tomato paste. The pesto based pumpkin pizza she ordered was great as was my mexican. Great to see a pizza store as well that does vegetarian and vegan options for their customers.",

"reviewcomment":"Ripples at Milsons Point will always be my first love, but I really shouldn&#39;t hold that against Sydney Wharf. <br><br>This beautifully designed restaurant has a stellar view (ahem, though not quite as lovely as Milsons...) and is a wonderful spot to escape the hustle and bustle of the CBD. It&#39;s too easy to stroll over the Pyrmont Bridge and around beside the Maritime Museum to Ripples. You may walk a little tentatively down the wharf wondering where the restaurant is, so just keep an eye peeled for the signing pointing the way.<br><br>First timers really shouldn&#39;t go past Ripples famous fish and chips. It never fails to disappoint, especially if you order a side salad to temper all the batter and carbs - or you can even order the fish grilled. The rest of the menu is delicious Modern Australian fare - the mains range from $25-32, and it&#39;s always worth asking about the specials. These guys know how to do their fish.  <br><br>It&#39;s also handy to know that like their sibling across the pond, the restaurant is BYO (corkage =$8 per bottle) and padded out with fun, colourful cushions - all the better to kick back with a glass of wine and enjoy a looooong lunch!",

It was across the road from the Rose of Australia pub so it was a good idea to fill up my stomach with food before filling up my stomach with beer. And finally it was nice!<br><br>I pretty much always got the same thing so I can tell you the salt and pepper calamari, the salt and pepper soft shell crab, the vegetable pad thai, the hokkien stir fry and the green curry were all good. I didn&#39;t get the all at once by the way. <br><br>It won&#39;t break the budget either so it&#39;s good if you&#39;ve already spent your allowance for the week or you want to spend it across the road at the pub!",

"reviewcomment":"A little bit Italian and a little bit Australian, Aperitivo tries to strike a halfway point between the two. Having lived in Italy I can see what they are trying to do - be an Italian wine bar and restaurant, and I believe they have succeeded as best they can.<br>Most of the staff look like Italian male models and have typically Italian accents. I don&#39;t know whether they&#39;re straight off the plane and are on working visas but Aperitivo seems to get the best looking guys.<br>The drinks are a little pricey but the meals are fine. They have a range of cocktails, a great list of wines and a number of sharing plates. If you have a healthy appetite you will have to order two or three of these. The meals are typically Italian with polpette (meatballs) and calamari (squid). On Tuesday they have pizza and beer nights, cheaper than the rest of the week and a good way of getting to know the place.<br>If you&#39;re looking for a place with atmosphere, they have live music on Fridays but make sure you&#39;re not near the front door when they&#39;re playing, a lack of conversation will ensue as they are loud and they play in a confined place.<br>Normally I go with a friend and we have a couple of drinks and two courses each and we get away under $100.",

"reviewcomment":"So, you know how there was a reality TV show called My Kitchen Rules? Well, there was, and two people on it either won it or came close to winning it and then they ran off and set up their own restaurant and this is that restaurant. <br><br>I came here with dear old mater on a mumsy-sonsy date. She was armed with a voucher of some description that gave us a share-style meal for two with entree, mains and dessert and it kinda sorta almost blew me outta my pants the food was that good. I don&#39;t know what I expected, but whatever those expectations were, they were exceeded. Is that possible? Anyway, that&#39;s what happened. <br><br>Entrees were beet, goats cheese and rocket salad with walnuts, some kingfish sashimi served with grapefruit and watermelon, and salt and pepper calamari with chilli, all excellent. <br><br>Main was this giant slab of beautifully juicy sirloin cut into thick slices with sides of Parisienne mash, wilted spinach and baby chats and adorned with caremalised onions. I didn&#39;t know whether to salivate or masticate, so I did one then t&#39;other. It was so big we couldn&#39;t finish it, which is some kinda travesty I tells ya.<br><br>Dessert bordered on molecular gastronomy. There were three things, the winner being a kind of hard toffee ice cream larded with frozen fruit and topped with a cube of the most delicate pineapple jelly that melted on your tongue so fast you weren&#39;t sure you actually ate it at all. There was a chocolate pudding with raspberry coulis and one other thing that I can&#39;t remember because sour apple cocktail. <br><br>Oh, and we were the only ones there on a Tuesday night. I mean, place was just dead. Which was fine with me. More for us.",

Well, it may not be the best Polish food in town in my humble opinion, but it&#39;s worth coming here for the cheesecake alone...and the friendly owner who  always comes up to say hello, which is a welcome change from many ostentatious venues serving average food.",

Don&#39;t let the spice deter you though, Mamak serves up dishes with incredible flavours to match. <br><br>I went for dinner on a Sunday and first ordered the &#34;Ice More More Tea&#34; and Chicken Lobak ($7.20) to start. The tea was a reminiscent of Thai ice tea with the condensed milk, but had a thick black syrup on the bottom that was insanely sweet and delicious. Our starter had tofu and yam combined with the chicken in log form, fried, and served with an incredible dipping sauce. I have a friend who says &#34;All food is just a carrier for great sauce,&#34; and I would be hard pressed to argue with him here. <br><br>As our main we ordered the Roti Bawang ($6.50) and the Mamak Village Goreng ($13.90). My favorite was the roti. Basically just a huge, thin pancake filled with sliced red onion, this traditional Malaysian dish comes with three separate dipping sauces. The lentil one (which, admittedly, was the color of pond algae) was lacking in flavour. The other two were spot on. Our noodle, prawn, chicken dish was intensely spicy. The noodle segments were no longer than 3 centimeters, making them look a little like meal worms to me. After I got over that association, I found them to be quite delicious. <br><br>For a two-person meal ringing in at under $30 dollars, I left the village of Mamak feeling pretty darn content.",

That is the Asian highlight.<br><br>If you don&#39;t want to be a stereotype, theres lots for everyone else:<br>-Excellent salad bar, like a gourmet one of the Broadway coles bar, where you can make your own ceasar salad which can out do the top master chef salad this year<br>-Thick cut chips and fish fillet, yay fish and chips!<br>-Laksa.....they just have the soup and noodles, but you can go to the cavery section and add CHICKEN, hey even add one of those prawns your parents keep trying to shove down your throat<br>-Lots of asian stuff, stir fries, curries etc<br>-Pizza<br>-Pasta<br>-Soup<br>-everything really....<br><br>AND then there&#39;s STRESSED backwards. Here you will find like 15 sweet things to choose from such as:<br>-cheesecake<br>-jelly<br>-cake<br>-cake<br>-pudding<br>-AND OMG the profiteroles are the best best best!! I swear when I was a fat girl I ate like 10 in one go.,............they were tasty and I had no shame in calories.<br><br>So I do think anyone who can&#39;t control themselves should go here to binge eat....maybe just bring a plastic bag at the end of it for the trip home if you really lack self control.<br><br>Price is around $40 depending on the day. Not cheap but better than the Westie RSL buffets and on par with the high class buffets.",

"reviewcomment":"The Gallery Cafe is deceptively sized: occupying one regular shopfront on Booth Street, the main cafe area extends way back to a large dining area and with another section downstairs. As you might imagine, the walls adorned with paintings, giving this establishment its name. This is a fairly beloved cafe in the area and with good reason.<br><br>The portions at Gallery are astronomical: the last time I dined, I ordered the chorizo and scrambled eggs breakfast with two extra hash browns (roughly $18) and the plate arrived looking like Richard Dreyfus&#39; mashed potato sculpture in Close Encounters Of The Third Kind. It was a truly massive and formidable serving and I attacked it with gusto. I didn&#39;t eat lunch that day, if you were wondering. Additionally, I have to reserve special praise for the hash browns: slightly closer to a fritter than a traditional hash brown, this doesn&#39;t matter. These are so tasty and soft. It&#39;s ridiculous. My brain is salivating right now as it thinks of it.<br><br>The service is generally of a high standard and on the busier weekend days, you can expect a little wait if you come at peak times. On my last visit for coffee, after a ten minute wait on a sparsely patronised afternoon, we were served by a waitress who was a little awkward which made us feel a little awkward and launched a cycle of awkward feelings. This is the exception, however, rather than the rule, so rest assured that your experience will probably be smooth sailing.",

They are sweet here, but it can get manic, nowhere to stand when waiting for takeaway.

It&#39;s nothing out of the ordinary with regard to its menu choices, with the usual crowd of money bags, satay, penang and various coloured curries each assuming their rightful places. <br><br>I decided to go for the Walking Duck Salad (don&#39;t worry, it&#39;s just a name - $16.90) and a serving of fish cakes ($7.90). My previous experience with a Thai salad was that the chilli level caused not-inconsiderable discomfort to myself, but thankfully this time I&#39;m happy to report chilli levels returned to normal and I was instead treated to fresh flavours and tender duck. And the fish cakes had that pleasant springiness to them as well as a delicious, not-too-fish taste! <br><br>So for a small little eatery, this is a great find!",

Beware though as it&#39;s fairly spicy, but that&#39;s just the way I like it. I&#39;m definitely getting this one again.<br>19. Pad Kra Prao = Paul J also mentioned this one as well.

The pancakes consist of three light and ethereal crepes served with a small ocean of maple syrup and a large dollop of softly whipped schlag (cream). The big breakfast IS big and will satisfy all but gargantuan appetites. These two offerings along with a long black for each diner will not make a huge dent in the day&#39;s dining-out budget and assures the diner they will survive if lunch is a bit late that day.<br><br>Situated on the edge of Fitzroy Gardens and the El Alamein fountain, Maggie&#39;s offers a quiet respite from the bustle of Macleay Street especially if a diner chooses an inside table. While a bit more noise filters from the street while seated outdoors the atmosphere at Maggie&#39;s seems to belie its location.<br><br>As mentioned by other reviewers Maggie&#39;s specializes in German-Austrian dishes. Which, to our chagrin and no doubt disadvantage, we have yet to try as one meal out a day for us (as travelers) is the limit and Maggie&#39;s breakfasts are our first choice.<br><br>Service is friendly and items emerge quickly from the open kitchen.

But it did well, and the young owner was told that an evening wine bar would also do well, so now it does that as well.<br><br>And it does both well. It&#39;s a small space, with a street-facing counter for a quick coffee, a few tables, and a semi-private booth in front; a long corridor past the kitchen and storerooms; and then a small funky courtyard in back.<br><br>I&#39;ve been for breakfast and found it fun and tasty. My salsa eggs, with spicy diced tomato-y bits and salty halloumi, were a fine breakfast. <br><br>I&#39;ve been for drinks and found it very relaxed, and with a big and interesting list of wines (by glass and bottle), beers (imported bottles), and cocktails (2 for 1 Hendricks gin sours? sure!). Shared with some warm spiced olives, and you&#39;ve got yourself a very happy hour.<br><br>We had one incident where coffees were forgotten during a breakfast order, but other than that service has been exemplary: very friendly, and not in a fake way.<br><br>Super neighbourhood cafe/bar.",

"reviewcomment":"A popular place to have drinks and food in the city by the looks of it. I usually go here to find my friends and I usually prefer to buy drinks when happy hour starts. I think this place is quite good as it&#39;s not so noisy even on Friday or Saturday night. <br><br>It has both inside and outside seating so if you prefer smoking or sitting outside, this is the place for you. The outside tables don&#39;t get packed up until closing time, so if you prefer to seat outside and drink after midnight, this is a good place to go. They have happy hour here after 9:30pm, so if you want to pay less, come later but normally the drinks aren&#39;t that expensive. Plus if you want to eat, they have all the usual pub food and it&#39;s quite good here for dinner if you are hungry.  <br><br>A great place to hangout with your friends if want to go have some food and something to drink away from the main streets.",

"reviewcomment":"I figured I would like this place being an American....American style food...American style portions, but I was surely disappointed. Not that I expected anything special from Margaritaville, but for the price you pay you&#39;d think it&#39;d be better. <br><br>I had the jambalaya and it pretty much seemed nothing more than cheap fried rice. It was dry and I think I found 1 piece of sausage. The prawns were decent sized and pretty tasty, but jambalaya is all about the rice! A friend had the seafood mac &#39;n&#39; cheese and it was actually pretty tasty. Way too rich for an entire meal, but still tasty. The beer was average price and the staff was pretty helpful.....but it can&#39;t makeup for the dish they claim to be as jambalaya. <br><br>As most places off Darling Harbour, Margaritaville is super touristy. Overpriced and mediocre food at best. I would definitely have a drink or two here, but avoid the food if you can.<br><br>Though we did see someone order the nachos and it was literally a mountain.

Outdoor dining on rickety tables with check blankets. Definitely unique. I like taking people here for the first time to see their reaction.<br>Healthy, wholesome food. Some reviews call it bland - those reviewers must like fatty, sugary food though as it tastes delicious. Think gluten-free, vegan, vegetarian options with fresh herbs, veggies and chilli. Yum. If I was in Sydney <br>I&#39;d go tonight.<br>Book people!<br>Don&#39;t miss out.",

I will not be so scared to ask about local dishes next time. For the person in an ealier review who thought the meat was burnt, I have to say it is a &#34;charcoal grill&#34;, if they want to see real burnt meat come to one of my BBQ&#39;s. <br>this restauarnt is like travelling Europe, dont expect pristine service but do expect honest and well prepared food from a region that so few of us in Australia have experianced.",

I keep looking at the restaurant for ideas on how to decorate my kitchen/dining room.<br><br>I went tonight for my birthday dinner with my partner. I have to give an honourable mention to Andy (The Maître d&#39;) and Lydia, the wonderfully knowledgeable waitress - master of food description (I can&#39;t think of a more honorary title, sorry) .<br><br>The food is always fresh, creative and superb. I&#39;ve also been lucky that at each visit the menu has been refreshed to reflect the season.<br><br>Tonight we had the &#34;Fritella affumicato - potato &amp; leek pancake - smoked salmon - salmon roe&#34; and &#34;Gamberi al vapore - steamed prawns - pearl barley - chick peas - baby spinach - lemon olive oil &#34; as entree. Followed by &#34;Chatham Island blue cod - spinach - salsa crudo&#34; and &#34;Risotto con funghi - porcini mushrooms - vermouth - thyme&#34;... all I can say about the food and service is &#34;FAULTLESS AND WONDERFUL&#34;. <br><br>It&#39;s also wonderful that the background noise has been baffled by very clever design. My partner is  Deaf and needs limited background noise and good light to be able to to lip read. The very discreet ceiling baffles and good lighting are very conducive to this. Thank you La Scala for the intuitive design.<br><br>I really can&#39;t wait to go back again. LOVE LOVE LOVE. Thank you La Scala for another wonderful meal and evening.<br><br>P.S. I forgot to mention, the raspberry and almond tart with pistachio ice cream is an awesome dessert. Make sure you leave room!",

This is a divine concoction at this establishment that wants you coming back for more and more on an odd weekend. <br><br>Just take it all in and let the morning unfold as you relax prior to working out what you are planning on doing for the rest of this given day on a weekend. Great either alone or with company. I don&#39;t know; however personally (at this establishment) I would prefer to eat and drink in peace: alone.",

Our only regret was that we weren&#39;t able to order and try more of their very unique dishes! even their classic dishes were impressive. We were told the chef goes to buy their fish at the fish market every morning, so fresh sashimi is guaranteed! <br>Their cocktail list was great too, very creative! Plus, $5 house spirits and beer on week nights!<br><br>The atmosphere was great, although it was only a week night. Big fan of the Red Hot Chili peppers playlist they were playing, very chill and contemporary! Perfect for the modern look and feel of the restaurant. The courtyard dining area out the back was also a plus!<br><br>Only downfall was that while the waiters were very attentive, the food was a bit slow. Also, there was no large signs outside and the lights were dim so it was a bit hard to find!",

"reviewcomment":"We were hungry for Thai food and wanted something different and not to far from home. Generally neither me or my partner would go to a restaurant with mixed nationality cuisine (in this case Vietnamese &amp; Thai) but Mekong has many good reviews on the internet. The place serves as a takeaway shop, but the eat-in space is set up pretty nicely - its clean, has nice sturdy tables and chairs, and the noodle bar is of fresh ingredients on display behind behind glass. <br><br>We ordered fish cakes to start, it is at $6 &amp; it is delicious! There is a good balance of herbs, and it is nice and moist when you bite in. I ordered chicken Tom Yum and was served a big bowl of it, the soup is well flavoured, the veges &amp; meat were plenty, and it was refreshing &amp; not oily at all. Hubby had a nasi goreng, again its well spiced, and all the rice were nicely coated in sauce (no white rice visible).<br><br>Both of us left happy and satisfied. Although there are many people come and go with takeaway but as the seats are inside it didn&#39;t bother us at all.

"reviewcomment":"It&#39;s scrubbed up nice, the Royal Exchange Hotel. Maybe still not something you&#39;d find in Potts Point or the inner-city, but the upgrade has done wonders and it&#39;s the best spot along Marrickville Road for a casual drink and pub grub.<br><br>It&#39;s got a few different areas, including a decent courtyard and space for functions. The bistro food is surprisingly good too. The menu&#39;s got all the usual favourites, like steaks, pizza and pasta, and mains like beer-battered fish, the beef burger and chicken schnitzel are all served with chips. There&#39;s even a tapas menu with dishes like grilled squid, chorizo and prawns, but I&#39;ve never tried it out and think I&#39;d rather go to a Spanish restaurant than a pub for my fix... If you&#39;ve got little ones in tow, there are also a bunch of kids&#39; meals for $8. <br><br>There are TV screens for sports games, a bottle shop for takeaways and a bus stop for city buses right outside.",

Eclectic and cozy interior.<br>Staff were friendly and efficient with their service. <br>The wagyu burger is to die for! Thick beef pattie , well cooked yet still tender and juicy, followed by layers of crispy bacon, caramelised onions, lettuce, beetroot and topped with a special sauce with a hint of spiciness . All this deliciousness sandwiched between fresh and crispy bun. The fries were just how I like it crispy and salty .  <br>Next time will try the restaurant upstairs.",

As usual I spend I good 15 mins pondering over choice (I do this all the time but always order the same thing, so I guess its purely for entertainment purposes) only to choose my farmhouse breakfast, with extra bacon, extra hash browns and a few other extras.<br><br>As usual it hit the spot of breakfast craving as I ate in my usual gluttonous manor, downsides I hate over cooked meat so crispy bacon is so not cool! pricing is average and the servers are always super sweet, which is great when I have just woken and stumbled my way there in my best diva after a hard night out impersonation.",

"reviewcomment":"Best pasties I have ever eaten.<br><br>The pastry is thick and crispy. Just like biting into a crunchy hashbrown made of yummy pastry. I think what makes the pasties awesome though is the filling. Unlike the dodgy ones which used to be served at primary school canteens prior to the health regulations, these pasties have real food inside their fillings. When you bite into the warm, gooey goodness wrapped inside the golden pastry, you will be able to see exactly what you&#39;re eating. So if it&#39;s the chicken tikka masala, it&#39;s 100% big chunks of chicken breast pieces with a lovely curry sauce. Or if it&#39;s the bacon and potato, you get exactly what you ordered, fluffy potato(not that powdered stuff) with crunchy real bacon pieces and melted cheese. <br><br>Unfortunately, I have a daily calorie limit but if I could come in just one sitting, I would play pastie Pokemon. There&#39;s so many different pasties here that I would use my mouth as a giant pokeball and try them all. I&#39;m sure I would be so fat but happy after.",

"reviewcomment":"This is a beautiful little boutique bakery with all sorts of find-looking desserts. Their glass cases contain some sweet, hand-crafted delicacies. And the cafe looks like just the sort of place you would linger and gossip and partake of crumbly little bits of baked goodness.<br><br>But I&#39;ll admit that in the several times I&#39;ve been here the only thing I&#39;ve ever had are their Portugese tarts. Dear god, they&#39;re fantastic. Creamy and delicious and browned just right and with a bit of cinnamon on top to set them off.<br><br>Oh, man. I wonder what time they open in the morning?<br><br>Note: they&#39;re a little fussy about what you call their tarts, they. They&#39;re technically named &#34;Sweet Belem Tarts&#34;. Asking for Portugese Tarts will also probably work. But DO NOT call them egg tarts; you will get a stern reprimand and a lesson about why they DO NOT make egg tarts here.",

Probably not as a great as the Melbourne version, however it was worth joining the parade of hungry eaters on a beautiful summer Saturday night with a date in tow; the love of my life back at the time. Simple but elegant. Designed for you to eat and appreciate outside. Their pasta packs some punch; especially the fettuccine carbonara: oh so thick and creamy; but not to the point where you feel so bloated afterwards. Eating pasta at this establishment makes you feel that you might have been Italian in a previous life.<br><br>It can get addictive, and within good reason as well. Please don&#39;t come here every weekend if you eat out every weekend; there is more of Leichhardt&#39;s culinary delights to explore. Lygon Street is to Melbourne as Norton Street is to Sydney. I rest my case. In saying this, an awesome dining experience overall: so make Sapore a destination you will come back to again and again in the future; especially if the food and the great customer service is consistent each and every time. Great with a date, or even with a few of your close friends. Don&#39;t know why; however eating in a large group just wouldn&#39;t cut it for me here.",

"reviewcomment":"As Irish bars go, this one isn&#39;t too sticky or smelly, which is a plus! OK, I may be comparing it to Scruffy Murphy&#39;s but still, it&#39;s not a bad pub. As with most Irish bars, it can get quite noisy when a few pints of the black stuff have been sunk, but it&#39;s generally a good atmosphere and there&#39;s a pretty decent restaurant upstairs too! <br><br>Of course, like all Irish pubs, you&#39;ll be able to watch sporting action from both hemispheres, so not a bad option if you&#39;re pining for Gaelic Football or Hurling but can&#39;t be bothered traipsing into the city. Plus, it still manages to keep it&#39;s pub atmosphere as opposed to the sense that it&#39;s just a drunken meat market! <br><br>Oh, and if you think the Guinness over here is no good, they have cans imported from Ireland - so if you don&#39;t like that, you may just not be into Guinness.",

"reviewcomment":"Deus Ex Machina, you tricked me.  <br><br>After years of avoiding this place, due to it&#39;s comparatively high prices and noisy Parramatta Rd location, I finally ventured in here after a visit to Deus&#39; Surry Hills Bicycle Works cafe (review: <a href='http://www.yelp.com.au/biz/deus-ex-machina-surry-hills#hrid:jXnL3XnQdOKMJnAbfpd9rQ/src:self'>yelp.com.au/biz/deus-ex-…</a>).  At Bicycle Works, I was surprised and delighted to find another subscriber to Little Marionette beans.  My coffee was perfectly sweet, rich and lingering.  So, when thinking of somewhere new to head for a coffee, I figured I&#39;d finally give Deus Ex Machina a go - after all, if they&#39;ve had Little Marionette beans this whole time then more the fool me.<br><br>So I ventured through the side door of Deus Ex Machina, hankering for a good coffee and with a good feeling that I was going to get one.  The Deus shop was far bigger than I&#39;d anticipated.  And, despite how loud the venue was, it seemed the perfect place to get some work done - at least 15 people in here were working on laptops, iPads or even pen and paper (!), with another 5 - 10 still reading the paper.  How then, with all these busily silent customers, does the place get so raucous?  Because the shop itself is so big that it still fits another sizeable group of people, made up of loudly assertive business meetings, cooing Mum&#39;s clubs (plenty of room to swing a pram) and young families.  The dinging of kitchen bells contributes to the rising cafe soundtrack, as does the hiss, grind and occasional squeal of the coffee machine.  And yet, as all the other working bees in Deus have obviously already found out, it&#39;s extremely easy to find an inner peace bubble within this jungle of sounds.<br><br>The shop is filled with five long and stretching tables at which strangers sit side by side, plus another handful again of still large but smaller tables in simple wood on wood designs.  The large windows are curtained with red velvet drapes and a range of pop art, film posters and various other greaser/badass art hangs from the walls.  A couple of motorbikes stand inside the shop and old surfing videos and cock fights play on the one plasma screen at the back of the cafe whilst Ella Fitzgerald trickles from the stereo.  A table full of magazines and newspapers stands by the door and the menu itself, scrawled onto domineering chalk boards, adds to the artistic flair of this sizeable shop.<br><br>So yeah, the cafe is cool.  Food looks yummy (sticking by my reasons for not coming here before - I still can&#39;t afford to eat here!) and despite the noise, the ambience is fantastic.  But how was the coffee?  As soon as I ordered, I looked over at the machine in search for Little Marionette&#39;s signature &#34;I (heart) Benny&#34; sticker.  It was no where to be seen.  Instead, I found a stack of takeaway cups emblazoned with Di Lorenzo&#39;s red graphics.  I had been tricked.  The coffee was well made, but the beans weren&#39;t the flavour I was after.  Looks like I will have to get a better paying job so I can afford a different reason to come back to this super cool cafe.",

Also accessible via the lobby of 420 George St, I love that you are able to sit out on the balcony like area for a quieter experience.<br><br>The coffee here was actually not that bad. While there was more milk than I required, compared to most cafes around here, the layered effect they achieved looked pretty damm tempting. Unfortunately it suffers from inconsistency and so I can&#39;t give it a 4 star review, but if you are looking for a quiet cafe for a business meeting that serves decent coffee, this might be the place for you.<br><br>The lasting memory I have of this cafe is the excellent service.

Lol.. ill explain.. my order was with chicken karaage, chicken teriyaka and tempura (prawns, calamari and vegetables). <br><br>The food i ordered was good, but I don&#39;t know why i ordered so much fried food when i was at a sushi place. The chicken teriyaki was really good. I don&#39;t usually like tempura as it is too oily but I ate the prawns (1 piece) and calamari (1 piece).<br><br>My boyfriend got the salmon lovers bento box which had SO MUCH SALMON! From memory it was around $21. There were salmon roles, nigiri sushi and then sashimi. The quality of the salmon was good, and it tasted fresh (i just had a piece of everything on his plate). <br><br>It is a little hole in the wall, nothing too fancy. It was quite packed actually. We just walked in on a Friday night, it is a casual spot to dine. Saw many different types of groups, families, dates, and groups of adults. I would come here again. It is nothing special, but when craving sushi, and its close by, then i would choose this place due to convenience.",

My taste buds are awash with curiosity. We&#39;ve never had African before!!!<br><br>So in we dive and get seated. I have no idea what anything on the menu was or what was the best thing to try. The waitress was really patient with us and our endless questions.<br><br>She let us know what the cultural foods we should try first were and based on what we usually like to eat what else we might like to try.<br><br>To start with I had to try the vegetarian triangles, my mouth insisted. They were sort of like curry puffs but flakier and a totally different flavour. Ok, so maybe they were nothing alike, but I&#39;m trying to find something comparable and obviously I&#39;m failing here :D<br><br>For my main I had to try the Ndebele - meaty, overnight stewing, vegies? Oh the nom! My taste buds were singing happily and berating me for not trying African food before now.<br><br>We left with an African food baby. Of the good sort. Rolled my way home after that.<br><br>So if you&#39;ve never tried African. Then you should. Don&#39;t forget to ask your wait staff about the food if you&#39;re feeling confused. They are super helpful!!<br><br>The only reason it got 4 stars was because of the decor inside. I felt a bit bombarded with bright colours and not the best in seating/furniture. But you aren&#39;t there for the bad murals or less than furniture, go for the food. The food is totally worth it!",

Well, pals from across the pond, on the weekend I found a beauty for you:<br><br>Proper pastrami served on a rye bread roll with big slices of salty dill pickle, lashings of rocket and a mustardy-herb-mayo-vinaigrette kinda dressing that I did absolutely no justice to with that terrible description. Damn thing was a revelation, ataste sensation that was over all too quickly. Thought about ordering an immediate second. Looked down at my belly. Thought some more.

"reviewcomment":"To be frank upon walking into this place I thought I had mistakenly walked into Starbucks. The tables, chairs, the colour palette, and the buzz of the place just reminded me of one of Starbucks&#39; many coffee houses in the Sydney CBD. <br><br>The other customers who were there looked like they could have been the frequent Starbucks types: University students on their lap tops, businessmen having coffees with their colleagues and small groups of people having talks over a few beverages and cakes. <br><br>Anyway I came here to try their famous honey toast they&#39;re famous for. Basically it&#39;s slabs of thick cut buttered  toast, drizzled with honey and lots of whipped cream on top. Definitely something you would avoid if you are watching your waistline however I am not one one of those people. <br><br>It was absolutely divine! The buttered honey toast and whipped cream was simply indulgent and just melt in your mouth goodness. <br><br>Luckily I shared with a friend because the portion was HUGE and it got quite sickening after a few bites. Definitely share with someone else if you&#39;re not a sweet tooth as it&#39;s a major sugar overload. Also really like their coffees which comes in hugs cups! <br><br>I like this place! Definitely will be back for their coffees and the honey toast.",

"reviewcomment":"We came to Splash during lunch time, and were at first a bit sceptical to see it was quite quiet (wasn&#39;t much busier when we walked past again that same night). We had crusty bread for a starter and it definitely wasn&#39;t worth $6, but I did want it badly enough. I ordered Gnocchi Pesto while my partner had a Steak Burger. For a quiet lunch time, our food took quite a while to come out and a couple that ordered after us got their food first - a personal hate haha. My partner quite liked his burger and at around $14 we both agree it was pretty good value. However for $18 I wasn&#39;t exactly impressed with my gnocchi - we&#39;ve probably made better at home. However the whole price for our meals combined was probably quite reasonable. The staff were also lovely, and to be fair they are a seafood restaurant.",

This place is THAT good. <br><br>So it&#39;s sandwiches - big deal, I hear you say. Yes, it IS a big deal. It doesn&#39;t matter that there is a line up to order. Because that line moves mighty fast. And you need the time to read the blackboard to decide on your sandwich. Once you&#39;ve placed your order with the friendly and evidently competent chap whose sole job it is to welcome you, advise you on options, then take your small amount of cash for what you are getting in exchange, you then wait outside. Within 5 minutes, even when it&#39;s the busy period, you have your sandwich in hand. Toasted or not. And it&#39;s bursting with filling. There are no corners cut here. This place is legit. <br><br>The other aspect that has me gushing are the juices. Freshly pressed in minutes upon ordering, your cup is filled to the brim with juice, not ice. It&#39;s 100% juice. <br><br>One toasted sandwich on Turkish and a large juice that I couldn&#39;t finish in one sitting: $14. Coming from Perth, let me tell you, that is astounding value. In a great way. <br><br>You won&#39;t regret it. All those people lining up each day cannot be wrong.",

Almost every dish benefits from 1 of 3 smoked wood influences - even the delicious cherries on the chocolate roll dessert!<br><br>The service was friendly, informative and educational.

"reviewcomment":"I like the Rose Hotel because it reminds me of San Francisco. The building is near 100 years old and has a very classic pub feeling in the front. The back, however, is a huge communal patio that begs you to kick back for an after work (or uni) schooner and befriend your neighbors. I went first on a sunny Sunday afternoon and there was a live band set up outside jammin&#39; old rock tunes. My friends and I parked on one of the long wooden benches with a bottle of white and got to chatting with those around us. I found the vibe to be very hipster, alternative - chic. I&#39;ve gone again on a Friday for happy hour and observed an influx of young professionals from the arts / media companies in surrounding Chippendale. <br><br>Food and drink wise, the place is above average on the pub grub spectrum. They have delicious pizzas from pesto pumpkin to potato, rosemary &amp; prosciutto, all between $15-$20 each. A standout is the Mexican Rose which contains chorizo, Spanish onions, roasted capsicum, jalapenos, mozzarella cheese and refried beans,<br>garnished with guacamole, sour cream and corn chips ($20). This place is definitely kickass, I recommend you get yourself here on the double.",

"reviewcomment":"We wondered in here to get out of the rain while we waited for Bistro Felix downstairs to empty out. It really is OK, but kind of a hodge-podge of construction and was quite busy which meant service staff weren&#39;t able to particularly focus on customers. <br><br>We had some small food servings, popcorn and bacon which was OK - mild heat. A charcuterie platter was well done. They&#39;d run out of hot apple cider and supplied a cold cider - on a cold rainy night not what I&#39;d particularly wanted. <br><br>I wouldn&#39;t head back there in a hurry - there were a few smokers that seemed to think since it was open air in the central part of Palings it meant it was OK to smoke, so all in all, I was happy to leave. <br><br>Maybe head back when on a less busy time - but really, in Sydney who has time to revisit places you didn&#39;t have a good experience at to begin with?",

"reviewcomment":"I had the Szechuan spicy eggplant, with rice, and I enjoyed the dish! It wasn&#39;t super greasy, so I feel that the restaurant is relatively healthy. The dish also wasn&#39;t spicy, but I suppose everyone has a different spiciness tolerance.<br><br>One problem I had was that I asked for brown rice, but then the waiter told me it was still being cooked. It wasn&#39;t too big of a deal; I just got the white rice instead. (I prefer brown rice though.) I do think $2.50 per bowl of rice is quite a lot. Another group of people asked for it a bit later, and I overheard the waiter explaining to them that the restaurant cooks new rice every Monday. I was there on a Monday, maybe 10-20 minutes after the restaurant opened.<br><br>I would want to come back and try some of the other dishes here, just not during lunch on a Monday.",

"reviewcomment":"This place is the best. I&#39;ve been coming here for almost a decade now and I almost always get the grilled fish with steamed vegetables and rice ($8.50). The food is delicious and fresh; the serving sizes are huge; and the prices are sensational.<br><br>If you come here at about 6 pm they have all their food packed into boxes which they sell for $4 each. They used to sell them for $3 each and the guy with the glasses and ponytail used to yell, &#39;Showtime, showtime, one for $3, three for $10.&#39; This made no mathematical sense to me, and one day I told him as much. The next day when I came back, the price had gone up to $4 per box. So you can blame me for that.<br><br>The fishcakes at this place are fantastic - make sure you ask for a wedge of lemon to squeeze on them for maximum deliciousness. I think they sell them at two for $3 in the evenings.",

"reviewcomment":"In case you&#39;ve been living under a rock, these little Middle Eastern holes in the wall are popping up all over Sydney. They may be small, but they pack a serious flavour punch. And they make a mean coffee. Every sixth free must be as generous as it gets in Sydney. Then there&#39;s the toasted sesame seed bagel for $5 and throw in a coffee for $6. My daily morning mocha puts a spring in my sunrise step and &#39;happy as&#39; staff put a smile on my melon. Not a bad way to kick off every day. The coffee is that good, you can always bank on a line-up - unless it&#39;s you&#39;re lucky day (so buy a lotto ticket!) ... but this is your opportunity to catch up on all the latest celebrity goss. Trashy mags galore are readily available for Sabbaba customers. One tip: read &#39;em while they&#39;re fresh - pre someone&#39;s greasy falafel fingers. Dine on freshly baked pita pockets and baklava galore. The Sabbaba pita is the go... falafel balls, village salad, tabouli, red cabbage, pickles, hummus, tahini, babaganoush and salsa. Oh yeah... bring you&#39;re appetite cuz they&#39;re hefty!",

"reviewcomment":"Home home, when we go home home home!<br><br>Ahhh, Turkish culture and cuisine .... As someone who lived in Turkey for quite sometime, I&#39;m a bit of a snob when it comes to tantalizing Turkish food. If the cheese aint peynir and the eggplant aint patlican, then this balik aint nibbling.<br><br>Too much Turkish there .. Now here comes the Pahsas explosion ..<br><br>My partner and I went here for my birthday and the moment I walked in, I felt like I was in a Cappadocian cave hostel. There were beautiful lights and lovely carpets draped all over the place; black and white pictures of touristic highlights from the 80s hung on the walls, and I was greeted with a &#34;Merhaba,&#34; which sent me spiraling right down through the rabbit hole of nostalgia ....<br><br>The place is BYO so my partner told the waiter he was heading out to grab a bottle of wine, and as soon as he spilled the secret, we were offered a &#34;special, just for you.&#34; If you&#39;ve been to Turkey, you know how comforting being offered a &#34;special deal&#34; can be. He gave us a bottle of wine and two glasses for $20, which was significantly cheaper than any wine on the menu... We also had to pay separate cash for it so the owner wouldn&#39;t  know .. Back street deals, I love it!<br><br>It was a Thursday night, so it wasn&#39;t packed, which should mean that the service should have been spot-on, but it was a bit spot-off... But hey, that&#39;s Turkey! The deal-making waiter was bustling about and forgot to bring us Turkish bread more times than three, but we didn&#39;t mind .. We were cuddled up on the awesome carpet cushions on the floor sipping black market wine.<br><br>Now the menu ... yuuuummmm!!! I would definitely recommend coming in a group so you can sample as many meze dishes as possible... But being the chubby little birthday bliss foody I am, I ordered four mezes, all of which were DELICIOUS!!!! Really .. the food was EXCEPTIONAL and worth every penny! For meze dishes, the portions were large, and a group of four could be easily satisfied with six dishes among them.<br><br>The haloumi cheese ($15) was served on a bed of walnuts and pomegranates, divine! The pan fried eggplant ($12) made me salivate, the sauteed mushrooms ($13) were perfect, and the shrimp raki ($15) took me back to days on the Bosphorous of sipping raki. This lovely assortment was definitely some of the best, authentic Turkish food I&#39;ve had!<br><br>Then I spoke Turkish to the waiter and the large group of Turkish men dining in &#34;traditional style&#34; in the middle of the restaurant, and they were swoon. We were immediately initiated into Sydney&#39;s &#34;inner circle of Turks.&#34; Knowing it was my birthday, they kindly brought over a complimentary plate of mouth watering baklava!<br><br>Needless to say, I left fat, happy, and kindly reminded of the reasons why Turkey is home and Pashas will more than do until I&#39;m back.",

They serve great food and the waiters/waitresses are reasonably friendly and quick. On the other hand, at the right time of day this place is more of a dog park than a cafe. If you have allergies, be warned. <br>Since I&#39;ve eaten here for breakfast and lunch on a number of occasions I&#39;ve been able try a couple different things on the menu. Their baked beans are on the earthier side with plenty of other veggies and some really good bread. I also recommend the banana &amp; walnut loaf; the ricotta and jam and very sweet so its a big sugary breakfast if you like that. The eggs seem a bit pricey for me. For lunch the open sandwich of avocado, feta &amp; spicy tomato sauce is a delight. Sounds simple but they nail it.",

"reviewcomment":"Every time I come here this place reminds me of being in Seoul for some reason. Maybe its the decor.<br><br>I mainly come here for the $10 lunch specials (which include dolsot bimbimbap), and have recently tried the charcoal based BBQ (which I recommend in this place if you got the chance).<br><br>A notable thing to also try here is the lemon soju (be careful, just because you can&#39;t taste the alcohol it doesn&#39;t mean its not there!)<br><br>Pricing wise (for BBQ at least) its a little bit more than what you&#39;d pay for Korean BBQ in the area, but this place offers something unique where the BBQ is charcoal based. Also an added bonus is because this place is well ventilated (and with inbuilt vents above the BBQ stove), your clothes don&#39;t end up smelling as bad.<br><br>Last but not least, its actually easier to get a table here than next door&#39;s Madang (where theres nothing really special about it once you&#39;ve been).<br><br>I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll be back here again.",

"reviewcomment":"Following our local colleague&#39;s lead for a quick Ultimo lunch before a meeting, we made our way into Malacca Straits after the Thai place he originally had in mind was closed for the afternoon, and I think fate was on our side.<br><br>It&#39;s an open, airy Malaysian/Thai restaurant that has a little something for any taste.  I had the chili prawns lunch special, and my companions went with the chicken laksa and beef rendang, and we shared some roti to soak up the various juices and sauces.  Each dish was distinctive, delicious, and inexpensive.  In particular the rendang was a big hit.  The total bill, including drinks and tip, averaged about $14 each.<br><br>The restaurant is a perfect setting for a casual afternoon lunch, with efficient, friendly service and prompt meal prep.  But if I&#39;m lucky enough to find myself in Sydney again sometime, I&#39;m going to try and get back for the BYO chili crab dinner - bring your own crab and they&#39;ll whip you up a Malaysian style chili crab for only $20.<br><br>Apparently there are imposter Malacca Straits around town trying to cash in on the reputation Chef Tan has built with this Broadway eatery, and there are certainly worse horses to hitch your wagon to.",

"reviewcomment":"Lunch was fun. This is s busy joint that works well with it&#39;s retail association. We were walk ups and benefitted from a short queue. It is always encouraging when tap<br>water is on offer and it was - sydney&#39;s white gold was good. <br>What was so great was shaved baby cabbage ... been on the menu for some time and it gets better! Meatballs and fettucine were complimentary ... indeed good flavours. We supplemented the &#39;white gold&#39; with a fine bottle of champagne Pommery. The cheese dish closed out a lovely lunch. Come and try this place. The atmosphere is amongst  Sydney&#39;s best.<br>This was lunch - the menu is quite expansive!",

Very authentic tasting and the fact that its 100% thai people eating in the outlet it definitely speaks volumes! 5 star vote is an overall experience and the $2.90 thai iced milk tea is the dealbreaker here. Can&#39;t wait to try the rest of the menu",
