"reviewcomment":"KaDeWe is a bit like Harrod&#39;s in London - you can find just about anything you need here. I was at the post office across the square from KaDeWe and needed a tube to mail some posters that I purchased from the Helmut Newtown foundation near the Zoo station. The post office didn&#39;t sell poster tubes but the helpful Beamter told me to try KaDeWe. Sure enough, on one of the top floors is a great stationary section that sells *everything* you&#39;d ever need for writing/mailing/recording stuff. I found the tube I needed, bought tape and felt tip pen - the store personnel helped me even pack the tube which I took back to the post office to mail to the States. Great experience. <br><br>The food hall at KaDeWe is amazing and the luggage section has a good selection of the German-made &#34;Rimowa&#34; brand aluminum suitcases. There&#39;s also a branch of the Dolores Mexican restaurant nearby and an excellent organic sausage stand near the entrance to the subway (if you don&#39;t want to eat at the food hall).

It took about 20 minutes from line to getting my food, and the wait was worth it.<br><br>Dolores deviates from being an authentic Mexican burrito place given that they have a LOT of vegan-friendly options, but I applaud them for doing this. I&#39;m no vegan, but their &#34;green rice&#34; (basmati rice made green from fresh cilantro and lime juice) was better than most rice that I&#39;ve had in a burrito. I love that they have various types of sauces (i.e. tomato salsa, smoky peanut salsa, chipotle mayo, etc) and meats (and not just 1 but 2 types of vegan soy meats!) for you to try with your burrito. I had an adobo beef burrito with the aforementioned green rice, black beans, cheese, and extra guacamole. It was a HUGE burrito that I could have split into 2 meals, and it only costed 7 EUR. And with a homemade ginger lemonade to go with my meals, I was one happy girl!<br><br>Those searching for an authentic burrito might be disappointed, but if you just want to get a burrito with interesting flavors, then Dolores won&#39;t disappoint.",

"reviewcomment":"My Oh My! Seeing Berlin from foot is one awesome thing but seeing the whole city from above is stunning! You not only get to see one portion of Berlin, but the whole 360! <br>I recommend coming during the afternoon, one reason being it is not too hot and you get awesome lighting and you get to see the sunset of course (depends on the time of year you are coming though)! When you buy your ticket you wait in a long line but it feels like it goes by fast because you are too busy looking at other tourists. Once you buy your ticket there is about a 2 hour wait to get to go to the top. If you want to eat inside the restaurant make you book your reservation head of time. Meanwhile you wait, there are couches and seat with tables to socialize or drink a cup of coffee. The you go up a crowded elevator ride to the very top. This part is exciting because your ears close up from the high elevation and speed. Once your up there, take your time and enjoy the view! you are not timed so you can pretty much stay up there as long as you like. <br>There is a bar with food service in the viewing section which I thought was good. The food was delicious and the bartender was friendly. I also recommend drinking a beer while you are up here, it&#39;s quite peaceful. :)",

As expected, it&#39;s well linked into the city&#39;s own transport network<br><br>The station itself has a futuristic feel, with a lot of metalwork and glass and an open structure, enabling you to see up and down through the various levels oft the station. With many floors, escalators and lifts, you&#39;ll probably have to make use otf the many diagrams scattered around the station to help you navigate your way around<br><br>The station proved a lifesaver on Easter Sunday as it was the only place with shops open, enabling me to pick up some supplies. There&#39;s everything from fast food to a supermarket to a pharmacy to be found here<br><br>I caught my train to Cologne from here. I was impressed that the e-ticket I printed out 3 weeks before my trip displayed the departure platform. What a great contrast to Brtiish trains stations or companies like New Jersey transit, who don&#39;t display a platform until 10 minutes before departure, causing a huge crush of humanity at the last minute<br><br>As expected, my train arrived exactly on time with announcements and signs in German and in English<br><br>Wunderbar, Hauptbahnhof!",

I knew it before I visited Berlin, having fallen in love with it on the side of a mountain near Neuschwanstein when I visited Bavaria and Munich a few years ago. But, coming back to Germany for the first time since, I needed more. Lots more! (For posterity, because even though I have an addiction and I&#39;m not ready to go into recovery, I&#39;d better be honest: I had six currywurst in three days in Berlin...!)<br><br>Konnopke Imbiss is listed on most sites, including Yelp, as a Must-Do if you&#39;re a currywurst person, even if your love isn&#39;t as big as mine. When I looked up how close they were to where I was staying, I was even more excited. I immediately walked down and proceeded to order zwei currywurst mit ein klein pommes (two currywurst with one small fries). The total, I remember, was €5.70, which was freakin&#39; amazing, because in London it would have been over £10, which is what, $15 in the US? I love you, Euro. I love you too, currywurst.<br><br>Very, very good, even at 11am on a Monday morning. Great homemade ketchup, crispy fries, and traditional currywurst sausage cooked just right. Served piping hot with wee spear-forks, and all take-away and at a great price.<br><br>Like everyone says, Must Do. (For me, Must Repeat.)",

I love it here!<br><br>Great food, great location, great staff, and great prices!<br><br>The place is quite large inside and always bustling.  For me it feels very Berlin with it&#39;s high ceiling and graffiti everywhere, and then you speak with one of the many staff and think &#34;wait! am I in Italy&#34;.  The strong accents and Italian responses are not to confuse you, but just a reminder that the pizza will be very good!!!  (The pastas are quite great as well!)<br><br>My favorite is between the Texana and the Piccantisimo.  I will continue to go here and to bring my friends here.  And now that the weather is great for sitting outdoors (which they have plenty of space), I plan on being there more often.",

The Reichstag building is so important historically that it is an essential thing to see when in Berlin and one of the things I was most looking forward to on my trip. Just to stand close to such a place was breathtaking - THIS is the building I had seen in so many books, pictures and documentaries. Such beautiful architecture.<br><br>People were having picnics in the surrounding areas at the time, which I thought added a nice atmosphere to it all.<br><br>Make sure to see it at both day AND night.<br><br>If you are going inside then make sure to reserve your place in advance.",

"reviewcomment":"Delicious, fast, and cheap!  Prices are around 3,50 for a sandwich or 5 for a plate.  <br>We got four plates for five people and quite enjoyed our dinner.  <br><br>Options: falafel, fried eggplant, halumi (fried goat cheese), lamb shawerma.  The falafel is incredible fluffy and tasty, with five to a plate, and all the plates come with a mildly spiced and very creamy hummus + salad with cucumbers, carrots, and honey mustard.  They were out of shawarma by the time we got there (about 8 p.m., the place was packed with locals with bike helmets perched on their tables), so we got the three other options and a couscous salad, which was also delicious and slightly spicy.<br><br>I&#39;m not a huge halumi fan but the others liked it, and I did enjoy the eggplant and couscous a lot.  We also loved that he took our order and then fried the falafel, halumi, and eggplant fresh for our takeout boxes.  Super cool little shop for a cheap eat in the middle of Mitte.<br><br>Someone said they avoid Oranienberger strasse, which we&#39;ve also been told, but this is on Linienstrasse.  Adored the food, and the atmosphere was also very chill with all the packed picnic tables outside.",

"reviewcomment":"This is one awesomely huge bookstore. <br><br>I have patronized this awesomely huge bookstore twice now, in the past month. And in both times, they delivered. My German perhaps isn&#39;t good enough to read a novel written in one, so I&#39;ll just review the parts that are relevant to me. <br><br>At the back, near the Sphinx, there is a two-storey room that is stacked only with English books. They have a wide variety of selections, and it seems that if you want something that isn&#39;t in stock, they can order it for you. Fiction is on the first floor, while the second floor has other goodies that can easily make you spend hours here browsing.<br><br>In the main section, at the third floor, are the travel guides. This is also one section that I can easily spend hours browsing. They have both English and German travel guides side by side, arranged in geographical order. When I had to buy a guidebook, they had one in stock that I purchased. They also have a huge map collection, and it seems that they stock things rather quickly, as the newest editions of Lonely Planet are already available for purchase.<br><br>One minor thing I didn&#39;t like is that they close on Sundays, but then I suppose that&#39;s the European way of things, and not a real problem. <br><br>If you&#39;re lucky, you might even come across the rather talented busker sitting at the front, with his electric piano, plonking away Beethoven, Bach, or Mozart.",

I know how it operates, I know the shortcuts, I know the time I&#39;ll need, I know what food they serve etc etc. It makes traveling so much easier than these massive airport where you need 2 hours and map, take trains between terminals and all other kinds of annoying bumps in the road from A to B. <br><br>I guess what I&#39;m trying to say is that Schonefeld make airtravel easy, although the trains to and from can be a little slow. But now I know their schedules too, and I&#39;ve stopped complaining. <br><br>And the icing on the cake: they have now started stocking the organic wines from Wittmann in their tax free shop.",

If I lived nearby, I would definitely be a regular!<br><br>Service was relaxed, friendly and wonderful. Every server we encountered in there was helpful. Even with our smattering of bad German they were obliging and never standoffish! The price is good too, for under 10 euro breakfast will set you up for the whole day.<br><br>If you need a reliable stop for good hearty food in a relaxing atmosphere (in the mornings anyway - as it&#39;s a 24/7 cafe I&#39;ve heard that it&#39;s a go to spot for late night nibbles) then it&#39;s a safe bet.

Everyone is respectful and just there to have a good time. How refreshing.<br><br>As for the inside. There was a lot going on. You feel the music in your bones quite literally. The bass is intense.

"reviewcomment":"My companion and I were out last night to attend a string quartet performance at the nearby concert hall, and as we were walking from the metro station to our destination, we walked past this establishment. My companion told me we should get chocolates, so I was pulled into this shop a few minutes before they were closing. I later realized that this is perhaps the best time to visit this place, when all the tourists have left and the place is almost empty. The influx of tourists in this shop is actually the thing that discourages me from venturing in in other times.<br><br>But now I realize why. It is a very swanky chocolate factory. You can see Berlin&#39;s landmarks made in chocolate. You can sit down and eat at a cafe upstairs. But for last night, all we wanted was a small bag of chocolates, so we made a small selection from the huge array of truffles and bonbons on display.<br><br>The shop looks very expensive from the outside, and their goods are very exquisite. Every bite was definitely worth it. And from what I can tell, the prices were rather reasonable as well. I&#39;ll definitely be back.",

"reviewcomment":"My main historical interest is in ancient Egypt, which I got my fill of over at the New Museum (Neues Museum). But I also wanted to see the famous Ishtar Gate at the Pergamon Museum (Pergamonmuseum). I was really surprised to see that there&#39;s more than just the Ishtar Gate, but long portions of the adjoining Processional Way as well. It&#39;s amazing that the colors are so well preserved. Even more surprising is that this gate is actually the smaller, frontal part. The larger, back part is too big to display and is in storage!<br><br>I was equally surprised at the huge reconstructions of other building and rooms such as the Pergamon Altar, the Market Gate of Miletus, the Mshratta Façade, and the Aleppo Room. The smaller items, including some fine jewelry, were nice to see, but the huge reconstructions were amazing.<br><br>Upstairs there&#39;s a very nice collection of Islamic art, including the already-mentioned Mshratta Façade. There are many large, intricate carpets, and beautiful, hand-written and decorated copies of the Qur&#39;an.<br><br>My girlfriend and I visited the museum in the middle of February, so we didn&#39;t find it hot or humid as other reviewers have mentioned.<br><br>I realize that some of these items may, by our standards, be considered to have been &#34;stolen&#34; from where they came, but my understanding is that many were gifts to Germany or were brought to Germany with the full knowledge of the local governments.<br><br>I honestly believe that, as is the case with the Egyptian collection over in the New Museum, many of these historic buildings and artifacts wouldn&#39;t exist today unless they had been brought to Germany or other Western countries. At best they would have fallen apart due to neglect, and at worst been intentionally destroyed for being &#34;un-Islamic.&#34; Thank goodness they are safe in museums in Europe and America.<br><br>If you&#39;re staying in Berlin for several days and plan on visiting this and other museums on Museum Island, I highly recommend purchasing a Berlin WelcomeCard with Museum Island. This card lets you ride the cities ample public transportation (buses, street cars, and the metro), gives you 25% to 50% discounts at various places, and lets you into the museums on Museum Island. The three-day card costs €38.50.",

All cakes and treats are vegetarian friendly, without any animal fats or gelatin. (If you&#39;re lactose intolerant, gluten intolerant or vegan just ask, they are very on the up and up about that stuff).<br><br>It was a little on the pricey side, but considering their quality of ingredients and in-house policy on making just about everything, I think it&#39;s worth it.

It&#39;s a small joint, so taking it to-go is okay too. I ordered the MarienBurger (partially b/c I can&#39;t read German, so picking this burger that has the same name as the place seemed like a good idea). I had to pick my jaw up when I saw how big it was (which was pointless, since I had to stretch my mouth back open to eat this juicy beast). It has 2 HEARTY patties and your regular fixings on a burger, plus bacon. The burger itself was probably  at least 3.5 inches tall - I don&#39;t understand how people can eat this with a side of fries...

"reviewcomment":"This place was recommended by the place we&#39;re staying and it was an excellent recommendation.  It is more of a fusion place than a traditional Asian resturant.  So while in yelp it is called &#34;Chinese&#34; you won&#39;t be finding mapo tofu or other traditional things or even bad western-fied things.<br><br>The dishes all have creative names and interesting references.  They should have a contest about them!  There are yummy starters like the pumpkin soup with shrimp (The shrimp are amazing by the way). Or fried dumplings (they call them dim sum, but don&#39;t expect and carts here,) on what appears to be either melted ice cream or yogurt.  Something bizarre that shouldn&#39;t be good but is!  I also tried the seven minutes of pleasure, which is almost large enough for a main, that evokes memories pleasant memories and good taste sensations.<br><br>The mains are also just as creative and interesting.  Like spicy chicken with Szechuan pepper.  While it doesn&#39;t have a lot of that lovely/deadly/numbing ingredient it is there, so points for them.  The beef with sweet potato is amazing as well as the shrimp dish whose name I can&#39;t remember.  but it is served with a mango and tomato side that is very well done.  All the mains we&#39;ve tried are creative and cooked perfectly with good skill.  <br><br>A tip, get the &#34;best&#34; house wine, it is a very nice tempranillo and priced nicely.  the service is attentive and friendly.  Small, so get there early.  <br><br>Really, I feel this place is four and  half stars, but the disco bathroom buts it over the top!!!",

"reviewcomment":"Most Thai restaurants are with the mom-and-pop variety: it isn&#39;t swanky, and there are plenty of Thai royalty decor adorning the walls. This one is more Thai-inspired Asian fusion. If you were looking for the authentic Thai-restaurant-where-Thai-people-go experience, then this isn&#39;t the place to go. Go to DAO Restaurant near Savignyplatz instead (<a href='http://www.yelp.com/biz/dao-restaurant-berlin'>yelp.com/biz/dao-restaur…</a>). <br><br>That being said, I think one can still enjoy this place given the right mindset. This is one of the more swanky bring-a-date sort of place, though the interior can be a little loud.<br><br>I ordered a pad kee mao (No. 29), and what came out was something totally different from the pad kee mao I was expecting. I was expecting a noodle dish that is very spicy, complete with Thai herbs and peppers, but what came out was a duck dish with the same spices, but the noodles were relegated down to being a side ingredient, not a main ingredient. And it now comes with rice. So, instead of a pad kee mao, I got a &#34;pad kee mao&#34;. <br><br>I originally thought I&#39;d give it 3 stars. But once I fixed my mindset, I upped it to 4. After all, there&#39;s nothing bad in going to a Thai-inspired fusion restaurant. Besides, it&#39;s not like they&#39;re claiming to be authentic. Bottomline, if you want to go to a restaurant where Thai people go, don&#39;t go here. But if you want to feel a little swanky while eating Thai-inspired cuisine, then by all means go here.",

Everything is simple.<br><br>You can watch the whole process of your ramen being prepared! Even the authentic preparation of noodles. And they will slice the egg with the string. <br><br>I allways ordered  Tonkotsu ramen because of the heavenly meat in it. The pork belly is divine! The broth is very oily but in combination with other ingredients and noodles it has so many flavors. <br><br>I have also tasted Miso Ramen but in my opinion it is not as good at Tonkotsu Ramen (also it has none of this epic meat in it;) <br><br>Will come back here many times in the future. And perhaps I will see you in the line waiting for your ramen;)",

"reviewcomment":"My boyfriend is Jewish, so this museum was a must-see on our trip to Berlin. Expecting a hard-to-handle, depressing account of Jewish suffering in Germany, I was pleased to see the optimism purported throughout the exhibitions despite the dark nature of Germany&#39;s history. The museum features aspects of Jewish history outside of the holocaust, which helped me to better understand the cultural identity of the Jewish tradition. I loved this museum, but even more so, I loved seeing my boyfriend find such a high reverence towards Germany for having it built. This museum is sobering, yet encourage. Very tasteful, yet haunting.",

"reviewcomment":"Stopped by for a lunch while shopping nearby. The restaurant is set back from the road a bit, and as you approach the front door you can feel the hustle and bustle of the main street disappear into the serenity of the restaurant&#39;s courtyard.<br><br>We sat inside on couches in the main dining area, which was large and airy with a peaceful atmosphere. Long, communal tables in the center of the room suggest that this is an Asian experience tailored to German taste and convention. The food bore that impression out, to a certain degree, but not in a bad way. <br><br>[Rant Alert]<br><br>You see, if we want an authentic, say, Vietnamese dining experience, then Vietnam is a mere 13-hour plane ride away. We chose, however, to travel to Germany, where we want to have German experiences. So, if someone wants to Germanize a selection of dishes that is already by design a fusion of the vast array of Asian cooking, then all they have to do to get our vote is to make the food taste good.<br><br>[End of Rant]<br><br>We ordered miso soup, kimchee, a sushi selection and Thai noodle soup. All beautifully not-exactly-authentic. For a change, we weren&#39;t boozing it up and ordered 2 iced ginger green teas. Our friendly waitress (par for the course in Berlin) came by with 1 tea, and informed us that they&#39;d run out, but she could make us a hot version. Go on, then. The iced version was delicious, with a generous slice of pickled ginger and lime wedge bringing up various flavors and scents. But the hot version -- Yabba Dabba Doo! This stuff could cure anything from a stuffed-up nose to PMS. Fantastic.<br><br>BONUS: If you&#39;re in need of a little entertainment, hang around the bathroom area downstairs (not for too long, though) and watch people try to figure out what to do what they need to do. <br><br>All in all, a relaxing and flavorful experience that promised to be even better at dinnertime.",

It is somewhat interactive as well, as people (me included) love posing for photos with their favourite pieces.<br><br>My only complaint is that it would be nice to have a little more room, as there is a busy road right next to the path you walk along.

"reviewcomment":"I just spent one of the most enjoyable days I&#39;ve had in the six months I&#39;ve lived in Berlin. The Erholungspark in Marzahn (Gärten der Welt) costs just 3 Euros and took me a little over an hour to reach by bike from Prenzlauer Berg. Coincidentally, I had just seen an excellent, moving documentary on <a href='/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Farte.tv&amp;s=ec82febf11f00fa6016fb017cdefb7a7748637005e55f809a12661ec40c5a17a' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>arte.tv</a> yesterday about the challenges young people face today growing up in Marzahn-Hellersdorf, the economically depressed area which surrounds the gardens. Riding through the real East Berlin depicted in this film was an experience. I was happy to see that the residents have access to this lovely park.<br><br> I enjoyed all the different gardens - especially the Korean and Japanese ones. The English labyrinth was great, too. It was a special treat to witness the happy participants of a wedding party and reception taking place in the Chinese Garden. The entire setting was very peaceful and I really liked that there were so many benches and chairs set up to take advantage of the sun, the quiet, and the ambiance. Highly recommended!",

Or buy pre-packaged ones to bring home for friends/family. You can create your own chocolate masterpiece. Pay for however many bars you want to create. Choose from white, milk or dark chocolate. Select 3 ingredients to put on your chocolate bar: nuts, cereals, fruits, etc. Allow 45 minutes for the product to be finished - I&#39;ve already watched the process of chocolate making from people in front of me so, I went to the museum and store part. The museum will tell you that white chocolate isn&#39;t really chocolate!<br><br>The cafe serves drinks and desserts. They have a chocolate mousse cake that looked soooo good.

The museum is very interesting, especially if you know something about the DDR (GDR in English) and would like to know more. The entrance fee is not expensive for the quality and amount of things you will be able to look, get to know, read and touch... The museum is totally interactive, fun for kids, and explains in detail through photos, original footages, clothes, and obviously informative leaflets, everything that chacracterized life in the GDR, from rules and means of transport.",

"reviewcomment":"My girlfriend and I were in search of a premiere German restaurant where we could enjoy some authentic food with the locals. <br><br>We found exactly what we were looking for at Schneeweiss. Cozy atmosphere with some MGMT and Donnie Darko tracks playing in the background but at just the right volume so that you can still hold a conversation. <br><br>We started off with the scallops and pork belly. I&#39;ve had better pork belly but I&#39;m also Cuban so that&#39;s not a fair assessment. However, I will say that the scallops were fresh and delicious and that alone is worth the price of admission. My girlfriend had the steak filet for her entree and I ordered the duck breast with goose confit and a quince-apple chutney sauce. The steak filet was cooked to absolute perfection. I would say that this was my first choice but my GF and I refuse to order the same thing. I tried her steak and immediately gave her that wide-eyed &#34;OMG this is the best steak I&#39;ve ever had look.&#34; I suffer from extreme short term memory while enjoying good good so the most recent plate is always the best ever. But what made this dish special was the braised fig sauce that accompanied it&#39;s meaty surroundings. The potato dumplings with steak and the sauce were an absolutely explosive combination of flavors. <br><br>As for the duck, I&#39;m still trying to figure out why there was a knife still at my table taking up space when one clearly did not need one to break the duck apart. The duck was soft and tender, falling off the bone with the touch of a silver fork. The sauce was epic, the waiter asked if I wanted more and now my biggest regret in life is saying no in the spur of the moment. But I can&#39;t be blamed because the taste put me in a state of shock making it difficult to understand my immediate surroundings. The goose was also very good but to be honest licking the duck bone is perhaps more entertaining. <br><br>Go with either dish and you won&#39;t be disappointed. The meal with bottle ice water was about 69 euros. It&#39;s a hefty price for the slow service we received in return but the food was worth every coin. <br><br>Overall, I give this place 4 stars because the service was a slow. The food took a while to get to the table and the waiter wasn&#39;t very attentive or special. Nonetheless, I definitely plan on returning upon a future visit to Berlin.",

And the view is impressive with the new additions around.<br>There is an entrance fee: 5 euros.Then you can enjoy the place, stay on the sand or on the roof, it is alright you can relax and get tan. <br>If you are thirsty, no problem, you can order at the bar.<br><br>The swimming pool is a little bit far form everything, but it definitely worth the trip!",

"reviewcomment":"The palace is amazing, maybe because it&#39;s the first real palace I&#39;ve been to. Most of the palace has survived WWII, and there are so many examples of artwork from different parts of the world collected in one huge building. Some of the rooms have every inch covered in artwork, so even the walls have lace on them.<br><br>But just as amazing (for myself as a runner) is the garden in the back. There&#39;s a nice trail that I run on which is about 1.5 miles around (depending on which route you take) which goes by a river, is generally pretty flat and easy to run on with dirt trails. It makes for a nice morning or evening walk in the summer as well.",

The variety is quite amazing.<br>Two things - get ready to pay, quite a lot above the usual normal prices (9 euros and up for a cocktail) <br>Dress fancier - this place is not for the casuals - I felt really uncomfortable, next time :)",

"reviewcomment":"I used to live in Seoul, so my expectations for Korean food are higher than the average bear.<br><br>Yam Yam gets a picnic basket. <br><br>We didn&#39;t have a reservation at this cafeteria-style eatery, and it was heaving around 8pm on a Saturday. We patiently waited (for about 15 minutes) and the house gave us some free tea for our wait. The hostess said she could accomodate us for literally 30 minutes, as the next free table was reserved at 9. We ordered while we waited, and eventually the same hostess said if we moved tables just ones seat over, we could stay longer. At that point we had already finished so it was fine. <br><br>This restaurant needs a bigger space! They were turning people away left and right. But what it lacks in tables and decor, it makes up for in speedy service, oh yea, and awesome food. <br><br>I mistakenly over-ordered, with a bibimbap, jiggae, mondu and a bulgogi dish for 2 hungry people. We scarfed our food because of the time restraint on our table, but the portions are HUGE and we could have dealt with just 1 side and 1 main course combined. <br><br>Definitely not a typical Korean BBQ place, or restaurant, but a fun German, cafeteria style take on Korean comfort foods. While I was there, I really wanted a Cass, but their beverage options were pretty limited. Would go again, with a reservation!",

"reviewcomment":"I, like fellow reviewer Jessie M., am surprised to read negative reviews for Il Casolare. <br><br>First of all, it is crowded for a reason; at the heart of Kreuzberg, if you have great pizza and low prices, then you are destined to be a sensation. Second, they have a great outdoor patio on a quieter street. Need I say more?<br><br>I went here with two guy friends to satisfy undying pizza cravings. Little did we know that we probably should have made a reservation, but luckily a table opened up a few seconds after we arrived.<br><br>I ordered the margherita pizza and sprinkled it with chili oil - beware it is SPIII-CYY. We were all thoroughly pleased with our meals and our waiter was friendly despite being swamped with customers. And for just 7 Euro? Shooot I will eat there any day.<br><br>Bottom line - there is a reason this place is always bustling.<br><br>**TIP: get Eis from the shop across the street.

"reviewcomment":"Clärchens Ballhaus is one of the oldest establishments in Berlin, having just celebrated it&#39;s 100-year anniversary in 2013. Dining and drinking here has become a given every time I visit my siblings in the capital of Germany. <br><br>Clärchens is a mix between a restaurant, beer garden, and dance hall (with daily lessons given in many traditional dance styles such as Waltz, Tango, Fox, Rumba). They are famous for their Spiegelsaal (&#34;mirror room&#34;), which is an upstairs private room where you can dine in a more peaceful setting than the main hall where dancing &amp; music is going on adjacent to the dining tables. The Spiegelsaal is frequently rented out for wedding receptions, corporate parties, and other festive occasions. It is dimly lit by candles and the upper parts of the walls reaching up to the high ceilings are covered in large mirrors, most of them cracked and worn by age, creating a charming and romantic environment. <br><br>The food is classic German and Italian with a few twists here and there. I am a big fan of their daily soup selections, the pizzas, and of course the gigantic Wiener Schnitzel that lays across warm potato salad and is served with a side of cucumber salad. If you&#39;re hung over or just have a really big appetite, this bad boy is for you: <a href='http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cl%C3%A4rchens-ballhaus-berlin?select=YA66OHcSqCQM5McjtKayPA#YA66OHcSqCQM5McjtKayPA'>yelp.com/biz_photos/clär…</a><br><br>There&#39;s a plethora of beer, wine, and mixed drinks, guaranteeing you&#39;ll leave Clärchens Ballhaus happy and satiated. Lot&#39;s of entertainment here and a great way to meet people from all around the world!",

In addition to the food, there is a concise but good drinks list.<br><br> Great for dining with friends, family or on your own.<br><br> Also worth noting is that there is a &#39;Next to Kuchi&#39; which offers their full menu to take away (Salads, Soups, Sushi etc.)<br><br> Miso soup with Vegetarian Sushi mix comes to 12EUR - a little bit more compared to surrounding places but Kuchi is has a better atmosphere, decor and most importantly, food.",

"reviewcomment":"The restaurant Ständige Vertretung (Permanent representation) owes its name to the time when Germany was divided in two, when West Berlin was formally no part of the territory of the Federal Republic of Germany (although its citizens were indeed west germans).<br><br> This explains why its walls are full of decorations of the time: old signals of the train station of Bonn (former capital, located in Rhineland-Westfalia), pictures of politicians of the time of the wirschaftswunder (economic miracle). The Permanent Representation was also the name of the representation office of the Federal Republic of Germany in Berlin; the russians (co-administrators of the city with the other allies) never allowed West Germany to have a higher-ranking representation.<br><br> And Permanent Representation also means: the restaurant presents itself as a representation of the Rhineland gastronomy and they do mean to stay here, which they do deserve. The Ständige Vertretung is probably where you can get the best pork knuckle (eisbein!) with choucroute in town; and if you are a resolute eater, don&#39;t think it twice and order a blood sausage (blutwurst). They are great.<br><br> In spite of their location, next to the Friedrichstrasse train station, and the large amount of tourists (the place is as central as it can be), this is not at all a tourist trap but a restaurant of german (rhineland) cuisine also patronized by so many germans. Most of them berliners.<br><br> Do not miss the real Cologne beer (Kölsch type, here sold under the mark Gaffels), which is hard to find elsewhere in Berlin.<br><br> The flammkuchen (something in between a crêpe and a pizza) are also great.<br><br> Prices are reasonable and the service, although the restaurant is always full, is quite good. The waiters and waitresses do earn their tip.",

Stick to the food plan.&#34; <br><br>Then I decided &#39;NO, I will not be an adult or drink a coffee or stick to the food plan, I will eat this rice pudding and I will love it.&#34; <br><br>And, I did. It was heaven. I also enjoyed a little bit of the citrus/quinoa/broccoli dish (saved the rest for a salad at home) and a berry smoothie. The smoothie was a bit runny for me (but then again, I will not allow bananas in my smoothies) and lukewarm...but, it is what it is. We snagged a nice spot to sit outside in the sun. On a Sunday! <br><br>The treats are fantastic, they have a nice cooler of pre-made items that are delicious, and will make fresh stuff in their little kitchen, too. They have a full range of coffee, juices, teas, etc. The staff is really friendly, they have free wifi, comfortable seating and an overall nice vibe. <br><br>A great spot, right off the M10 tram, and very close to the U1 stop at Warschauer Str. <br><br>Get the rice pudding.

It also meant we were able to enjoy their happy hour from 6-8pm. The drink menu is extensive and I went with a classic, the Mai Tai. All  I have to say was that it was very very strong. <br><br>The decor of this bar will catch your eye right away. It&#39;s kitschy with gingham wall paper and a bit of a 70&#39;s vibe.

"reviewcomment":"This place is just awesome. I came across it by complete chance while I was actually searching for another place to eat that I found off of Yelp when I saw this small stand-like place with visuals of CHICKEN - very eye-catching. There was a line forming so it definitely looked like it was worth investigating. <br><br>Turns out that less than 5 euros get you a combo meal with a HALF chicken - a WHOLE HALF of a chicken and it&#39;s all yours!!! The combo includes a side of fries or salad (or if you&#39;re REALLY hungry, a slightly pricier combo gives you both). <br><br>Just seeing other people eat their meals here made me brave the line and quickly Google the correct way to say, &#34;halbe Hähnchen mit Coca-Cola,&#34; which was completely unnecessary since they understand English just fine if you&#39;re ordering... You order, pay, and they give you your meal asap before you leave the line - I was so excited to eat it that I broke a tip of my plastic fork when I stabbed the beast of a meat that was the freshly-cooked chicken. Very certain that I will be here once or twice more before I leave Berlin!",

It&#39;s pretty big and the copper dome signifies how important it is.  This is a Protestant church. Look at the details on the statues.<br><br>The inside is beautiful too. Look up at the ceiling. This is called the Berliner Dom after all. There&#39;s a large Sauer organ and you can purchase a CD if you like the sound from an organ.<br><br>There are different parts to this place. The church, the dome walkway, the crypt and the museum. It&#39;s about 7euros if you want to see all that.",

There are a couple places that are great for sushi, but finding one that serves other great dishes is a challenge. <br><br>Sasaya serves all sorts of Japanese dishes and is run by Japanese. They have fantastic daily lunch options that are pretty darn cheap (you can get an entire fish for €9) and delicious. The service is quick and friendly, the food yummy, and the prices great. With this combo, Sasaya has become one of my favorite restaurants in Berlin.<br><br>If you like Japanese food, give Sasaya a try! You need to reserve beforehand though!",

The star attraction was the tallest ice slide in the city where they had built a tobaggon ramp and you could pay to zoom down on tyres. It looked fun but the queue was a little daunting<br><br>The rest of the market had mainly food and beer stalls.

"reviewcomment":"I am starting to like this idea of having a slow brunch on the weekend. So for today, I grabbed my book, went out of the house hungry, and went out to find food. I somehow stumbled across this cafe, Gorki Park, near my usual hangout neighborhood. <br><br>I got in around a little after 10 AM, and there was no other diners yet. I sat at a table in the inner room, and ordered the Schwarzes Meer Frühstück, as well as a hot chocolate. <br><br>It arrived in a few minutes, after a short wait, which allowed me to read my book and enjoy the slow movement of time on a Saturday. When the plate arrived, I was amazed at what it contained. <br><br>All the things are fish-related, after all, this is the Black Sea Breakfast, right? There were smoked salmon neatly placed on top of potato pancakes; there was a Russian crepe filled with cream cheese and topped with salmon caviar; there was a crostini with tuna on it; and there was also a herring tartar. The only non-fish item was the scrambled egg. This whole thing is accompanied by bread, of course, as well as butter.<br><br>I was overall impressed by the breakfast, and so I ate slowly, while reading my book. I would definitely recommend this place to others. The only thing preventing me from giving them a full 5 stars is the bread. It would have been nice if the bread came out warm. That would have added a better personal touch, and would have made the breakfast impeccable.",

"reviewcomment":"The wife and I were in Europe for our honeymoon in November 2013, and did some country hopping.  Our primary destinations were France &amp; Italy, but we stayed in Germany a few days because we chose to fly Air Berlin from ORY-TXL and TXL-FCO based on price and membership in Oneworld.  Ironically we liked Germany better than Italy or France, but that&#39;s another story.  <br><br>Air Berlin is an LCC, so you get no frills.  No first class, no IFE, etc.  However, you do get your first check bag free (2nd check bag for nominal fee if purchased online), free soft drinks, free light snack, and options to buy hot meals and alcohol.  <br><br>Our flight from ORY-TXL was aboard one of the airline&#39;s new Boeing 737-800&#39;s with the Boeing Sky Interior.  The flight wasn&#39;t too full, and the young flight crew were very friendly and professional.  <br><br>Our flight from TXL-FCO, on the other hand was aboard an older, worn A320 and was PACKED.  It also had a more senior flight crew was quite unfriendly and rough... But that still didn&#39;t diminish the value of the flight and I would choose to fly with them again in a heartbeat.  <br><br>The one thing I&#39;m not looking forward to is the closure of TXL and transfer of flights to BER.  TXL is REALLY close to downtown Berlin, and while it&#39;s an awful airport, the convenience more than makes up for this.",

Very interesting menu which has much different choices from the norm.<br>I had the most lovely cold starter which is sliced pork with a multitude of dressing and flavours- nice. The main course of prawns was also excellent and very well presented.<br>The service was also very attentive and friendly. Hmm nice Berliner Pilsner also served here too.<br>Overall, i really enjoyed the meal, and much thanks to the owners who gave me directions through QYPE",

"reviewcomment":"Giant burgers for a decent price.<br>My husband and I came here a few weeks ago on a weekend night and it was packed!  We ended up sitting outside despite the cold (I&#39;m pretty sure the staff thought we were crazy) because they had nice outdoor seating and it was quieter.  I didn&#39;t get a good look or feel for the interior atmosphere but it is definitely a popular spot and it seemed like there were big groups of friends hanging out, which is cool.<br><br>They have a lot of burger options.  It took me forever to decide but I ended up going with the peanut butter burger and my husband got one of the spicy burgers (I can&#39;t remember what it was called).  The bartender/server guy was nice enough, not rude but clearly not trying to charm you.<br><br>The burgers are very wide and on the thinner side, which is how I like mine, and loaded with toppings.  And then there are the potatoes wedges!  They were soooo good and the homemade onion dip was to die for.  Aside from the tasty burgers, the potatoes and dip would definitely bring me back in.<br><br>The burgers are around 10 euro each which seems to be about average for the &#34;nicer&#34; burger joints in Berlin (i.e. White Trash, The Bird, etc).  We couldn&#39;t even finish our whole burgers so I think we got our moneys worth.<br>People on Yelp seem to be complaining mostly about the non-burger food and the service.  I don&#39;t know why you would expect good nachos in Germany at a non-Mexican/Tex-Max restaurant...  If you want a big tasty burger and you are fine with servers with an edge, Room 77 is a good option for you.",

"reviewcomment":"&#39;which market have you visited?&#39; was the question asked most about Berlin. <br>&#39;the one between two churches&#39; we said excitedly, not wanting to butcher the german pronounciation of gendarmenmarkt. <br><br>This market was great, sure a euro to get in, but all in all, it was the one that I went to visit twice because I loved the atmosphere so much, it was like a really nice mix of locals and british tourists, and OMG I LOVED THE CHRISTMAS BAUBLE STORE. I never knew you could have a whole shop dedicated to christmas decorations and ornaments. it was PURE kitsch. <br><br>Do you know what else I loved- the drinks that came with a souvenir mug/glass. They were too adorable. and the hot apple drink was lovely! Talking about drinks, trying to order a half pint in berlin here is hard. They gave me a pint instead. not that i should complain because I ordered a really yummy beer. But it was bigger than the size of my face. and half the size of my body. (TOILETS PLEASE- which is 30 cents....but when you gotta go, you gotta go)<br><br>They also have a stage dedicated to live music- and there was an acapella german man band who did a backstreet boys tribute song, with boyband dance moves. I loved it, it was amazing! (also, it&#39;s really the skinny small guy in the group that has the deepest singing voice- i mean, at least you know there&#39;s a god...)<br><br>This market is also laden with sit down restaurant type booths- and it&#39;s got panes of plastic window to keep the heat in whilst you eat. Definitely recommend the Gendarmenmarkt if you go berlin around Christmas time!",

The prices are exaggerated, nevertheless, getting a 1 year ticket for 7 locations, is very reasonable (around 80 EUROS). You can visit other locations with it, like Madame Tousaut ( Do not laugh, if i have spelt this wrong ;) ), Lego Discovery center and other bigger amusement parcs in west germany.<br><br>The variation of the fish species is way less than in the Aquarium at the Bahnhof Zoo area, but the decoration is nicer in many cases. You can walk through tunnels, where fish is swimming over your head.....not bad.",

"reviewcomment":"My girlfriend and I recently spent four nights at this hotel and enjoyed it very much. We upgraded to a business-class room on the fourth floor, which included a balcony facing Berlin Cathedral and the breakfast buffet.<br><br>The room itself was clean and comfortable, with modern décor. A bottle of sparkling water was provided on the first day, and the room had a Nespresso coffee machine with coffee pods and tea bags replenished every day. My only real complaints are that there wasn&#39;t that much storage space for our clothes, and the free Wi-Fi could have been better.<br><br>The view from the balcony was nice, although it was too cold in early February to sit on the balcony and enjoy that view. It will be even nicer when the building boom in Berlin is over. Right now the skyline is dominated by construction cranes, but that&#39;s the case pretty much everywhere we went in Germany.<br><br>Breakfast was a highlight for me every day thanks to the wonderful buffet in the Restaurant HEat off the lobby. There&#39;s the usual breads, rolls, and pastries, meatballs, hot sausages, grilled tomatoes, assorted cold cuts and sliced cheeses, eggs, waffles, yogurt, a variety of cereal, fresh fruit, etc. In addition to the usual sliced cheeses, there&#39;s a cutting board with an assortment of artisanal cheeses, and I was very happy to find a bowl of quark with herbs mixed in, something I used to enjoy as a kid and which we don&#39;t see in the US. To drink, there&#39;s coffee, cappuccino, tea, mango lassi and other smoothies, and both still and sparking water. If you&#39;re lactose-intolerant, note that there&#39;s a whole section of foods just for you along the wall behind the eggs and sausages.<br><br>The location of the Radisson Blu is also excellent. There are many restaurants and shops within easy walking distance. If you&#39;re here for the amazing museums, they are right across the bridge on Museum Island. You can continue in that direction all the way to the Brandenburg Gate and the Reichstag if you don&#39;t mind walking half an hour. In the other direction, the Berlin TV Tower, many more shops, and the Galeria Kaufhof department store is just three or four blocks away.<br><br>If you don&#39;t want to walk, there&#39;s a bus stop a block way. If you&#39;re staying for a few days, buy a Berlin WelcomeCard, which lets you ride the city&#39;s buses, street cars, and metro trains and gives you bunches of discounts throughout the city. We got plenty of use out of ours during our stay. Buy the WelcomeCard with the Museum Island add-on and you get access to all the museums as well for one low price!<br><br>In short, I thought this was an excellent hotel with almost nothing to complain about and a wonderful location at the heart of Berlin.",

"reviewcomment":"A real treat. Borchardt is a VIP dining experience. Established in 1853 Barack Obama, Mick Jagger and Karl Lagerfield have all dined here.<br><br>The wiener schnitzel in particular is elevated to new standards: it&#39;s ultra thin and has the lightest and crispiest coating imaginable. Yes, there is also an elevated price too but my friend put it best &#34;You can&#39;t put a price on good schnitzel!&#34;.<br><br>The goose dinner I had was also exceptional. I&#39;m not sure if this is part of the regular menu, but I highly recommend it if it&#39;s available. <br><br>Not sure why the other reviewers had bad service experiences. I went on a Friday evening. The restaurant was packed and we were warmly welcomed, checked our coats, were promptly seated (we had a booking) and our server was attentive and friendly.

Their lemon sorbet is bright, fresh and tastes like lemons, not artificial flavouring. They also give you a freshly baked butter waffle cone if you get three scoops or more.<br><br> 2.

And it wasn&#39;t just that the meat was different, they varied when it came to ingredients, in ex. the chicken one had fries inside. They were very tasty!<br><br>But actually the menu isn&#39;t just shoarmas. It&#39;s very rich and written out in both german and arabic, if that helps!

I&#39;ve heard only good things about this place, and sure enough, this place delivered.<br><br>As this was a Vietnamese place, I couldn&#39;t pass the opportunity to test them by ordering a bowl of pho ga, and I paired it with real authentic Vietnamese coffee. My companion on the other hand ordered a rice bowl mixed with water spinach, and she also ordered a lemongrass tea. <br><br>The place was still not busy, although we already saw several tables that were reserved for the night. Our food came out quickly, and we were amazed at the pretty presentation. It looked tasty, and sure enough, it tasted good as well. <br><br>The place is a little expensive; my small Vietnamese coffee was 3,40 EUR, but it was so worth it. I loved that little cup of sweet goodness, I was almost tempted to order another one, but I feared I wouldn&#39;t be able to sleep later.<br><br>Overall, we paid 24,80 EUR plus tip. A little pricey for Berlin, and a little pricey for the quantity, but this place is more quality than quantity. I&#39;ll be back here again. I suggest asking for a place in the terrace when the weather is good. There are plenty of good nooks and crannies to bring a date and be intimate during a meal.",

Here you&#39;ll find origami birds hanging from the walls, paper lanterns, and an incense scent that&#39;s actually bearable.<br><br>I absolutely love the vegetarian dumpling soup, while the original pho is superior as well.

Here are the things I like:<br><br>*While waiting for the elevator, the Muzak played a remix of Opus III/Kirsty Hawkshaw&#39;s &#34;It&#39;s a Fine Day.&#34; In 2013. I let eight elevators go by so I could hear the whole thing.<br>*Six days a week from 6-10:30 a.m., show your room key at Humboldt&#39;s and get into the buffet breakfast for free.<br>*Like a lot of places in Germany, the windows inexplicably open. Having a hotel room with openable windows is a treat.<br>*All the workers speak fluent English and don&#39;t get mad at me for only speaking Spanish and English. <br><br>There is no cell reception in a lot of places, but apparently that&#39;s normal here.<br><br>All for 100 euros (yes plural of euro is euros--it&#39;s in the EU style guide) a night midweek?

"reviewcomment":"As someone who adores animals I generally have a love/hate relationship with zoos. I love seeing wild animals close up but feel a sense of inner turmoil that they are cooped up in cages. Having said that, I have visited a quite frankly bizarre number of zoos all over the world. <br><br>Here&#39;s a short summary of the high/lowlights; Edinburgh Zoo is my &#34;local&#34; and is very good, Portugal Zoo is horrendous and depressing and Berlin Zoo is the best zoo I have ever visited in the whole wide world (so far)!<br><br>The queue outside this zoo was huuuuuuge but it was well worth the hour long wait to get in. There was a man selling huge, fresh, warm pretzels to the gathered masses and another entertaining impatient children with a bubble blowing machine.<br><br>Once you enter the zoo it gets straight into the good stuff. There&#39;s none of this faffing about with flamingos and such. The first animals I saw were hippos and elephants, awesome!! The enclosures are big and open which is reassuring. Generally there were just low electric fences separating you from the animals. <br><br>I saw loads of animals I had never seen or even heard of before. There were also so many baby animals too which everyone loves to see. Luckily I was by the big cats enclosure at feeding time and saw the baby lions, tigers and cheetahs getting stuck into juicy steaks! A truly magical moment!  <br><br>The petting zoo is fun and the attached Aquarium is a tourist site in it&#39;s own right. It&#39;s huge and not only has sea life but also a ridiculous amount of reptiles, amphibians and creepy crawlies!<br><br>The zoo restaurants are pretty good as far as these things go and there&#39;s plenty of little stall selling ice-creams and drinks dotted around the place. It was raining and crazy busy on the day we went but that didn&#39;t stop us having a great time.<br><br> If you get fed up of all the historical sites in Berlin and fancy a bit of light relief then definitely consider giving this zoo a visit. Just stick on a pac-a-mac if it looks like there will be rain!",

"reviewcomment":"I have recently fallen in love with Indian food and part of it is thanks to Amrit. I saw this restaurant when I first arrived in Berlin and was immediately intrigued by the vibrant umbrellas and decor outside of the building (I&#39;m a sucker for presentation).<br><br>At long last, I finally decided to head up to Oranienburger Straße (although there are numerous other locations in Berlin) for lunch at Amrit and was far from disappointed. It was gorgeous out so I sat outside underneath one of their Indian-inspired umbrellas and ordered, challenging myself with a German menu. Clearly my German isn&#39;t perfect so I wasn&#39;t fully certain what I was going to get but my word was it tasty - plenty of spices like good Indian food has.<br><br>One of my biggest complaints about the restaurant is the waiters who stand outside and practically beg you to come eat there. Amrit, you have good food - why not let it speak for itself instead of looking so desperate.",

First of all, go with the intention of spending the whole day and then going again to finish what you were not able to finish in the first place. It&#39;s humongous! I couldn&#39;t believe how big and varied this garden is.<br><br>It&#39;s in a beautiful part of Berlin as well.<br><br>I really cannot wait to go back again. (another note added after my original comments) I would definitely check if the main glasshouse is open before returning as that&#39;s where the giant water lilies are kept... I really wanted to see them but alas no... This review was written in 2008.<br><br>I had a yearly pass last year that people with a Berlin Pass can buy for 20€, it&#39;s so definitely worth it :)",

"reviewcomment":"It was a second to last day in Berlin and being in a trendy part of the city with lots of bars, we were looking for a place to eat. Having gotten lost, we found ourselves in a dark location where the only light was from this restaurant. It looked quiet but the decor was pretty inviting, as was our hunger which we sought to satiate. Wanting to eat somewhere nice on our last day, we couldn&#39;t have been happier here.<br><br>Our waiter was extremely, kind, personable and friendly. His english near perfect. He was only one person waiting the whole restaurant which was pretty large. Luckily, it wasn&#39;t a busy night. We ordered our food and drinks. I still can&#39;t get around how reasonably priced beer is in Germany. Whereas in the Uk you eat somewhere nice, your drinks bill can be at least a 30-40% of your food total. In Germany it&#39;s almost like the other way around. Your drink will only be 10-15% of your total bill. It&#39;s nice to see that food is valued more highly than alcohol and quite rightly so.<br><br>The food itself was not stunning but still of a very good standard and quality. My lamb cutlets with ratatouille were sublime. The Octopus Carpaccio less so, but still decent enough. The dessert was lovely, sweet breads with ice cream and plum.<br><br>My friend really wanted the beer stein he was drinking from and after asking if he could purchase it, the waiter said he couldn&#39;t sell it, but that he could have it for free. Suffice to say, we left a generous tip as a result, and the glass made it back to England safely in one piece. <br><br>So in all, the atmosphere in this place is relaxed and quiet. Perfect for a nice dinner and conversation. The staff are superb and the food very good considering the price which came up to about 35 EUR each incl drinks. If in Berlin, shall definitely be stopping here again.",

There is a huge selection of roasted, grilled, pickled, and raw foods but I thought the highlight was the seafood grill located near the middle. You can order white wine and watch the show as they cook your food in heaps of butter. SO SO good. The fish is fresh and cooked to perfection at a fraction of the price of Ka De We!   I definitely recommend this as a go to for a trip to Berlin, it is even worth the standing.",

"reviewcomment":"I am a fan of this place because they have gluten free Thai food. While not as good as my favorite place in Oakland, Cha Cha has several tasty gluten free dishes. I regularly get the massaman curry. There is seating outdoors which on a nice day is a great place for tourist watching. The fruity drinks are also fun. Not the cheapest place or the fastest, but if you need a break after the Brandenburger Tor before you hit Checkpoint Charlie, Cha Cha is the place.",

Lovely cavelike atmosphere. We were offered an upstairs table after a few minutes but liked the cellar vibe- except for the loud US/English speaking woman who wanted all to know her business... Food was so flavorful, washed down with some tasty German brews. Hope to get back sometime to order off the menu.",

"reviewcomment":"We found this restaurant completely by accident. I&#39;d planned out a lot of restaurants to visit in advance but as soon as we got to Berlin we left out hotel room and went for a walk around Mitte to get some food as we were so hungry. We found Augustiner am Gendarmenmarkt and stopped in to grab some food and beer. Wow! It was fantastic. Traditional German pub food and the most delicious beer. This is exactly what I had always wanted from my trip to Germany. The food, drink and atmosphere were all just perfect and this ended up being one of the best places we ate at - completely by accident!<br><br>We visited twice in the end. The first night we had a giant platter of various meats and every single thing was delicious. The second time I had the pork knuckle, a Germany staple that I&#39;d always wanted to try. After some difficulty in working out how to cut into the thing (my fault!) I couldn&#39;t get enough of that either.<br><br>If you like hearty pub food then this is your place. Also, the Augustiner Hell beer is now one of the my absolute favourite drinks of all time. Enjoy!",

"reviewcomment":"I was here this morning for a meet-up with an alumni association. It was a huge restaurant, and during Sundays, they have brunch buffet, which, for 9,90 EUR, it is eat-all-you-can, and you pay a la carte for the drinks. After experiencing this place, I think I am willing to give this place 3 stars.<br><br>The spread was plentiful. There were plenty of selections, and for 9,90, come hungry, and you will get your money&#39;s worth. Who would believe there&#39;s spareribs for brunch? Anyway, buffets aren&#39;t really my style, but I was hungry, that I ate enough for the whole day, I don&#39;t think I would be eating something for the rest of the day. The food was tasty, but, as buffets are, they sit there on the long table for the longest time, so sometimes, they are still warm, sometimes, they&#39;ve been there waiting for someone to take them. <br><br>Given the set-up, I think this restaurant is more for quantity than quality. If you&#39;re hungry, then 9,90 EUR is a deal. I was, but I also think that eating out is something one should enjoy as a social act, not just an act of stuffing one&#39;s stomach. If not for the alumni meet-up, I probably would not have entered this place. I give it 3 stars for an okay experience.",

It took them like a little more them five minutes to prep it but it was worth the wait. Fries were good too, and they had this dip which was ketchup and spicy onions. Big up to them.<br><br> The price for a menu was almost 7 EUR, which is of course not dirt cheap but alright (I think at BK you prolly pay 8-9 EUR for the same thing).<br><br> They also have a daily special thing, but I didn&#39;t have that.

So I did.<br>The entrance is already cool, followed by great music and beautiful people - if you come early you might even find a seat. The problem is though - if this seat is reserved the waiters will tell you to get up at some point which is quite annoying... I was sitting here first! <br>The drinks are not too cheap but my mojito was well maid. And I did enjoy every sip of it. <br>At first we were sitting on the stairs at the end of the bar, and then were moved to a couch, it is an open space blocked with quite a lot of seats, yet feels spacious enough, there is also a club downstairs that opens up later on and people are being charged for at the entrance after 22:00 or so on weekends, but as it started to get more and more crowded, we moved away to another bar.",

"reviewcomment":"We&#39;ve visited Nolas multiple times on this trip to Berllin -- it&#39;s just beginning to feel like Spring, so we&#39;re struck with a sudden urge to sit outside, I suppose. <br><br>As you can imagine for a restaurant with outdoor seating in the park, this place is full of families on a Saturday or Sunday afternoon. They have a good brunch buffet -- there are some pretty tasty things offered (German, Swiss and American style), but you do pay a premium for being able to sit in the sunshine and enjoy your coffee. <br><br>They also make wine at Nolas. We tried a bottle of the Riesling and it was a good evening drinking wine for sitting on the patio.<br><br>Finally, the ice cream -- it&#39;s nothing to write home about, really. The flavor is just ok and it doesn&#39;t seem super fresh. That said, I definitely recommend the Eiskaffee. Coffee + ice cream for an afternoon snack? Ja, bitte!",

I get annoyed that they have long intermissions in films that shouldn&#39;t have them, but what I find most galling is that they charge you an extra Euro to see a long movie.

"reviewcomment":"Craving Italian food at an affordable price? This is your lucky day! Let me walk you through the sequence of my meal<br>1. Starter: Bruschetta - it was good, but I&#39;ve had much better before.<br>2. Pasta: Linguine with tuna, cherry tomatoes etc - now this dish was seriously good, the pasta just cooked to perfection it disappeared effortlessly.<br>3. Dessert: Tiramisu. OMG. I have a weakness for these anyway, but this tiramisu is seriously dangerous. And it is massive. I have rarely come across such a good tiramisu and I would consider it a crime not to order it, even if I was completely full, which I was, incidentally :)<br>Now a quick note about everything not related to food, which is secondary anyway: The ambience was ok, it is definitely not cosy, the place is too big and too busy for that. I would strongly recommend reserving a table, as this place was fully packed even on a Monday.",

But unfortunately, I was wrong. <br><br>See, the thing is, I once entered an Ishin before (they are a small chain of sushi restaurants here in Berlin), it was a long time ago (in a galaxy far far away, oh, wait, never mind...), and I went with a colleague for lunch. I was so dissatisfied with it, and vowed never to enter an Ishin again. So I made it my personal goal to try to find the best sushi in Berlin, and I firmly believed that Ishin isn&#39;t the place to look for it.<br><br>Enter my companion, who swears by Ishin. I suppose he was able to convince me to give Ishin a second chance, so tonight, I did. We went on a Thursday (Thursday and Friday are the best days for sushi, by the way, due to the fish shipments), and tried their nigiri menu (for 16,50 EUR, you get to choose 15 pieces). That was a swanky deal. We additionally ordered gyoza, and hiya-yakko.<br><br>And oh my god. That was sushi that can kick ass. They had swanky offerings like uni, toro, amaebi, and others, and the quality of the fish is so evident from the way it melts in your mouth. <br><br>So yes, I give up. Ishin delivers, as long as it is Thursday (or Friday, perhaps), and you&#39;re not getting the lunch menu. It&#39;s a good thing this place is close to where we live.",

We arrived around 10:30 p.m., walked right in and got a table.<br><br>The drinks were heavy pours and beers were well-priced. The kitchen was closed, but soon basket vendors came by with samosas and pretzels. The place was just loaded with happy, brainy Germans playing songs on the jukebox and bopping along to the music. I didn&#39;t want to leave. <br><br>I can imagine it&#39;s even better (and more crowded) in the warmer months, when boast pass by on the river.",

"reviewcomment":"A friend of mine and I visited this place in the Mitte.<br><br>I instantly fell in love. There is an outside patio area to sit on and enjoy your meal. There is also seating inside. There are pictures around the cafe. There are also French products to purchase.<br><br>This is a self service place, so I would advise to pick out which table you will be seated at and then go order. They will ask where your table to located.<br><br>I went here about 4-5 times for breakfast after discovering it, and I always ordered the same thing. <br><br>--Cappuccino which was strong and excellent. Way better than our watered down coffee in America..<br>--Rhubarb Tart, this was so delicious. It was sweet enough, and I loved the tartness which in my opinion balanced out the sweetness.<br><br>There was some language barriers, but some of the baristas spoke English and we made it work. <br><br>I am really going to miss this place!",

I&#39;d say it&#39;s like a Black Angus or Ruby Tuesday, an upscale coffee shop which features steaks, served with a house salad, baked potato with their &#34;house&#34; sour cream and a hunk of garlic bread.<br><br>The American dressing for the salad was more like 1000 island, while the French was more like Ranch dressing. Go figure.<br><br>I had the rib eye and my server thought I said Well instead of Rare. No biggie, it got sent back and came back perfectly cooked, piping hot!! The steak was tender but a tad salty from their seasoning. I devoured it anyway.<br><br>Stephen had the special prime and it looked as tender as it tasted. He finished his meal as well.<br><br>Quite honestly I can&#39;t find fault with our meal. My steak was €20,50 which is no different than what I pay in SoCal. I did sub the sour cream for the herb butter, and was glad I did. The German sour cream is thick, and not as creamy as the US version.<br><br>I would recommend this place and would come back too.",

"reviewcomment":"I would say this was my first &#34;real&#34; german meal.... Was recommended to this place by a Berlin local and I have to say I am  a fan - the generous portions and heavy carbs may be a turn off to some, but to me, it was comfort food deliciousness!! <br>For our mains, my sister and I did the old half/half switch trick - which meant I got to try two different dishes, we chose Käsespätzle a cheesey, chewy pasta that with every mouthful I was thinking about the next, as well as the Rheinischer Sauerbraten which was a braised meat with red apple cabbage and potato dumplings. <br>The servings were HUGE! and although I was feeling full, decided to share a dessert. The three of us shared the Süßer Flammkuchen (Sweet Flambee) which was kind of like a dessert pizza/tart with apple and raisons with a shot poured over an set on fire - the flames added a bit of drama to the meal - it was quite exciting. <br>My only negative of the meal was the shot of alcohol poured over the dessert... I get that this is how the fire is lit, but it was a little overpowering in some parts which were quite heavily soaked in alcohol. Apart from that, I would recommend this place to anyone wanting an authentic german meal in berlin!!",

The amount of work that gets put in to make wax to look like a certain person is crazy and I have absolute respect for those who create these wax figures. Putting each strand of hair - I wonder if the sculptors just wish they were making all Michael Jordan figures instead.<br><br>The main reason I felt the need to go here was to see Mesut Ozil&#39;s wax figure. When they launched his last year, he was still with Real Madrid but he&#39;s now wearing a red Arsenal jersey - I still like him though. CR7 is also there but his figure must&#39;ve been made before he got his teeth and face done.<br><br>The bonus items I wanted to see were Dirk Nowitzki and Michael Jackson. Hitler is also there but you&#39;re not allowed to take pictures with him and he&#39;s in a glass cage. Obama, Reagan, Churchill, Lady Gaga, Madonna, Bieber (yuck), Katy Perry, Brad Pitt, Leo Di Caprio, Russell Brand, Will Smith, etc were there too. Beyonce&#39;s figure looks like Mya Rudolph though.<br><br>I bought tickets online so we got to skip the line.",

"reviewcomment":"My girlfriend and I went there along with my sister for her birthday dinner. The surroundings which could have been pretty idyllic, are sadly somewhat ruined by a large construction site right next to it. However, these are soon forgotten, as the food arrives. We chose the 8 course surprise menu with wine. This means the chef gets more or less free hands, but some of the courses are the same ones as on the 6 course tasting menu. The highlight was the eel with smoked pork bellies and eel tea, but all 8 courses were great tasting, all the way from the amuse bouche through to the surprise dessert consisting of no less than 8 tiny dessert dishes!<br>They try to use local or regional ingredients, lots of fresh herbs (some of which are home grown), and pack each dish full of flavour.<br>The service is impeccable and professional, but without the stiffness and formality you tend to find in fine dining. The atmosphere is relaxed and informal. This is all about the great food experience, and highly recommended.",

I have to say that the strudel was very tasty and well-done, though I don&#39;t have plenty of strudel data points. Their dessert rack near the counter was also superb, and if I were hungry, I would have ordered a cake slice (but I had cake two hours before that). <br><br>Service was not the most prompt, as is the case with most of Europe.

It seems straight out of the 20s, with the old-timer staff to boot. I recall the barstaff wearing some sort of WWII-looking navy-ish hats. <br>The menu is a hardcover like a vintage book. It has dozens of cocktails listed, made with anything from gin to champagne, to brandy. I&#39;ve tried a few, and since they&#39;re pretty strong, can only have a few each time I go! The pink lady, and the aviation are among my favourites since I am a fan of gin in cocktails... <br>The prices are a little high--8-15 euro per cocktail, and the service is slow, (as I found this the case in most places in Berlin) but it is definitely worth the trip.",

"reviewcomment":"Un très joli cinéma au coeur de Mitte dans les Hackesche Höfe qui méritent d&#39;être eux aussi remarqués. J&#39;y suis allée il y a quelques mois pour la première du Film Hollunder Blüte, bien situé dans une cours charmante et tranquile, il faut monter quelques étages pour s&#39;y rendre. Le hall est accueillant, et ce qui m&#39;a beaucoup plu, ce sont les petites tables et les chaises pour prendre l&#39;apéro avant ou après le film. Mobilier de bon goût, ce qui n&#39;est pas toujours le cas dans les cinémas! La salle de cinéma elle-même n&#39;a rien de bien spécial, rien à dire là-dessus. L&#39;expérience cinématographique m&#39;a bien plu.",

"reviewcomment":"My aunt brought us here and I had currywurst for the first time. I ordered it with frites and mayonnaise to get the whole experience. I had a bit of a kebab, which was tasty. When I first heard about currywurst, I couldn&#39;t really wrap my head around the idea of curry powder with sausage and ketchup but once I tasted it, it made sense. The fries were nice and crispy but they were drowning in ketchup and mayo. I&#39;m only assuming that&#39;s how it&#39;s served traditionally because I don&#39;t have anything to compare it to. Despite the condiment drowning, I liked it anyway.<br><br>It was late at night on a weekday so there weren&#39;t a lot of people around besides a few couples and some guys stopping by for a quick bite after a night of drinking. They have tables that you stand at - no chairs here. Like other currywurst spots, it&#39;s very casual. My aunt and mom each had a bottle of Berliner Kindl Pilsner to accompany their food. Something I found interesting was that they have bottles of Moet in the fridge. You know, just in case you feel like popping bottles while snacking on sausage.<br><br>I don&#39;t know if this is THE place to go for currywurst but I really enjoyed the food here.",

"reviewcomment":"Great place for steaks! Good service, too. Was in Berlin for business and went alone, so the waiter asked me if I cared for newspaper and was generally very friendly. They have a big steak menu, South American and USDA. Went for the boneless rib-eye and it was phantastic: tender, juicy, a tad smokey and cooked to perfection. Many times they tend to overcook steak in Europe, or at least in Germany, but this was perfect. Wanted medium-rare and that&#39;s exactly what I got. This was probably one of the best steaks I&#39;ve had in a very long time. Then they have an extra menu with about 20 or so different varieties of coarse salts for the steak, which is really neat. Salad was also very tasty (had the chopped one) and great wine by the glass. Very good experience overall.",

"reviewcomment":"My friend who lives in berlin showed me around to a few awesome spots and Freischwimmer WAS BY FAR my favorite restaurant in Berlin. It stood right up there with White Trash Fast Food Restaurant. The vibe here is much more relaxed and one that I never wanted to leave. If it was not for the rain we would have still been munching on olives and bread and feeding the ducks that swim in the canal. Freischwimmer is an old house boat and there are many along this canal that are converted into restaurants, lounges and clubs. It is situated outside with a portion that you can sit under the roof but still outside so if you get chilly BRING a sweater. The food is outstanding. I would say that the menu is a little bit of European and Asian dishes. Now, the full bar here is awesome and though they Whisky selection is sadly limited they can still make a good Whisky Sour. Priced very reasonably so perfect for those traveling on a budget. <br><br>The view is great and it is a short walk to the River Spree and on those warm days it is also close to Badeschiff (outdoor public pool on the River Spree)...",

You need a few hours at least to see everything. They go through German history before it was even called Germany right up until what is happening now. Since the place is so massive they do tours of the museum itself and they do English tours as well, so if you are not a big history person this might interest you! <br><br>Spoiler Alert!! - If you are from the US they have a copy of the Declaration of Independence written in German! Apparently when the declaration was signed  a copy of it was in German as well due to the number of German immigrants in the colonies at that time.",

I knew that this market existed, but only recently have I tried it out, due to the prodding of my companion, who loves farmers markets like these.<br><br>I love that there are so many fresh produce, and the prices are not outrageous either. There are also artisan stalls, so if you want some souvenirs from Berlin, there are those you can get here. There are interesting food stalls too, so if all you want is some very delicious street food, you can get it here too. But for us, this is where we do our weekend shopping, as the vegetables are fresh, the meat is freshly butchered, and it is just a joy to shop. <br><br>I regret the fact that whenever I needed to buy some Berlin souvenirs for friends overseas, I always went to that market near the Wall during Sundays. But that was just too far from where I live, and too flooded with tourists with cameras. Here, there are more people carrying shopping bags than cameras, and somehow, I prefer that, as the merchandise also tends to be different due to the different market it caters to.",

"reviewcomment":"Was it the band?! Seeing an old favorite rock the place, live and loud and free?! Because of the company we kept?! The excitement of the day?! All the build up to the night?! My love of this neighborhood?!<br><br>Maybe a little of all of the above?!<br><br>Sometimes going to live concerts in Germany can be a bit of a letdown. I suppose I am used to livelier and more vocal crowds elsewhere. But our fellow rockers in Lido were out in good and full force, and I was simply in my element!!!<br><br>Looking back, I do think a lot of the great atmosphere can be directly lent to the location. It&#39;s big enough to hold what feels like a healthy crowd, without losing the intimacy of a smaller venue, where you feel close enough to the band no matter where you are standing (way in the back, behind the sound guy) or how tall (I&#39;m a midget compared to the average German!). It&#39;s never a push or shove to get to the toilets or to the bar, despite the place getting awfully full! The offering at the bar is basic but decent, and compared to other cities in Germany, oh so fair! Compared to Frankfurt, the prices in Berlin are near a steal!<br><br>The initial room we entered was rather smokey - not my favorite condition of air to inhale, and so I mentally prepared myself for a night of it. But when we entered the main hall, it was surprisingly faint and light. A sign of a well-ventilated place! Not that I endorse the habit, but sometimes a light whiff of cig-smoke is welcome. Certainly beats the scent of long-overdue showers and worn out deodorant. While I have appreciated the whole non-smoking movement popping up in cities and establishments all over the world, I still enter a dark and atmospheric club like Lido and can&#39;t help associate the scent of cigarette smoke with some of my best and dearest memories of long, lusty, hilarious, and exhilarating nights out. Ah, only in Berlin, still in Berlin! can you smoke and drink and dance and bop without grabbing your coat for a puffer outside.<br><br>The sound balance is fantastic, the space just right for up-and-coming bands, the crowd a nice mix of humanity, and the remnants of the interior detailing, a hint of the former glory days this place perhaps used to see and know, a salute to a passing time when art nouveau was at its best.<br><br>It was Lido. It was the band. It was Berlin xx",

"reviewcomment":"So, one of the nicer parks I&#39;ve visited in Berlin. Big hill to climb, great view, epic Hohenzollern monument pile at the top and a waterfall to boot.<br><br>Details: The east side is more &#39;natural&#39; with trails and heavy vegetation. Probably a lovely ramble in the summertime. The center is a man made waterfall course that seems like its da bomb when its on - I sadly visited in November when it was shut down. Kind of a fail, but yeah - frozen water can do some damage to deals like this. Although, given water is still standing there, not sure why they don&#39;t keep it running... killing the fountains long before snow time makes little sense to me, but I&#39;m from Florida, what do I know about winter?<br><br>The west side of the park is flatter and more &#39;park like&#39;. Wide open spaces, nice trees, a few benches (yeah, could seriously add a lot more of those) and plenty of lawns. SW corner has a soccer field (ok kickball, or whatever you call it) and a beer garden... that is also closed in November. Kids play park was in use and looks like its well loved - no matter the weather.<br><br>NW corner has a masonry entry deal that looks as it it was last maintained when the Kaiser was still in charge... there appears to be some construction activity on that when i visited today - hopefully that is in the process of updating / restoration. Its a cool feature, just one that needs some love.<br><br>Verdict: I&#39;d be a regular visitor if that was my &#39;hood - and its worth a trip even if its not. Plus, lots of shopping &amp; restaurants and such on the main drag in front of the park.",

"reviewcomment":"Yaam beach bar is a slice of the Caribbean in the middle of Berlin. Sitting just off the Spree in Friedrichshain, it&#39;s super easy to get to (it&#39;s a 2 minute walk from Ost Bahnhof).<br><br>It sits at the end of East Side Gallery, and is a great place to stroll along to after eyeing up some graffitti. Kick off your shoes and swap concrete for sand as you step inside its scribbled gates. Tucked behind multicoloured walls, you can lounge on a deckchair, in a hut or swing wildly on a hammock as you enjoy some strong (but tasty) cocktails.<br><br>It&#39;s a Caribbean cave of wonders, and you can wind down to the side of the Spree, which is bejewelled in fairylights, or prop up the bar and enjoy some of the reggae music during the evening.<br><br>Despite the fact Yaam throws a good party, there is a distinctive family vibe during the day. Its chilled out atmosphere is favoured by the locals, and its grassroots wackiness appeals to tourists. One of the highlights of a night in Berlin, Yaam is a vibrant, warm hearted alternative to a stuffy cocktail bar, any night of the week.",

"reviewcomment":"Mauerpark is a great example of what makes Berlin different. Mauerpark is not a nice, manicured park, but it is lively, interesting and different, and of course it has a good stretch of the old Berlin wall running through it.<br>The history of the park is actually quite interesting. It was once the site of the Nordbahnhof (North Station) of Berlin, and continued to be a freight station up until the building of the Berlin wall. Afterwards, for obvious reasons the land became a mixture of death strip and waste land.<br>These day&#39;s the old death strip part is now the park, i.e. the grassy area and the hill, and the western part is now used for a flea market which is well worth visiting.",

"reviewcomment":"On a rather cold and wet trip to Berlin, my travel companion and I were staying in the Prenzlauerberg area of Berlin and were looking for a place nearby that we could have dinner after a long day (we were both flying into Berlin very early that morning). Café Jacques was within walking distance from the U-Bahn station that we were adjacent to. This place has had some good reviews, but we wanted to give it a go anyway. The reviews are darn right about this small joint with an amazing menu and a great vibe. <br><br>Certainly make sure you make a reservation if you&#39;re coming here because it gets really packed and we were really lucky to get a spot in here without any reservations. The staff here are über friendly. We didn&#39;t speak any German, but the staff were willing to converse with us in English and even translate pretty much the entire menu for us (and yes, there&#39;s no English menu here - which is actually a good thing). We settled on a pita and hummous starter and pasta and a veal main for our mains. The wine list is absolutely amazing and even the basic wines are absolutely delicious. We both had the Temperanillo which arrived in huge glasses with generous pours. Serving sizes were also very large for Europe (albeit, everything is bigger in Germany ;)). <br><br>This place is definitely off the charts and for a somewhat &#34;hole in the wall&#34; type place, it was absolutely phenomenal. If I&#39;m ever in Berlin again, I would definitely come back here. Great food, great music, great atmosphere and certainly a great city.",

"reviewcomment":"Like any fan of classical music, I&#39;ve heard many recordings made by the Berlin Philharmonic under various conductors, and know the importance and reputation of the orchestra. I never seriously thought I&#39;d get to hear them play, and in Berlin to boot, until my girlfriend and I started planning a trip to Germany.<br><br>We had limited options due to our schedule, but were able to buy tickets online for a concert led by principal conductor Simon Rattle that included Mozart&#39;s Piano Concerto No. 18 in B-flat major, K. 456, Messiaen&#39;s Oiseaux exotiques, and a pasticcio of excerpts of Haydn&#39;s Symphonies Nos. 45, 64, and 90 as well as from the Creation and The Seven Last Words. The soloist for the first two pieces was Japanese pianist Mitsuko Uchida.<br><br>We sat in section A left, row 2, seats 1 and 2. The view from this location--on the left rather than the right--was great, as we could see the soloist&#39;s hands. The tickets were pricy, though, at about $125 a piece.<br><br>Picking up our tickets at the will call window was easy and didn&#39;t take long. Before the concert we checked our coats and my camera, had some small sandwiches and drinks at one of the concession stands, and took a brief look around the building. We were told that admittance to the concert hall takes places 20 minutes before the start of the concert, but they let us in a bit early.<br><br>The concert itself was wonderful, and the acoustics in the hall fantastic. I own recordings of Uchida playing Mozart, and enjoyed her performance of the piano concerto very much. Messiaen is far less approachable than Mozart, and I can&#39;t say I enjoyed it all that much, although I gave it a chance. Rattle&#39;s pasticcio of Haydn--which lasts slightly over an hour--worked very well, and the orchestra even turned off their music-stand lights and left the stage during the &#34;Farewell&#34; Symphony (No. 45) portion.<br><br>It was a wonderful, perhaps once-in-a-lifetime experience.",

"reviewcomment":"I was here earlier this week with my companion, as well as a couple of other companions. We had a reservation for 6 people at 8 PM, and we got this table right by the balcony. <br><br>When our party all arrived, the servers were quite attentive to all our needs. With 5 people and different food needs, the servers were more than happy to answer our questions (Q: What&#39;s Zigeune sauce? A: That&#39;s a sauce with plenty of Zigeune inside, finely chopped, very delicious!). Seriously, the servers were part entertainers. They seemed to be really enjoying their job. It was a very relaxed environment.<br><br>Okay, let me talk about the food. It was delicious. I had the artichoke appetizer, baked with goat cheese and vegetables. I shared this with my companion. And for my main dish, I got the roast rabbit. That was divine. Finally, my companion and I shared a half-liter of Greek dry red wine.<br><br>One thing I didn&#39;t like about this place is the quantity. Oh my god. Their food servings are huge. My appetizer (which was shared) was 6,50 EUR and comes in a huge plate. And my rabbit was 12,50 EUR and also came in a huge platter. Next time, I would share everything with someone, say, order one appetizer and one main dish to share. Because ideally, they would serve just 60% of the current quantity and reduce the price a little bit. But oh well, there&#39;s a way to trick the system. Hence, I am only giving this place 4 stars.",

We got the schnitzel which was the best I&#39;ve had ever -- tender, thin, but still nicely fried. It came with an interesting warm potato salad that I found delectable.

I love the fact that the ice is not as sugary (sweet) as in almost all the other icecream parlors in Berlin. <br>Their dark 67% chocolate is too die for. Their hazelnut is the best I had in Berlin. Everything is organic and they have a lot of vegan ice as well (without milk).<br>They experiment a lot with flavours and really make unique but excellent tastes. Last but not least: the guys behind the counter are very friendly.<br>Yes, they are a bit more expensive (like 20 cents per serving) but it&#39;s well worth it.<br>You know what? I think I&#39;ll go there now!",

"reviewcomment":"After perusing Yelp to find a good Asian restaurant near Prenzlaurberg, I picked out Onkel Ho. Good reviews enticed me to it. My verdict is 4 stars. My husband and I really enjoyed the zen ambiance but I was not really impressed by the Pho. Firstly, they had a limited selection of pho. It was either chicken or beef so I ordered the beef soup. To me its a bit boring. I was looking for a combination of beef flank, tripe, tendon along with the beef steak (ohhh yeah I am a meat eater). Secondly, I thought that soup base was not as flavourful as the one I have elsewhere. I feel like it was missing a certain something (spicies or herbs) I cant quite figure out. Thirdly, since I am not so fond of sprouts, I was not too happy that the soup automatically came with it. I was so used to the separate plate of vegetables to accompany my soup. I am unsure if they provide fresh basil with the soup but I was not served with it.<br><br>On the other hand, my husband was impressed by the dish of the day which was vermicelli noodles and grilled beef topped with crushed peanut. They recalled it being juicy and tasty.<br><br>Overall, we were satisfied with out selections but I was not as impressed as my husband.",

It is - however- NOT the food that was kept the crowds away.<br><br>The udon soups are as hearty as they are delicious, the only catch: deciding which soup to opt for, they all sounds do tempting. I went for the fish soup and didn&#39;t look back to the menu in regret for even a split second. The fish was just slightly fried and melts on the tongue, while the seafood was chewy and oceany to the tee. The noodles were thick and moist, a real treat after getting a little bit fed up with the same old thin rice noodles at Berlins many vietnamese restaurants.<br><br>The decor is ok, large round modern communal tables, the service is decent, and they have an English menu! A perfect spot to grab a bit, or slurp a soup (hence the name) before catching a flick at Babylon up the road. I&#39;ll definitely go soon again!",

"reviewcomment":"Hmmm I was really torn in how many points to give. The theater is one of those really cool DDR buildings and looks amazing inside. It only had one screening hall, but that one is huge. The waiting area has amazing chandelirs and just brings you back into a different era. The reason why I am only giving 3 points is, because the bathrooms are simply disguisting, they are old and smell, so try not to use the bathroom here. Secondly, the entire theater is pretty dusty and since I am allergic to dust it is a problem for me. The interior of the theater is really nice though.",

The deep maroon of the<br>seating and the beige/light golden colouring of the walls went splendidly with<br>the warm atmosphere of the building. It wasn&#39;t difficult at all to find our<br>seats and the staff was helpful and kind. I arrived a bit early to scope out<br>the rest of the venue and saw it was to my pleasure clean and well-kept. If you&#39;re looking for places<br>in the area to grab a bite before or after the show, there are a few<br>restaurants in the area. Directly right next door is Fritz 101, a German<br>brauhaus Bavarian cookhouse with what I thought was wonderful pork knuckles and<br>schnitzel, where my spouse and I went. Afterwards a walk down Friedrichstraße<br>would be right in order.",

The park is lush and green with many open areas for picnics and benches to use for people watching. The park has numerous nooks and crannies; plenty of street vendors with portable grills and the different variations of trees is quite remarkable.<br><br> I would highly recommend a picnic lunch and spending half a day walking around. Alternatively you will notice tons of folks riding bikes. Don&#39;t be surprised when you see people reading books. They actually still read books in the park. You will want to take a camera as the park has many monuments and statutes. I will never visit Berlin without spending a few hours in this park. The only thing missing is a Sabrett hotdog vendor serving hotdogs with red onions and warm pretzels",

"reviewcomment":"Die Tiergartenquelle hat mir wirklich gut gefallen. Die Atmosphäre eines S-Bahn-Bogens ist schon recht einzigartig, das Gewölbe hebt sich merklich ab von vielen anderen Lokalen.<br>Das Essen ist deftig-deutsch und gut. Ich hatte Cordon-Bleu vom Schwein, meine Mitstreiter unter anderem Schnitzel.<br>Wir saßen zu viert an einem sehr langen Tisch mit unterschiedlichen Tischnachbarn, was mich nicht stört, im Gegenteil. Das Restaurant war an diesem Abend brechend voll, die Bedienung war freundlich, wenn auch bei so vielen Gästen nicht sehr flott, verständlich...<br><br> Das Bier ist sehr gut, wenn die Preise auch ruhig etwas niedriger liegen könnten wird dies meine erste Wahl sein, wenn Übernachtungsgäste aus Übersee ( ich bin &#39;Couchsurfer&#39;) wieder mal authentisch Deutsch essen gehen wollen.<br><br> Nachtrag: War kurz vor Neujahr noch mal dort, diesmal mit 5 Amerikanern und 1 Belgier. Erst jetzt wurden mir die riesigen Portionen bewusst, wir waren sehr früh dort, anscheinend werden die Portionen immer kleiner, wenn der Laden richtig voll ist. <br>Wie gesagt, wir hatten Riesenportionen und es hat uns allen hervorragend geschmeckt. Meine Gäste fanden das Restaurant toll und waren vollends zufrieden. Leider musste eines der Mädels unbedingt so eine schicke Glühweintasse mitgehen lassen, hoffe, ich darf das Lokal noch betreten, kann aber nix dafür, sie hat mir ihr Beutestück erst zuhause gezeigt.<br><br> For English Visitors:<br><br> Tiergartenquelle is THE place to experience an original Berlin atmosphere without being too touristy!<br>Portions are giant, prices reasonable and the beer is one of the best Berlin provides.<br>Even for larger groups tables are available in order to serve tourists as well as families and people living around the venue.<br>Some of my friends didnt found the place, but its sooo simple: its situated in the same building as Tiergarten S-Bahn-station, just fall on the street and take next door to your right.",

"reviewcomment":"Rolled up to Fritz this weekend and it was pretty cool and fun. Definitely the younger type of crowd here ranging 18-21 mostly vs the higher end clubs, but was still fun. <br><br>They have 2 music rooms, 1st one was house music and 2nd one was rap/r&amp;b style. Place got packed and the party/energy was good. <br><br>They have a completely separate outdoor tent for smokers which was nice. Would recommend for people who like Soda club type of scene. Door entry was 8euro.<br><br>-Aaron the American",

"reviewcomment":"I have a goal to bring my companion to a new restaurant every time we eat out and it is my choice to pick a restaurant, so we ended up here for last night. It was a late dinner; we showed up at about 21:15, and I was surprised that the place was still packed. We unfortunately did not have a reservation, so we had to wait about five minutes before a table opened up.<br><br>I ordered the Jeonji Dolsot Bibimbap, while my companion ordered the seafood stew set (I forgot the name). We also shared an order of the dumpling appetizers (V5): these are four small delicate dumplings filled with Korean goodness, dipped in delicate dipping sauce. Oh, we also shared a pot of green tea.<br><br>I was impressed with this place. The food was amazing. The bibimbap was perfect: I mixed it with the spicy sauce provided on my tray, and mixed it all over inside the hot stone. The rice was well-done, and the vegetables and meat were fresh. The delicate seaweed soup that came with it also had a very exquisite flavor that I would want to order it for that soup alone. <br><br>Needless to say, judging from how my companion looked that night, he also enjoyed his meal.<br><br>The restaurant is small; there&#39;s not a lot of wiggle room in it. Make a reservation if you are a group bigger than two people. As we were leaving around 22:00, people were still coming in and sitting down. The restrooms are downstairs; they are very clean and cavernous, although they should clear the trash bins every now and then.<br><br>Overall, a great find. I give this place 5 stars and will definitely come back here again.",

As everyone has already said, the chicken is amazing and a good deal at 7.50 Euro. <br><br>Recommend both their kraut and potato salad.

The one with viges is really popular.<br><br>They have a lunch menu, a salad &amp; a pasta for a fair price. Their wine menu has some delicious choices from Italy and around. You can also order a plate of antipasti with a tasty glass of red wine. Great in the summer, sitting outside on the terras. Watching all those fashionable people walk past you. <br><br>Reserving a table might be a good idea, it is very popular so you&#39;ll have to be lucky for a table. It&#39;s located on a great spot if you want to go for drinks afterwords. Torstrasse <br>is full of great bars and small clubs. So enjoy your time there and let me know how it was!",

"reviewcomment":"we were wandering around looking for a place for dinner away from what would for sure be tourist traps on Unter der Linden near Brandenberger Tor. i&#39;m sure we were not walking down the right roads but it seems like few options are available, and yet fewer are open on a Saturday evening.<br><br>trusty ol&#39; yelp led us to Maximilian&#39;s, tucked indoors on the main level of an office building. boy was it popular with the locals! there is a relaxed &#34;patio&#34; seating area and cozy tables and booths inside. service was a bit slow to get the menu, to take our orders, to get the cheque, to bring the bill. not sure if it&#39;s just the more relaxed atmosphere of Europe/Germany that we&#39;re not used to in North America so I won&#39;t hold it against this place.<br><br>- BERLINER EISBEIN MIT KARTOFFELN, SAUERKRAUT UND ERBSPÜREE (13,90€) - little ol&#39; me gets served this dish with Berlin-style pork hock the size of my HEAD with boiled potatoes, sauerkraut, and roasted pea puree. the pork was so flavourful and boiled to the point where the skin/fat/meat was all buttahhh. by the time I was finished, it looked like I had barely touched the plate form the opposite angle. more ridiculous, my leftovers proved enough for 3 tasty tasty sandwiches the following day and a half. wunderbar :)<br>- SCHWEINSHAXE MIT SEMMELKNÖDEL UND SAUERKRAUT (11,90€) - this traditionally Bavarian roasted pork knuckle comes with bread dumpling and sauerkraut. not a fan of bread dumpling, as it&#39;s much too dense for me, but the pork had an insanely crackling skin. so crispy!!<br><br>prices are verrrry decent for the portions! paulaner is a plenty here. this place is solid.",

"reviewcomment":"Imagine one of those secret bars from the 1920&#39;s prohibition in America. You don&#39;t know how to get in, unless you&#39;re with someone who does. We found a metal door which we presumed was the entrance, rang some sort of bell and voila - enter Igor from the Adams-family. Only handsome. And in a tux. But his attitude was the same. More or less ;)<br><br>It&#39;s the cooles thing to be in a bar that&#39;s just underneath the railway tracks at Friedrichstrasse station, and once inside you understand why this bar is so hyped. <br><br>The prices are accpetable at an average of 9 euros per drink, but the female bartenders make them so well and with so much attention to detail, that I found myself giving the hard working bartenders a large tip for their efforts. Good show.<br><br>Once you&#39;re on Friedrichsstrasse station find the S-bahn and follow the platform till the end, follow the staircase as far across the water as you can, cross the road and you should find yourself in front of a big metal door with a door bell on the left hand side.",

"reviewcomment":"Wow 5 stars from me but the fact that I went  here 3 times over 5 nights is Berlin should explain how much I enjoyed it here! <br><br>Situated in East Berlin, nicely tucked into the area of next to Warshauer strass U Bahn - Cass&#39; is in what can only be described as a compound of derelict warehouses, funky bars with no frills and a vibe that is laid back and independent. <br><br>With 3 big club rooms and 3 bars inside - everyone is catered for on a night out. On the weds night I went to see rapper Pharoahe Monch, Friday was all about 80&#39;s music/indie/rock and Hiphop while Saturday was more general cool tunes throughout with another favourite rapper &#39;Shabaam Sadeeq&#39; playing live in the main room. <br><br>Cloakrooms are €1, pints of excellent wheat beer €2.30 and the bouncers actually are a pleasure to chat to. If only this was how clubs operated back in the UK!<br><br>If you&#39;re in Berlin - you have to go here. Just check their website to see what&#39;s on in advance. Just be warned - the German guys on the fussball tables upstairs are absolute masters. No matter how good you think you are, you will get your arse kicked! We did...",

Ristorante Masaniello (not to overstate it) is the shit.<br><br>Run by a family from Naples, the place charmed from the moment we entered and the wood powered oven cooked our divine pizza margherita. Who knew that a little tomato sauce, buffalo mozzarella and basil was all you really needed on a pizza? Oh right - the Italians. This place reconfirms that all you need is the right ingredients to make transcendent food.  <br><br>We ordered another pizza with salami and, olives &amp; artichokes....but that margherita stole our heart. Its pure creamy goodness was exactly what we wanted. And their spicy oil was even better than XXL - an impressive feat. On top of all this, our Italian server, homey decor, and temptress of a courtyard already have us planing for a return visit. Parents - we are taking you here. You&#39;re welcome.",

"reviewcomment":"The location is perfect. Across the street from the concert hall/opera house and within walking distance from Checkpoint Charlie, Brandenburger Tor, stores, restaurants and metro stations. It was easy to get to/from.<br><br>Two bell hops welcomed us and automatically took our bags to our room while we were checking in. This was nice since my luggage handle broke when I got it from Berlin airport. Check-in process was a breeze and there was a room available for us before the normal check-in time.<br><br>The hotel is an older but beautiful building. The lobby is pretty. There&#39;s a restaurant and a bar downstairs. There&#39;s free wifi at the lobby only. The room we had was nice and comfortable with a view of a chocolate shop! Toiletries include shampoo, conditioner, hand soap and body wash.<br><br>All the employees were helpful and polite. We had to check which channel the Real Madrid vs Bayern Munich was on and the concierge guy got the answer. I ended up watching the game at the lobby since there were lots of Munchen fans watching and I was the only Madrid fan - I&#39;m always ready for trash talking! After 2 goals from my team, people went back to their rooms. I really couldn&#39;t find a flaw with this hotel.",

Our hotel was just around the corner so it was nice to walk and pass by it on a daily basis while in Berlin. The museum located nearby is the main attraction for me - it is a history of the wall and is eye-opening and enlightening. The museum looks like it&#39;ll be small from the outside, but don&#39;t be fooled! It can take a long time to look around but is well worth it.<br><br>We often saw this area in the evening as well, when going back to our hotel. This is a great time to have a second look around and think, as there is next to nobody about later on.<br><br>It&#39;s definitely a must-see, due to the historical significance of the area, but don&#39;t expect to spend a lot of time here. Maybe grab a coffee afterwards!",

"reviewcomment":"What a playground. Water play. Rope jungle. Huge animal statues. Clay making. Climbing areas that go on and on. <br><br>And that&#39;s apparently just one of three playgrounds here at Britzer Garten, a huge suburban park that&#39;s got a lake, a little train, plentiful benches and flower gardens, several snack stands and at least one very nice looking cafe on the small lake. <br><br>This made a very fun outing for our crew of young European travelers (i.e., kids 4-8) who had enjoyed all the sightseeing but were also ready for a good place to just run around with the local kids.<br><br>If you&#39;re going from downtown Berlin: it&#39;s only 20 minutes or so on the U-6 to Alt-Mariendorf, but you will then definitely want to take the bus to one of the park entrances. It&#39;s only a 5-10 minute bus ride -- and pretty easy to figure out once you arrive at Alt-Mariendorf -- but the distance is further than it looks on a map... and you don&#39;t want to use all your little people&#39;s energy just walking down a semi-busy street. Also, check out the map on the park&#39;s website before you go. I&#39;d suggest aiming for one of the SW entrances (bus 179 as of this week), which are adjacent to the playground our kids enjoyed. (We entered from the North and bus 181, and there is not much up there other than flowers). Overall the park is plenty close that it&#39;s not a big deal getting there, but far enough that I&#39;d consider it at least a half-day outing.",

Perhaps because I have a particular sense of what I want my flea market to look like. Perhaps I go to flea markets not to look for old and used stuff (I didn&#39;t want to use the euphemism &#34;antique&#34;) but to look for products of artisans who might not have a fixed shop to sell their wares. Incense, artwork, small non-used items for gifts, that sort of thing. <br><br>And so when I headed here, there were less artisans selling their products, and more junk scavengers selling their junk. I have no problem with people selling junk, I just have no need for it. So personally, while this is an interesting fleamarket, I am afraid I would have to go somewhere else if I want more choices for interesting dyed cloth shopping bags, or handmade knitted hats, et cetera.",

Overall the burger was very juicy and had good flavors. I would have wished for a larger bun, it seems somehow to be a trend to server burgers with larger buns. Also next time I would go for a smaller burger as these ones have better patty, bun and other ingredients ratios. Overall it was a good burger. The fries come with either mayo or ketchup. The ketchup is excellent, it seems to be some sort of homemade ketchup.",

The cappuccino is technically perfect: a strong shot of dark brown, freshly roasted espresso topped with thick, creamy (full fat) milk with a dusting of chocolate and served with an amaretti biscuit.<br><br> On offer is a wide range of cakes, chocolates and other calorie laden sweet things which are pretty much irresistible to the hardiest dieter. Also worth noting is the nice selection of salads and sandwiches on offer during lunching hours, which in Berlin is anything from 1100 - 1800.<br>However, some may find the smell alone in the adjacent store to be satisfactory enough - you can buy all of the Coffee that they serve in the café and more, freshly ground. On offer is a wide range of high quality chocolate from Berlin, Germany and further afield such as Switzerland &amp; Austria.<br><br> Bear in mind, you do pay for the privilege of having an exceptional coffee in a fairly nice neighborhood, as a cappuccino was around 3,80EUR but it&#39;s so worth it!",

Service is normally attentive and friendly, though I had few cases (been there at least 8 times) which I got &#34;Berliner style&#34; replies... Good wines, even the &#34;normal&#34; house wines are surprisingly not that bad as in most places, but (as it is quite common in the area) truly overpriced. <br>One of the main advantages of the place is the terrace. Lovely place to sit, having wine and some Serrano Schinken. Life seem to be great then....",

There is a smoking area inside which is such a great idea comes from heaven! (specially in winter in Berlin!) <br><br>Everything but the waitress! Yeah. The one star of the 5 stars falls because of the bitchy blondie waitress on last sunday morning. I am not even talking about how long i waited for a breakfast, I am just so annoyed because of the attitude. I disapprove the rude and spoiled waitress attitude which some people think it is cool and kind a hot! what is wrong with you people? Nobody has to be a smiley face all the time but also nobody has to be an ass.     <br><br>2 breakfast days spent in one week holiday. You should definitely try.",

"reviewcomment":"After finally trying out a Currywurst at Konnopke&#39;s Imbiss (not as spectacular as I&#39;d expected, but it was ok), I was walking homewards and happened to walk past An einem Sonntag im August.  It caught my eye, so I walked in.<br><br>I really, really liked the atmosphere here.  There were glass doors separating the spacious main area from the smoking room, and they seemed to actually work! (unlike some other places I&#39;ve been to...but then again, there weren&#39;t any smokers at the time).  Lining the long wall were three large wooden &#34;steps&#34; padded with cushions and regularly interrupted by small tables with menus, pots of sugar, and books.  These stair/benches were decently but not super comfortable, but I still I enjoyed sitting there--it was the perfect people-watching spot, with great views out the large windows of the street.<br><br>Also in the café were sofas (which I later moved to), plentiful outlets, WIFI, and delicious drinks.  On the slightly pricier end of things, but the warm red currant juice (with a hint of cinnamon!) that I ordered was absolutely delectable.<br><br>Coming back for sure!",

Chilled out, dark, loud and winding like most of Berlin&#39;s nightclubs, it delivers banging tunes. <br><br>If you&#39;re into the technical side of music you&#39;ll appreciate the clear sound systems, the rumbling bass and the constant thud of the music as it pounds through your body. Like a lot of Berlin&#39;s clubs, you can feel the music vibrate through you. Dancers go into their own wee world in here, and my pal who loves her techno was a big fan.<br><br>The music was a mix of drum and bass, fast house music and some old techno, all of which were accompanied by the most incredible strobe display I&#39;ve ever seen. The lasers literally engulf and consume your body. I wasn&#39;t even drunk and the light show displays made me feel like I was tripping. It was absolutely tremendous.<br><br>Although Berghain and Watergate are probably the undisputed kings of Berlin&#39;s clubbing scene, Tresor is up there with a great reputation, and still gives the new kids on the block a run for their money. A throwback rave and great for a night out. Don&#39;t let sleazy guys ruin your night, ladies - to be honest, you&#39;ll get that in any club across the world, so don&#39;t let it put you off!!",

Great food, nice interior, and good service!<br><br>Pro&#39;s:<br><br>- creative interior (cloudesque ceilings) and authentic furniture (low tables, chairs, and sofas)<br>- tapas-style food that comes in dozens of small bowls<br>- main dishes are usually served with bread on the side and hummus<br>- good food quality, inexpensive ... great value for money<br><br>Con&#39;s:<br><br>- furniture needs some overhaul<br><br>There is also a takeaway window in case you want to grab a Shawarma to go. I usually sit down and get something grilled (lamb or chicken) with rice and several sides (hummus, vegetables, beans). I like the variety of dishes and drinks (try the Mango Lassi). If you&#39;re in the mood for Middle Eastern - this is your place!",

"reviewcomment":"Before I can review Bandol sur Mer, I have to write a mini-review of Germany&#39;s attitude towards Valentines Day.  Most holidays feature one of more of the following: family obligations; fasting; or Jesus.  So basically, they are, actually, kind of a drag.  On the other hand, the basic premise of Valentines Day is: pick somebody you like and then do enjoyable things with them.  Why is this not a popular Winter holiday in Germany?  I can understand skipping Yom Kippur but not Valentines Day.<br><br>Anyway, I mention this because I was a little mystified why it was so easy to get a reservation for Feb. 14, after I totally whiffed late in December.  Second, Bandol sur Mer is cozy, and everybody except for one couple was speaking English.  It was like being back in the ancestral homeland, except for the part about public transit taking you there without much hassle or danger.<br><br>On to the food: on offer were two prix fixe menus, one of which was friendly towards fish-dairy-only eaters.  Some standouts were the mackerel small plate, the veal tartare, and the modernized &#34;mushy snap peas&#34;, but the courses were solid up and down, with enough time in between (we were there from 9-12 = 21-24) to not feel overly stuffed.<br><br>I&#39;m not sure who is classifying it as €€ instead of €€€, but you won&#39;t feel ripped off either.  Highly recommend, and will return once in a while.",

They&#39;ll mix any 3 or 4 fruits of your choice!<br><br>The shop has a lunch period from about 12:30-14:30 where they ask for customers to enjoy and savor their lunch instead of using the wifi.

Doing this is probably illegal in the US. We ordered our appetizer platter with a shot of vodka each (it&#39;s a combo special!) after hearing that these guys were generous with the pour. What we didn&#39;t expect is that they would keep coming back throughout the meal and giving us various different flavors of vodka.<br><br>All in all we received 4 ice cold shots of different flavors of vodka, EACH, and only paid for 1 pair of shots. The food wasn&#39;t even that pricey: we paid 12 euros for the appetizer platter (shots included) and 10 euros each for our mains. Best business model ever, I think?",

"reviewcomment":"good times, cheap drinks, fun music, good dancing/party atmosphere. Also good if you&#39;re on the pull; but if you&#39;re a single woman and not looking to go home with anybody, you might want to change your mind and bring a friend with you, either that, or get good at telling random dudes to piss off.<br>The bar staff and door guys are always chill and respectful. There is also a cloakroom here that is pretty cheap, 50 cents or a euro or so, and you can go and get stuff out of your bag if you like without any attitude from the attendant.<br>People are generally in a nice mood and happy here, you don&#39;t have to be a star to grace the dance floor, which is usually filled with people of all ages and walks of life. A really fun way to spend an evening; no one thinks they&#39;re too cool for school hereit&#39;s all about having fun and living in the moment.<br>Immer gerne wieder, I love the Kaffee Burger.",

Cozy space with communal tables and a choice of indoor or outdoor seating, this place was crackin large for dinner. A popular choice so it seems amongst the locals. The big test was the thinness and firmness of the pizza-whether it could withstand gravity when sliced and lifted from plate to mouth without flopping down. And it did! Served hot and from really nice Italians, I now understand why it&#39;s all the rave. Go get your pizza fix from this place, it&#39;s well worth it.",

"reviewcomment":"God, German Christmas market are amazing, the ones in London just don&#39;t do it justice. So the basis of our berlin trip was to go christmas markets and we wanted to do all different ones- and we couldn&#39;t pass up the one at Charlottenburg castle because it&#39;s a palace in the background, with christmassy things. I LOVE IT. Its the epitome of europe! <br><br>Also, they do such cute mulled wine in boot cups this year, I took mine home! I wish i had another, both mulled wine and the mug. This christmas market actually doesn&#39;t start to get bustling til after 3pm, so have a look around the castle first! It has everything a christmas market should have, including fairground rides and also a big wooden nativity scene, it was beautiful. the stalls are amazing, selling all sorts- we picked up too much chocolate, and i would&#39;ve loved to pick up more ornaments- i think it was the only place I saw some really traditional christmas ceramics and I was tempted to buy- if it weren&#39;t for going back with cabin luggage only!<br><br>The crepe lady is AMAZING.

But every spot will do!<br>What I really like is you can see the Ferris wheel of spree park from some points of the park, enjoy it while it&#39;s there.<br>There&#39;s also a &#34;Denkmal&#34; for the soviet soldiers across the street which is one of my favorite spots in Berlin, it&#39;s simply stunning.",

I was drown in looking through their windows while walking down the street. It seemed busy and buzzing with warm colored, modern interior.<br><br>They had a wonderful jazz band playing that night. The space was just the right size, with the L-shaped bar, some lounge seating, and just enough standing space to allow for mingling. I was able to get the last free seat at the bar! <br><br>The menu had a good variety between cocktails, wines and different spirits with varied prices. I thought the price for their excellent wine was a steal at 4 or 5 Euros!! <br><br>Also I was very impressed with all I could see from my seat: the staff had a great time and it was a pleasure to look at them working. I haven&#39;t tried any of the cocktails or beers, but I wanted and craved each and every of the selections that were created in front of my eyes. Everything was so clean, beautifully presented, with delicious looking garnishes and appropriate glassware. <br><br>It&#39;s a hotel bar but it didn&#39;t seem touristy at all!

I went for a vegetarian meal made from lentils mostly. I was also given an appetizer &#34;biscuit&#34; (spicy) along with a tomato sauce and the some flat-bread. Everything tasted really good already. I took a mango-yoghurt drink to go with that, for smoothing all the upcoming spiciness. Fair trade and organic, always good to know, but 2,90 which is quite high in comparison with the meal itself. Also took an Indian tea at the end, not amazing but OK with an honey aftertaste.",

They even serve breakfast during weekdays until 3 pm or in weekends until 5 pm. That&#39;s very well needed in Berlin where you can party day and night and forget about when it&#39;s time for breakfast... But that aside...  I loved the burgers. Very nice chips that go with the burgers and an amazing taste. But next time I&#39;m going to order mine without the spread mayonnaise as it contains a lot of garlic. You&#39;re reminded of that after every little burp ;)",

"reviewcomment":"A wonderful experience at a luxury hotel.  The room was ultra comfortable (gotta love the heated bathroom floors and remote-control blackout shade!) and the spa/workout room was lovely.  Internet was fast.  The artwork everywhere was amazing.<br><br>They have quite the spread in the Club lounge, and the attendants were sweet and attentive, albeit a bit too formal for my taste. Though I&#39;m sure if they erred on the side of being too casual, some business dude would complain about that...  heh. What can I say, I&#39;m a chick who wears combat boots and usually prefers to hang out with the &#34;riffraff&#34; but every now and then I need to treat myself, and this is quite the hotel for that.<br><br>There was only one snafu with my entire stay involving miscommunication about a personal training session at the gym.  However, I was highly impressed that their Director of Rooms not only emailed me, but also CALLED me (overseas!) upon my return to apologize and make sure everything had been made up to me.<br><br>The hotel is easily accessible to lots of public transport, and as another reviewer pointed out, the mall is super close if you need to grab snacks or other items.<br><br>I am looking forward to booking another stay with them this summer!",

"reviewcomment":"This is a cool place, with chunky modern dark wood tables and benches inducing a convivial atmosphere, as one often has to share the larger tables with strangers. The glass walls are illuminated by funky color-changing lights and adds to a slightly surreal ambience, like a fancy place from the film Blade Runner.<br><br> The food is generally very tasty, Thai of origin, with a healthy blend of Vietnamese and Singaporean, and you can order small or regular portions. My usual trick is to get a few starters and then order the 1 kilo of fried fresh king prawns, which means that one must always come here with a friend as that&#39;s a lot of prawns!<br><br> Service is usually pretty good, unless the place is packed, which is quite often during the weekends, so reservations are definitely recommended.<br><br> Overall, it&#39;s a nice place to take friends who want to try an unusual modern Asian bistro, and that&#39;s what I do.",

"reviewcomment":"To be honest, I had not very high expectations for dinner, after peeking through the earlier reviews. But I went with a Swabian who highly recommended the place for authentic Schwabisch food and it was actually surprisingly unexpectedly amazingly rather good! I had the Badisches Schneckensüppchen (snail in cream) soup and it was simply great. Creamy, silky, aromatic, with the snails perfectly textured and tasty. Since Helmut Kohl was recently on TV, I ordered the Schwäbischer Saumagen (stuffed pig&#39;s stomach) in his honour, and I can now understand why he insisted that every head of state that visited Germany had to have one. And unlike President Chirac, I rather enjoyed mine, though I have to also add that it may be some time before I order another one as it was so substantial! I also have to confess that I left most of the sauerkraut uneaten as I hate the stuff, but then I always do this anywhere where they serve it (except for Borchardt).<br><br> I didn&#39;t recognise any of the German wines but the restaurant had federweiss (fermented grape juice, 10% alcohol) and we had that instead though it was rather expensive at 4,50 Eur per little glass.<br><br> Unlike the problems experienced by the other reviewers, I have to say that service was perfectly fine, although a little slow. Perhaps chatting politely to the staff and expressing genuine interest in the many (many) Swabian dishes helped. Speaking German also helps although they have an English menu (which we didn&#39;t need).<br><br> The atmosphere is pretty OK - it&#39;s not too fancy but it was pretty packed with Germans and very few tourists and everyone looked like they were enjoying themselves.<br><br> Anyway, I will definitely be back here to sample more authentic Swabian dishes here - it is different from the rather greasy and heavy local food in Berlin which I am not too fond of.<br><br> And one thing I would recommend is to try the dishes with the names you have never heard of. Who would have thought that the Swabians do snails so much better than the French? My friend had the tripe and that was also sensational, as good as the best tripola de Firentina in Florence.",

"reviewcomment":"Eng:<br>We went here without knowing anything about it other than that is an Italien place. And we were really surprised by everything. The restaurant is really cozy and the atmosphere is very authentic italian. The whole staff spoke italian to each other and there was a lot of local italian guests there as well. Which is always a good sign. <br>The food was fantastic.  Rustic italian style, no pizzas but alot of different pastas and salads and couple of fish and meat dishes... They also have a great vine selection, all Italian of cause :) <br>This place is highly recommendable<br><br>Dk:<br>Vi vidste ikke rigtig så meget som stedet da vi tog her til, ud over at det var italiensk mand. Men vi blev virkelig overrasket.<br>Restauranten var rigtig hyggelig, med en meget autentisk italiensk atmosfære. Alle bordene havde rødternet dug og et lille sterinlys, og vægene var rå mursten. Personalet snakkede italiensk til hinanden, og der var en del lokale italienere der for at spise (hvilket altid er et godt tegn).<br>Maden var fantastisk; rustik italiensk stil. De har ingen pizza, men der er en masse forskelliige pasta retter og lækre salater, og et par fiske- og kød retter (som viste bliver skiftet ud fra dag til dag). Det har også et ret fint vinkort, men noget for en hver smag, de er selvfølgelig allesammen italienske.<br>Dette sted er meget anbefalelsesværdigt!",

Es gibt immer wieder andere Sorten aber es ist immer was nach meinem Geschmack dabei :)<br>Ab und zu gibt es auch ziemlich abenteuerliche Sorten, z.B neulich Schafskäse  schmeckt erstaunlicherweise recht lecker (durfte mal problieren). Hätte ich nicht gedacht, aber so lange es meine Lieblingssorten gibt, bleibe ich bei denen.<br>Das der Besitzer unhöflch ist, kann ich nicht bestätigen.

"reviewcomment":"Well.... so much potential, so much FAIL.<br><br>Now, granted I visited midweek in October so there were no festivals or concerts happening... but really. A site of this cultural significance has to attract more than just German speaking people to its walls... the local history museum had some really interesting artifacts, but I couldn&#39;t figure out what most of them were.<br><br>Wins: The Julius tower. You can climb to the top and see some nice views. The art exhibit in Bastion Kronprinz was great (although WHY you need to buy a ticket to a show where the work is FOR SALE is beyond me). Nice space. Sadly, the nicest part of the whole complex.<br><br>Haus 4 apparently has a number of artisans and a theater inside, they were mostly closed (not that I blame them - little or no traffic). Good use of the space and I&#39;m sure a great place when its a bit more &#39;happening&#39;. The glass artisans were in, and they have nice work - and were actually working. A musical instrument shop is also there, and a photo gallery.<br><br>Fail Bits: So many parts of the place are closed off or locked up tight. Even the walk way from Bastion Kronprinz to Bastion Brandenburg shows as part of the designated path, but was closed Seriously? Lame.<br><br>The collection of statues from the Avenue of Victory was amazing - but, sadly locked away behind a fence where you couldn&#39;t see most of them. WTF? The coolest stuff was unreachable.<br><br>Also: Up on Bastion Konig were two markers, seemingly grave stones - no info, no explanation. Seriously people, step it up a bit.<br><br>There is a restaurant, no idea if its any good.<br><br>The staff seemed truly bored.<br><br>I&#39;m not unhappy about visiting, I&#39;m just unhappy that the experience was so lackluster. Could have been awesome.",

We already had dinner, so all we did was drink beer. <br><br>They brew their own beer, and as with every German brewery, they only serve a pils, a hefeweizen, a dark beer, and some other special brew. Nothing else. Egal, purity laws aside, I do like their brews. <br><br>I took the four-beer sampler, which is basically 0,1 liter each of the four brews that are currently available. I enjoyed them very much, and it was very palatable and smooth to the touch. I just wish that they did more varieties than those allowed by draconian beer laws. But I suppose that&#39;s not the brewery&#39;s problem.<br><br>I won&#39;t mind going back here again for a beer. They also offer German pub food: it looked mouth-watering, but I was too full to eat at that time.",

"reviewcomment":"This review is based on my wonderful time spent at Rivabar in Berlin back in 2007.<br><br>As I walked through Dircksenstrasse on a Thursday evening in an attempt to explore the Hackesher Markt district, the inconspicuous and intriguing facade of Riva immediately caught my attention. It was one of the top bars recommended by various users of &#34;ASW&#34; (aSmallWorld). After exploring the various nooks and crannies of the area, my instincts led me back to the doorsteps of Riva. As I walked inside the place, I was immediately drawn by its minimalist yet brightly painted ceilings. The fixtures were simple and hip, the layout ultra functional and the vibe simply jiving with a sort of strange energy. I settled myself by the bar and immediately ordered a nice full bodied glass of red. The very amiable bartender, Andrea, informed me right away that a book reading was to take place, sort of forewarned me that a sullen hour or two would take place prior to any sort of bacchalian festivities. I was happy! I love lectures and any form of cultural immersion, albeit the fact that the reading was in Deutsch, it was an extra treat to find out the writer was an Italian giallo writer. The night simply rolled perfectly. The wonderful lecture, the post-partying with the publicists and the staff, meeting Bruno Morchio the writer, while enjoying the hospitality of Andrea and meeting the owner, Stefan. I had a few glasses of reds and enjoyed the prosciutto di Parma with olives appetizers that Andrea served, on the house.<br><br>The crowd was jubilant, very cosmopolitan and hip, yet very worldly in an intellectual and cultural way. Something that I so much needed, given the grungy culture of my city of residence, San Francisco, California. I left after a few hours for an Italian dinner at a nearby Trattoria. However, in the process, I met a couple of business folks whom I dragged back to Riva. <br><br>Our evening ended at Riva! This time around music was jivin and Andrea the chef bartender was such a blast! He must be the best bartender, evah, in the world. When in Berlin, Riva bar is a MUST! It represents the character of this bustling, energetic, artsy and edgy city ... Berlin, Berlin! and Riva, is the hippest city and bar ... in the continental Europe, and perhaps even in the globe! <br><br>I still manage to paint a nostalgic smile whenever I remember that evening.<br><br>.....<br><br>Thus far, I think this place is still a hit!",

"reviewcomment":"Probably the best value for money in terms of fun with your friends! Hundreds if not thousands of games on shelves surrounding us we grabbed a seat and played Smallworld - stayed there for hours and paid the what seems to be a symbolic amount for their time. <br>The keeper was very caring and attentive, went long lengths to help us find what we wanted and knew the shop perfectly (&#34;oh, Smallworld? It&#39;s right between the two Zug Zug over there&#34;, it was behind a box - no way he could have seen that!) <br>The place sells light drinks and beer for a decent price, and stays open until you finish your game (as long as you&#39;re in your finishing rounds of course!) <br>I would recommend this to anyone playing games from Jenga to Eclipse, it&#39;s a lot of fun with any amount and types of friends! Definitely coming back!",

"reviewcomment":"Since becoming interested in ancient Egypt during the fifth grade, I&#39;ve read stories about the discovery of artifacts at Amarna, ancient Akhetaten, by German archeologists. I&#39;ve seen pictures of them in books for decades, and have even had the chance to see some in person when I saw the Pharaohs of the Sun exhibit at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art in 2000. But my dream had always been to see these and other finds from ancient Egypt in Berlin. I recently got the chance to do just that when my girlfriend and I visited Germany.<br><br>The museum&#39;s Egyptian collection is extensive, covering all periods. I&#39;m partial to the pieces from the New Kingdom. Like many Egyptophiles, I&#39;m fascinated by the short, enigmatic Amarna period, and the Neues Museum has many pieces found at Amarna.<br><br>The museum also holds Classical pieces, but Greek and Roman culture and history don&#39;t interest me as much as ancient Egypt, so we only gave that part of the museum a perfunctory visit.<br><br>The lighting in the museum is generally good, and I took many high-quality pictures. The exception was in the dimly-lit room containing the iconic Nefertiti bust, which was guarded by men at each door and one inside the room, all making sure you didn&#39;t try to take a photograph.<br><br>If you&#39;re staying in Berlin for several days and plan on visiting this and other museums on Museum Island, I highly recommend purchasing a Berlin WelcomeCard with Museum Island. This card lets you ride the cities ample public transportation (buses, street cars, and the metro), gives you 25% to 50% discounts at various places, and lets you into the museums on Museum Island. The three-day card costs €38.50.",

They quickly checked to make sure to see if this was a recognized problem by Apple, which it was and so we got the repairs for free. They took a week to turn things around, which seemed completely reasonable and rang us several times to give updates on progress. In addition to repairs the store offers a full selection of Apple products, and there is even a Einstein coffee bar upstairs in case you want an additional caffeine jolt to accompany the eye candy on display.<br><br>Bottom-line: If you Apple product is sick, this is a good place to go.",

Gorgonzola Club definitely tops the list.<br><br>Terrace seating out front, romantic dark interior with a lot of space, and a lovely little garden terrace nestled in the back of the restaurant. The menu was extensive - pasta, pizzas, main dishes, appetizers, etc. <br><br>We started the meal with a glass of Prosecco and a plate of bruschetta. The bruschetta is a bit different than the stale toasts topped with tomatoes that many are used to, instead it comes out looking a bit like a pizza and tasting a lot like heaven. A thin dough topped with juicy tomatoes, olive oil and tons of garlic. Don&#39;t skip it! <br><br>Next, I had the seafood pasta which was one of the daily specials. I received a large portion of spaghetti in red sauce filled with the tiniest, sweetest clams, shrimp, squid, and so on. The dish was delicious. <br><br>I also tried a bite of pizza that a friend ordered - it was very tasty. <br><br>We finished the meal with an espresso. The food was on-point and memorable. The service was also impeccable.<br><br>Whether you&#39;re in the area or not, Gorgonzola Club is worth a visit!",

Once purchased, I was able to print out an e-ticket, which included the departure platform for my journey, which wasn&#39;t due to take place for a few weeks! This negated the massive scrum that results from English train journeys where you have a mass of anxious commuters staring at departure boards in stations and then surging through the tiny gate when the information flashes up on the board<br><br>My numbered seat was easy to find on-board and it was nice that the announcements were all made in English as well as German. I paid a little extra for a first class seat and it was very comfortable. The only small issue was that i thought the coffee the conductor was offering me was free as part of the first class service but it turned out I had to pay for it<br><br>The journey was fast and it was nice to see something of the German countryside flash past. Both stations in Berlin and Cologne were impressive and well signposted<br><br>Deutsche Bahn, come to the UK if the Germans don&#39;t want you!",

"reviewcomment":"As everyone has already said, the real secret to dining here while still holding onto some of your money is to come for lunch. I had a lovely experience here. They have a great online reservation system with an easy interface so I highly recommend that.<br><br>I ordered a 2 course meal for 35 euros. The main cost driver here is definitely drinks... I ordered water (stupid, should have just gotten tap water) which was 10 euros which is completely absurd, and a riesling by the glass (11 euros). The riesling was good for sure, but 11 euros for a few sips? uhhh no. Not a fan. <br><br>For the meal itself, I ordered the onsen egg because I&#39;ve never had one before and the skate wing. Both were excellent and I was more than pleased. My favorite part of the meal was definitely the amuse bouche though--always fun for me. When I went, it was an asparagus puree with king prawn mmmm delicious. The onsen egg was great--I didn&#39;t know what it was which is why I ordered it. It turned out to basically be a soft boiled egg that was fried on the outside. I don&#39;t even want to imagine how difficult that probably is to cook. It was on top of a potato puree with various mushrooms mixed in and then complemented with a nice lobster bisque. Great starter.<br><br>My main course was the skate wing which I&#39;ve always never had before and I&#39;m definitely a fan after this meal. Perfectly cooked and really well-seasoned, I was really pleased with it.<br><br>The service is precisely what you would expect from your standard double MIchelin. They were there when they needed to be and not there when they didn&#39;t need to. They were knowledgable about the food, and just polite and friendly. I am quite the fan.<br><br>Definitely a little torn on the rating here. For sure 5-star food but the drinks tab is really ridiculous, and I wasn&#39;t mind blown by anything here. When I go to a double or triple Michelin, I&#39;m really looking to have my mind-blown. Everything is great here, but nothing is spectacular or anything. <br><br>tldr; if you want to experience a double michelin for a cheaper price, come at lunch for a very reasonably priced lunch menu; avoid getting water though unless you want to dump 10 euros for it!",

The french breakfast (including crepes) and the italian (lots of good quality mozarella) are particularly good.<br><br> We often meet friends here because the food is good, the staff are quick and friendly and it&#39;s big enough that you can usually find a seat. Being on a corner it&#39;s also great for people watching on a sunny day.<br><br> Another bonus is that they&#39;re happy to serve big glasses of leitungswasser (tap-water), with ice too if you&#39;re lucky.

They were also serving a &#39;fest&#39; beer which I can vouch for, having drunk it somewhere else (<a href='/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.qype.co.uk%2Fplace%2F1866-Tiergartenquelle-Berlin&amp;s=17ba9b0a508bdcdcc473b5cde3efe630a89c8d12c20f7bdee0c821891a25b441' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>qype.co.uk/place/1866-Ti…</a>) . The one thing that was lacking to my mind was the option to order some kind of &#39;Bierprobe&#39; so that you can try all of their beers. They serve good smelling food.<br><br> The building is an ingenious use of railway arches.

I tried their currywurst (€8), which tasted fine but wasn&#39;t particularly memorable. Washed it down with a konig hefeweizen (€3). The menu also has pizza and pasta, a few German specialties, etc.<br><br>I split a tiramisu with my dining partner afterward, which was fine.<br><br>The inside of the restaurant is massive and well-decorated with a real &#34;pub&#34; feel. Bathrooms are located downstairs and are clean, with a number of stalls so you don&#39;t have to wait in line.<br><br>The best part of the restaurant is the outdoor seating, location, and atmosphere.

It&#39;s a great location to pass a few hours resting after a long day of shopping nearby before heading in for the night.",

The space is intimate but still not too small. The price is always right. The atmosphere is fantastic, and the people who work there and go there are lovely folks. Although the shows are earlier than most venues, it&#39;s nice to have some kind of consistency to rely upon.<br><br>Keep supporting this place because it does a lot of good things for Berlin music.",

"reviewcomment":"This is an amazing little restaurant! I grabbed takeaway from here my first night in Berlin and it was so amazing I decided to grab lunch here before I left. <br><br>It came out to less than 25 euros for 2 beers, the daily fish and spinach lasagna special, and a grilled salmon platter. The dishes were huge! Each platter comes with a small salad and the grilled salmon had a side of potatoes and garlic bread too. We sat inside but we noticed servers bringing dishes outside and to the right; not sure if there is a bigger dining room nearby? It&#39;s great watching your food get cooked and staring at the fresh seafood but the only caveat about sitting inside is you will leave smelling like grilled fish.<br><br>Another thing is that they accepted my credit card the first night but not the second time I went even though my bill was higher the second time around. Not sure if they only accept credit cards in the evenings or if it depends on your server?",

"reviewcomment":"On my fifth day in Berlin, I ate at the Massai !<br><br>One star for the look : The Massai is an African restaurant. From the outside, you can totally get this feeling. Once inside, you have travelled in an instant to Africa. The waiters are dressed with a white african-like uniform and the menu are... How can I say ? When the menu arrived at the table, I thought there were severals XD Not. Actually, it is a fully binded book and each page is really thick. It looks like the menu has been carved in wood. Really funny, I would like to be the waiter with a table for 4 ! :D<br><br>One star for the food : I asked for an Antelope meat. One the menu there was no specification about the rest. Just that there would be wild rice and vegetables. I had a soup as a started, which I had not ordered. It was OMG delicious. They I had my plate. When I say plate, I should say PLATE: I had never seen such a huge plate, could barely stand on the table. On this plate I had the meat, perfectly cooked, some vegies in some kind of coconut shell, some beans in another shell, some wild rice kept warm under another shell. I cannot really explain how good it warm. It was just... Beautiful ! If you want to try this dish, look at the section Cap Special of the menu and Antelop meat.<br><br>One star for the people : Really nice and helpful AND fast !<br><br>One star for the presentation : Every plate, bowl, is decorated with African designs and the word MASSAI. Really exotic :)<br><br>Anything else to add ? I have not put a five star, though I would really like to, because my friend thought it was way too spicy. And it was not actually specified on the menu that it would be that much. If you are in Berlin, think of my recommandation and Enjoy !",

Polite strangers, but strangers. Then the food came. It was AMAZING. Hands down the best Vietnamese food I&#39;ve had in Berlin, maybe the best food I&#39;ve had in Berlin. Fresh basil and lemon grass, just the right amount of sauce, chicken breast recognizable as chicken breast. I forgot where I was until the last drop was gone. I don&#39;t know when I&#39;ll go back--people were literally lined up to wait for a seat at one of the small tables--but I was there between twelve and one. Maybe it&#39;s less crowded later in the day? If it weren&#39;t for the crowds, I would go back again in a second.",

It&#39;s one of those places you have to find deep in your guide book, but when  you do find it, you are more than impressed.  It&#39; was fantastic.  <br><br>My friends and I decided to head here after reading about it in Lonely Planet, and when we walked in, we were hit with the GREAT smells! It smelled like heaven.  There are a LOT of great Indian options from Naan Pizza to thali to dosa.  I tried the naan pizza with olive tapenade, parm cheese, and arugala - and it was HUGE. The serving sizes here are really big for the price (great bang for your buck).  I even took mine home and finished it the next day. <br><br>Definitely trek here if you can - but be warned, it&#39;s a tiny space!",

"reviewcomment":"I eat here every time I go to Berlin. I recommend everyone who visits to check it out.<br><br>Having heard great reviews, we went over for Sunday brunch only to be greeted by staff that became even ruder when we didn&#39;t have a reservation. (Having just learned about Kopps and not knowing the culture of German brunch I feel is a good excuse.) They gave a reservation for a couple hours later so we had a wander around. When we returned, we were still treated poorly, despite having a reservation. <br><br>And then the chef came out. He was so nice, took us to our table personally (much to the chagrin of the front of house) and melted all of our foreign fears away. Once he left however, we were never spoken to again by the staff and had to get water ourselves by asking at the bar.<br><br>But on to the main bit: The Food! Vegan, traditional German food I wanted, and they delivered! A magnificent spread of all sorts of homemade food. Breads, jams, dips, creamy potato salads, &#34;meat&#34; boards, soup, so much more... I was surprised to see it was very heavy in replacement products; fake meat, fake mayo, fake egg, etc. I love that stuff, but I know many people who aren&#39;t. I think I went to the buffet 5 times. It was spectacular. <br><br>I also went back for a normal lunch with the omnivorous hubby, and he declared it &#34;was the best meal I&#39;ve had in a long time.&#34; He had the lunch special, which that day was fresh tomato soup, spaghetti, and wild green salad. I had the walnut and mushroom ravioli which were out of this world!!! The staff were a bit nicer, and respectfully spoke slower German to us rather than eye-rolling and reverting to English.<br><br>Positives:<br>FANTASTIC FOOD<br>The price is right<br>Great ambiance<br>Casual for lunch but nice enough for a date<br>The chef CARES!<br><br>Negative:<br>staff doesn&#39;t seem to care that much<br>The chocolate cake dessert is so disappointing, I didn&#39;t finish it (even with two peoples help)<br><br>Summary: Don&#39;t forget to RSVP!

Adnan always greats everybody warm and friendly, no matter you are a VIP or no name guest. Kitchen is italian cuisine, always with a twist and really, really fresh. Fish, seafood and pasta are my favourites - no matter as a grilled, sauteed or raw dish! Try to also have a slice of the crispy and really thin homemade pizza together with your starter (share it with your, as it&#39;s too big in size). It&#39;s not a Michelin awarded restaurant, waiters are very &#34;casual&#34; - kind of cantine style restaurant. Don&#39;t try to get super correct and attentive service - that&#39;s not the way Adnan works!",

The lake is nice and clear for swimming or just rent a boot and take a sun bath in the middle of the lake defo highlight of the long summer months. <br>It&#39;s easy accessible via U-bahn from U-Bahn Krumme Lanke or via the S-Bahn from the Stop Schlachtensee. <br>Only recommendation don&#39;t stay right at the big lawn next to the SBahn stop its getting overcrowded and the Lake has way nicer little spot if you just start walking around it ;)",

"reviewcomment":"Foodie fun on Thursday nights!  But get there early as many choices sell out.  We were victims of our own late arrival and indecision...we ended up liking our Oma Marie pies alright, and were suprised to meet our vendor from Virginia, USA, but wished we would have had time to sample more of the yumminess that it looks like we missed.  Quite a wide variety of cuisine...wanted to try more but had not the time.  Be sure to stock up on plenty of euro as the venue is cash only from what we could tell.<br><br> I LOVED our hand-crafted Gin Fizz from the bar to the right as soon as you walk in the door...the one with the sign that says &#34;Bar&#34; above it.  Wow!!! Best Gin Fizz I have ever had in a thirty-year drinking career.  (Then again, maybe it was just the fact that I wanted some ICE after a week in Berlin and this was the best way to obtain some giant, perfect ice cubes!)  <br><br>Event attracts all ages - tourists, locals, families, singles - and appears to be a great gathering place for friends to meet for food and drink.  Go enjoy!",

It&#39;s small and very cute - flamboyant interior with pink wall paper and a very queer decor. The waiter was very nice, and spoke English. The menu was bilingual. I had the roast beef, which is nothing like US roast beef - it was a delicious filet! It came with frites and a beautiful salad that was a delight. I had a beer with it. They have a nice patio, and the restaurant as a whole can probably fit about 20 people. <br><br>A cute, off the beaten path treat!",

We set outside right by the river and just enjoyed people watching and the boats go by. The waitress was really friendly but that place is a little understaffed! She definitely could use some help but definitely did her best to accommodate us. Also what I found interesting is she took our order on an iphone!

Also like Koernerpark, the pond/fountain is below street level, so traffic noise is minimal.<br><br> I sat here today, enjoyed a yummy toast and Bionade, while listening to the fountains and watching two turtles sunbathe on the small rocks at the edge of the Cafe&#39;s deck.<br><br> The menu is limited, but service was good (possibly less so if filled to capacitythere are quite a few tables, although only about 8 on the prime deck area in front of the cafe itself -- which is, interestingly, formed from several joined metal containers, such as you would find at a construction site).<br><br> Although not as lushly planted as some other urban nature spots, I highly recommend Engelbecken for a respite from sirens, S-bahn rumblings, and traffic noise.",

So my task was to find a place that is vegan-friendly, near the Pankow area, and open for breakfast at 9:00 AM, as we only had a two-hour window to meet, due to other imposing constraints. I found this one.<br><br>I found the shop very welcoming, and very clean. I arrived when they were still not open, and the staff was already hard at work arranging the fresh flowers they put on the tables, and so forth. When we entered, we found a table by the end of the room, and they gave us menus. English menus are also available, which my companion appreciated very much.<br><br>I ordered the spinach omelette, which came with a side salad, as well as a pair of English muffins that had some pesto spread on it. They were all vegetarian, and very tasty. I also ordered a Milchkaffee, which was very well-made.<br><br>I am not a vegetarian anymore, but at least I know there are good options like these in the city.

You should be able to just walk right in. But you&#39;d be entirely wrong. Hit up the website and click on &#34;RESERVIERUNG&#34; in the menu.<br><br>Now, how do you actually find the place? I&#39;m pretty sure a disgruntled hipster wizard cast a spell on this place to make it nigh un-findable. The quick version is to simply enter the park from the Görlitzer Bahnhof U-Bahn station and it&#39;ll be the very first building you approach if you keep to the path. Enter on the right side.<br><br>The mini-golf itself, once you manage to snag a reservation and get yourself inside, is pretty damn fun. It&#39;s black-lit with 3D and makes for a super fun experience with friends. At only 6.50 EUR, it&#39;s also a bargain for 1-2 hours of sweaty, eye-straining excitement.<br><br>Not that it doesn&#39;t come without its caveats. The staff, well it would be kind to say they&#39;re simply curt. Your experience may vary from general indifference to downright rudeness. The maintenance of the holes themselves is also merely a suggestion. The last four holes will make you angry at the world.",

"reviewcomment":"Hohenschönhausen used to not even be marked on maps - it was that secret. Today you can take guided tours around the eerie buildings. Still and quiet except for the various groups, it all comes to chilling life when tales of it&#39;s history are recited. It is the background to the confession scenes in the film The Lives of Others. The idea of it alone is terrifying. And yet there we stood, on a fairly sunny day, listening to a young American woman tell us about the atrocities that occurred here.<br><br>The place is now a museum and memorial located in Berlin&#39;s north-eastern Lichtenberg district. It was opened in 1994 on the site of the main prison of the former East German Communist Ministry of State Security, better known as the Stasi.<br><br>The memorial was founded in the early 1990s by former inmates. We heard that former prisoners occasionally give the tours. We were on the English tour and a young American woman gave our tour and was a wealth of information.<br><br>Highly recommend this historic site.",

This mcfit subsidiary especially is quite nice as it is a kind of test branch for new services, maybe as it is nearby the companies headquarter. There are eg lockers used with the key card, nice decoration of the place or key card accessible food and drink machines. The place is well kept, its clean and machines are mostly working. The folks are nice due to its siruation in prenzlauer berg. The only dusadvantage is that it is quite crowded in peak times. But here again 24/7 gives plenty space to switch to less popular slots",

"reviewcomment":"Checkpoint Charlie has become a somewhat tacky tourist spot since the fall of the wall and although the nearby museum is quite informative visiting the site is not as sobering an experience as a visit to Bernauer Strasse.<br><br> Bernauer Strasse became famous during the first days of the wall (which initially in 1961 consisted of the buildings on one side of this street) as people jumped out of the windows of apartment buildings onto the pavement in West Berlin. In some cases human tugs of war erupted as East German guards leaned out of windows as they struggled to hold onto people being pulled to freedom from West Berliners standing on the path below. (The world&#39;s media witnessed much of this drama.) As well as these escapes it was also the location of a tunnel through which 57 people escaped and was where Conrad Schumann, an East German soldier, made his iconic leap over barbed wire.<br><br> In time this ramshackle wall was replaced with the most famous incarnation that was finally toppled in 1989. On Bernauer Strasse this could only be achieved by demolishing large numbers of houses (in a city that still had a shortage of housing after so much lay in ruins in 1945) along one side of the street and, eventually, a large church.<br><br> This is also the sole surviving section (albeit partially reconstructed) of the border defences. Visit Bernauer Strasse and view the wall from the nearby viewing platform and the incongruity of this lethal border running through a suburb is.<br><br> Although the site is still somewhat rough around the edges more permanent visitor centre buildings are apparently in the planning stages.",

"reviewcomment":"I fell so-so about this thai/vietnamese restaurant. The inside decor is rather bland-generic, but there&#39;s hope upon seeing the kitchen. It could serve authentic enough food, but it doesn&#39;t. The food wasn&#39;t bad, mind you, it just ended up being your generic germanized thai imbiss. We ordered two different curries and couldn&#39;t tell them really apart, besides than one had mushrooms. I still give it 4 stars, because I still enjoyed it and the service was friendly, though I secretly know that as soon as this place shop for the night, these people make the best possible thai food and eat it all themselves. Why not serve it to the public? Surely, germans are ready for it?!",

"reviewcomment":"We were on our to a different bar around the area that was pretty crowded... I opened up yelp and this one shows up!<br>This place is quite cool, maybe because I was tipsy I didn&#39;t really figure out where the door is - but we made it. <br>So here we are - the bar is a big hall with quite a lot of tables, there&#39;s music in the background but it&#39;s not too loud so you can speak to your friends, my friend was in charge of bringing us the drinks but prices were quite average and quick service... When I went to the bathroom (that needed some cleaning) I was happy find out they have pinball, fuss-ball table and (ta-ta-taaaa) a pool table! <br>The atmosphere feels just right and a there is an interesting mixture of people - from metal heads to party people, but I guess all of us need the occasional drink :)",

"reviewcomment":"Paying for a city tour? What for? There is a great alternative for the regular price  Bus number 100.<br><br> Start at the Alexanderplatz and go to the Zoo (which is worth visiting too, though it&#39;s another story).<br><br> With the 2.10 Euro ticket you trip can last up to 2 hours which means that you can get out at any stop and proceed your journey with the next bus. And for 6.30 Euro you can travel Bus, S-Bahn and U-Bahn in the zones A and B the whole daylong.<br><br> Anyway if you start at Alexanderplatz, you will drive past the <br>TV tower,<br>Lustgarten &amp; Museumsinsel / Museums island,<br>Berliner Dom,<br>Humboldt-University,<br>and State Opera (from which it&#39;s just a 5 Minute walk to one of the most beautiful Berliner squares  Gendarmenmarkt).<br><br> You will see almost the whole Unter den Linden street.<br><br> The bus will stop right in front of the Reichstag, from which you can walk to the Brandenburger Tor, Pariser Platz and the Memorial For the Murdered Jews of Europe.<br><br> From the bus you will catch the sight of the <br>Bundeskanzleramt,<br>Haus der Kulturen der Welt/ House of the Cultures of the World,<br>Schloss Bellevue,<br>Siegessäule/ Victory Column,<br>and Kaiser-Wilhelm-Gedächtniskirche/ Memory Church.<br><br> Mind that most times of the day the bus is as full with people as a cucumber with seeds. No wonder as for many tourists it is the best way to explore Berlin.<br><br> Take the S-Bahn to get back to the Alexanderplatz and to enjoy a couple of nice views of Berlin or may be to get out at the Hackescher Markt for a relaxing beer in one of the hundrends of street cafes. <br>Yes, afther the 100 Bus journey you definitely deserve a beer!",

"reviewcomment":"This supermarket is a need to know! <br><br>Why do you need to know it...because it&#39;s open every day from 9am till 10pm?<br><br>NOOOOOO...because it is open on Sundays, Bank Holidays and even Christmas Day and Boxing Day! <br><br>You know it makes sense to memorise this place.  The times it has saved my arse on a public holiday is untrue. You know what it&#39;s like, you have guests coming around, and you are humming away in the kitchen cool as a cucumber, totally in control then BAM!!!  That one essential ingredient you forgot to buy.<br><br>I only live two U-Bahn stations away so it&#39;s not such a hassle but seriously where else can you go on Christmas Morning to find ingredients.  It&#39;s quite a sizeable store and has a huge fresh fruit and vegetables section, fresh bread, Lots of international food items,  toiletries in case you didn&#39;t get enough loo roll to accommodate last minute guests moving in over the holiday period.  <br><br>PLUS they have an ok selection of crisps! When I first got to Berlin I trotted off to the supermarket in search of crisps. Well, it was like I had entered the twilight zone. Where on earth could you find a huge long aisle of crisps... all different brands but all Paprika Flavoured! If you just arrived from the UK you will soon know what I mean!<br><br>Usually when I come here, it is on a public holiday so I am like a headless chicken running around stressing out if they have the right size parsnips if any at all... So it&#39;s also handy that there is a large booze section, for medicine purposes you understand, calming of the nerves and so forth!<br><br>Easy to get too, being right next to Zoo Station. So next Sunday when you found that you have run out of spuds for your Sunday roast, this could be the place for you!<br><br>Prices are average to a little over average, but cheaper than going to the nearest Spätkauf which probably is only good for drinks and snacks anyway.<br><br>I gave it 4 stars because it&#39;s like the ER of grocery shopping to me, a real life saver!",

The room was much larger than I&#39;d expected (based on experience in other hostels), and it was well furnished with plenty of storage. Totally exceeded my expectations (which weren&#39;t exactly low, given the standard set by our last stay here).<br><br>And the staff is still as nice as ever. I&#39;d forgotten that unlike many hostels, here they don&#39;t demand money the minute you walk through the door but instead let you settle in first. The cafe downstairs looks to have been updated, and with the 80-plus degree weather this time around, we were able to enjoy the outdoor space as well.<br><br>It&#39;s no secret that I want to come back to Berlin as often as possible, and I wouldn&#39;t think of staying anywhere else if I come back.",

"reviewcomment":"From afar, the Tempodrom looks like a magical place. But as you come closer, the magic fades away and is replaced by concrete. So was my experience when I visited the venue for the first time just last week; it&#39;s facade just wasn&#39;t that interesting to me. And in general, I tend to be skeptical of larger concert venues.<br><br>However, Tempodrom really does deliver, as well as make the saying &#34;don&#39;t judge a book by its cover&#34; ring true. The inside is big, with plenty of room to navigate. The entrance itself is on a mezzanine-type level, with stairs up to the seats or down to the concert floor. There are plenty of bars, and though the prices are a bit more than smaller clubs, they still were less than I was expecting (for example, I paid €3,50 for a class of wine that is maybe a euro less at smaller spots). They also sell snack food, such as pretzels, which is kind of a nice touch.<br><br>The sound was also fine. Granted I didn&#39;t try out many spots in the room, but other than being loud (more the bands than the sound itself, thank goodness for earplugs), it was a pleasurable listening experience.",

The selection of newspapers in great (though German) and the variety of food is big- from croissants to special lunches served already at 11:30. <br>I especially like the breakfast which comes with cheese, ham, boloney and other meats. With some vegetables one can build a sandwich to fit their taste exactly. The fresh orange juice is very good and not expensive.<br>The employees are always nice and welcoming, and they also speak good English. <br>The location is especially nice on the weekend when there are no school boys and sitting outside on the sun is very relaxing. <br>They also have wi-fi, but you have to ask the waitress for the password.

"reviewcomment":"the price-performance balance in comparison to other restaurants in Berlin-Mitte = top<br>for around 5EUR you get a full warm meal + tea , what I think it is a nice deal.<br>The mango milk shake is very good, but I suggest the coconut- fresh ananas drink.<br>It&#39;s a very little restaurant with mostly quick service.<br>Basicly it is clean, but not perfekt.<br>Seems to be little trashy style  but nevertheless it has a KULT asian image!<br>Hope the quality keeps in that condition, so Berlin has a one more very nice little place to be.<br>Hope for everybody to profit of my suggestion.<br>Cheers",

"reviewcomment":"Shiso Burger is a place where you go when you want and interesting tasting burger. I have tried chilly lemon, bulgogi and teriyaki salmon burger- all great. And I think that the size of the burger is perfect, just enough of everything ( bread meat sauce etc).<br><br>I love that the burgers are with the Asian twist and you can order edamame beans as a side for your burger. The fries is Shiso burger are too oily for my taste:( <br><br>Sometimes you have to wait for the table pretty long, especially on the weekend. And you will most likely have to share the table with other people if it is just 2 of you. <br><br>The food will be at your table pretty fast though.

"reviewcomment":"We were staying at the nearby Radisson Blu hotel, and my girlfriend and I found this restaurant by Yelping a place within walking distance that serves traditional German/Berlin food. Two of the things I wanted to try in Berlin were a Berliner Weisse and Currywurst, and I was able to get both at Deponie Nr. 3.<br><br>The restaurant itself is attractively decorated. It sits under an S-Bahn line, so you&#39;ll hear the train zoom by every now and then. One part of the restaurant has tables and is quieter; the other part has benches and can get loud.<br><br>Berliner Weisse is a low-alcohol wheat beer, to which a flavoring is added. I ordered in German and was then asked &#34;rot oder grün?&#34; mean &#34;red or green?&#34; which confused me. It turns out that &#34;red&#34; is a raspberry syrup and &#34;green&#34; is a woodruff syrup. I got the red, which was very tasty, although it seemed funny to sip beer through a straw.<br><br>I wasn&#39;t sure I&#39;d like the Currywurst, but it was really good. Unlike later Currywurst I&#39;d eat, here at Deponie Nr. 3 I got one large, whole sausage, not small sausages cut into pieces. The curry-flavored ketchup is wonderful. Sweet at first, and then a few seconds later the curry flavor develops. It&#39;s flavorful but not too spicy, and goes extremely well with the accompanying fries.<br><br>My girlfriend got the Pilzpfanne or mushroom pan, which includes pork medallions, mushroom gravy with bacon, and roasted potatoes. This was very good, and had I not wanted the Currywurst might have been on my short list of options.<br><br>For dessert we got coffee and split an order of excellent Apfelstrudel with vanilla ice cream.<br><br>A very nice restaurant, and I&#39;d gladly eat there again if I had the chance.",

Although they have an extensive menu and two restaurants on the same freaking street, I choose to the go the smaller one closer to Simon-Dach. It&#39;s less crowded.<br><br> My husband and I have our preferences for thai food, so the stuff we don&#39;t get too often, stuff we don&#39;t cook, or stuff my parents didn&#39;t make are the stuff we order and eat. with that being said, I&#39;m very much into noodles and noodle soups. He gets the stir-fried types, pad woon sen . . I get wonton soups or noodle soups. Thai people are my favorite people for noodles. I know Pho food is noodle heavy, but it&#39;s often bland and requires you reaching for table condiments.<br><br> The wonton soup has another name which I don&#39;t know. But it was fresh and delicious and surprisingly filling. Wash it down with Lychee or Mango lassi / shake (Nahm Puhn) and you&#39;ve got yourself a typical meal for me. The papaya salad is also delicious, which of course is always an indicator of great thai food.<br><br> The neighborhood is great, so that&#39;s one more reason to draw you there.

When we went to the room, I could not believe how nice it was for only 99 EUR a night!  Everything was so new and clean. The only thing that&#39;s weird is there were only twin beds that we had to request to be pushed together.  But they put them together in such a way that there was no awkward uncomfortable middle gap.  The room has free bottled water and a coffee machine.  It&#39;s a 5 minute walk from Tiergarten Park and 15 minute walk from all the main areas of Berlin.  I definitely recommend staying here!",

"reviewcomment":"Delicious melt-in-your mouth Falafels and schwarma. Please do not miss your chance to try these delicious dishes. We ordered the Falafelteller and Schwarma im Brot (akin to a kebab/durum). The Falafelteller was so beautiful to look at; it came with a variety of sauces (one which I suspect was humus, yogurty sauce and a spicy sauce (my favourite)), tabouleh, chilli pepper, salad and boom-chicka-wow-wow crispy tasty Falafels. There was also a side serving of flat bread. Biting into one of the Falafels was heaven. Seriously, you have to try to it understand what I mean. The sauces were perfectly balanced. The schwarma was just as good. The meat was beautiful and tender and they added a little bit of fried potato so it felt like I was eating it with potato chips. Also, try the pfefferminze Tee. It comes with fresh mint leaves and this interesting looking thing  that I think may be a preserved lemon?? The tee was actually a bit sweet (i think the preserved lemon caused that) for me since I prefer pure pfefferminz. THE BEST PART IS THE PRICE- 3€ for the Schwarma im Brot and 5€ for the Falafelteller! Before I forget the place is quite small so you may struggle to get a seat. However, people are pretty courteous in that they don&#39;t take too long to finish their meals so others can have a spot.",

"reviewcomment":"I was super excited to come for multiple reasons. Firstly, I was stoked to finally have made it to a Yelp event, secondly I love exploring new restaurants, and thirdly I love Scandinavian food.<br><br>Munch&#39;s Hus is in an area I normally don&#39;t frequent that much, but it is super close to a U-Bahn stop, so getting here is really easy. The atmosphere of the restaurant is very cosy with Norwegian music playing in the background. The menu ranging is not big, but all the dishes sound delicious and the ones we had, all were able to keep up with our expectations. It took me some time to be able to decide, but with a beer in one hand and Elkblood (mixed drink from berries and vodka - oh god), I was finally able to make my decision. I went with the Kjottkaker, Norwegian meatballs (I am sure many of you know the Swedish/Ikea version of that Köttbullar). I received 3 massive hand-made meatballs, potatoes and cabbage. Everything was delicious and filled me up to the max. <br><br>The service at Munch&#39;s Hus was also great. Very attentive waiters, who were up to explaining everything, if we had any questions. The prices are also ok, considering the quality and service.<br><br>All in all, a great discovery and I will definitely be coming back at some point.",

"reviewcomment":"When my girlfriend and I were planning our trip to Germany, one of the things we decided to do in Berlin is ascend the iconic Berlin Television Tower. It&#39;s the tallest structure in Germany and the fourth-tallest in all of Europe.<br><br>Regular tickets are €12.50, but we got the VIP tickets for €19.50 instead, which turned out to be worth the extra cost. You ascend and descend the tower by way of relatively small elevators, and if the line is long, you&#39;ll have to wait many times for the elevator to come and go before it&#39;s your turn. The VIP tickets not only let us go to the front of the line and get on the next available elevator, they also got us a guaranteed window seat at the restaurant above the observation level.<br><br>The restaurant is 679 feet above the ground, and the view is indeed spectacular. The restaurant used to revolve once every hour, but the speed was doubled after renovation more than a decade ago. It was a lot of fun looking for and snapping pictures of our hotel, the museums on Museum Island, the Brandenburg Gate, and the Reichstag.<br><br>My girlfriend had the baked potato with roast beef and coffee in the restaurant, and I was still full from breakfast and lunch at Curry 36, so I only had cheesecake and coffee. I love cheesecake, but prefer the baked German- or New York-style version of the sweeter, moister American version on a graham-cracker crust. The cheesecake here was just perfect, as was the coffee. Unfortunately, this being Germany, there were no free refills on the coffee.",

"reviewcomment":"I&#39;ve eaten here a couple of times. Around 6-7 i would say. <br>I love their food, it&#39;s simple and delicious.<br><br>Their smoothies are a little boring, but i like their menucard detail where they tell you which smoothie is good for what, nice detail. <br><br>Their sushi is great! It&#39;s not the most creative or surprising sushi, but it&#39;s very good and satisfying. I could always eat their avocado-sushi, yum! And they have a little fun feature where you can select Kappa-rolls with either yellow, blue, pink, spotted or green, nori-wrapping, so cute.  <br><br>Last time i was there I got the Vegan duck in red curry. It was awesome! It could have used some more vegetables though, but other than that- Perfect. Very mild, with a nice red curry flavor, and the mockduck is so crispy and delicious! And with a smallish portion of rice, so you don&#39;t feel like they cheap out and make it 70% rice/30% other. The only thing it needed was more veggies. <br>The menu says that it&#39;s &#34;strong/Spicy&#34; which i wouldn&#39;t say, so be sure to tell them you want it extra &#34;scharf&#34; if that&#39;s what you&#39;re into :) <br><br>I&#39;ve gotta admit that i was close to bumping Papa nô down to a 3 because the service is bad, but the food is so nice. <br>The staff comes off lazy and uninterested in giving a good service. They are VERY impatient, and never smile. And they just call you when your food is ready even though it&#39;s a large restaurant with a pretty &#34;fancy&#34; look. <br>The person accompanying me on one of my visits does not speak or read german, and therefore made the mistake of looking in the &#34;only for take-out orders&#34;-fridge for a beer that he could buy. When the staff saw this all 3 started yelling at us in German, making it impossible for me to translate for him what he should do instead, pretty buttholish of them. <br><br>All in all<br>2 for the service<br>but 4 for the food :)",

It was like 9pm or something well past dinner, but November was aglow with orange light. There was no one inside but a waiter with a mysterious smile. He welcomed us in to a candle lit table. <br><br>My family and I ordered and shared quite a few dishes: some soups, schnitzel with chanterelles, whole grilled fish, a mushroom pasta, and a couple of desserts. The schnitzel was the best we had after several weeks in Germany, and the dish was pilled ridiculously high with delicious chanterelles. Everything about the plate exuded generosity and tastiness. <br><br>Mainly though, the reason I&#39;m back writing about this place now is because of the service. The guy probably kept the place open well past normal closing time for us, and was incredibly nice about everything.<br>At one point I commented that I really like the German beer mugs on this trip. At the end of the meal as we were standing up, he comes up to me with a new one from the bar and tells me to keep it as a little piece of Berlin. It&#39;s probably been almost two years now, but I still have the mug. Beer always seems to taste so much better in it",

"reviewcomment":"I decided to visit the Bode Museum during Christmas Day. Because of that perhaps, there weren&#39;t a lot of visitors in the museum, and it increased my enjoyment of the place, as there were no crowds. Three floors of classical sculpture and other art forms, ranging from Gothic to Renaissance, thus ate about 2 hours of my time.<br><br>The entrance costs 8 EUR for adults. You can get a deal if you plan on visiting other museums in the Museum Island by getting the day-ticket (or combi ticket, I am not sure), but since I was only planning on visiting the Bode Museum, I settled on the regular one. <br><br>Cameras are allowed, as long as flash is not used. Awesome! There are plenty of docents that watch almost every hall, but they are unintrusive. Bags must be checked in at the entrance area. And the museum is also well-equipped for visitors on wheelchairs. <br><br>The exhibits are plentiful, and will definitely eat up at least 2 hours of your time. There are plenty of benches around, if you want to rest a bit, or simply sit down and admire art hanging in front of you. In my opinion, the ratio of exhibit to &#34;white-space&#34; is well, and I didn&#39;t feel overwhelmed after my tour. <br><br>Finally, the restrooms are well-kept, swanky, and a pleasure to use. Indeed, it&#39;s a pleasurable location to have a bit of release after two hours of walking.",

"reviewcomment":"After landing in TXL and getting lost in the subway system, we rolled in here at 8pm on a Tuesday for our first Berlin meal. To cut to the chase, we were very satisfied. <br><br>The customers at the time almost filled one of the rooms although it seems like the restaurant is much much bigger than the one room we were in. The waiter was friendly and understanding of our lack of German ability and provided us with the English menu. We got the weiner schnitzel because we saw everyone else getting it, and another dish that involved a fried pork cutlet covered in gravy. <br><br>The rumors are true: the weiner schnitzel was enormous, and the other dish was pretty substantial. After awhile, the dishes became too heavy and repetitive, so I would suggest you share or order for the table. <br><br>A lovely first evening in Berlin, and I almost wanted to return for my last. Nothing too special, but solid nonetheless.",

"reviewcomment":"This is the only hotel I stayed at in Berlin so I have nothing to compare it to, but it had everything we needed and I would definitely stay here again. The location was in general walking distance of a lot of the sites, the river, and the main tourist road in Berlin. The rooms were clean and comfy. The bathroom was the same. The tapas bar in the lobby is definitely worth checking out. <br><br>The lone problem has to do with the wifi. It was for pay and only offered for 30-minutes a night. Which is not terrible, since you are on vacation, but it was spotty for us some of the time.",

Well, a bunch of drunk friends.<br>This is one of the best ways to enjoy karaoke anyway in my opinion, second time we went there was a booth hopping night, besides the big main stage you can enjoy private booths (that usually cost quite a lot) so we ended up going crazy with random people, singing awesome and weird songs, I&#39;d totally recommend taking one of the booths if you&#39;re in a group, it&#39;s a lot of fun!<br>And if not- join the crowd at the main stage, I had a really great time, this place has good vibes and funny people all around.",

"reviewcomment":"The first English review of Wirtshaus Hasenheide, I&#39;m honoured! And also feeling shameful that I don&#39;t speak German :( So I thought I&#39;d offer a tourist&#39;s view of this traditional German eatery. We had a supreme restaurant guide in the form of Svenja of course, who talked us through the menu with total efficiency and recommended what she thought would give us a well-rounded impression of German food. We were a table of one pescetarian, one meat-eater who hates mushrooms and one lady who was happy to have a little of everything, so we opted for three dishes to share.<br><br>Simple solution really, Svenja and I could partake the non-meat creamy cheesy pasta with crisped onions and mushroomy cheesy rosti option, she and my SO could share his meat dish as well as the pasta (he&#39;s the mushroom-hater, by the way) and that way everyone could have a bit of what they liked. Firstly we ordered drinks which were beers and wine, lovely enough and reasonably priced too, and when it came to ordering food we did get to that point where you feel horrendous for waving a member of staff over... but the wait was getting a little OTT and we were all very hungry little souls by this point.<br><br>Anyway, when the food came it did not disappoint. The mushrooms on the rosti had been cooked brilliantly, in that they offered none of that sliminess which indicates they&#39;ve been sweating in their own juices too long... rather they were tender, had bite to them and really retained the flavour of the dish. Yep, garlic to the max. Piles of melted cheese of course, as is requisite for the foodstyle, and oh, that melt in the mouth grated potato underneath! Heaven. The thick spaghetti noodles with the creamy cheese sauce were divine, and I did sneak a potato from the SO&#39;s plate but even they were full of bacon - that was one meaty dish! They even sliced the sausages in a really unusual style whereby they opened like flowers, or squids, much to his horror and my amusement.<br><br>The place is atmospheric and full of wood; you kind of feel like you&#39;re in a lodge. Overall it was an awesome start to our trip, the food was spot on and while the slow service did let it down somewhat it came with a friendly smile, so there&#39;s little to complain about really. A surprise winner, and I do want that rosti again... like right now, please.",

We ate soooo much that we were the whole next day still full. We tried the tasting platter and ordered the beef tartare on the side. I have been to a couple of Ethiopian restaurants, but the beef tartare at this restaurant was by far the best I have ever had. Prices are very good and portions more than generous.

"reviewcomment":"I was here the other day, having lunch with a friend I haven&#39;t seen since 1995. We were surprised that we both ended up living in Berlin, so we decided to meet up one day and have lunch together. We both work near Mitte, so after agreeing to meet near Checkpoint Charlie, we strolled around and found this Japanese restaurant. <br><br>As it was lunch, they had lunch set menus, so we both opted for the Menu A, which included 8 nigiri sushi, 6 pieces of maki sushi, a couple of other pieces, and miso soup. I paired mine with green tea, as usual. My meal cost about 15 EUR, which, as far as I can tell, is on the higher side, but I think with this one, I am willing to pay for that. Here&#39;s why.<br><br>First, I loved the soup. Miso soup sounds so easy to make, but if you mess up the ingredients, then it&#39;ll fail. They know what they&#39;re doing. The subtle taste of the soup was great. Second, the fish was on the fresh side. No, it&#39;s not glistening fresh, but it will do. I also liked the way they flavored the eel, with just the right amount of sweetness. <br><br>Overall, this is a good sushi place, at least, better than the others I have encountered. I am fine giving them 4 stars, which means that I am comfortable bringing people to lunch here. Probably not for dinner, but it will do for a lunch meeting or something similar.",

The atmosphere is very pleasant and thankfully it&#39;s not so dirty here :D Also they have a two hour free wifi session for the customers, which works super great-you don&#39;t even need a password.

"reviewcomment":"Disappointing. I&#39;m beginning to doubt the ratings that I see on Qype. How can this place receive 4 out of 5 stars??? First, I was not pleased that the cashier upselled me from a simple 4 Euro Dürüm, to an Adana plate for 8 Euros. When they served the dish and I told them I wanted a Dürüm, the server simply waived off the comment stating that Adana is better. The Adana was generic, no spices to distinguish itself from any other Kebab from different Mediterranean countries. But it was worsened by 3 sauces: a sweet crossbreed of Mexican salsa/ketchup, Thousand Island, and ranch dressing. I realize that Döner began in Germany, but this sort of fast food fusion is not hitting the right note. The rice was plain and lifeless, the salad not super fresh. The faux decor of this restaurant imagines itself to be greater than what it really is: a cheap fast food stand, serving mediocre food for restaurant prices.",

I&#39;ve been there twice in the last couple months but can&#39;t remember what I ate. The wine list was good but the service was lacking on both visits. In nice weather you can sit on the bank of the Spree and watch the tourist boats go by. I guess I&#39;d recommend the place more for the atmosphere and as a nice place to have a drink.",

I started to hit up the historic bungalow place, but wasn&#39;t feeling it - as I wandered up Kreuzberger Strasse I noticed STAROPRAMEN DARK on the awning...<br><br>Say WHAT? Czech Cerny pivo on TAP? No way.<br><br>Yes way.<br><br>So, after confirming the menu looked good and that Staropramen Cerny was -actually- available... I settled in and ordered a schnitzel. With the schnitzel came a salad that was - well, really terrible. I&#39;ll just pretend that wasn&#39;t actually delivered to my table.<br><br>Also included was a pile of fries, and those were fine - but here&#39;s the deal: All that was 3,75 euros. Adding the beer and a single scoop if ice cream brought my total to 6,75. For a full meal. Again, pretending that sad little salad never appeared. (honestly - epic piles of mayo does not make for a good &#39;dressing&#39;)<br><br>The waitress was friendly, prompt and quite helpful. I enjoyed tipping her.<br><br>The two guys sitting next to me ordered the Angus Burger - which looked AWESOME. Kinda grumpy I didn&#39;t get one of those myself... ok, not really. Next time for sure. Also: A table tent advertises a plate of wild North Sea mussels for 8,90. Thats gonna be a return trip item for sure.",

Hence, we were able to sit down in a large cubicle without waiting at all.<br><br>I selected items from the Winter Limited menu. I got a potato and goose stew, followed by a Rapunzel Salad (salad greens with apples, tomatoes, and fried goose liver). That was good. My companion on the other hand got a big pot of mussels in tomato and garlic sauce. <br><br>This place is relatively cheap, compared with other establishments that serve the same quality food. Main courses hover between 8 to 12 EUR, and the food is more pub food rather than swanky white linen. They also have some specialty beers on tap. <br><br>The missing star is due to the service. It&#39;s a little slow and unenthusiastic, as with many places here in Europe. If you need something, you have to grab the person&#39;s attention, as they won&#39;t do a good job monitoring every table making sure that the diners are satisfied with their dining needs. So if you need more napkins, or you want your plate of mussel shells emptied because it is not big enough, then you have to explicitly ask for that.",

I discovered the restaurant thanks to a friend of mine who has been several times here already. He told me: No matter what you choose, you are going to love it. He was right!<br>Ich kann nur die zahlreiche positive Bewertungen bestätigen. Man ißt <br>hier lecker; es ist einfach nicht das billige Chineser um die Ecke und <br>die Preise sind nicht übertrieben aber trotzdem dementsprechend höher <br>(bleiben dafür angemessen), wie man auch angesichts der Lage erwarten kann.<br> Die Karte ist ein Vergnügen und man hat nur die Qual der Wahl, denn das<br> Angebot ist vielfältig und die auf der Karte abgebildete Gerichte total<br> einladend. Ich habe das Restaurant dank eines Stammgastes entdeckt. Er <br>hatte mir versprochen Egal was du bestellst, es wird schmecken. Ich <br>kann ihm nur Recht geben.",

I definitely recommend the intercontinental breakfast, and the pancakes ... It was all delicious. The ambiance in the restaurant is relaxing, soft music, chill ... Perfect for late hungovers! They have a lot of options on the menu to satisfy a wide diversity of tastes so its perfect for foreigners. Bonne appétit !",

"reviewcomment":"Ostbahnhof is pretty OK. I don&#39;t know what the old station looked like prior to the construction of this one in 2002, so I have nothing to compare this to. However, the fact that one of the track always seems to be closed down or worked on is kind of strange.<br><br>The train station may not be as huge as the new Hauptbahnhof, but it&#39;s still pretty nice. I like that it has all the necessary amenities of a central station, but it&#39;s not complicated to navigate. <br><br>One upside is that trains traveling to or from major cities tend to stop here, so it&#39;s more convenient for those of us living in the area to catch our trains or get off here, as opposed to dealing with it at HBF. <br><br>One downside, however, is that even though it&#39;s an important station, many of the passes that need to be purchased or any kind of customer service like refunds, etc. is nearly impossible here. After two friends never received their Euro passes they ordered, they came here on the day of travel to deal with it, but we were brushed aside and told to deal with it at HBF. Not a big deal, except for the massive lines of people that always seem to plague customer service there. So, that&#39;s kind of annoying. I wish they had better service or more options here.<br><br>Otherwise, Ostbahnhof is not bad. I also like that the shops here are open on Sundays, for the occasions once or twice a year when I need something I forgot to buy and find myself SOL.",

"reviewcomment":"As my friend had stated this museum is a hit or miss. First off I came to see the Johannes Itten and Paul Klee exhibit called &#34;COSMOS OF COLOR&#34;. I had purchased tickets online before I even arrived to Germany. The exhibit was amazing but the rest of the exhibits within the museum was disappointing. If you buy a ticket online for an exhibit mind you will only be able to see that exhibit and will need to purchase another ticket to enter the other exhibits. If you are a fan of the Bauhaus then trust me when I say that the name &#34;GROPIUS&#34; is simply part of the museums name. There was nothing on the Bauhaus here other than the Klee and Itten exhibit. <br><br>For more on the Bauhaus be sure to visit the Bauhaus Archiv and a two hour train ride away is the Stiftung Bauhaus in Dessau. I went and it was amazing. <br><a href='/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bauhaus.de&amp;s=de90f851457b19e7570af2b77b0de7cdbe0198b004418a437fe72969e167df72' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>bauhaus.de</a><br><a href='/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbauhaus-online.de%2Fen%2Fstiftung-bauhaus-dessau&amp;s=b4f85df029141cc8329eecee38fd3d3616f2a68e1db6300ed998434360681fdf' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>bauhaus-online.de/en/sti…</a>",

"reviewcomment":"This hotel has more personality than any other hotel I have ever seen. It is hard to explain, you just have to experience it. Though you might get an idea from visiting the website or from hearing that they will deliver a Gibson guitar to your room via room service.<br><br>I stayed here for a conference last week and I really enjoyed my stay. The beds were very comfrotable, the room amenitites (slippers, toiltetries, etc) were nice. The view of the river Spree is great, especially from the higher floors. <br><br>The best part of the hotel is that the staff and many of the services are at the level of a truly fine hotel (St Regis, Ritz Carlton, Four Seasons). I am not saying the hotel is that nice - it isn&#39;t.  It is more like a W level than a St Regis level. But the staff is that friendly, professional and helpful. The concierge was outstanding.  Working with the concierge Jan was no different than working with a concierge at one of the  best hotels in the world. Laundry/dry cleaning and room service were also top-notch in both friendliness, promptness and product.<br><br>The conference I spoke at paid for my room and I am not sure what the rate was, but I understand it was reasonable. Wifi was free to all guests. It did pay for room service, drinks in the bar and laundry service, and they were all very reasonably priced. So I think this hotel is a great value.",

Meatballs, meat salad, etc which all looked as though it had been standing there for some time.<br><br> The servers were rude, and we were somehow unable to order breakfast off the menu, although we could&#39;ve ordered main meals such as steak or pasta. This makes no sense.<br><br> Perhaps this place would be better suited to an evening meal (again, there is a serious lack of vegetarian options), but I would not go again during the day.

Very relaxed, fairly central in the Mitte/Alexaderplatz district and offering a very chilled table service experience - Cafe Cinema is somewhere to go if you&#39;re after a fairly lo-key night out. <br><br>Wine and Weiss bier is all served for less that €4 a pop but if the truth be known, I haven&#39;t explored the menu any more than this at this stage. <br><br>One thing to be aware is that it gets very busy in here and with most places in Berlin - they&#39;re not too keen on a load of Brits turning up to settle in for the night, however there is more seating towards the back area near the toilets. <br><br>If you do end up here and it&#39;s really busy, the next alley way has a nice little tucked away bar that is pretty big and means you can enjoy a drink here before returning to Cafe Cinema! <br><br>I&#39;d highly recommend this place, make sure you check out out if you&#39;re in Berlin.",

"reviewcomment":"I rarely go to bars, so I don&#39;t have a high bar for bar reviews. Anyway, this was the site of a meet-up event tonight, and at 7:45 PM, the place was still slow. That was the time when I walked in and saw a couple of friends. <br><br>I ordered a White Russian. I didn&#39;t know it was a recommended thing here. I just wanted something potent and with Kahlua in it. But it was very potent. I ordered a second, and soon enough, I was swimming in bliss. Perhaps the good company was also to blame, but I did have a good time. <br><br>So why just 4 stars? Well, when you need to go to the toilet, well, it&#39;s downstairs. In some sort of Gothic looking area. In a stale musty part of the establishment. No wonder nobody is down there, and everybody is upstairs. Unfortunately, the sofas are downstairs. But it seemed like it is just inhabited by ghosts, and if you have just finished a horror Gothic novel like me, then it&#39;s probably creepy. Good thing I only went to the toilet once.<br><br>Anyway, I&#39;ll be back, as they never seem to be conservative when it comes to alcohol in their cocktails. Very potent.",

"reviewcomment":"Well. I knew there was a seedy underside to Berlin somewhere - and here it is. As part of my study of public spaces in Berlin for my thesis, Gorlizter Park was on my list.<br><br>Its a big park, with a lot of parts. The north end is surrounded by hipster hangouts, a very nice church tower and an Ubahn station. Lots of people coming and going. There is also a hill with a swimming pool buried in the middle of it. One side has a glass jewelbox viewing window, the other side a particularly ugly curved concrete facade that looks to be left over from the GDR days. One would hope that the bulldozer will one day remove that hideous blot of concrete. <br><br>There are 3 old buildings nearby that seem to be relics of a railroad past. Nice structures - one is a restaurant (Das Edelweiss) and one is marked &#39;clubhouse&#39;. They are simply covered in graffiti. Sad really. There is an odd concrete construction facing the restaurant that seems to be either the worst designed amphitheater ever, or a failed fountain that now kinda serves that purpose. Not sure. Odd.<br><br>Graffiti is an epidemic here. For some reason the lower half of the park has this yellow brick wall in many places that simply invites spray paint. There are no police to be seen. Lots of people out with strollers and dogs, even on a drizzly weekday late afternoon. Older folks walking about - and - drug dealers.  I was warned in advance - but the blatant nature of the activity was rather surprising.<br><br>Above Oppelner Strasse is mostly open and/or active recreation. Below, towards the river, is designed to offer a more &#39;natural&#39; green experience. There is a strange depression in the middle that serves no purpose, and at Oppelner is a fountain that was inoperative. Perhaps due to the season. Dunno.<br><br>Heres the strange thing: Right at the entrance, on either side of the fountain, are two grottos with benches and heavy vegetation/shielding for these spaces - its as if the designers ASKED the pot dealers how to set it up best for them and they did. Absolutely the dumbest thing I have ever seen in a park. One guy on a bike was simply convinced I was his newest customer. He gave up after two or three entreaties. It seems he was a runner for the dudes hanging in the grotto - I saw him going there and off again a couple of times. Clearly, attitudes about drugs are more relaxed here, but this park suffers greatly I think from the obvious disorder of street level drug sales and graffiti.<br><br>Even with all that, given the location and size of the park, I&#39;m guessing that in summer its a very busy place.",

It has countless cool things to see, places to eat and trendy areas to hang out in. <br>Some of the more up and coming areas are in the East side of Berlin and that is where you find this cool little restaurant/bar. We had been going for a saunter up Karl Marx Alley  and at one point turned off it and after a few more turns ended up here.<br><br>We had the breakfast platter to share. It was HUGE and really reasonably priced. There was an abundance of cold meats, cheeses , breads, eggs and fruit. To go along side that I had a great vanilla milk shake. Due to over indulgence on the alcohol front the night before, I was feeling a bit sensitive and this sorted me right out. <br>The decor inside the place is nice and the location is great . Only slight moan was the service was quite slow, but there was lots of plus points that meant I could generally overlook this.",

"reviewcomment":"All right, I&#39;m fibbing a bit on the Price Range bar below, giving this a rating of cheap which means 7 Euro or less.  The menu is three courses for 7.5 Euros.  At least that was the last time I was at Cafe Nord-Sud in September.  I will be there again within 3 days as I am Berlin-bound today, and can&#39;t wait to have lunch at Nord-Sud again soon.<br><br>If you are looking for fine dining, this isn&#39;t the atmosphere- it is absolutely casual, and as far as I can tell a two man show.  The owner/server is usually frantically busy, but remains to my mind extremely charming.  I always feel like I am seeing a theatre piece when I am here, as once the place is full, and it often is, he is definitely pulling off a performance piece to keep things running.<br><br>There are three menus each day.  Each is a different 3 course meal.  No mixing and matching, no interchanging,- you pick one and get those three courses.  One of the three has always had a main course of fish, and one has always been red meat or pork when I&#39;ve dined here.<br><br>Coming from the San Francisco Bay Area, I am always thrilled to be here and get a three course French meal for an amazing price.  And I very much appreciate the energy and dedication it takes to make it happen.<br><br>For travelers on a budget, who like French Cuisine, and especially those who appreciate the eclectic, Cafe Nord-Sud is worth a special trip.",

I didn&#39;t have a human companion, so I took my book with me. As I already bookmarked this months ago, I was curious to see how this restaurant does given my standards.<br><br>They have a very small fixed menu, plus a daily menu that is ever-changing. You can find what they are cooking on their website, as well as written on the blackboard displayed in the restaurant. <br><br>I ordered the potato stew (large portion), as well as a latte macchiato. Service was quick (well, they&#39;d only scoop up a portion into a serving bowl), and the taste was good. I typically like restaurants with small menus; that&#39;s typically a sign that they do it well. I&#39;d rather pick a restaurant with a small menu, than one that has tons of possibilities, because I am not sure you can really deliver good food if you&#39;re trying to make lots of variants. <br><br>I also liked the atmosphere inside. It&#39;s not grandma-chic, but it definitely has an original feel to it. The tables are old, you almost expect it to smell musty, but that&#39;s just an illusion. I love the atmosphere, especially in the back room. I&#39;d totally come back here, either with a date, or with friends, drinking.",

And I must say the cocktails very pretty good. The classes are so big that you can&#39;t taste the alcohol, but you can sure feel it. The burger I had was alright, I think the beef patty had too much pepper in it and as I ordered the avocado burger, I expected to get avocado on the burger not guacamole, but I love guac, so It was all good. I was torn between giving 3 or 4 stars, but since the staff was very nice and friendly I opted for 4.<br><br>Just one more thing, the restaurant is aiming for mexican food, but looking at the dishes and the menu and I would say it&#39;s not proper mexican food.

It&#39;s almost always filled with locals, though those from the Indian sub-continent are missing.<br><br> 1. The Food<br>Well prepared standard Indian fare, with vegetarian options. Some dishes are on the oily/greasy side. The dishes are not very spicy, most likely because of their customer base, but are tinkered with on request. Their food is better seasoned than most Indian places in the city, with the brightness of their curries balanced out with the creaminess of their ghee and cream.<br><br> 2. The Staff <br>Kind, easy-going and quick.<br><br> 3. The atmosphere<br>A local neighbourhood hang-out. They also have a nice heated patio where you can sip on their numerous cocktails throughout the year.<br><br> 4. The damage<br>Most dishes are under 7 euros. Drinks are 2-5.<br><br> 5. Useful tidbits<br>Try their platter of mixed appetisers or creamy mango lassi.",

"reviewcomment":"Cafe Matilda is an almost-perfect cafe/bar mixture - so far I&#39;ve had breakfast and afternoon Kaffee und Kuchen there, but they also have drinks and probably other fare in the evenings. <br><br>The breakfast was an amazingly good deal - the Kleines Fruhstueck is actually huge, with two kinds of cheese and two kinds of meat (some kind of prosciutto and salami) along with a soft-boiled egg and various fruits and vegetables. Of course the requisite bread basket was there as well - all of this for EUR 5.60 (September 2012). <br><br>We saw the different types of Kuchen in the display when we were there for breakfast, and they looked great, so we came back in the afternoon. Also quite good. <br><br>There is seating out front on the sidewalk/pavement, and a front room and back room - all very comfortable. Inside the lighting is pretty low and relaxing, and they play a lot of soul-type music on LP. <br><br>I have to give a few negative marks to the lack of WiFi, and also our waitress in the morning was a bit scattered - dropping things and the like, but otherwise reasonably friendly. <br><br>Well worth it for breakfast - I doubt you could find a higher quality traditional German breakfast for less than EUR 5.60.<br><br>Quick edit: I got the prices wrong the first time - it&#39;s actually cheaper - EUR 5.60 for the Kleines Fruhstueck (changed above). Also, the second waitress we had when we came back was awesome - so definitely give it good marks for service all around.",

The dishes were overall very tasty, especially the curry with peanuts was great. The tandoori was also very moist and really well flavored. The only complaint I had was that the sauce of the curry seemed a bit to liquid for my taste. I also would have loved a bit more spicy dishes. But I will certainly go back there...",

"reviewcomment":"My companion and I ended here after a botched attempt at having home-cooked dinner (yeah, Sunday doesn&#39;t feature a lot of open supermarkets). Anyway, since my companion is vegetarian, I suggested we try this place. <br><br>I ordered the Sudan-Teller, while my companion ordered the Vegan-Teller. I found my plate amazing, while she found hers lovely. My platter featured three falafels, an aubergine paste, some yoghurt-type thing, a salad, and something else that definitely had peanut butter in it. They served it in one large plate and coupled with a pair of pitas. <br><br>And believe it or not, my platter only cost 4,50 EUR. I thought it was worth more than that, given the taste and the quantity.<br><br>Needless to say, I will definitely be back. This place features a lot of vegetarian dishes, and even though I am not vegetarian anymore, they make me want to be one again.",

"reviewcomment":"It&#39;s a shame I hadn&#39;t stopped in sooner this summer, as I really love a very good (and very inexpensive!) Thai dinner with a cold Singha beer...but they are doing construction on the building, which obscures the entrance and makes the whole patio feel a bit dark and covered. <br><br>Hopefully it shapes up soon, because get past the construction equipment and there is a wonderful meal awaiting you! (and me!)  I am wholly and mightily impressed with this little Thai place on the corner of Christburgerstr. &amp; Prenzlauer Alle! <br><br>I had decided on my return trip home (after being soaked in a freak rainstorm) that I&#39;d pop into this place and check it out...it only took me a moment to understand I had made the right choice and that it was far preferable even to my takeout mainstay Xuan, in Kaiser&#39;s. Bangkok is roughly the same price and I would say a bit better quality, and much nicer atmosphere. After all, its not in a grocery market. <br><br>For 8,20 I got a good portion of chicken, veggies and rice in peanut sauce accompanied by my beloved Singha. Would&#39;ve been even less had I gone for a draft beer which are less than 1,50. I chose to indulge in an import...when you only have one, make it count right? <br><br>Besides the very low price point, I was very impressed with the super speedy and very friendly service. The two girls working the room were efficient and happy. From the time I sat down until I received my food could not have been more than 10 minutes. It was so hot I had to let it cool down, even! <br><br>Will definitely be stopping back in to try the summer rolls, soups, salads, etc...hot, filling, friendly service, inexpensive. Nice for a date, catch up with friends or even solo (like me!).",

Eure Idee ist super, aber wenn man als Kunde noch gerne seinen <br>Kassenbon und das bereits bezahlte Essen haben moechte und voellig <br>neutral danach fragt Kann ich noch meinen Kassenzettel und mein Essen <br>hab, das sie hinter sich gestellt haben, dann ist es eine Frechheit, <br>wenn dann eine Kollegin dazu kommt, die <br>einem voellig unbegruendet an den Kopf knallt, man solle freundlicher <br>sein. Kollegin? Nein, wie sich rausstellt, die Store-Managerin. Gehts <br>noch?<br> Ich habe mein Essen nicht herbeigesungen oder auf Knien danach<br> gebettelt, ich habe es nur gerne haben wollen. Mit einem Laecheln ueber<br> die Situation, in der es ewig gedauert hat, einen Gutschein als <br>Teilbetrag einzuloesen, weil die nettere Mitarbeiterin an der Kasse, da <br>noch Kopfrechnen musste, weil es falsch eingegeben war. Und ja, aus <br>Erfahrung haett ich immer gerne einen Kassenbon, und ich wurde danach <br>gefragt und sagte Ja, bitte!, was wieder vergessen wurde Aber Hey! <br>Bin ich unfreundlich aber moment ach nein, ich bin ja Kunde, der <br>ist hier nicht Koenig, sondern soll nur das Geld bringen.. <br>Freundlichkeit und Service ist anders! Ihr habt Glueck, dass eure Idee <br>so gut ist, dass man das Personal selbst bis in die Fuehrungsebene <br>einfach nach aussehen und nicht nach Kompetenz einstellen kann. <br>Freundlichkeit? Fremdwort!.. Umtausch? Kassenbon, sonst Beule. Kassenbon<br> ungefragt mit in die Tuete tun, Fehlanzeige! Bin ich sauer? Nein, ich <br>find es eine Frechheit, aber dreist kommt weiter.. nud Ja, das war das <br>4. Mal, dass man in dem Laden scheisse behandelt wird. Als Kunde, der <br>den Laden immer weiterempfohlen hat! 2. Beschwerde und ja, wir habens<br> es immer wieder probiert, bleiben jetzt aber gerne fern! tut uns <br>nicht leid, schade ist es trotzdem",

"reviewcomment":"My companions and I went here for lunch yesterday. As one of them wanted some good Indian food, I asked for recommendations from the interwebs, and Kifah told me that this is one of the better Indian restaurants here in Berlin.<br><br>They open from noon, which was the time we were there. We ordered two different appetizers (and they were more than happy to accommodate us in asking for an extra samosa, as we were three), as well as three different main dishes. Unfortunately, they didn&#39;t have naan, simply because they just opened for the day, and that meant that their stone oven for making naan isn&#39;t ready yet. Understandable. <br><br>The main dishes were quite lovely. And what I liked the most, is that they never toned down their flavors to accommodate the cowardly German palate. Spicy things are indeed spicy. So that lamb curry was definitely potent!<br><br>I would definitely come back here again, perhaps even for dinner, when they have naan. I gladly give this place 5 stars, and I promise to be back.",

"reviewcomment":"This place is not a quick grab and go join. It seems that the Germans don&#39;t like this place. I can understand the displeasure with it, considering the price. The meal is expensive, and its Berlin. There are a lot of the unemployed, and students here. Additionally, its in a section of town that isn&#39;t known for finance. [Ok there are a few tech shops, and hotels around] <br><br>The food at this place is good. I had the weinerschnitel. It came with bread prior to the meal. The food was excellently prepared and was quite tasty. The portions were just right. Its been a while [July 2011] since I&#39;ve been there so, I cannot recall what came with the meal. <br><br>The atmosphere: It was quiet, and the space was open. It appears that they are going for an atmosphere that is spacey and quiet. This place could very well be used as a lounge later in the evening. <br><br>The downsides to this place: <br><br> 1.  Its rather hard to find. Its down an alley and is out of sight from the road. <br> 2. Its pricey",

"reviewcomment":"I&#39;m thinking to myself, tacos in Berlin?  Am I setting myself up for trouble?  Luckily the answer is no and tipica comes through with some good representation of the taco arts.  And as you might guess from my yelp slogan I&#39;ve enjoyed many tacos over the years. <br><br>How things work here is you pick a a choice of taco fillings, some traditional some not so, some sides and salsa.  You get a plate with the items and a basket of warm tortillas to build your own.  The tortillas exceeded my expectations and so did the food.  The salsa not so much but who cares when they also provide the side of chopped onions an cilantro, the traditional garnish with a squirt of lime!<br><br>We tried the al pastor and carnitas, some of my favorites and a chance for me to be hyper critical.  The al pastor was very similar to things I&#39;ve had at various places in the states.  While the flavor was good, it wasn&#39;t the best, however the meat was tender And a better quality than you see back home.  The carnitas was the variety that uses more citrus than I typically like but flavor full and very tender.  Also the right amount of fat.  They remind me of caribbean style carnitas instead of what you might get in Cali or mainland mex.  <br><br>Not exactly cheap taco wagon fare but, good and much better than I imagined.  I put together about four or five tacos with the fixings they served and was very happy.  Btw, cheap taco wagon tacos are usually the best and something to search out.  But having some nice drinks at Tipica does have an advantage to eating at a taco wagon.<br><br>A hint to the Berliners and other Europeans going here, tacos are street food to be eaten with your hands!!! So stop trying to eat them with a knife and fork!  Pick it up and go to town!",

"reviewcomment":"Mutter... The name alone has that feeling of homeliness about it, but you would be wrong in this case to assume it refers to the German word for &#39;mother&#39;. Rather in this case it means &#39;Nut&#39; as in Nut and Bolts or as I see it, the Nut that keeps my screwy personality in balance... keeping me fed and watered is not a job to be undertaken by the weak and faint hearted!  Like a Nut it has many sides to its personality ...<br><br>During the day Mutter serves as a café where you can enjoy a nice breakfast, one of the lunchtime specials on offer or a simple coffee and slice of cake. Sometimes I have lunch meetings here because there are plenty of nice quiet corners to set up shop in, especially if you need to get connected to the interweb!<br>This is a bit like a home from home for me.<br><br>The place is bright and airy with plenty of areas to choose from. Inside there is a main dining area upstairs with its own bar, the principle bar is situated downstairs and separated by a smaller area at the entrance of Mutter. From the  Main Bar you can access the main outdoor seating area which in winter becomes tented complete with heaters. A little lounge area can also be found outside on the other side of mutter, nice to just hang with friends in the sun, shaded areas are also provided.<br><br>In the evening it transforms itself into a lively bar and bustling restaurant noted for its Thai cuisine.  The food is excellent especially for those who like their food sssssssssssspicy, perfect to extinguish with a nice cold beer or a tasty cocktail.  My go to dish here is the Beef Pad Kee Mao, a Chinese influenced spicy fried rice noodle dish, aka &#39;Drunken noodles&#39;... perfect to serve in a bar!  For an alternative I might have the Beef Krapao Nua sab, a stir fried beef in chilli and basil dish served with steamed rice or the Pad Prik Suii, Beef in a thick spicy pepper sauce.  But my all-time favourite is the Pad Kee Mao. Also available to go ;) <br><br>Other tasty things on the menu include: Gaeng Pet Ped Jangt (a roast duck with red curry), Gaeng Pet Gai (chicken coconut red curry) served in a pineapple or a nice juicy papaya salad. Sometimes you might find a tender roast beef on the daily specials menu, also good. Prices are fair considering the quality and the portions.<br><br>The Staff are very friendly and helpful! <br><br>During major Sporting events, Mutter provides screens inside and out so you can watch matches live whilst enjoying a nice cool beer amongst a friendly local and international crowd... rewind to World Cup 2010... only England supporter in bar full of Germans apart from the Irish guy who was obviously also supporting Germany!  What can I say...I survived...but then we did loose and there was that awkward moment when it seemed I was the only voice to be heard when England scored its only goal! Heavens this review might have taken a different turn had England won!<br><br>By the way Mutter is also a great location for private functions and parties complete with DJs that will make you want to dance until all hours of the morning, well at least until the Ordungsamt arrive!",

"reviewcomment":"What a superb venue...We went to see &#34;Cabaret&#34; there and had a good pre-ordered meal at &#34;Half Time&#34;. We had excellent seats close to the stage. A real Berlin experience !<br><br> The show was very professional but was in German of course. However I have seen the film so many times and read Chris Isherwoods book, so I could follow the gist and the music was really good.<br><br> The taxi driver we ordered from the Hilton didn&#39;t know where the venue was so thanks to our Citymap we were able to direct him there !! Not easy to find !<br><br> Since returning to the UK we went to see the english version in London.",

I mean ... a butcher would know their meats right? <br><br>Fleischerei Domke cooks the meal my German grandma would... if I had a German grandma. It&#39;s homely and comforting food that sticks to your ribs. I ordered the schnitzel (<a href='http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/iriy3D7FCSnTjkp-qcijhQ?select=Bv_yAP4PefQagBYExRVc9g#Bv_yAP4PefQagBYExRVc9g'>yelp.com/biz_photos/iriy…</a>) and it was so lovely - nicely fried meat served with a healthy serving of potatoes and red cabbage. It doesn&#39;t get much more German I&#39;ve imagine. Other menu items include brats, goulash, blood sausage, stuffed cabbage rolls, and more. My new friend I met while sharing the bench had this amazing looking ribs that fell off the bone. Prices are great with most items under €5.<br><br>I could kick myself that I only ate here once on my last day especially since I lived so close to it but for a perfect homestyle German dinner to bid farewell to an awesome city, Fleischerei Domke was just perfect.",

It&#39;s somewhat isolated, hidden away among a bunch of apartment buildings, but worth coming if you&#39;re already close by.  The chairs are awesome!!",

"reviewcomment":"I knew that today was going to be a long day (yes, I am writing this review during the 10 minutes free time that I found this late afternoon). I was in my office since before 9:00 AM and will be here until around 6:00 PM. So around mid-afternoon, I took a break and took some papers I needed to read, while trying to find a new cafe. I found the Sarotti Höfe, named after the chocolatier Sarotti. <br><br>True to the name, they offer plenty of chocolate-related drinks, both alcoholic and non-alcoholic. The temperature was a little chilly, so I asked for a grog and a slice of the sachertorte. That set me back 6,80 EUR. And yes, I enjoyed it, in many ways.<br><br>The grog was potent. The sachertorte was chocolatey. And I was light-headed after consuming these two items and walking back to my office. <br><br>I give this place 4 stars. Perhaps it&#39;s because I like the interior: it has charm and character, and gives off an old-world feel, at the same time making people of all walks of life welcome (they have a rainbow sticker at the door, among other things). I also like the plentiful choices of cakes. What I don&#39;t like is the lack of accessible electric plugs. So this isn&#39;t a place I would like to set up a laptop and work in, this is more a place where one would feel comfortable taking a little break from the hustle and bustle of life and sip a drink, potent or non-potent.",

"reviewcomment":"Berlin really knows how to do a good job with museums. this is another must-see.<br><br>it&#39;s a bit hard to find - it&#39;s right in the middle of a shopping district. in fact, I think we walked past it once thinking it was a store - you have to go inside a small shopping mall to get to it!<br><br>this museum is focused on the history of Berlin&#39;s almost 800 years as a proper city. there are exhibits on everything: religion, entertainment, science, economics, industry, and more.<br><br>there are two sections of this museum which I consider both its greatest assets, and its scariest:<br><br>1) the rise of Nazism. in one part of the museum, you must walk down a hallway with &#34;books&#34; in the floor - coincidentally, many of which were banned by the regime. as you walk down the hallway, the sounds of angry mobs, breaking glass, and Hitler&#39;s speeches are heard. it&#39;s thoroughly haunting.<br><br>2) the nuclear bunker - every hour on the hour, you can take a tour of a massive bunker built right below the museum. it&#39;s dark, the sounds of sirens and bombs are heard at one point, and somehow manages to be both sprawling and claustrophobic.<br><br>we lucked out - we finished the exhibits as a bunker tour was starting, but it was a German one. however, there was an American family visiting their German relatives, so the younger family members translated for us.<br><br>admission is 10 Euro, or 8 reduced. price includes the bunker tour.",

You miss and you are out. The final two competitors left aim to be the first to reach 10 points and therefore be crowned the winner. Easy!<br><br> Cheap beer and much fun to be had.

"reviewcomment":"While this place is a restaurant, this review only applies for the drinks. My companion and I headed here after dinner last night because we wanted mojitos. So why not go to a Cuban place for it? <br><br>They are sort of a restaurant, sort of a bar. They have both a food menu and a drink menu. And their drink menu was enormous too, I almost regretted not sampling the other offerings. Though I have to say, the mojitos were very potent. Very potent that I was very tempted to order another one, if not for a pressing appointment later that night. So I settled for just one.<br><br>The place has a dark atmosphere; it is more a cavern-like dive bar than a restaurant. That being said, the acoustics are good enough to allow you to have a conversation with your companions. <br><br>The service was great; the staff regularly checked on us whether we were doing okay or whether we needed anything else. And yes, they were very visually appealing, which fuels one&#39;s imagination, to the point that I almost wished I took Spanish instead of German when I was taking foreign language courses in the university, just so that I can carry a longer conversation with them while visually appreciating them. I guess the mojitos were partly to blame.",

"reviewcomment":"From the minimalistic decor - the light dusty blue walls, the modern meets vintage lightbulbs hanging from the ceiling - to the open sushi bar, to the &#34;i want everything on there&#34; menu, Omoni is my favourite Korean (bordering on Japanese) kitchen in Berlin.<br><br>Ooooor, at least it shares the no. 1 spot with Yam Yam, but whereas I go to Yam Yam for a bibimbap craving, korean pancakes and dumplings, I go to Omono for the more sushi like options. <br><br>I have a tendency to order the same things: the tuna tartar rolls ($4.80) are beyond tasty, and serve as the perfect entree. For a main it&#39;s all about #15 ($8.50):  a rice bowl served up with both raw and cooked salmon, salmon skin and bio-salad - hearty, yet fresh at the same time. And oh yes, the seaweed salad is pretty amazing too. <br><br>The place is popular, and is only open for dinner, so make sure to book if you are more than two people. Otherwise try to get a seat at the bar and watch the chef do his magic!",

"reviewcomment":"Walking up street, I immediately spotted the storefront to this Japanese restaurant- it&#39;s hard to miss with the most colorful and cute artwork painted on the storefront windows. <br><br>This is truly a special and unique place that will transport you to Japan. You will completely forget you&#39;re in Berlin as you enter this hip and very pink restaurant. Yumi (lady who runs the place) and the staff are all super-friendly - It was so nice to see so many happy smiling faces. With a little smile of my own, I ordered and settled in for a yummy meal and a feel-good Japanese cultural experience. <br><br>The menu is simple, fresh and authentic Japanese home cooking - the kind of stuff you&#39;d find coming from a real Japanese kitchen including: Grilled fishes, Yakiniku beef, Miso tofu, Teriyaki Chicken, Noodle bowls, Sushi, Japanese rice porridge and a range of authentic side dishes. The dishes are carefully prepared and arrive the table looking picture perfect - how often do you get a salad with little carrots cut into cute little flower shapes? <br><br>They also have bento boxes which are packaged boxes filled with a variety of tasty bites portioned and sectioned to make a really healthy and convenient meal to go. Growing up in Hawaii, I remember being able to grab these types of bento boxes all over the place. Seeing the bento boxes on the counter brought back some nice memories and I&#39;ll definitely be back to grab one next time I need a quick meal to go.<br><br>I also found out that Smart Deli also has an online food order/delivery service. The order form is on their website. I took a look and there is a nice wide range of all the Japanese basics you&#39;d need to cook a nice meal at home. So, if you&#39;re feeling inspired to cook some Japanese food in your own kitchen, you&#39;re all set here!<br><br>Before I left, Yumi came over to chat with me as I was looking at a flyer for an upcoming event they were hosting with handmade crafts and food demos. It was such a nice treat getting to learn about her life and the restaurant. Felt like being at a friends house for lunch and sitting around chatting after. All her hard work definitely shows as I found out it happened to be their 10 year anniversary on the day I was there and I got a free homemade smiley face cookie for their birthday as part of the celebration. <br><br>What more can I say? Go check this place out - you&#39;ll be hooked too",

"reviewcomment":"I discovered this place today and will definitely come back many times for their &#34;crazy hour&#34; - an all-you-can-eat sushi (and other dishes) buffet between 15h and 17h every day for only 7,90 euro - unbelievably cheap.<br><br> As far as I could tell, the sushi was good, though the sake nigiri had more white fat in it than usual. It&#39;s all very fresh - the chef comes out with more pieces all the time, so you know they haven&#39;t been lying there all day. I also had a very tender pangasius filet and a delicious fried banana for dessert - all included in the buffet price.<br><br> Lots of people sharing the huge tables - each of them has a built in grill where the chef can come out and cook directly in front of the guests, something that happens only in the evenings I suppose.<br><br> 1/2 liter tap beer: 4 euro.<br><br> À la carte prices are about 15 euro per dish I think, and there are also quite elaborate menues for more persons - that&#39;s probably when the table grills are used.",

We ate here twice in our visit to Berlin because the food is fresh, tasty and a nice change from currywürst and döner kebab. Both times we had the Mix Platte for 2. The felafel was light and crispy, the tabbouleh salad and vegetables were dressed just right with lemon and olive oil and the meat kebab was delicately spiced. I am from LA so the Syrian flavor difference was apparent - I&#39;m used to a heavier hand with garlic and spices in the Armenian, Persian and Israeli cuisine in California though maybe it&#39;s just a German preference for milder flavors? Whatever the case my husband and I loved Yarok! <br><br>It gets busy but just squeeze in somewhere and be patient!",

Still a bigger fan of whiskey--and they have that too--but it was on their specials list, and was definitely a good pick!<br><br>Atmosphere: Music: Great choice of jazzy pop covers, at just the right volume. Service: fantastic--they even took my coat and let us stay a little past our reservation. A little surprised when we got served by a dude in a dress (this is after all in the heart of Berlin&#39;s gay district), but hey, it&#39;s a free country!<br><br>The bill: less expensive than I would have thought, but then again we&#39;re talking Euros and I haven&#39;t gotten over the exchange difference... So, maybe a little pricy. 20€ including tip.<br><br>Final Statement: AMAZING burgers, good drinks (if the beer selection is a bit sparse, the bar is fantastic), great service, slightly unusual locale.

Quite a few celebrities drop by there - and get served as everyone else would be served. A really nice and romantic place, completely unexceited, but you&#39;ll love it. Really typical italian.

Yet, Curry Mitte delivers the full package.<br><br>The staff is inconsistent and each of them has a very own very Berlin personality. From sloppy answers to mild insults, they are very personal and charming. Typically Berlin.<br><br>The Curry sausage comes in the skin and no-skin varieties and with ketchup or home made hot sauce (which tastes great). If that&#39;s not enough, you can try to beat the scoville scale and try a really hot sauce.<br><br>The fries are super crispy and as good as fries get in Berlin. The crowd is untypical for Mitte: people are reasonable and nice. Blue and white collar<br> Reasonable prices (1.80 Euro curry sausage)",

"reviewcomment":"Sometimes you sleep in on the first day of your holiday, especially after getting up at 5.30am the morning prior. It&#39;s nothing to be ashamed of, but often we berate ourselves for doing so. &#39;We&#39;re missing bits of the day! There&#39;s so much to see! We can&#39;t justify breakfast at this hour!&#39; Perhaps not, but 1pm is a perfectly feasible time for brunch... and in this case, as opposed to it equalling a meal between breakfast and lunch, it served as a combination of the two.<br><br>Hotly tipped Kültürzeit was the choice we opted for, and boy is this place great value. Not only is it decorated quirkily (you know how I dig this) and set up with a great selection of fun group tables and romantic little mini ones for two (to which they add candles... candles during the day! I love this decadence), you can choose wherever you want to be. Any apprehension we felt at being cheesy tourists at a local place was soon quashed by a) a friendly waitress who spoke to us in English and told us just what to do and b) a loud group of Aussies. We weren&#39;t alone in our rubbishness at German.<br><br>So basically the deal is thus: you pay 8 euros but not until you&#39;re done, and you can attack the brunch buffet as many times as you like. Drinks are on top but this doesn&#39;t hurt in the slightest. I&#39;ve always had a strange relationship with buffets - I love them at parties and in select restaurants, but sometimes they&#39;ve proved godawful. This one was so far from godawful I can&#39;t even begin to heap the hyperbole upon it that it deserves. It had me at this conversation:<br><br>Boyfriend (after nipping up to the buffet for the first round whilst I held the table): Could you test this out and tell me if it&#39;s onion ring or calamari?<br>Me (munched): It&#39;s calamari.<br>Boyfriend (calamari-hater): *Various expletives*<br>Me: And it just happens to be the best calamari I&#39;ve ever tasted.<br><br>Seriously. I think it&#39;s ruined all other calamari for me. Every bit of it. In the world. Never have I not had to chew squid at least a little - this stuff just melted in your mouth. So that was there, piping hot, alongside cous cous, various fish and seafood, scrambled eggs, tuna salad, bean salad, pasta, bread, cheese, cold cuts, chicken, cereals, nutella, jam, piles more... just a brilliantly eclectic range of food that yelled, yeah, this is brunch. Deal with it.<br><br>My first experience of German coffee knocked my socks clean off and the OJ was fresh and refreshing, and goodness me were we set up for the day after that meal. This is the fuel you need for sightseeing, and at less than 10 euros a pop you simply cannot complain!",

The schnitzel was good.  There was karaoke on Thursday and they have a wide selection of American songs to choose from. There was an excellent band on New Years Eve.

Little did I know we were going to a swanky place.<br><br>But not just any swanky place, but rather, a vegan swanky place. Now it gets interesting. I ordered the sea salad as my starter, followed by the garden lasagne. The sea salad was composed of wakame, kelp, seaweed, and other ocean goodies, neatly treated (some of the pieces were deep-fried), and mixed very delicately, with a curry sauce that had just the right amount of kick. <br><br>My main dish was the garden lasagne, which featured no pasta in it. Rather, this is a raw dish, with layers of thinly sliced vegetables arranged like a lasagne. The sauce, which was some sort of swanky pesto, was also very good. I liked the pairing they did with the mango coulis.<br><br>I also ordered the mango cheese cake, but yes, this was vegan, and therefore featured no cheese at all. Regardless, it tasted very good. The wine, as well as the coffee that ended everything, was also divine. <br><br>The service was great: menus come in the form of iPads, and is available in German and English. The waiter would take off your coat and hang it for you. They would serve and refill your glass with wine, but perhaps the only thing they can improve on is this aspect: they should watch the tables more and see whether people need more wine on their glasses.<br><br>Aside from that, it was a very wonderful evening.

"reviewcomment":"I was here tonight due to a Meetup event. This is perhaps the second (or is it third?) Markthalle that I have been to, and while I like the concept of an indoor food market, somehow, this one failed to impress.<br><br>Well, the decor inside was impressive, sure, but the offerings were not. Perhaps it was because it was a Tuesday evening, therefore the place wasn&#39;t busy? But I cannot help but notice the fact that there were plenty of shops that were closed. And perhaps because of that, there weren&#39;t a lot of people around. In fact, they had live music starting at 8 PM, and even then, there weren&#39;t a lot of people. That doesn&#39;t look like a healthy Markthalle, but again, perhaps it&#39;s because it was a Tuesday.<br><br>Hence I am giving just 3 stars. I&#39;ll probably go ahead and check it again on a weekend evening and see whether things are different.",

My husband and I used to frequent the one on Oranientstr. but it was just too busy to make it worth it. Now it&#39;s in our back yard and before it gets busy, we&#39;re definitely there. Apparently the vegetarian burger menu has expanded and I&#39;ve been quite excited. My husband likes it because it&#39;s cheap, but it doesn&#39;t quite substitute a burger from The Bird.<br><br> The ambiance is okay, it&#39;s close enough to the M10 and Simon-Dach Str. However, there&#39;s a hostel nearby. That&#39;s fine for them, but makes locals a bit sketchy about lingering on. Nonetheless, I was quite excited for the Kreuzburgbers to open up here!",

"reviewcomment":"If you want to get away from the busy wasteland of consumerism and tourism that is Alexanderplatz, the Nikolaiviertel is a refreshing piece of Berlin history. Founded in 1200, this is the original old Berlin (Alt-Berlin, if you will). And though it&#39;s just a hop, skip, and a jump away from Alex, the architecture and the overall ambiance are totally different. <br><br>Granted, this is also a popular destination for visitors, but it manages to still retain a bit of charm. Truth be told, Nikolaiviertel is best experienced on a weekday afternoon in the spring. Stroll around the cobblestone streets, admire the buildings, peek into shops, or grab a beer and sit alongside the river. While it&#39;s never a destination, whenever I find myself here, I can&#39;t help but enjoy it.",

"reviewcomment":"To an American Christmas Market sounds like some lame ass place in a mall where you&#39;d take your kids to get pictures with Santa but it&#39;s not like that at all.  Someone said Berlin has like 70 of these but don&#39;t quote me on that.  In general they all have the same basic stuff with some markets being slightly better than others, but if you&#39;re a tourist I&#39;d think you aren&#39;t going to notice the subtle differences.  <br><br>What to expect ....Gluhwein, which is like a warm red wine w/ spices and tastes awesome &amp; keeps you warm while getting tipsy.  All the alcohol vendors also have a bunch of other warm alcoholic drinks that we pretty much just experimented with.  What is also cool is that when you buy a drink you get a real mug which you just put a couple Euro deposit on and get back when you return the mug.  I say this is cool because I always feel it&#39;s cheesy in the US when you go to Octoberfest and you get a drink in a plastic cup.... kills the authenticity.  What else.... food food food.  Maybe I don&#39;t know my German food but I got the sense this was pretty much the authentic stuff that actual Germans would eat.  And if you&#39;re in Germany you probably know this already but bring some change for the bathroom b/c for some reason Germany makes you pay to use the toilet &amp; last thing you want to do is get liquored up and not have cash to pee. <br><br>Since there are quite a few Christmas Markets within walking distance of each other what we thought was fun to do was a Christmas Market pub crawl of sorts where we&#39;d go eat n&#39; drink for an hour or so then go on to the next one.  You can pretty much spot every market from a distance because they have a ferris wheel, altho I can&#39;t imagine going up in that thing when it&#39;s 25F outside.  <br><br>Final note, during my Euro trip I went to some other Christmas Markets in other cities and definitely Berlin&#39;s were top shelf compared to other places like Rome where the Christmas Market is comparable to a small town US carnival.",

This was ok, but probably not something I would order again.<br><br>Then we ordered the chicken curry and some sort of pasta dish with mutton.<br><br>Both were INCREDIBLE. Perfect amount of spice, fresh flavors and excellent portions. I was here three weeks ago and can&#39;t wait to go back!",

The decor id beautiful, with classic solid wood tables, french windows onto the yard, an old-fashioned bar and suffused lighting in the evening. It makes a great spot for a dinner with friends of for a date.<br><br>The food is delicious and clearly prepared with care and good-quality ingredients. The bread is fresh, comes in several variety and is served with homemade seasoned butter.<br><br>Everything is nicely presented, without anything pretentious.<br><br>Best of all, the staff is friendly, polite and accommodating.<br><br>I cannot think of a better place to have dinner on my last day in Berlin!",

The sushi really IS amazing, perhaps a couple of cents more expensive than average Berlin sushi (?)  but definitely worth it! <br>The teriyaki salmon with rice is a little too weak in it&#39;s taste for me, although the salmon is well made and it is overall a good meal. <br>The udon soup was way too sweet for me, I can&#39;t recall this kind of sweetness on any of the Udon soups I had in Japan, but there are probably different kinds. This one was not my cup of tea, though. Nice staff, cosy place  book a table!",

Wiener art means that its a pork schnitzel instead of the &#34;real&#34; veal schnitzel. <br><br>The schnitzel was tasty and good as always but the french fries where only ok. <br>Think they would have been tastier and more crispy if they would have been fried 1 more time.  The sallad buffé is always fresh at Maredo and this was as good as usual.  <br><br>With one bottle of house wine that was ok but nothing fancy and 2 beers the check was 60 € wich is good for two. <br><br>Service at this location was typically german friendly and i would return.",

Expansive cocktail menu, great selection of rice noodle salads and noodle soups, among other things.<br>Expect to wait a while, service can be slow.",

"reviewcomment":"This my least favorite market in Berlin. The stalls have many antique and vintage items for sale and it is interesting for both the variety and the style of objects they have. Everything from musical instruments to Antique Military head wear.   My problem with it is, that they charge far more that the other flea-markets for the same items. There are many things you can get here that are unique however but you&#39;ll have to pay more than a reasonable price for them and may have to negotiate with a less than friendly seller to boot, although I&#39;m glad to say there are many who are friendly and helpful too, and if you are really lucky, really lucky, you may just find that bargain you have been searching for.",

The wait staff is friendly and as chatty as you&#39;d want them to be. They have a great selection of teas - it&#39;s really one of the best places I&#39;ve found after years of living on and off in Berlin.  What gives it the 5 star rating, which I don&#39;t do all that often (I don&#39;t think) is that they have a great Tea Happy Hour, where for two hours you can get any tea on their extensive list at a discounted price. <br><br>I&#39;m on a crazy horrific student budget (eating 3 squares that don&#39;t involve beans can be a challenge some days), but I&#39;ve got to get out of my pint-sized apartment and work and when I do, I often come here. <br><br>I&#39;ve discovered new teas and tried a wider variety than I&#39;d thought possible.

You get as many helpings as you want and all they ask is that you don&#39;t die in the restaurant.<br><br> This place also has Brazilian dancing at the weekends so it&#39;s best to come around that time. The ambience is rather like a canteen in many ways, with rows of long tables where friends and strangers eat together. Eventually, the dancers (which includes the cooks, by the way) get around to convincing everyone to jump up and conga around the place.<br><br> Ridiculous, but fun!",

And since another companion of mine suggested this as an alternative, we headed here to try it out. The fact that it was very close to the metro station was also a good plus.<br><br>We didn&#39;t realize that there were two lines, which separates chicken and beef. It wasn&#39;t clear at the outset, so while we were still eyeing our options, the guy at the empty counter said &#34;Bitte schön&#34; and so we ordered. When we learned it was the chicken stand, I was a little disappointed, but still ordered one, as the beef stand had about 5 people lined up.<br><br>Anyway, even though it was chicken, it was a great choice, great enough that I am willing to give it 4 stars. I only wonder what the beef tasted like. But since the waiting time isn&#39;t 45 minutes, I am more than willing to give it a try. This is definitely a great alternative to the more famous one, though I still say that there is a reason why there is a 45-minute wait on the other one, because it really is very good.",

The food  is very nice indeed, their meat, fish and vegetable dishes are all made and presented well, by staff who want you to enjoy the food and atmosphere and want you to return. Naturally we would expect that in every restaurant but, it is, unfortunately, not the case. I have eaten in 3 Greek restaurants in the area (one closed a few years ago) and Taverna Dimokritos is the one that stands out for me, great food, great service, reasonable price  and no airs and graces.

It is a very simple place, I usually come to have a quick lunch on my break or sit for a good small sushi dinner. Prices are good, and between 11:00 and 16:00 you get %30 off. They allow my dog come in and sit with us, and they offer free Wi-Fi (just ask for the password). As a vegan, it is easy to order many great tastes, I love the avocado - peanut maki. I am glad to have this hidden gem next to my house!",

"reviewcomment":"A wonderful lounge area, wonderful roof with a pool and a view towards the TV Tower over Berlin-magnificent, and to that is a relaxing mini theater (where you can lay!) . The prices are very high and the service is from a scale from one to ten a eight and a half. I am amazed that the waiters can speak English and German so congrats for that. Although, I am wondering their experience in service since one of their cooking employees came into the very small and cramped elevator when like five us were already inside. Maybe I am being stingy but service is service. <br><br>Best of all is the free wifi! Although in America it&#39;s a common thing to have wifi almost in every shop, Germany is still adapting to that new custom. Overall the experience was good. <br>Also you must know that you must be a member to get inside the SoHo house and being a member is a actually a huge honor because you have to be recommend by at least two people who are members of the SoHo house and pay a monthly fee. I heard stars like George Clooney and Cat Blanchet were spotted there!",

"reviewcomment":"This is a great place for lunch as the set menu is always very good and also very reasonably priced. Where else can one escape with 3 courses for 25 Euros including a glass of wine and coffee (and tip) in a top-class restaurant in the centre of Berlin?<br><br> I used to come here years ago for dinners and this elegant place was instrumental for my decision to move into the area. But since I moved in, the management changed and the restaurant fell down a deep crevice in terms of quality and service. Over the last 2-3 years, I saw signs that they are crawling back up but they still have not quite made it back to their old apex. In the past, they would have easily qualified for a Michelin star. As it is, they still do not have one (and it shows) but they are charging prices as if they do. Oh, by the way, they also do the most expensive sushi in Berlin, which you can see hand-made by Japanese-looking cooks.<br><br> There is a luxury cocktail bar lounge area just inside the restaurant where one can listen to great blues and soul music tinkled on the piano and sung by various artistes after dinner time. This is a wonderful lounge, if only the drinks were a little cheaper, but it&#39;s still worth coming here once in a while to pass the time away on a dull evening.<br><br> The restaurant itself is a lovely place to dine and watch either (a) life moseying by in Alte Potsdamer Strasse, or (b) the cooks in action in the open kitchen. Both are entertaining, with my preference for the latter. The ambience is dark executive as befits the main restaurant of the best Grand Hyatt in Europe, but is intimate and cosy enough to bring friends along. Service is generally good and they even remember your name if you go there a few times. Or maybe they just remember weirdos like me.<br><br> Some years ago, I recall that they had also mispriced a Chateau Margaux 1988 on their wine list and we took full advantage of that until they sold out.<br><br> Ah, those were the days. Maybe it will get back to where it belongs but at the moment, the fact is Vox is a classy refined restaurant, with a great music lounge, serving good quality hotel food at premium hotel prices at dinner time. So the best deal there is their lunch set menu.",

The room itself was very spacious and comfortable. They also offer free wifi during your stay which is very helpful but you have to be sure to request the codes daily.  I loved the bathrooms which were stocked with plenty of amenities and the shower was great. <br>I plan to stick with the NH chain for any future visits to europe",

I&#39;m pretty sure it was at this location where I had my first Maredo experience, which involved sangria that was definitely spiked with something. I ended up on a park bench next to a dog I called &#34;Hundie&#34; after wandering around drunk at 3 in the afternoon. <br><br>That&#39;s not really relevant, though, and what is is that this is your standard chain Mexican food, with decent ingredients and an easy-to-understand menu (fajitas, steak, and the like).

"reviewcomment":"This was the perfect dinner for one of the coldest days this winter. With the outside temperture of -10C, we were warmed up with some interesting fondues, which are not just the typical Swiss fondues but also meat fondues with interesting chocolate or chili sauces. Each plate also came with a nice salad with a good balsamico dressing and everyone shared around their fondues. The only slightly negative point was that we had to wait quite long (as we were quite a big group) but at the end everyone was pretty happy and completely stuffed. The restaurant had no wine list but a very big selection of wines from various countries. So the waiters kindly made some suggestions which we could try, ponder over before deciding on a selection.<br><br> We had a great night out with lots of chatting and it was pretty difficult to leave around midnight and return to the cold. By the way, a couple of people complained about the &#34;stale&#34; bread. Just for your information, bread has to be hard and a little stale before they can go into a fondue. Otherwise fresh bread will just crumble away and dissolve into the cheese!",

"reviewcomment":"I had been waiting over 6months to visit this place. I am allergic to gluten and lactose, so naturally the paleo lifestyle fits with me. Having stumbled across the restaurant during a google search I was super excited to visit Berlin.<br><br>I am an Aussie, so when i stumbled across this restaurant i was 6months away from eating there, and my excitement was pretty intense when i finally got to eat there. <br><br>So a few hours before we went to eat at Sauvage, we checked out online what we were going to order. <br><br>When we arrived at Sauvage we were surprised by the atmosphere and the layout of the restaurant. We were seated at a cute little wooden table with candles as the only lighting. The rest of the restaurant is quite dark with candles lighting the way, which sets a great mood. <br><br>When we were given the menu to look over, i was disappointed to notice the two things i had decided on at the hotel before arriving were not on this menu. I was very disappointed, but also excited that i was able to eat and order anything off the menu, this has never happened before.<br><br>My friend and i each ordered a starter, a main, a dessert and a bottle of wine. The food was AMAZING!!! I was in heaven with each bite. My friend doesn&#39;t follow a paleo lifestyle, however was still impressed by the grain free bread and crackers, the apple and rhubarb crumble and the bacon wrapped quail. <br><br>I wished i&#39;d had more time in Berlin to go back to Sauvage for Breakfast, their grain free, gluten free, dairy free and sugar free options looked amazing. <br><br>For the 3 courses and a bottle of wine, we were only set back 70ish euro, which in my eyes is pretty good for the quality and the portion sizes we were served.<br><br>Will recommend this place to any one visiting Berlin regardless of allergies or health choices.",

I normally would not see a movie while on holiday but being that nearly everything is closed even large chain companies like ALL SAINTS on a Sunday in Europe. Even some of the restaurants were closed. I stumbled upon this indie theater that laid within a courtyard. You enter first an alley which walls are covered in street art. Murals and tons of wheat paste posters decorate the walls. Tables of a coffee shop and people roaming the little shops and a hidden bar is what welcomes you. <br><br>Kino Central is not playing the run of the mill films, no you will indie films are played here. Though I had seen Searching for Sugarman we thought it to be cool to see it with German subtitles. Best  part is that you can grab a beer or wine and take it in with you. The theater is small nothing huge nor fancy.",

"reviewcomment":"Found this on a recommendation from the owner of Little Ottik.  We had returned to Little Ottik one night as we really enjoyed it (and the owner is from Detroit like us),  but he didn&#39;t have any openings.  So we asked him where he&#39;d eat and he recommended Nansen.<br><br>So glad he did.  The food and service was great!  We ate outside--it&#39;s right on the canal, in a quiet area of Berlin.  Staff spoke great English (sorry, my German is passable, but not great.) and was very efficient and friendly.<br><br>Every course was wonderful.  Appetizers--an amazing yellow pepper soup that was so flavorful. (5.20 Euro)  Entrees--lamb (19.80 E) that tasted like lamb.  And perfectly cooked venison (23E).   This was some of the best food we had in Berlin.<br><br>Deserts shouldn&#39;t be passed up--it&#39;s like this is a 3* restaurant in hiding.<br><br>If we lived in Berlin, this would be our favorite place.  Not stuffy or too fancy--just a great location, great food and great service.",

"reviewcomment":"This place serves excellent Italian fare. It has its charm and is a place where one can have a long meal with friends and chat the night away. Their service is quite top notch for a little local restaurant in Germany. Personally, I have rarely received good service from any restaurant here, especially in Berlin.The wait staff was very attentive and actually took care of our table, came around with multiple utensils and extras, without us having to ask for new cutlery (which I find is absolutely ridiculous in some restaurants where you are having a few courses). Anyways, I was impressed by their attentiveness. <br><br>The olive oil tasted like the authentic stuff. You know, from the lady across the town in that little corner store, who hoards the flavorful variety. Also nice to note is the FRESH ground pepper. It really makes a difference folks. Combined with the good olive oil, the bread was yummilicious.<br><br>Their pasta is delicious and really rich. I forget what I had, but it was the one with pine nuts, raisins, swiss chard, and penne pasta, covered in a cream sauce. It was the perfect serving size after sharing some appetizers.<br><br>Our table had a bottle of Chianti, a few bottles of water, about 3 beers, 4 cocktails, the classic appetizer dish, and three main courses and the total bill came out to around 80 euros, which I think is ridiculously cheap considering our happy and full bellies, the great conversation, the nice atmosphere, and our slightly buzzed mood. We were fully prepared to conquer our next mission: operation dance dance dance. <br><br>Definitely will be coming back here again. I am not giving the place 5 stars because although the food is pretty good, I still have had better Italian food in Berlin. Also, looking at other tables, the pizza didn&#39;t look so appetizing.",

"reviewcomment":"This modern European bistro is located a few blocks away from where I live. They were also open early. Hence, when we needed brunch, this was a place we decided to try.<br><br>They serve brunch from 8:00 AM to 3:00 PM. They have several types of &#34;breakfast platters&#34; but given the amount of stuff in there, they are more brunch than breakfast. Perhaps I am just used to the idea of a small breakfast, and the things they offer look like lunch to me. <br><br>My companion got the Italian breakfast, which consists of several types of cured meat, cheese, an egg, and many other goodies. I on the other hand got the salmon omelette. They both come with complimentary bread, which definitely looked fresh. <br><br>The food was great, but the drinks were spectacular. I whole-heartedly recommend the &#34;Kaffee al Sheikh&#34; which is this shot of espresso, made with Arabian spices and cardamom. It&#39;s strong, bitter, and they serve it with a glass of water on the side, but it is amazing. It&#39;s a coffee experience. I also recommend the &#34;Karkadee Tee&#34; which I tried the next day, which is a herbal tea made from Egyptian herbs and spices.<br><br>Yes, things were so good here we decided to pay them a visit again the next day. So yes, this place gets 5 stars in my book. It is definitely as good as it gets.",

It&#39;s a huge complex set over 3 floors, all with space age interior design.<br><br> The changing area is really spacious and has a male only sauna attached.<br><br> On another level, there is a beautifully designed pool and wellness area with mixed steam room and sauna.<br><br> Finally, the main floor had a huge training area with machines and banks of tvs, and a reasonable free weights area.<br><br> I found the staff to be pretty friendly and most are bilingual. You get 2 towels when you come in, plus they have sweat towels available - a nice touch.<br><br> Of course, all this luxury comes at a price. A day pass is about EUR35 and I paid EUR125 for one month. Of course, paying monthly is cheaper, but you are tied into an annual contract.<br><br> So, if you&#39;re staying at the Hilton or work in Mitte and money is no object, then Holmes Place is for you.",

Il faisait très sombre et très bruyant à cause des nombreux écrans qui passaient des clips musicaux.<br>J&#39;ai pris une salade &#34;Carambar&#34; (11€90) qui consistait en une salade de roquette (même si le menu ne l&#39;indiquait pas) et de grandes crevettes cuisinés à l&#39;huile de sésame. Les quantités sont grandes ce qui est un bon point mais il est difficile de tenir une conversation tellement la musique est forte.<br>Nous n&#39;avions également pas beaucoup apprécié le fait que la bouteille d&#39;eau que nous avons commandé soit arrivé à la fin du repas.",

"reviewcomment":"Rustic, cozy restaurant right next to the Koepenick castle serving traditional Berliner dishes at very reasonable prices. Add outdoor seating, friendly service and micro-brews on tap, you can&#39;t go wrong. The Ratskeller is a basement under the civil hall complete with wooden tables, stained glass windows and Gothic ceilings. <br><br>My parents and I came here for dinner midweek and everyone raved at how delicious their food was. My mom went healthy with a garden salad topped with fresh fruit, grilled chicken and raspberry vinaigrette. <br>My dad chose the pork goulash in beer sauce with red cabbage and bread dumplings. The dumplings were fantastic, first steamed then sautéed crispy, awesome, a meal in itself. <br>The BF chose the beef Sauerbraten in red wine sauce, smoky potato mash and red cabbage. The roast was so tender he was able to fork-shred it.<br>Finally, there are three vegetarian dishes on the menu (somewhat non-German but to my delight) but I chose the Koepenicker Doppeldecker, which was 2 crispy potato roesti (hash browns) topped with graved salmon. The salmon was so tender it melted like butter on the tongue. Awesome dish as well.<br><br>If you&#39;d like to get out of the city center, especially the show-offy and touristy Kurfuerstendamm Area, and eat where the locals eat, this is worth a half hour trip on the S-Bahn. I guarantee it.",

"reviewcomment":"We were here for a late dinner yesterday, wanting to try out a new restaurant. So we tried this one, which I have to say, was an experience with good and not so good items. <br><br>Let me start with what I like. I like the design of their menu. Most restaurants (even those serving non-Western cuisine) follow a Western format, beginning with appetizers, a huge main dish section, and some desserts. Saigon Green doesn&#39;t follow that. Instead, they have just a few main dishes, and the bulk of the menu are these small appetizers (Vietnamese-style tapas, so to speak). So what we did last night was order 5 of those for two people, plus drinks. <br><br>Of those 5 dishes, most were very palatable. I loved the very spicy papaya salad, as well as the chicken and vegetable salad and the shrimp fritters. However, what I didn&#39;t like were the dishes that I thought were the staple of every Vietnamese restaurant. Their spring rolls were too dry; yes, there was sauce provided, but I should say it was not enough to mitigate the dryness of the wrapper and the vegetables inside. Also, their bunh bao had too much dough in it. What&#39;s supposed to be a steamed rice mini-bread with meat filling turned out to be just steamed rice mini-bread. I should say I have had better bunh bao elsewhere, notably in that restaurant sharing a part of their name near Görlitzer Bahnhof.<br><br>So, overall, I am giving this place 3 stars. They had good things that doesn&#39;t make me want to not come back here again, but they also had not-so-good things that makes me want to continue and search for other better Vietnamese places.",

"reviewcomment":"My companion took me here for dinner one night. I am not a big fan of Chinese food, but he said I might change my mind after this one, so we ventured into Charlottenburg for this little restaurant.<br><br>As I was browsing the menu, I noticed that they specialize in Lanzhou cuisine: this already earns them 1 star, as I&#39;d rather go to a place that has a narrow specialization and does it well, than a place that has a wide specialization and does everything mediocre. China is a huge country, and I&#39;d rather go to a restaurant that would introduce me to a more specific type of cuisine.<br><br>The second and third star is for its food quality. They seem to have a lot of noodle-based dishes (maybe it&#39;s a Lanzhou thing, I don&#39;t know), but everything we ordered was fabulous. My companion is a vegetarian, but the things we ordered tasted something I didn&#39;t expect for vegetarian food. Glass noodles, deep-fried crunchy tofu, that was mind-blowing. <br><br>The fourth star is for the ambiance and atmosphere. It was clean, funky, modern, but at the same time, also rather traditional. I like the juxtaposition of the old Chinese-style furniture with the pop-art interior design. <br><br>The fifth and final star is for the fact that as much as I would like to find something bad, I cannot. Maybe their restrooms need a little bit of remodeling, but I am so willing to overlook that since their food is just delicious, and cheap too. Their entrees average around 8 EUR, and 12 EUR is high-end already. <br><br>Needless to say, I am definitely going back here. This is good Lanzhou cooking; it gets full points from me.",

The service was friendly and with a smile which I haven&#39;t experienced before.

It seems to be considered a random side that you douse with dressing. <br><br>The atmosphere was good - sit outside if you can, though away from the smokers if possible.

Quality of fish was ok, not great, and the rice used was again too salty.<br>Spent about 18 euro in total, including service charge.",

It was unusual enough for my friend and I to stop our Berlin tour and sample this unusual &#34;delight&#34;. <br><br>The verdict: Black olive ice cream should not be attempted solo. They did well capturing black olive&#39;s flavor and its salty brininess. The lemon curd pie was perfect, but a tad sweet. But when paired together..... the brininess is neutralized, it&#39;s less sweet, and overall delectable. A winning juxtaposition if eaten together. Bravo for a unique dessert.",

They did an incredible job renovating it and turn it into a modern Beergarden &amp; Restaurant at the Schlachtensee.<br>I spent some great evenings sipping their tasty Bowle and chatting with friends the night away over there. But its pretty nice all year long, in winter time they serve hot chocolate and mullet wine to warm you up after a stroll around the lake or even some ice skating if you dare to step on it. During the Weekends it tends to get too packed and you could queue for ages to get a refreshment or a sunny spot. <br> If you look for a &#34;nature break&#34; of Berlin busy city life, take the Sbahn down there and enjoy a chilled glass of Bowle during the summer!",

"reviewcomment":"Wow. Vux is located a short walk from my flat and I am astounded it has taken me this long to finally try it.<br><br>The verdict: nothing short of amazing. The bagel sandwiches are reasonably priced and loaded with all sorts of goodies. Mine came with seitan, a spicy-fruit habanero-mango sauce, veggies and fake cheese. It was perfectly spicy and filling, and a complete step up from the generic &#34;bagel with hummus and sprouts&#34; that I&#39;m typically limited to in American cafes.<br><br>The coffee I had along with my meal was normal, which means it was good, and came with a small coconut-y cookie, which pleased me, because normally I can&#39;t eat the cookies that come with coffee. <br><br>For dessert I had a chocolate cupcake with peanut butter frosting. For the pricetag of 2,50 the cupcake itself was pretty standard - similar to every vegan cupcake I&#39;ve tried or made. But the frosting was out-of-this-world delicious. I think frosting shots are stupid but I totally would have bought one if Vux sold them.<br><br>The location itself is great. Small and cozy and clean inside, with a couple additional tables outside on a quiet street. The only thing keeping this cafe from five stars are subsequent visits.",

I stumbled upon this delightful chain whilst trying to find my perfect Berlin accommodations.  Hostels and I are not friends.  But I&#39;m also not a millionaire.  Enter Motel One.  They have something like 5 locations in Berlin. I picked this one in Kreuzberg.  And I am so pumped that I did.  <br><br>First off it is literally like 30 steps to the subway, so you are zipping along to other parts of the city in no time.  Its also in a fun neighbourhood.  Think hipster meets punk meets students.  I was quickly and safely able to walk to tasty restaurants and some pretty dope bars and lounges.  <br><br>The rooms are fantastic.  I was blown away.  Adorable colour scheme, big shower stall, comfortable beds, AIR CONDITIONING!!! And for an extra 7 euros you get wifi in your room AND a buffet breakfast.  That breakfast blew my mind.  Our North American hotels should start taking notes! Fresh buns, fresh cheeses, fresh meats, soft boiled eggs, yogurts, fresh fruit, coffee and teas.  Oh and they let you pay your hotel bill in your home currency which means Visa couldn&#39;t ding me an exchange rate! <br><br>Again, Motel One is the bomb.  Go. Stay. Enjoy!",

No meat.<br><br>We decided for the buffet and one extra order of banana curry. Many dishes have organic ingredients, and tasting the dishes, we all felt that the ingredients were fresh and picked with care. The buffet was delicious and variable, it offered a wide range of flavors, all without meat.<br><br>Even though I do enjoy meat, and I did struggle entering this place ones I found out it doesn&#39;t serve meat, I have to say that I am glad I went.<br><br>This is one of my new favorites, and given the amount of great Indian food places in Berlin, that is a compliment.",

"reviewcomment":"5 STRONG stars!<br><br>Had an amazing evening here.  Looked this place up by googling wine bar berlin.  Found Rutz weinbar.  Then I used Yelp and U guys said it was great.  YES IT IS!!<br><br>Came in w/out a reservation but it was early.  They asked if we wanted the wine bar on the ground floor or the Michelin starred restaurant upstairs.  We chose the wine bar.  We were seated at a table and our coats were taken.  A cute purse holder was attached to the table for us too.  The service was charming.  Really nice.  Attentive<br><br>The food was amazing.  I had wine (of course) an d a lovely salad and a salmon dish and my friend did the secret dinner which was 3 or 5 courses- you choose and you tell them your dislikes or restrictions and they wow u.  My friend is not picky at all (nothing like me) and she LOVED her surprise dinner.<br><br>The wine and wine suggestions were right on.  The pours are small.  Prices are high.  It&#39;s classy.  It&#39;s worth it!<br><br>I dream over and over of this dinner.",

There is also a beer garden outside. My American friends love this place for its charm. I love it for the cakes! I could literally spend an hour browsing the glass displays without being able to choose!<br><br>The location is right in the historical center of former East Berlin, on the main street connecting the Brandenburg Gate and Alexanderplatz, Unter den Linden.

"reviewcomment":"Man, this place is amazing! <br><br>This is a &#34;shopping mall&#34; for interior design and home improvement. They have several shops that cater to pretty much everything you need when building a home. While we visited, we checked out a couple of shops that sell tiles, as well as a shop that sells lamps. <br><br>As this is a review of the shopping mall only, I won&#39;t say anything about the individual shops, though they tend to be more on the high end side of things. The mall, however, is well-designed, using plenty of natural light. There is plenty of space, and a neat little cafe at the ground floor. The elevators are see-through, and there is always a car waiting at every floor. <br><br>I would probably be back here, spending hours debating what kind of lamp we want in the living room, or what would be our next home improvement. There&#39;s plenty to see and get ideas from, but I would still shop around for other alternatives, since the shops here tend to be high end, so to speak. That still doesn&#39;t prevent me from window-shopping (for carpets, lamps, other stuff for interior design), however.",

I was in Berlin last fall for a work conference and a few of us stopped in here for dinner our first night. Since I didn&#39;t have Yelp Germany to rely on at that time, I had to count on my good friend Google (and Google translate) to help me scope out some spots before we left the states. My co-workers were grateful that I had come prepared and had some idea of the places that were in the vicinity of our hotel and the conference center. This place was the first stop on our list, and it definitely impressed.<br><br>The food seemed to  be typical German fare (based solely on one other prior visit to this fine city). Lots of pork. And endless potatoes, in any variety you could imagine. I went with the roasted pork with saurkraut and potato dumplings. Very filling, and very delicious. <br><br>Aside from the food, this is a good spot just for the interior ambiance. Very cute and homey decor. There were also an interesting variety of eclectic trinkets and wall hangings that kept us entertained throughout the night each time we spotted a new one. <br><br>If you&#39;re looking for something light, you should probably look elsewhere. But, if you&#39;re in the mood fora hearty German meal, look no further, this place will have what you need!",

"reviewcomment":"I was here last night for a meet-up with a few young folks from dear old Yelp. We were supposed to meet in a different location, alas, that location closed, so the meet-up shifted to here. Three hours later, we were giggling, laughing, taking pictures, drinking, and having fun. <br><br>This bar is something that slowly evolves through the night. When I arrived a little after 7:30, there weren&#39;t many people at all, just 3 tables occupied with small groups. Later on, the crowd grew and grew, until it was too much one has to shout to be heard. That&#39;s not a problem, though.<br><br>There are a few things that are rough on the edges in this bar, just like the city of Berlin itself. The furniture looks like they&#39;re all bought from a flea market, the restroom is riddled with graffiti (and it is hard to tell which one is the male and female restroom when both doors are closed, wait, where&#39;s the door again?). So I believe the key to enjoying this place is your own company. Bring a bunch of friends and have a great time with them. <br><br>One thing preventing me from giving it a full 5 stars is again the fact that smoking is permitted inside. As much as I enjoyed being there, I hated the smell my clothes have upon leaving the place.",

"reviewcomment":"This place supplies ingredients to several restaurants that I know, so the quality of the stuff here is never less than excellent. The only problem is that much of the meat is sold vacuum-sealed in rather large portions. For example, one cannot buy a portion of foie gras - it has to be a whole one, and it&#39;s the same with calf sweetbread. But the fish section is much more reasonable as the fishmonger will cut fish to size for you and also fillet and remove the skin if you ask nicely. There are also several cheeses which are hard to find elsewhere. The only let-down is the selection of wines, which are a little haphazard and a little too focussed on Spanish and Italian.<br><br> So, if you want the finest ingredients at prices lower than the KaDeWe, this is the place to go. But please do go early as they can run out of stock of certain items by the end of the day.",

But the dish initially was sold from small street stands and became popular with construction workers after the war, and I wanted to try Currywurst from one of these stands. At our hotel, we were told the most iconic Currywurst places in Berlin are Curry 36 in the west and Konnopke&#39;s Imbiss in the east.<br><br>We got our Currywurst with casing, and just the curry ketchup on the fries, no mayonnaise. It&#39;s fast food, so the order is ready very quickly and is relatively inexpensive. There&#39;s no seating near the stand, you just eat quickly, standing up at one of the high tables, and then go about your way.<br><br>As far as taste, I think it was delicious. The fries took me back decades to my childhood. Germans use different potatoes than we do in America, and I hadn&#39;t tasted fries like that since I was a kid and lived in Germany.",

They wouldn&#39;t let me use there phone to call apple support germany either! They wouldn&#39;t allow me to log onto the wireless to use my skype, I had to go to starbucks, log onto wireless so i could use skype to call apple support germany! This is an authorized apple support centre?!!!! I think not. Apple should not be involved with this store.",

On a regular night the cover will not be too expensive, but on a special night the price can sky-rocket.<br><br>The club is huge, with three big rooms, multiple bars, and an outside area. This club feels like a good cross between Villa and Berghain when the place really gets going and it gets quite full attracting all types of people but a lot are Berlin-minded people.",

Vino e Libri is a real, proper Italian restaurant, which is also why the staff speaks cute broken German. If you speak Italian go ahead and have a chat with them. The menu has a decent size, ranging from pizza and pasta to risotto and fish dishes. They also have a weekly menu with dishes ranging from €5-€10. It is a save place to go if you want good Italian food. The staff is nice here, but once in a while you will get a &#34;grumpy&#34; italian, especially when you come in a bigger group. All in all, I like Vino e Libri though and the food is also yummy, but nothing über special. Great for lunch though.",

I was starving, but as my companion is a Spaniard, I guess it is perfectly normal for him to have dinner at that time. Because it was late, the restaurant wasn&#39;t full, and we immediately found an empty table.<br><br>I ordered the No. 42, which according to the English description in the trilingual menu, was a platter of the eternally turning skewer of meat. My companion on the other hand ordered something else; the plate looked pretty, but I didn&#39;t try it. My platter on the other hand came with a lot of meat, and some bread, or was that bread? Underneath the meat?<br><br>We both ordered the ayran, which is a yoghurt drink. It&#39;s a little saltier than the Indian lassi; I almost wanted to put sugar in it. But it was good too.<br><br>I am glad I had a good experience here; Hasir is a restaurant with at least 3 different branches in the city, and I had a bad experience with the one in Kreuzberg. This one in Schöneberg was a more pleasant and less life-threatening experience. I will be back.",

"reviewcomment":"We were desperately looking for somewhere nice for supper (well ok, we never actually set out to find somewhere horrid.) It was cold and everywhere we tried seemed to be way too formal, full, or a bit seedy. <br><br>We stumbled upon this place and peaked inside. It was warm, cosy, welcoming and everyone spoke Italian, which was useful (beuacuse my Italian is a thousand times better than my German). We got a table and were soon pouring over the lovely wine list and ordering lots of little bites to go with it. We both also had pasta, which was delicious and shared the delectable tiramisu. <br><br>Highly recommended!",

But at lunch time when the sun is shining, then it is really great. And it does taste too! The view from the boat and the moving vibrations of the boat are unique. There are often very long waiting times at lunch time because they don&#39;t have enough staff on board.<br>Video link: <a href='/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DBo9woO3-2EM&amp;s=119be9a44cc0f8ac6f706395391dd6e97f63dcc2051225c638f6d4e1d20a57ad' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>youtube.com/watch?v=Bo9w…</a>",

The food was fresh and tasty , the ambiance cosy, and the service very friendly and willing to speak English (I&#39;m ashamed to say my German was very rusty, but they were gracious and offered English menus). My husband, who is the gluten-free one, had Mediterranean veg for a starter, a side salad and a wonderful sort of reverse-cheese burger (cheese inside a minced-beef patty) with fries. <br><br>We&#34;d be happy to go back....",

Hate that about restaurants, but this one is great. <br>Can really recomand the chorizo, the fried one on page two on the menu. so good and spicy. The wine is also very good, bread perfect ( that says a lot about the place, bad bread, usually bad food) <br>The potetoes isn&#39;t the best I&#39;ve had, but then again, we ate them all, so they worn&#39;t bad! haha!<br>It&#39;s located in a great area as well, and if you like tapas, I can really recommend this one!",

They serve coffee and honestly my only complaint was the fact that it was bitter (but not worth docking a star). There is a display cooler with lots delicious looking divine treats and baked goods, as well as some bottle drink options. The hubby had egg sandwich for 3 Euro and I had a 3 egg scramble with cheese and added tomato with a small bread for 3 Euro, can&#39;t beat those prices especially when the food was good and served with a smile.<br><br>Both times we went we had no problems ordering as the lovely ladies spoke English (I really need to work on my German).",

"reviewcomment":"The Cafe Hardenberg. Yes. Spacious with some flair. Being opposite of the Uni and near the Art Uni as well it is every time when I go packed or near packed, Sunday afternoon being worst. The food is not bad and not so expensive, but I am a person who eats there breakfast or have just a &#34;Milchkaffee&#34;, which comes Berliner style in what in other places is used as a soup bowl and to soak it up you get a cookie with it. I never asked, but the calories of that in itself might actually equal a bowl of soup, the thing is rather filling, but then again I am not sure if one should count it as an actual &#34;meal&#34;?<br>The place is stretched over two floors, and has palm trees and shabby red velvet seats along the walls, where the shabby-ness is very essential to contribute to the flair. It has a great counter bar that reminds of Paris in the 1900&#39;s. It also has a huge mirror on one wall, so it seems even bigger than it already is. It has at some extremely attractive and at the same time annoyingly vain waitresses and once and a while same style waiters, so if you like that it is a great place to try your flirting skills, if you don&#39;t like that, well... the obvious, don&#39;t go there.<br>It has all in all an interesting atmosphere to hang out and be seen, and if you are young and pretty yourself you can sit there and after at least 20 minutes some eager guy will ask you if there is a seat free at your table, so that is not bad on a rainy cold afternoon on Berlin. Sadly, if you are not that young any longer this phenomena drizzles out, I guess there are other places then. On the other hand, once a boyfriend at the time was very pissed off with me, as I had waited for him there and one guy had asked to sit at my table, as the rest of the Cafe was totally packed (see above, Sunday...), so you can also get in trouble for the same thing, but maybe your boyfriend is not so possessive. <br>There are better avant-garde places in town, but for the relatively posh area this one will do to write on your novel and have a coffee with it, or to just sit there with only the coffee and no novel, and look great doing so.",

"reviewcomment":"This place was a bit hard to find, but we wanted to stop here to get a traditional German meal as our first meal during our trip to Germany. <br><br>I really enjoyed our meal here, but the service was not great. First off, we were not greeted when we walked in. We simply went to the back and took a seat. When the waitress FINALLY came to our table, she was pretty friendly and worked with us the best she could in English and with our tiny, tiny bit of German. They also had English menus, which was great! I was okay with the service not being great, as we were on vacation and were not in any rush. I think it&#39;s also a cultural difference to not always rush through meals :)<br><br>My husband and I had planned to share a soup and an entree, but this did not quite work out as we were hoping. The soup was AMAZING!! I think it was a potato soup with mushrooms. So good!! We wanted to share the pork knuckle for the entree and we thought we had communicated that clearly by pointing to the menu and saying only one with hand gestures. This did not work. We both got a massively large pork knuckle with red cabbage and potato dumplings. It was absolutely delicious, but WAY, WAY, WAY too much to each as an individual, especially since it was just lunch for us. It was definitely enough to share between two people. <br><br>The pork was really tender, and the cabbage was really well cooked. I am normally not a fan of the stuff but it was so good that i certainly had my fill. Oh yeah, and who could forget the beer...yum!!<br><br>I would definitely go here again for traditional German food and a couple beers if I made it back to Berlin. BUT I would go with a very empty stomach or try to learn a little more restaurant-ordering German!!",

"reviewcomment":"I was here with a companion yesterday for lunch. I was interested in what they offer since most of the South Asian restaurants I find here in Berlin are so tame and non-spicy at all, as they taper the taste to the German palates. So I didn&#39;t have high expectations of this place.<br><br>Anyway, when we got there, the place was not crowded at all, but we can see several tables marked reserved, and I suppose that was a good sign. I ordered a vegetarian aubergine curry, as well as a mango lassi. My companion on the other hand ordered some samosas and a lentil curry. <br><br>They gave us some of those crisp wafers for appetizers. The sauce was hot and spicy. That was a good sign. I almost wanted to order a portion of raita to cool things down, but my mango lassi did the trick as well. I liked the eggplant as well as the spiced coconut that came with it. My companion didn&#39;t like the samosas too much, however. <br><br>Overall, I am giving this place 4 stars, because for the first time, I found a place that serves spicy food. However, their service needs improvement. But then again this is Europe, customer service isn&#39;t on par with that in North America. So expect a little bit of a delay when you finally decided what you want to order and want to tell it to the waiter.",

"reviewcomment":"It made me incredibly happy to see many familiar Asian foods in this market. Being thousands of miles away from home, this market provided me with all the components necessary for making my favorite Filipino dishes.<br><br>My goal during my last visit was to pick up a few Filipino ingredients. Although, Japanese, Thai, Chinese, and Korean ingredients and specialty foods are also sold at Asia Mekong: Sauces and spices, dried seaweed wrappers, assortments of bagged and loose leaf teas, oodles of noodles, and frozen dumplings (give em a try; they&#39;re surprisingly good for being frozen!) can all be found. Even freshly made packaged foods like Kimchi are available for purchase in the refrigerator section. <br><br>What I especially enjoy about Asia Mekong are the familiar brands carried. I was fortunate to had discovered Spring Home brand egg roll wrappers, bottles of Datu Puti vinegar, and packages super sweet Philippine Dried Mangoes. <br><br>Prices are reasonable, I believe, especially if you&#39;re on a tight budget; though, fresh foods do cost a little more. <br><br>Service at Asia Mekong is efficient and friendly. They deliver some of the best customer service I&#39;ve experienced during my weekly supermarket trips.<br><br>Awesome selection of food, CLEAN shop, recognizable brands, and welcoming service: these are some of the factors that make Asia Mekong one of my favorite grocery stores to shop at in Berlin.",

"reviewcomment":"Quiet family island... Not far from railwaystation Tiergarten. In a very green area, around - a big park or even forest in the middle of the city. Most amaizing things - rabbits which are looking around for some delicious food as well as visitors. <br>Most interesting that they are open until 2.00 am! Good place for a family with candles on the tables, a room for children with different toys and even a small billiard which is used also by older visitors. The whole room is devided into different sections on different levels so you really can enjoy the calm athmosphere without seeing many peoples. <br>I give to the place 4 stars because the prices where are a little bit high - eg about 3 euro for a small glass of tee or a normal dish for 10-12 euro especially for a place situated not in a tourist area without distinct cuisine positioning. Everything is delicious but I would say nothing special. I took rice sate one day and big potatoe with mushrooms the other day but I would say that I was shaken, so the cuisine is good for everyday eating but not with their prices. <br>Summing up - good place for family or couples, quiet, big, but without any special zest.",

There weren&#39;t even that many people in there!<br><br>The only downside, and this was pretty annoying, was that the Wifi timed out every 30 minutes or so.",

"reviewcomment":"One of the best meals I&#39;ve had in Berlin. Absolutely perfect in every way. I came with a party of 6, we were seated immediately and met with very friendly service right away. We ordered some calamari, the appetizer sampler and some carpaccio. Everything was nothing short of incredible. The wine was delicious, they didn&#39;t make any fuss about bringing 6 hungry guys bread every 20 seconds as we inhaled it.<br><br>For the main I ordered the farfalle with salsiccia. it was so good! Al dente house-made pasta (very fresh anyway, if not house-made), seasoned and sauced perfectly, and just the right amount. I&#39;m a big eater and this left me in great shape, not too stuffed, not wanting more.<br><br>I tried my friend&#39;s calzone which was so nice and perfectly spicy. Very well made. <br><br>The ambience is nice, the music selection is incredible (this was one of the main points of the guy in our group who took us here), and the service was fast and friendly. Prices are definitely decent. It&#39;s not the cheapest night out, but for 3 apps, 6 mains, 3 bottles of great wine and a bottle of sparkling water we ended up at €35 each. Pretty damn good, I think!<br><br>Highly recommend this place. Good for dates and small groups, though not a place to be loud and wildly festive.",

There is a wide selection of vegetarian dishes, and although there is a sign saying &#39;Vegetarian Mexican&#39; there are still some meat dishes.<br>As well as a wide choice of food, there are alos loads of cocktails to choose from. Happy hour runs til 2am (like many bars in this area) and the cocktails are actually really decent. They are freshly prepared, have huge pieces of fruit (bananas, pineapple) as decorations. They taste delicious and aren&#39;t stingy on the alcohol content.<br>The waiter we had was amazing, making jokes with us because one cocktail took longer to make than the others, and had a chat with us at the end.<br>Overall a really good find, I&#39;m definitely going back!",

We originally planned to try another bar, yet we found out that it was a smoker&#39;s-only bar, so we searched for another one. We ended up here.<br><br>It was a Wednesday evening, and so it wasn&#39;t crowded. There was a toddler on the bar. I got a beer, while my companion ordered a hot chocolate, as he was moving away from alcohol for the time being due to a headache. Oh, we also ordered nuts.<br><br>I like the ambiance. I like the huge selection of drinks. They also have food, but it would be great if they have more finger food. Based on the menu, all they have a cheese of various sorts on bread. And nachos. <br><br>That being said, I would consider coming back here again. It&#39;s on a dead end in Mitte, which makes the place rather quiet, and the experience of catching up and shooting the breeze in a tucked-away place is quaint at times.",

"reviewcomment":"Dieser Laden ist kaum zu übersehen, wenn man daran vorbeigeht, denn es ist immer ganz viel los darin. Das Restaurant ist jedoch leicht zu übersehen  es liegt im hinteren Teil des Geschäfts und ist so gut wie immer voll. Die Spezialität des Hauses oder Kumpir ist eine Ofenkartoffel mit Butter und Käse, zu der man viele diverse Salate bestellen kann, die dann auf die Kartoffel als Topping kommen. Es gibt: Couscous, Karottensalat, Nudelsalat, russischen Salat (der eigentlich nicht wirklich russisch ist, da andere Zutaten wie grüne Erbsen, Würstchen, Salzgurken etc fehlen), Mais, Oliven, türkische Würstchen, Pepperoni und vieles mehr. Das ganze kostet nur EUR3,90 und ist gerade für den Wedding angemessen. Die Ofenkartoffel gibt es auch außer Haus und die nehme ich häufig mit. <br>Allerdings lässt der Service zu wünschen übrig. Ich habe dort früher immer Köfte zum mitnehmen bestellt und habe jedes Mal deutlich gesagt, dass ich den Salat ohne Dressing und die Pommes ohne Mayo haben möchte. Das wurde zwar an die Küche so weitergegeben, wurde von der Küche wiederum nicht umgesetzt. Ich bekam dann die Speise natürlich mit Mayo und den Salat mit Dressing. Und jedes Mal, als ich die Bedienung darauf hinwies, gab es zunächst lange Diskussionen mit der Küche etc. und ich musste weiterhin auf mein Essen warten. Schade darum<br>Aber da die Ofenkartoffeln immer vorne zubereitet werden, kann man vor Ort bestimmen, welche Toppings man auf der Kartoffel haben möchte. <br>Für mich kein Köfte mehr, aber definitiv wieder Kumpir!",

"reviewcomment":"The Renger-Patzch Restaurant is an insider&#39;s tip. Lovely, casual atmosphere with long benches belies the very fine food. Start off by sharing one of their Tarte Flambees (a bit like a pizza but lighter as it&#39;s made with pastry rather than bread dough, and many would say tastier) and take your pick of one of their amazing mains. I&#39;ve eaten here countless times and have never been disappointed. Word of warning though  if you order the pork main dish, which comes with sauerkraut, be prepared for some serious commitment to pork (<a href='/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FMonikasays.com&amp;s=2839e5dd01724ee8836a8a606a5904598202b9106ad30969ab42fe87eb5dff2c' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>Monikasays.com</a>)",

It was a very interesting and educational experience.<br><br>Since this is the seat of the German federal government, there is heavy security. It&#39;s like an airport. So we got in, and had to present a valid identification. The guards checked it against a list of guests they already had at that time. So one cannot simply walk in and say they would want to visit. I personally registered a month in advance, because I knew someone who had access to tours, and when I checked their website, it seems that tours are not typically done.<br><br>Oh well, after security, we toured the building, guided of course. Pictures are allowed, but pictures of the guards are not. Architecturally, the building is superb. I love it. Way more pleasing to the eye than the White House. And what I like a lot is the fact that the guards were actually polite and treated us very professionally, unlike other uniformed people in that other continent across the ocean. <br><br>Overall, I liked my tour here last night. It was a very interesting and informative evening.",

You&#39;ll be sitting next to young and old and one thing&#39;s for sure, you&#39;ll not be sitting next to them for long.

I entered this establishment, and while it is a bookstore, I think it is more of a specialty bookstore, more along the lines of an antique bookshop. Thus, the target audience of this store would be very small.<br><br>And who are the target audience? Those who are interested in architecture and art. Yes, most of the books seem to be about architecture and art. There are plenty of coffee table books about photography, art, modern art, buildings, nudes, and so on. But this isn&#39;t the place to buy your next paperback novel you&#39;ll be reading while commuting on the S-Bahn, nor is the place to buy your next travel guidebook for your next vacation. <br><br>So there, 3 stars. Just OK. That being said, I think I know where to look in case I want to gift someone a coffee table book.",

I spied Kaffee Raum and popped in quietly, took a seat at a plush green couch in the corner, settled up with a good book....<br><br>A bowl of Cafe Au Lait (a bowl! I love it...) and the eggs, bacon and toast plate was just perfect. A light little brunch that left me full, but not feeling heavy. A quiet place to read (it seems a lot of readers cluster inside!) and polite service.<br><br>I returned again for a breakfast meeting a few days later, and enjoyed their outside seating, sunshine, the Fitness Fruhstuck (I liked the one at Alpenstuck Backeri a bit better) which was nice...and another bowl o&#39; coffee.

"reviewcomment":"Plenty of differently themed saunas, steam baths, hot tubs and cold tubs, reclining chairs indoors and out and a pool in which you can swim from indoors to outdoors. And there&#39;s an hourly saunaaufguss in two of the saunas<br><br>Restaurant is so-so - okay if you find that you need a snack but not good enough that I&#39;d plan ahead of arrival to eat there.<br><br>Staff generally doesn&#39;t speak English and all signs etc. are in German, so as a service to those who don&#39;t understand German language and/or German sauna/spa culture here&#39;s a quick intro to avoid getting you into awkward situations with staff and other guests.<br><br>The biggest shock to people from some other cultures will be that saunas are mixed gender and swimwear is not allowed inside them, meaning that people are in the nude. You can cover up in your towel if you&#39;re shy, and outside the saunas and in the big pool bathing suits are allowed, but nowhere are they required. In addition there&#39;s a section for women only (with a couple of saunas and hot and cold tubs I believe, but naturally I haven&#39;t been there). This mixed gender nudity is completely normal in saunas in Germany (and several other civilized countries) and it is not connected to anything sexual. I&#39;ll assume you&#39;re smart enough to figure out that it&#39;s not cool to ogle nude people so I don&#39;t have to tell you.<br><br>In the sauna you&#39;re supposed to sit on your towel, and to not place your feet directly on the bench below. A large towel makes this easier. Also, a short physics lesson for first timers: You might think that it&#39;s warmest close to the sauna oven, which means on the lowest shelf. But hot air tends to rise, so actually the higher you sit the hotter it gets. If you&#39;ve never been in a sauna before I recommend starting low.<br><br>Stay quiet in the saunas, and don&#39;t be loud anywhere on the premises. People are here to relax, and loud talk is frowned upon. Also, mobile phones are not allowed so leave them in the locker. I assume the same goes for laptops, cameras and other gadgets and I can&#39;t recall ever having seen a piece of electronics in here.<br><br>Do not go directly from the sauna to the cold tub or pools. Rinse off in the shower first. Yes, it&#39;s soo nice to run out of the sauna and jump directly in the cold water, but hundreds of people go in the same water and none of us want to swim around in the others sweat so basic hygiene is to be observed.<br><br>There a &#34;saunaaufguss&#34; in two of the saunas once per hour. In practical terms this means that a member of the staff will come to the sauna, throw some scented water (which quickly evaporates) on the stones of the sauna oven and swing a towel around to mix up the air. The effect of all this is that you get a whiff of whatever the water is scented with and, most importantly, the higher humidity makes the air feel a lot hotter. The time and scent of the next aufguss is announced on a sign next to the sauna, and it&#39;s advisable to be there a few minutes early as it tends to get crowded. Again, if you&#39;re new to saunas I highly recommend starting out on the lowest bench. Also, opening the door during the aufguss is frowned upon as it lets hot air out and cold air in so don&#39;t leave prematurely unless absolutely necessary.<br><br>Do not reserve reclining chairs by leaving your towel on them when you&#39;re not using them. Or at least that&#39;s what the signs say, in actual practice you often see 90% of the chairs empty, yet still with towels and other crap marking them as reserved, which can make it difficult to find a seat, especially if you&#39;re two or more people who would like to sit together.<br><br>It&#39;s highly advisable to wear slippers as the floor is slippery in many places. Also, your towel is not unlikely to get drenched so bring an extra and leave it in your locker so you can dry off properly once you&#39;re done. Bring a bottle of water as sweating in the sauna can make you thirsty, and bring soap and shampoo as well.",

But the street is kinda dark, quiet and looks like there are only flats with nothing note worthy.<br><br>Wellll guess again! It has a hidden bbq spot you really should visit and we&#39;ve had some of the best bbq I&#39;ve known! The meat platter is huge, for €25 you get to choose 3 types of meat and 1 side, real American style. You get a platter with 3 big heaps of meat and a regular sized bowl with whatever side you ordered. <br><br>The staff is very friendly and funny, real cool guys. The atmosphere is very chill and you sit at big tables that you share with other people. The decor is cool too, brick walls, big paint outs of a pig and cow, vintage lamps and chairs. <br><br>I haven&#39;t had that many real bbq in my life so I don&#39;t know if this is the best I&#39;ll ever have but for now it sure is!",

"reviewcomment":"The Berlin Marriott is a fantastic property and truly one of the best properties I&#39;ve stayed at in the Marriott family of hotels.  Located in the Postdamer Platz area of Berlin, the hotel is within easy walking distance to most of the major sites in Berlin and has easy access to the subway.  In fact, during the winter, there is often a winter village setup right around the corner!  <br><br>Beyond the location, the service here is phenomenal.  From the moment our taxi pulled up, all the staff was incredibly friendly and helpful.  The property itself is also very well maintained.  It was completely spotless and there people constantly cleaning.  For our stay, my wife and I, as Marriott Rewards Platinum members were upgrade to a nice superior room and were granted lounge access.  <br><br>The room itself was a nice size with very modern (but not pretentious) decor.  The bathroom was simply amazing, though water does have a tendency to seep out the shower door if you aren&#39;t careful.  The bed was also quite comfortable, which wasn&#39;t the case with the other 2 Marriott family properties we stayed at in Europe.  <br><br>Our room also included nightly turndown service with chocolates!  The cleaning staff were also very friendly, though they seemed to be the only staff that couldn&#39;t speak english.  Not really an issue, though, as they seemed to at least understand what they needed to know.  <br><br>The Concierge Lounge here (free for MR Gold &amp; Plat) was also excellent.  Very beautifully kept with ample seating and great selections of food and drink.  The only downfall was that you couldn&#39;t take a bottle or two of water with you to your room.  But free food and drink is hard to complain about, especially when it&#39;s of high quality as was the case here.  <br><br>I&#39;d wholeheartedly recommend this property to anyone visiting Berlin.  The service, the rooms, everything is just perfect.  A truly great stay in a wonderful city!",

"reviewcomment":"Imagine having to wait 1-2 hours for a burger and fries and discovering that you have made a terrible terrible mistake. Welcome to Hamburger heaven! They provided what may have been some of the worst hamburgers I&#39;ve ever tasted. They don&#39;t ask you how you want your hamburger cooked and so you get it cooked well-done. <br><br>I should thank them though, because I&#39;d never suffered the experience of truly tasteless french fries and they were kind enough to serve me up a portion. Finally that ketchup is that weird sweet marinara sauce style German ketchup which is just not very good. This review is really for Americans. I&#39;m a New Yorker who loves Berlin and really enjoys the food there, but I recommend not eating the German version of American food, unless you are not looking for American food. The one saving grace is the cook who was exceptionally nice.",

"reviewcomment":"Nothing like a chick with an eyepatch and a sign declaring &#34;Suicide Sue&#34; to get your attention. I walked in and sat myself. I perused the English menu and soon noticed their specialty - spreads. They are heavily featured in the first section, offering several options, including brunch for 2+ people, that promote their spreads.<br><br>I chose the veggie option which came with cheese, olives, tomato slice, rocket, 4 bread slices, bread, butter, and 3 spread choices. I selected turkey-pineapple-curry, beetroot-horseradish-apple, and brie cheese-dates.  My favorite spread was the beetroot. It reminded me of a typical Christmas dish my mom makes. My least favorite was the brie-dates. It was a pungent biting flavor that wasn&#39;t balanced with the present dates. The most memorable cheeses were the fresh mozzarella and a taleggio-like cheese (creamy, slightly salty rind). <br><br>Overall, it was a great meal. I enjoyed mixing and matching spreads to breads. My table also had 4 salt combination options - hibiscus, chili, saffron, and herbs (the hibiscus and herbs labels were switched however).",

"reviewcomment":"If you&#39;re in a mood for traditional German cuisine, this is a place to get it!  The restaurant is a little out of the way from all the touristy places in Mitte, and you&#39;ll get a glimpse of a residential part of the city, Friedrichshain, that most tourists don&#39;t get to see. <br><br>The building has an interesting history which used to be an electric power transformer station, and depending on the evening, it offers entertainment venues as well.  The restaurant is renovated impeccably with a beautiful open space.  We had a great table right next to the window on the balcony and had a great view of the restaurant. <br><br>The food was as good as expected.  We ordered Schweineschnitzel, Argentinian rump steak, and duck, and everything was cooked to perfection.  The only disappointing thing was the quality of the steak which was subpar, and for such a nice restaurant, I expected they would serve better quality meats.<br><br>The service was excellent ... the best we&#39;ve had in Berlin during this trip, and although we were the only table with a child, I appreciated that the waitress was interacting with our son and treated him like a patron instead of ignoring him as in other restaurants.  <br><br>Overall, it was a great dining experience!",

"reviewcomment":"Of the plentiful offering of Christmas markets in Berlin, the Rixdorfer Weihnachtsmarkt is perhaps one of the better options. The ambiance is much less commercial and more homey than many of the others, and the fact that it only runs for a weekend means it is extra special.<br><br>Unfortunately, this short running time also means that the market is packed with people, as everyone only has three days to visit. During the few hours I was here, from the late afternoon to the early evening, it was nearly impossible to maneuver the crowd. My bet is that arriving closer to the opening time guarantees less people (not to mention, the result is warmer feet).<br><br>Still, I did enjoy seeing all the handmade goods at the various booths. Some of them were pretty standard, but others were rather unique. This market also had a large amount of vegan food options, such as cookies, and although the vegan chili was just OK in taste, the fact that something warm and hearty was offered for the animal-free palette made me happy. <br><br>I would highly recommend that everyone visit this market at least once, as it really is able to capture the charm and feel of what the village of Rixdorf must have been like years ago.",

The weather was nice so we opted to sit outside, watching people pass by while chatting away. <br><br>I don&#39;t think I can give more than 3 stars for this place. The furniture was nice; this place has major retro style, with old chairs, old atmosphere, old ambiance. But perhaps the staff was old as well, because we waited more than 10 minutes outside and nobody came to take our order, even though we were clearly visible through the window.<br><br>So, ten minutes waiting, and my companion already just couldn&#39;t wait so he went inside and placed our order at the bar. Note that the place wasn&#39;t busy at all. Anyway, our coffees arrived, and somehow, the moment we finished them, then the staff came out and asked if we wanted another one. We said no. <br><br>Overall, the place is nice, but it&#39;s lacking in other aspects. The staff needs to fix their timing skills.

After dinner one night, my companion and I decided to check this place out, not really having a goal to buy something. We saw that they have clothing, appliances, accessories, and others.<br><br>They have a USB-powered desk fan!<br><br>But perhaps what caught our eyes the most were the nifty porcelain toothbrush holders, and we were searching far and wide for that. It looks very simple, yet it works! We bought two, and sure enough, we like how it looks in our bathroom.<br><br>Overall, this is a cool place. Small, but it definitely functions. Way cooler than the Swedish version of this concept, found in that gigantic warehouse in Tempelhof.",

They also have breakfast here, but I would rate it as average (with a star for the toast on avocado). The prices are ok, can even be cheap if you order a panini. Th eggs florentine are great (especially with a side order of avocado!). The pancakes disappointed me though, the serving size is pretty small and will leave you hungry. The toast on avocado is more american sized though and yummy! All in all the menu is not that big, but if you&#39;re craving eggs and/or avocado they have great options. If you like both you need to do a DIY order, but I think we can all handle that. I was not able to do any desserts, but the carrot cake looked delicious.",

Mournfully nicknamed the Tränenpalast (Palace of Tears) it was the site of many farewells for West Berliners visiting their friends and family in East Berlin. This part of the station is still standing today.<br><br> Although it is partly a shopping mall now the West Berlin platforms were home to duty-free shops prior to the fall of the wall as the communist authorities attempted to prise foreign currency from visitors to fund their bankrupt state.",

It may look small from the outside, but it is actually quite commodious on the inside, and it also exudes a warm environment.<br><br>The servers are quick to welcome guests, and they also speak English! Which is great because my German did not get me very far, but they still went ahead and tried to converse with me in German! (Good for practicing!)<br><br>I had the lambrusco wine, and I am generally not a fan of wine, but this was really good! And it was a little over 4 Euros for 0,25L, not too bad. (: I also ordered the spaghetti with bacon and egg. The proportion was really good, and the price was only about 7,50 Euros. This DEFINITELY beats most Italian restaurants I have been to in California -- especially Olive Garden!!<br><br>I really enjoyed my service and meal here. I may have to come back more often because it was that welcoming. (:",

"reviewcomment":"I&#39;ve never been one for pet shops or breeders so after convincing Ian to get a bunny, the first step was finding the animal shelter. Actually- the step before that was finding the word for animal shelter. Ah, &#34;Tierheim&#34;. We&#39;re off.<br><br>The place is out there - about an hour to get to by public transport. But it is so worth it! <br><br>The Tierheim itself is pristine. A hexagonal cement structure, everything was clearly marked with a pond and the dog section in the center. Parts of Aeon Flux were even filmed here/ <br><br>We entered the &#34;Bugs Bunny&#34; section with the rabbits. We entered a long hallway with the right side taken up by rabbits behind glass. Some were brown, some were gray, some were black, some were large, some were itsy bitsy. Nervously we surveyed the scene. Would there be a test or something?<br><br>After being ignored for 20 min (typical German customer service) we practically jumped on the first official. She explained the process, we paid 20 euro, and then it was time to pick a bunny. &#34;What should we look for?&#34; Ian asked. &#34;Dunno. A cute one?&#34; This was a tough order, because in case you didn&#39;t know, bunnies are crazy adorable. We picked basically at random, a tiny brown male. &#34;He hasn&#39;t been castrated yet. You could come back on Friday.&#34;<br><br>Oh. Yeah. You&#39;re cute little guy, but we are not making this trek again. Once again we walked the hall, considering an enormous spotted female named Ruth, a gray male named Boris, and a white and brown spotted guy named Hugo. For no obvious reason, we picked Hugo and re-named him Herr Schmidt. <br><br>This is undoubtedly the most beautiful animal shelter I&#39;ve ever seen and I highly recommend a visit just to check it out. Along with adopting out pets, there are care facilities, an old age area (!), and a pet cemetery. Go, volunteer, donate and adopt.",

I had carrot-orange soup and a redbeet spread with dark bread as a welcome (excellent), and then I ordered a veal consommé and a wiener schnitzel. The consommé was good and very well presented. The veal schnitzel was thin with a puffy crust, what a sight!<br>Although it was a little salty, it was very good. Two sides (potato salad and cucumber salad) were really good as well.<br>I would have given 5 stars, but the schnitzel was a bit too salty for that!",

Five-six-seven (?) different cheeses, hummus, turkish yoghurt, fruit, bread, sallad, it just won&#39;t quit!<br>Their coffee is not so strong though, so if you are a coffee drinker (which I&#39;m not really) you might wanna order your coffee black and put milk in afterwards. For me, the coffee with milk is just fine though.<br>They have free wifi, but it goes down around lunch time, 11-14 I think, don&#39;t know why. And in the weekends it&#39;s down from 7am until 3pm.. this is really weird and the reason why they don&#39;t get 5 starts from me.<br>The staff speaks English, the service is good and you should go there tomorrow!",

Exception:) I had quite a few  currywursts during my short stay in Germany. This stall made them tastier. I ordered Berliner currywurst (€2.50) and boy, it is so yummy! Love the combination of the tangy sweet ketchup with a hint of curry and the savoury taste of the wurst! I almost ordered one more but in the end, I decide not to waste my calorie intake on the same food. So I ordered bockwurst instead. It is cooked by steaming instead of the usual grilling for the other sausages. This is tad saltier with a smoked taste, served with mustard. <br><br>Great for on-the-go or those feeling a little peckish:)",

"reviewcomment":"Just outside Berlin lies Spreepark, an abandoned East German amusement park. Kulturpark Plänterwald, later known as Spreepark, opened in 1969 and at its peak was host to over a million visitors a year. In 2001, however, only 400,000 people visited the park and it was closed down the following year.<br><br>Today, locals and tourists alike risk the trespassing fine to view and capture Spreepark&#39;s headless dinosaur sculptures, roller coaster cars filled with leaves and Ferris wheel that spins slowly in the wind. <br><br>Yelpers if you care to visit, follow my detail instructions:<br>You have to take a train through a mountain and over a lake then climb a fence to get into the park, but when you do, it&#39;s beautiful...  The old Ferris wheel creaks, abandoned boats are strewn about. I don&#39;t understand why they don&#39;t sell tickets still! Maybe that&#39;s the charm of the park.",

We ordered our food eggs Benedict with ham and fried eggs with Texas style sausage links and hashbrowns (which I ordered extra crispy but that didn&#39;t work out)  apart from that the food tasted great and to go along with it I ordered a extra spicy bloddy marry and that was great. The place still needs some work but it kind of goes with the theme I guess but the service we received was really really good.

"reviewcomment":"On a recent trip to Berlin with 25 people, it was safe to say that finding space for our group was getting more and more difficult as the nights went on. With us planning on going to the nearby Cassiopeia later on, the trusty Yelp app helped me find this bar which was just up a side street and tucked away - in fact there wasn&#39;t even a sign outside telling you the name of it and most of it was covered in scaffolding (very Berlin - could be a cool permanent thing!)<br><br>Inside there was a DJ spinning quality classic chilled grooves, the bar staff were friendly and welcoming to us Brits and as usual for Berlin, the costs of the beer didn&#39;t set you back more than €2.50. The interior is all red leather and is a maze of small rooms, passages and cubby holes - a real cave of a place but it&#39;s surprisingly spacious. with loads of room in the back if there&#39;s a big group of you. <br><br>Overall a great find and one that sorted us out for a few hours before a heavy night of clubbing - sweet!",

Two stories chock full of cool, unique, hard to find things for the home and garden, with a selection of food and drinks tossed in for variety. Large selection of old-fashioned and unique tools and games, vintage or vintage-like furniture and accoutrements, a small clothes selection. Basically, just a well-selected assortment of cool stuff in a funky environment. Good place to go if you need a gift but have no real idea. It&#39;s the kind of place, by the way, where (after examining 1000 EUR coffee makers and wonderful leather chairs) you will leave with at least one trinket, like a ruler/level/pencil three-on-one doohickey. :)",

Once with Walid and once where we both went and were with Mariette. Walid was excellent as well. <br><br>I completed the tour and spent hours following up and reading further about the history.

It was 4pm I had severe sugar cravings kicking in and I was in search for something sweet<br><br> Like a bright light at the end of a tunnel I couldn&#39;t shield my eyes from the numbers of people emerging from this place. How could people eat ice cream in this weather I thought? My curiosity got the better of me and with a hop, skip and jump from the cafe opposite I was going to find out<br><br> There were eight flavours on display including erdbeer (strawberry), hazelnut, chocolate, lemon, pistachio and the rather delightful peanut caramel (which when mixed with the chocolate flavour tasted rather like a snickers bar - yum).<br><br> The ice cream was incredibly smoooooooooooth and for only 80 cents for a reasonable sized scoop, I now kick myself for not having tried all the flavours whilst I had the chance (doh!)<br><br> I can only imagine how busy this place gets in the Summer - especially with the nursery opposite - all those kids, mums and dads this place must be a goldmine! Certainly better than Haagen Daz ice cream.",

Upon closer inspection the place was called das edelweiss and is a cafe serving all sorts of breakfasts, which was handy seeing as I&#39;d not yet had any breakfast!<br><br> Inside it was more designed and cool than I was expecting it to be (you should see the state of the surrounding park). One other very noticeable thing was the number of dogs that they had around (there were 4). When someone walks in with a dog, someone will often bring over a dish with water for the dog! I guess you shouldn&#39;t come here if you don&#39;t like dogs :p<br><br> I ordered a standard cheese/meat/fruit/bread breakfast and was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the ingredients that they used, especially the meats.<br><br> There is free wifi, but unfortunately the guy working when I was in didn&#39;t know the password.

It is an understatement to say that it&#39;s busy - the traffic roar starts at 4 AM and lasts till late in the evening. The comfort rooms face the Spree or inner yard, which lets you slip much better. Comfy rooms, which could be more noise proof and excellent breakfast.",

Even at the best places back in San Francisco I never saw this! The atmosphere was nice -- relaxed, clean, comfortable -- and the music was so good it actually made me listen and take notice<br><br> Anyhow, I live about an hour and a half away from Berlin, and Restaurant Van Long is a compelling reason to make the trip",

Next, we enjoyed the steak carpaccio (which was momentarily baked with black truffles and parmesan cheese.)  We also also had the roasted white asparagus au gratin. (Spargel).  This was paired with a small salad and Schinken.  As an entrée, we had two variations of the pork platter; one with wine sauce, the other was lemon sauce.  This was accompanied by roasted rosemary potatoes, broccoli, and carrots.<br><br>Our waiter deserves an A+ for service, hospitality, and humor.  He was passionate about the food, and perfectly accommodating.  The interior and exterior are charming.  A Moto Guzzi theme... Absolutely perfect!!   We will be back.",

"reviewcomment":"The food is great. 5 stars for that. Just had a halumi teller(€5) and it was great. The service is quick. Seating indoor is a little awkward, low round brass unsteady platters in decorative bases. Outdoor seating is standard outdoor rickety green metal and wood Berlin benches.<br><br>Get the food, but get it to go.",

"reviewcomment":"Despite being a pain to get to, this modern gallery is well worth a visit; the art starts before you even get in the building with a couple of cool external installations.<br><br> Inside, the lower atrium contains the larger contemporary installations such as a to scale blow-up tank and the frame of a house&#39;s plumbing system (more exciting than it sounds - I promise).<br><br> There&#39;s are a few rooms off the main hall for mainly audio and visual installations, and the gallery upstairs traces some of the strands that have led to the development of modern art.<br><br> Overall, the lighting and whitewash provide the artists with a good neutral canvas. Thankfully, the art, whilst modern, is not too abstract to be enjoyed by armchair enthusiasts - although I&#39;m not sure how often the exhibitions last. There are the obligatory cafe and shop too for when you are all cultured out.",
