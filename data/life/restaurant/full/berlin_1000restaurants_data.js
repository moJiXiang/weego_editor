"reviewcomment":"Awesome service. Packed - make reservations. Pakistani food, NOT indian, as the only other english language reviewer, with no &#39;Friends&#39;, and one review, stipulates. It&#39;s not personal, or anything to do with her, though. It&#39;s this retarded, buggy &#39;Yelp&#39; system - eliminating many helpful reviews and yet leaving in a review from 2011, from a one-off reviewer.<br><br>{Edit: please also hunt for the mis-categorized  review from &#39;slowfood&#39;. &#39;It&#39;s too sweet/westernized&#39;, goes the review; worth reading. However, given the local community, this is expected. Menu items 108 through 113, are the hot and spicy items. And if you especially want hot and spicy, be sure to ask.}<br><br>Service was good, prompt; much more than can be expected for the city-area generally. This ethnic &#39;proud of my restaurant&#39; shines through. People spoiled on non-local service standards, may easily miss the extra, here, that good service provides.<br><br>The chai was respectable. The salzig lassi could have been saltier; otherwise excellent (salt to taste).<br><br>The fried vegetables were done correctly with a chickpea dough instead of wheat.<br><br>Murgh Salat was very sweet - not offensive - but sweeter than what i want for an evening meal. The mango pulp content made it incredibly sweet - i don&#39;t think any sugar was added. Says something for pakistani mangos, though. Mixed Pakora was good, however, again, the sauce was sweeter than i would have liked. A meat dish will be next.  ...<br><br>Music was not too loud. Bathrooms were private, heated and clean.<br><br>If you had a good experience at this restaurant, please let us know. If you want to thank me for this review, please mark below. Thanks :)",

"reviewcomment":"Burrito tested and approved by an American! And you could tell this place has some creds when there is a long line (mostly of hipsters) to order. It took about 20 minutes from line to getting my food, and the wait was worth it.<br><br>Dolores deviates from being an authentic Mexican burrito place given that they have a LOT of vegan-friendly options, but I applaud them for doing this. I&#39;m no vegan, but their &#34;green rice&#34; (basmati rice made green from fresh cilantro and lime juice) was better than most rice that I&#39;ve had in a burrito. I love that they have various types of sauces (i.e. tomato salsa, smoky peanut salsa, chipotle mayo, etc) and meats (and not just 1 but 2 types of vegan soy meats!) for you to try with your burrito. I had an adobo beef burrito with the aforementioned green rice, black beans, cheese, and extra guacamole. It was a HUGE burrito that I could have split into 2 meals, and it only costed 7 EUR. And with a homemade ginger lemonade to go with my meals, I was one happy girl!<br><br>Those searching for an authentic burrito might be disappointed, but if you just want to get a burrito with interesting flavors, then Dolores won&#39;t disappoint.",

"reviewcomment":"Okay, I have a confession to make. I have a true, deep, and undying love for... currywurst. I knew it before I visited Berlin, having fallen in love with it on the side of a mountain near Neuschwanstein when I visited Bavaria and Munich a few years ago. But, coming back to Germany for the first time since, I needed more. Lots more! (For posterity, because even though I have an addiction and I&#39;m not ready to go into recovery, I&#39;d better be honest: I had six currywurst in three days in Berlin...!)<br><br>Konnopke Imbiss is listed on most sites, including Yelp, as a Must-Do if you&#39;re a currywurst person, even if your love isn&#39;t as big as mine. When I looked up how close they were to where I was staying, I was even more excited. I immediately walked down and proceeded to order zwei currywurst mit ein klein pommes (two currywurst with one small fries). The total, I remember, was €5.70, which was freakin&#39; amazing, because in London it would have been over £10, which is what, $15 in the US? I love you, Euro. I love you too, currywurst.<br><br>Very, very good, even at 11am on a Monday morning. Great homemade ketchup, crispy fries, and traditional currywurst sausage cooked just right. Served piping hot with wee spear-forks, and all take-away and at a great price.<br><br>Like everyone says, Must Do. (For me, Must Repeat.)",

The mango pulp content made it incredibly sweet - i don&#39;t think any sugar was added. Says something for pakistani mangos, though. Mixed Pakora was good, however, again, the sauce was sweeter than i would have liked. A meat dish will be next.  ...<br><br>Music was not too loud. Bathrooms were private, heated and clean.<br><br>If you had a good experience at this restaurant, please let us know. If you want to thank me for this review, please mark below. Thanks :)",

"reviewcomment":"Went here four times in the space of a week as myself and my SO were staying nearby and it was wonderful each time!<br><br>We mainly sampled their breakfast offerings, which were all great; soft buttery scrambled eggs with ham, feta and tomato, fresh herbs, fresh yummy croissant, platters with fresh fruit and their cappuccinos- creamy and wonderful. If I lived nearby, I would definitely be a regular!<br><br>Service was relaxed, friendly and wonderful. Every server we encountered in there was helpful. Even with our smattering of bad German they were obliging and never standoffish! The price is good too, for under 10 euro breakfast will set you up for the whole day.<br><br>If you need a reliable stop for good hearty food in a relaxing atmosphere (in the mornings anyway - as it&#39;s a 24/7 cafe I&#39;ve heard that it&#39;s a go to spot for late night nibbles) then it&#39;s a safe bet. Next time I&#39;m in Berlin I&#39;ll definitely be making a return visit!",

"reviewcomment":"Delicious, fast, and cheap!  Prices are around 3,50 for a sandwich or 5 for a plate.  <br>We got four plates for five people and quite enjoyed our dinner.  <br><br>Options: falafel, fried eggplant, halumi (fried goat cheese), lamb shawerma.  The falafel is incredible fluffy and tasty, with five to a plate, and all the plates come with a mildly spiced and very creamy hummus + salad with cucumbers, carrots, and honey mustard.  They were out of shawarma by the time we got there (about 8 p.m., the place was packed with locals with bike helmets perched on their tables), so we got the three other options and a couscous salad, which was also delicious and slightly spicy.<br><br>I&#39;m not a huge halumi fan but the others liked it, and I did enjoy the eggplant and couscous a lot.  We also loved that he took our order and then fried the falafel, halumi, and eggplant fresh for our takeout boxes.  Super cool little shop for a cheap eat in the middle of Mitte.<br><br>Someone said they avoid Oranienberger strasse, which we&#39;ve also been told, but this is on Linienstrasse.  Adored the food, and the atmosphere was also very chill with all the packed picnic tables outside.",

The beer selection was smaller, but tasted fine. Overall, a solid place to grab a well priced meal and drink.

"reviewcomment":"My companion and I were out last night to attend a string quartet performance at the nearby concert hall, and as we were walking from the metro station to our destination, we walked past this establishment. My companion told me we should get chocolates, so I was pulled into this shop a few minutes before they were closing. I later realized that this is perhaps the best time to visit this place, when all the tourists have left and the place is almost empty. The influx of tourists in this shop is actually the thing that discourages me from venturing in in other times.<br><br>But now I realize why. It is a very swanky chocolate factory. You can see Berlin&#39;s landmarks made in chocolate. You can sit down and eat at a cafe upstairs. But for last night, all we wanted was a small bag of chocolates, so we made a small selection from the huge array of truffles and bonbons on display.<br><br>The shop looks very expensive from the outside, and their goods are very exquisite. Every bite was definitely worth it. And from what I can tell, the prices were rather reasonable as well. I&#39;ll definitely be back.",

We rode bikes through the side streets to hunt out this hidden brick courtyard deli, where you can wheel your bicycles right through and park them next to your  table.<br><br>A NY style deli, I couldn&#39;t not go for a fresh bagel with homemade cream cheese (you can get Philadelphia, but why would you??).  And I added a lovely coffee from south America (they have info on their extensive coffee offerings on their website, score!).<br><br>Husband got a quiche and a lemon tart. All cakes and treats are vegetarian friendly, without any animal fats or gelatin. (If you&#39;re lactose intolerant, gluten intolerant or vegan just ask, they are very on the up and up about that stuff).<br><br>It was a little on the pricey side, but considering their quality of ingredients and in-house policy on making just about everything, I think it&#39;s worth it.

Some of the first things I noticed were silverware that was readily available on the counter... which confused me, because they&#39;re burgers... completely makes sense once you see what you order. <br><br>MarienBurger was so good and the staff is friendly. It&#39;s a small joint, so taking it to-go is okay too. I ordered the MarienBurger (partially b/c I can&#39;t read German, so picking this burger that has the same name as the place seemed like a good idea). I had to pick my jaw up when I saw how big it was (which was pointless, since I had to stretch my mouth back open to eat this juicy beast). It has 2 HEARTY patties and your regular fixings on a burger, plus bacon. The burger itself was probably  at least 3.5 inches tall - I don&#39;t understand how people can eat this with a side of fries... Make sure to wipe your hands with the packaged wet napkins they supply!",

Or fried dumplings (they call them dim sum, but don&#39;t expect and carts here,) on what appears to be either melted ice cream or yogurt.  Something bizarre that shouldn&#39;t be good but is!  I also tried the seven minutes of pleasure, which is almost large enough for a main, that evokes memories pleasant memories and good taste sensations.<br><br>The mains are also just as creative and interesting.  Like spicy chicken with Szechuan pepper.  While it doesn&#39;t have a lot of that lovely/deadly/numbing ingredient it is there, so points for them.  The beef with sweet potato is amazing as well as the shrimp dish whose name I can&#39;t remember.  but it is served with a mango and tomato side that is very well done.  All the mains we&#39;ve tried are creative and cooked perfectly with good skill.  <br><br>A tip, get the &#34;best&#34; house wine, it is a very nice tempranillo and priced nicely.  the service is attentive and friendly.  Small, so get there early.  <br><br>Really, I feel this place is four and  half stars, but the disco bathroom buts it over the top!!!",

"reviewcomment":"Awesome service. Packed - make reservations. Pakistani food, NOT indian, as the only other english language reviewer, with no &#39;Friends&#39;, and one review, stipulates. It&#39;s not personal, or anything to do with her, though. It&#39;s this retarded, buggy &#39;Yelp&#39; system - eliminating many helpful reviews and yet leaving in a review from 2011, from a one-off reviewer.<br><br>{Edit: please also hunt for the mis-categorized  review from &#39;slowfood&#39;. &#39;It&#39;s too sweet/westernized&#39;, goes the review; worth reading. However, given the local community, this is expected. Menu items 108 through 113, are the hot and spicy items. And if you especially want hot and spicy, be sure to ask.}<br><br>Service was good, prompt; much more than can be expected for the city-area generally. This ethnic &#39;proud of my restaurant&#39; shines through. People spoiled on non-local service standards, may easily miss the extra, here, that good service provides.<br><br>The chai was respectable. The salzig lassi could have been saltier; otherwise excellent (salt to taste).<br><br>The fried vegetables were done correctly with a chickpea dough instead of wheat.<br><br>Murgh Salat was very sweet - not offensive - but sweeter than what i want for an evening meal. The mango pulp content made it incredibly sweet - i don&#39;t think any sugar was added. Says something for pakistani mangos, though. Mixed Pakora was good, however, again, the sauce was sweeter than i would have liked. A meat dish will be next.  ...<br><br>Music was not too loud. Bathrooms were private, heated and clean.<br><br>If you had a good experience at this restaurant, please let us know. If you want to thank me for this review, please mark below. Thanks :)",

I speak German, but my hubby doesn&#39;t, so they offered him a menu in English.<br>They have business lunch specials, and a large and diverse menu. If you are gluten-free, they offer plenty of tasty options. <br>The pizza size is generous and they have creative and traditional options named after the 12 apostles. My daughter had one with dates, feta, and Italian ham.<br>If you&#39;re visiting Berlin and hankering for non-German food, I recommend paying these pizza prophets a visit!",

It was also decently priced, I expected more on Kollwitz ;) Whilst waiting for my sandwich to be made I noticed all the lovely cakes they had as well.<br><br> I had to order a piece of cake as they looked just too good to pass up. Also, I had a look at qype before going and saw that the reviews have been great! I tried a piece of Sacher Torte, I have to say it was one of the best I have tried in many years. It had the lovely almond meal and chocolate cake, with the lovely jam and then covered with both marzipan and chocolate. It was incredible. The cake slices are actually inexpensive for the size and quality.",

Everything is simple.<br><br>You can watch the whole process of your ramen being prepared! Even the authentic preparation of noodles. And they will slice the egg with the string. <br><br>I allways ordered  Tonkotsu ramen because of the heavenly meat in it. The pork belly is divine! The broth is very oily but in combination with other ingredients and noodles it has so many flavors. <br><br>I have also tasted Miso Ramen but in my opinion it is not as good at Tonkotsu Ramen (also it has none of this epic meat in it;) <br><br>Will come back here many times in the future.

"reviewcomment":"Stopped by for a lunch while shopping nearby. The restaurant is set back from the road a bit, and as you approach the front door you can feel the hustle and bustle of the main street disappear into the serenity of the restaurant&#39;s courtyard.<br><br>We sat inside on couches in the main dining area, which was large and airy with a peaceful atmosphere. Long, communal tables in the center of the room suggest that this is an Asian experience tailored to German taste and convention. The food bore that impression out, to a certain degree, but not in a bad way. <br><br>[Rant Alert]<br><br>You see, if we want an authentic, say, Vietnamese dining experience, then Vietnam is a mere 13-hour plane ride away. We chose, however, to travel to Germany, where we want to have German experiences. So, if someone wants to Germanize a selection of dishes that is already by design a fusion of the vast array of Asian cooking, then all they have to do to get our vote is to make the food taste good.<br><br>[End of Rant]<br><br>We ordered miso soup, kimchee, a sushi selection and Thai noodle soup. All beautifully not-exactly-authentic. For a change, we weren&#39;t boozing it up and ordered 2 iced ginger green teas. Our friendly waitress (par for the course in Berlin) came by with 1 tea, and informed us that they&#39;d run out, but she could make us a hot version. Go on, then. The iced version was delicious, with a generous slice of pickled ginger and lime wedge bringing up various flavors and scents. But the hot version -- Yabba Dabba Doo! This stuff could cure anything from a stuffed-up nose to PMS. Fantastic.<br><br>BONUS: If you&#39;re in need of a little entertainment, hang around the bathroom area downstairs (not for too long, though) and watch people try to figure out what to do what they need to do. <br><br>All in all, a relaxing and flavorful experience that promised to be even better at dinnertime.",

"reviewcomment":"Awesome service. Packed - make reservations. Pakistani food, NOT indian, as the only other english language reviewer, with no &#39;Friends&#39;, and one review, stipulates. It&#39;s not personal, or anything to do with her, though. It&#39;s this retarded, buggy &#39;Yelp&#39; system - eliminating many helpful reviews and yet leaving in a review from 2011, from a one-off reviewer.<br><br>{Edit: please also hunt for the mis-categorized  review from &#39;slowfood&#39;. &#39;It&#39;s too sweet/westernized&#39;, goes the review; worth reading. However, given the local community, this is expected. Menu items 108 through 113, are the hot and spicy items. And if you especially want hot and spicy, be sure to ask.}<br><br>Service was good, prompt; much more than can be expected for the city-area generally. This ethnic &#39;proud of my restaurant&#39; shines through. People spoiled on non-local service standards, may easily miss the extra, here, that good service provides.<br><br>The chai was respectable. The salzig lassi could have been saltier; otherwise excellent (salt to taste).<br><br>The fried vegetables were done correctly with a chickpea dough instead of wheat.<br><br>Murgh Salat was very sweet - not offensive - but sweeter than what i want for an evening meal. The mango pulp content made it incredibly sweet - i don&#39;t think any sugar was added. Says something for pakistani mangos, though. Mixed Pakora was good, however, again, the sauce was sweeter than i would have liked. A meat dish will be next.  ...<br><br>Music was not too loud. Bathrooms were private, heated and clean.<br><br>If you had a good experience at this restaurant, please let us know. If you want to thank me for this review, please mark below. Thanks :)",

"reviewcomment":"My girlfriend and I were in search of a premiere German restaurant where we could enjoy some authentic food with the locals. <br><br>We found exactly what we were looking for at Schneeweiss. Cozy atmosphere with some MGMT and Donnie Darko tracks playing in the background but at just the right volume so that you can still hold a conversation. <br><br>We started off with the scallops and pork belly. I&#39;ve had better pork belly but I&#39;m also Cuban so that&#39;s not a fair assessment. However, I will say that the scallops were fresh and delicious and that alone is worth the price of admission. My girlfriend had the steak filet for her entree and I ordered the duck breast with goose confit and a quince-apple chutney sauce. The steak filet was cooked to absolute perfection. I would say that this was my first choice but my GF and I refuse to order the same thing. I tried her steak and immediately gave her that wide-eyed &#34;OMG this is the best steak I&#39;ve ever had look.&#34; I suffer from extreme short term memory while enjoying good good so the most recent plate is always the best ever. But what made this dish special was the braised fig sauce that accompanied it&#39;s meaty surroundings. The potato dumplings with steak and the sauce were an absolutely explosive combination of flavors. <br><br>As for the duck, I&#39;m still trying to figure out why there was a knife still at my table taking up space when one clearly did not need one to break the duck apart. The duck was soft and tender, falling off the bone with the touch of a silver fork. The sauce was epic, the waiter asked if I wanted more and now my biggest regret in life is saying no in the spur of the moment. But I can&#39;t be blamed because the taste put me in a state of shock making it difficult to understand my immediate surroundings. The goose was also very good but to be honest licking the duck bone is perhaps more entertaining. <br><br>Go with either dish and you won&#39;t be disappointed. The meal with bottle ice water was about 69 euros. It&#39;s a hefty price for the slow service we received in return but the food was worth every coin. <br><br>Overall, I give this place 4 stars because the service was a slow. The food took a while to get to the table and the waiter wasn&#39;t very attentive or special. Nonetheless, I definitely plan on returning upon a future visit to Berlin.",

Second, they have a great outdoor patio on a quieter street. Need I say more?<br><br>I went here with two guy friends to satisfy undying pizza cravings. Little did we know that we probably should have made a reservation, but luckily a table opened up a few seconds after we arrived.<br><br>I ordered the margherita pizza and sprinkled it with chili oil - beware it is SPIII-CYY. We were all thoroughly pleased with our meals and our waiter was friendly despite being swamped with customers. And for just 7 Euro? Shooot I will eat there any day.<br><br>Bottom line - there is a reason this place is always bustling.<br><br>**TIP: get Eis from the shop across the street.

We patiently waited (for about 15 minutes) and the house gave us some free tea for our wait. The hostess said she could accomodate us for literally 30 minutes, as the next free table was reserved at 9. We ordered while we waited, and eventually the same hostess said if we moved tables just ones seat over, we could stay longer. At that point we had already finished so it was fine. <br><br>This restaurant needs a bigger space! They were turning people away left and right. But what it lacks in tables and decor, it makes up for in speedy service, oh yea, and awesome food. <br><br>I mistakenly over-ordered, with a bibimbap, jiggae, mondu and a bulgogi dish for 2 hungry people. We scarfed our food because of the time restraint on our table, but the portions are HUGE and we could have dealt with just 1 side and 1 main course combined. <br><br>Definitely not a typical Korean BBQ place, or restaurant, but a fun German, cafeteria style take on Korean comfort foods. While I was there, I really wanted a Cass, but their beverage options were pretty limited. Would go again, with a reservation!",

"reviewcomment":"Clärchens Ballhaus is one of the oldest establishments in Berlin, having just celebrated it&#39;s 100-year anniversary in 2013. Dining and drinking here has become a given every time I visit my siblings in the capital of Germany. <br><br>Clärchens is a mix between a restaurant, beer garden, and dance hall (with daily lessons given in many traditional dance styles such as Waltz, Tango, Fox, Rumba). They are famous for their Spiegelsaal (&#34;mirror room&#34;), which is an upstairs private room where you can dine in a more peaceful setting than the main hall where dancing &amp; music is going on adjacent to the dining tables. The Spiegelsaal is frequently rented out for wedding receptions, corporate parties, and other festive occasions. It is dimly lit by candles and the upper parts of the walls reaching up to the high ceilings are covered in large mirrors, most of them cracked and worn by age, creating a charming and romantic environment. <br><br>The food is classic German and Italian with a few twists here and there. I am a big fan of their daily soup selections, the pizzas, and of course the gigantic Wiener Schnitzel that lays across warm potato salad and is served with a side of cucumber salad. If you&#39;re hung over or just have a really big appetite, this bad boy is for you: <a href='http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cl%C3%A4rchens-ballhaus-berlin?select=YA66OHcSqCQM5McjtKayPA#YA66OHcSqCQM5McjtKayPA'>yelp.com/biz_photos/clär…</a><br><br>There&#39;s a plethora of beer, wine, and mixed drinks, guaranteeing you&#39;ll leave Clärchens Ballhaus happy and satiated. Lot&#39;s of entertainment here and a great way to meet people from all around the world!",

In addition to the food, there is a concise but good drinks list.<br><br> Great for dining with friends, family or on your own.<br><br> Also worth noting is that there is a &#39;Next to Kuchi&#39; which offers their full menu to take away (Salads, Soups, Sushi etc.)<br><br> Miso soup with Vegetarian Sushi mix comes to 12EUR - a little bit more compared to surrounding places but Kuchi is has a better atmosphere, decor and most importantly, food.",

"reviewcomment":"The restaurant Ständige Vertretung (Permanent representation) owes its name to the time when Germany was divided in two, when West Berlin was formally no part of the territory of the Federal Republic of Germany (although its citizens were indeed west germans).<br><br> This explains why its walls are full of decorations of the time: old signals of the train station of Bonn (former capital, located in Rhineland-Westfalia), pictures of politicians of the time of the wirschaftswunder (economic miracle). The Permanent Representation was also the name of the representation office of the Federal Republic of Germany in Berlin; the russians (co-administrators of the city with the other allies) never allowed West Germany to have a higher-ranking representation.<br><br> And Permanent Representation also means: the restaurant presents itself as a representation of the Rhineland gastronomy and they do mean to stay here, which they do deserve. The Ständige Vertretung is probably where you can get the best pork knuckle (eisbein!) with choucroute in town; and if you are a resolute eater, don&#39;t think it twice and order a blood sausage (blutwurst). They are great.<br><br> In spite of their location, next to the Friedrichstrasse train station, and the large amount of tourists (the place is as central as it can be), this is not at all a tourist trap but a restaurant of german (rhineland) cuisine also patronized by so many germans. Most of them berliners.<br><br> Do not miss the real Cologne beer (Kölsch type, here sold under the mark Gaffels), which is hard to find elsewhere in Berlin.<br><br> The flammkuchen (something in between a crêpe and a pizza) are also great.<br><br> Prices are reasonable and the service, although the restaurant is always full, is quite good. The waiters and waitresses do earn their tip.",

"reviewcomment":"This place is just awesome. I came across it by complete chance while I was actually searching for another place to eat that I found off of Yelp when I saw this small stand-like place with visuals of CHICKEN - very eye-catching. There was a line forming so it definitely looked like it was worth investigating. <br><br>Turns out that less than 5 euros get you a combo meal with a HALF chicken - a WHOLE HALF of a chicken and it&#39;s all yours!!! The combo includes a side of fries or salad (or if you&#39;re REALLY hungry, a slightly pricier combo gives you both). <br><br>Just seeing other people eat their meals here made me brave the line and quickly Google the correct way to say, &#34;halbe Hähnchen mit Coca-Cola,&#34; which was completely unnecessary since they understand English just fine if you&#39;re ordering... You order, pay, and they give you your meal asap before you leave the line - I was so excited to eat it that I broke a tip of my plastic fork when I stabbed the beast of a meat that was the freshly-cooked chicken. Very certain that I will be here once or twice more before I leave Berlin!",

"reviewcomment":"My favorite burgers in Berlin so far - large, in charge, and delicious.  The actual patty and bun size aren&#39;t overwhelmingly huge (thank goodness, I think some Berlin burger joints over do it for the sake of notoriety) but loaded with toppings.<br>I thoroughly enjoyed my cheeseburger w/ jalapenos and my husband also enjoyed his Mexican-style burger, which was one of the specials that day.  My burger came with a big ol&#39; pile of jalapenos under the bun so I was a very happy American!<br>And my husband&#39;s burger had an insane amount of guac &amp; other toppings for only about 1.50 euro more than the standard burgers.  The burgers have way too much salad to fit in any normal human&#39;s mouth - I just pushed some of mine off and ate it as a mini side salad. :)<br>The potato wedges are also amazing!  Although you should only order them if you are really, really hungry, like we were.<br>The location is a little odd and could be hard to find if you aren&#39;t looking carefully.  The inside is very small and there isn&#39;t much seating indoors or out so try to go when it might be less crowded!  We went on a cold Thursday holiday and got lucky with the wait time and seating but by the time we left there was a line out the door.<br>The prices are lower than some other more &#34;upscale&#34; (i.e. good quality beef and unique burgers) burger places in the area.  I am looking forward to my next visit!",

"reviewcomment":"Awesome service. Packed - make reservations. Pakistani food, NOT indian, as the only other english language reviewer, with no &#39;Friends&#39;, and one review, stipulates. It&#39;s not personal, or anything to do with her, though. It&#39;s this retarded, buggy &#39;Yelp&#39; system - eliminating many helpful reviews and yet leaving in a review from 2011, from a one-off reviewer.<br><br>{Edit: please also hunt for the mis-categorized  review from &#39;slowfood&#39;. &#39;It&#39;s too sweet/westernized&#39;, goes the review; worth reading. However, given the local community, this is expected. Menu items 108 through 113, are the hot and spicy items. And if you especially want hot and spicy, be sure to ask.}<br><br>Service was good, prompt; much more than can be expected for the city-area generally. This ethnic &#39;proud of my restaurant&#39; shines through. People spoiled on non-local service standards, may easily miss the extra, here, that good service provides.<br><br>The chai was respectable. The salzig lassi could have been saltier; otherwise excellent (salt to taste).<br><br>The fried vegetables were done correctly with a chickpea dough instead of wheat.<br><br>Murgh Salat was very sweet - not offensive - but sweeter than what i want for an evening meal. The mango pulp content made it incredibly sweet - i don&#39;t think any sugar was added. Says something for pakistani mangos, though. Mixed Pakora was good, however, again, the sauce was sweeter than i would have liked. A meat dish will be next.  ...<br><br>Music was not too loud. Bathrooms were private, heated and clean.<br><br>If you had a good experience at this restaurant, please let us know. If you want to thank me for this review, please mark below. Thanks :)",

"reviewcomment":"I am starting to like this idea of having a slow brunch on the weekend. So for today, I grabbed my book, went out of the house hungry, and went out to find food. I somehow stumbled across this cafe, Gorki Park, near my usual hangout neighborhood. <br><br>I got in around a little after 10 AM, and there was no other diners yet. I sat at a table in the inner room, and ordered the Schwarzes Meer Frühstück, as well as a hot chocolate. <br><br>It arrived in a few minutes, after a short wait, which allowed me to read my book and enjoy the slow movement of time on a Saturday. When the plate arrived, I was amazed at what it contained. <br><br>All the things are fish-related, after all, this is the Black Sea Breakfast, right? There were smoked salmon neatly placed on top of potato pancakes; there was a Russian crepe filled with cream cheese and topped with salmon caviar; there was a crostini with tuna on it; and there was also a herring tartar. The only non-fish item was the scrambled egg. This whole thing is accompanied by bread, of course, as well as butter.<br><br>I was overall impressed by the breakfast, and so I ate slowly, while reading my book. I would definitely recommend this place to others. The only thing preventing me from giving them a full 5 stars is the bread. It would have been nice if the bread came out warm. That would have added a better personal touch, and would have made the breakfast impeccable.",

"reviewcomment":"Awesome service. Packed - make reservations. Pakistani food, NOT indian, as the only other english language reviewer, with no &#39;Friends&#39;, and one review, stipulates. It&#39;s not personal, or anything to do with her, though. It&#39;s this retarded, buggy &#39;Yelp&#39; system - eliminating many helpful reviews and yet leaving in a review from 2011, from a one-off reviewer.<br><br>{Edit: please also hunt for the mis-categorized  review from &#39;slowfood&#39;. &#39;It&#39;s too sweet/westernized&#39;, goes the review; worth reading. However, given the local community, this is expected. Menu items 108 through 113, are the hot and spicy items. And if you especially want hot and spicy, be sure to ask.}<br><br>Service was good, prompt; much more than can be expected for the city-area generally. This ethnic &#39;proud of my restaurant&#39; shines through. People spoiled on non-local service standards, may easily miss the extra, here, that good service provides.<br><br>The chai was respectable. The salzig lassi could have been saltier; otherwise excellent (salt to taste).<br><br>The fried vegetables were done correctly with a chickpea dough instead of wheat.<br><br>Murgh Salat was very sweet - not offensive - but sweeter than what i want for an evening meal. The mango pulp content made it incredibly sweet - i don&#39;t think any sugar was added. Says something for pakistani mangos, though. Mixed Pakora was good, however, again, the sauce was sweeter than i would have liked. A meat dish will be next.  ...<br><br>Music was not too loud. Bathrooms were private, heated and clean.<br><br>If you had a good experience at this restaurant, please let us know. If you want to thank me for this review, please mark below. Thanks :)",

"reviewcomment":"As I was able to convince my companion to try a restaurant I haven&#39;t been to before, we went here, which was a short ride from where we were. I&#39;ve heard only good things about this place, and sure enough, this place delivered.<br><br>As this was a Vietnamese place, I couldn&#39;t pass the opportunity to test them by ordering a bowl of pho ga, and I paired it with real authentic Vietnamese coffee. My companion on the other hand ordered a rice bowl mixed with water spinach, and she also ordered a lemongrass tea. <br><br>The place was still not busy, although we already saw several tables that were reserved for the night. Our food came out quickly, and we were amazed at the pretty presentation. It looked tasty, and sure enough, it tasted good as well. <br><br>The place is a little expensive; my small Vietnamese coffee was 3,40 EUR, but it was so worth it. I loved that little cup of sweet goodness, I was almost tempted to order another one, but I feared I wouldn&#39;t be able to sleep later.<br><br>Overall, we paid 24,80 EUR plus tip. A little pricey for Berlin, and a little pricey for the quantity, but this place is more quality than quantity. I&#39;ll be back here again. I suggest asking for a place in the terrace when the weather is good. There are plenty of good nooks and crannies to bring a date and be intimate during a meal.",

Wasn&#39;t too crowded when we arrived but got super crowded fast. Sat out on the communal tables on the patio and enjoyed my 1st meal in Berlin.  <br><br>Coming from California, though, where we have great sushi places it&#39;s hard to say this is better than those.

But this place is actually Lebanese/Syrian and that does make a bit of a difference tastewise.

And it wasn&#39;t just that the meat was different, they varied when it came to ingredients, in ex. the chicken one had fries inside. They were very tasty!<br><br>But actually the menu isn&#39;t just shoarmas. It&#39;s very rich and written out in both german and arabic, if that helps! There is seating space inside and also outside on sunny days. The interior is pleasant with wooden and beige details. <br><br>The lines to the counter confirm that the food is good and popular!",

"reviewcomment":"It was a second to last day in Berlin and being in a trendy part of the city with lots of bars, we were looking for a place to eat. Having gotten lost, we found ourselves in a dark location where the only light was from this restaurant. It looked quiet but the decor was pretty inviting, as was our hunger which we sought to satiate. Wanting to eat somewhere nice on our last day, we couldn&#39;t have been happier here.<br><br>Our waiter was extremely, kind, personable and friendly. His english near perfect. He was only one person waiting the whole restaurant which was pretty large. Luckily, it wasn&#39;t a busy night. We ordered our food and drinks. I still can&#39;t get around how reasonably priced beer is in Germany. Whereas in the Uk you eat somewhere nice, your drinks bill can be at least a 30-40% of your food total. In Germany it&#39;s almost like the other way around. Your drink will only be 10-15% of your total bill. It&#39;s nice to see that food is valued more highly than alcohol and quite rightly so.<br><br>The food itself was not stunning but still of a very good standard and quality. My lamb cutlets with ratatouille were sublime. The Octopus Carpaccio less so, but still decent enough. The dessert was lovely, sweet breads with ice cream and plum.<br><br>My friend really wanted the beer stein he was drinking from and after asking if he could purchase it, the waiter said he couldn&#39;t sell it, but that he could have it for free. Suffice to say, we left a generous tip as a result, and the glass made it back to England safely in one piece. <br><br>So in all, the atmosphere in this place is relaxed and quiet. Perfect for a nice dinner and conversation. The staff are superb and the food very good considering the price which came up to about 35 EUR each incl drinks. If in Berlin, shall definitely be stopping here again.",

"reviewcomment":"Awesome service. Packed - make reservations. Pakistani food, NOT indian, as the only other english language reviewer, with no &#39;Friends&#39;, and one review, stipulates. It&#39;s not personal, or anything to do with her, though. It&#39;s this retarded, buggy &#39;Yelp&#39; system - eliminating many helpful reviews and yet leaving in a review from 2011, from a one-off reviewer.<br><br>{Edit: please also hunt for the mis-categorized  review from &#39;slowfood&#39;. &#39;It&#39;s too sweet/westernized&#39;, goes the review; worth reading. However, given the local community, this is expected. Menu items 108 through 113, are the hot and spicy items. And if you especially want hot and spicy, be sure to ask.}<br><br>Service was good, prompt; much more than can be expected for the city-area generally. This ethnic &#39;proud of my restaurant&#39; shines through. People spoiled on non-local service standards, may easily miss the extra, here, that good service provides.<br><br>The chai was respectable. The salzig lassi could have been saltier; otherwise excellent (salt to taste).<br><br>The fried vegetables were done correctly with a chickpea dough instead of wheat.<br><br>Murgh Salat was very sweet - not offensive - but sweeter than what i want for an evening meal. The mango pulp content made it incredibly sweet - i don&#39;t think any sugar was added. Says something for pakistani mangos, though. Mixed Pakora was good, however, again, the sauce was sweeter than i would have liked. A meat dish will be next.  ...<br><br>Music was not too loud. Bathrooms were private, heated and clean.<br><br>If you had a good experience at this restaurant, please let us know. If you want to thank me for this review, please mark below. Thanks :)",

"reviewcomment":"I have recently fallen in love with Indian food and part of it is thanks to Amrit. I saw this restaurant when I first arrived in Berlin and was immediately intrigued by the vibrant umbrellas and decor outside of the building (I&#39;m a sucker for presentation).<br><br>At long last, I finally decided to head up to Oranienburger Straße (although there are numerous other locations in Berlin) for lunch at Amrit and was far from disappointed. It was gorgeous out so I sat outside underneath one of their Indian-inspired umbrellas and ordered, challenging myself with a German menu. Clearly my German isn&#39;t perfect so I wasn&#39;t fully certain what I was going to get but my word was it tasty - plenty of spices like good Indian food has.<br><br>One of my biggest complaints about the restaurant is the waiters who stand outside and practically beg you to come eat there. Amrit, you have good food - why not let it speak for itself instead of looking so desperate.",

"reviewcomment":"I didn&#39;t know exactly what to expect when I came to this Berlin institution. I had images of big breasted beer maids and a lot of toasting...too many movies I guess. <br><br>The only massive breasts were those on the roasted chickens and that was actually okay with me. There is a huge selection of roasted, grilled, pickled, and raw foods but I thought the highlight was the seafood grill located near the middle. You can order white wine and watch the show as they cook your food in heaps of butter. SO SO good. The fish is fresh and cooked to perfection at a fraction of the price of Ka De We!   I definitely recommend this as a go to for a trip to Berlin, it is even worth the standing.",

"reviewcomment":"We went on a Sunday for brunch. Told we may have to wait an hour- decided to wait and see. Only took about 15 minutes, then we were given a table in the cellar. Lovely cavelike atmosphere. We were offered an upstairs table after a few minutes but liked the cellar vibe- except for the loud US/English speaking woman who wanted all to know her business... Food was so flavorful, washed down with some tasty German brews. Hope to get back sometime to order off the menu.",

"reviewcomment":"Awesome service. Packed - make reservations. Pakistani food, NOT indian, as the only other english language reviewer, with no &#39;Friends&#39;, and one review, stipulates. It&#39;s not personal, or anything to do with her, though. It&#39;s this retarded, buggy &#39;Yelp&#39; system - eliminating many helpful reviews and yet leaving in a review from 2011, from a one-off reviewer.<br><br>{Edit: please also hunt for the mis-categorized  review from &#39;slowfood&#39;. &#39;It&#39;s too sweet/westernized&#39;, goes the review; worth reading. However, given the local community, this is expected. Menu items 108 through 113, are the hot and spicy items. And if you especially want hot and spicy, be sure to ask.}<br><br>Service was good, prompt; much more than can be expected for the city-area generally. This ethnic &#39;proud of my restaurant&#39; shines through. People spoiled on non-local service standards, may easily miss the extra, here, that good service provides.<br><br>The chai was respectable. The salzig lassi could have been saltier; otherwise excellent (salt to taste).<br><br>The fried vegetables were done correctly with a chickpea dough instead of wheat.<br><br>Murgh Salat was very sweet - not offensive - but sweeter than what i want for an evening meal. The mango pulp content made it incredibly sweet - i don&#39;t think any sugar was added. Says something for pakistani mangos, though. Mixed Pakora was good, however, again, the sauce was sweeter than i would have liked. A meat dish will be next.  ...<br><br>Music was not too loud. Bathrooms were private, heated and clean.<br><br>If you had a good experience at this restaurant, please let us know. If you want to thank me for this review, please mark below. Thanks :)",

"reviewcomment":"I was here this morning for a meet-up with an alumni association. It was a huge restaurant, and during Sundays, they have brunch buffet, which, for 9,90 EUR, it is eat-all-you-can, and you pay a la carte for the drinks. After experiencing this place, I think I am willing to give this place 3 stars.<br><br>The spread was plentiful. There were plenty of selections, and for 9,90, come hungry, and you will get your money&#39;s worth. Who would believe there&#39;s spareribs for brunch? Anyway, buffets aren&#39;t really my style, but I was hungry, that I ate enough for the whole day, I don&#39;t think I would be eating something for the rest of the day. The food was tasty, but, as buffets are, they sit there on the long table for the longest time, so sometimes, they are still warm, sometimes, they&#39;ve been there waiting for someone to take them. <br><br>Given the set-up, I think this restaurant is more for quantity than quality. If you&#39;re hungry, then 9,90 EUR is a deal. I was, but I also think that eating out is something one should enjoy as a social act, not just an act of stuffing one&#39;s stomach. If not for the alumni meet-up, I probably would not have entered this place. I give it 3 stars for an okay experience.",

"reviewcomment":"I had a soy burger today, which was pretty tasty and all on my plate was made right when I ordered it. It took them like a little more them five minutes to prep it but it was worth the wait. Fries were good too, and they had this dip which was ketchup and spicy onions. Big up to them.<br><br> The price for a menu was almost 7 EUR, which is of course not dirt cheap but alright (I think at BK you prolly pay 8-9 EUR for the same thing).<br><br> They also have a daily special thing, but I didn&#39;t have that. My friend got it, and she seemed to like it very much.",

"reviewcomment":"We found this restaurant completely by accident. I&#39;d planned out a lot of restaurants to visit in advance but as soon as we got to Berlin we left out hotel room and went for a walk around Mitte to get some food as we were so hungry. We found Augustiner am Gendarmenmarkt and stopped in to grab some food and beer. Wow! It was fantastic. Traditional German pub food and the most delicious beer. This is exactly what I had always wanted from my trip to Germany. The food, drink and atmosphere were all just perfect and this ended up being one of the best places we ate at - completely by accident!<br><br>We visited twice in the end. The first night we had a giant platter of various meats and every single thing was delicious. The second time I had the pork knuckle, a Germany staple that I&#39;d always wanted to try. After some difficulty in working out how to cut into the thing (my fault!) I couldn&#39;t get enough of that either.<br><br>If you like hearty pub food then this is your place. Also, the Augustiner Hell beer is now one of the my absolute favourite drinks of all time. Enjoy!",

"reviewcomment":"I was hoping that this restaurant sucked. But unfortunately, I was wrong. <br><br>See, the thing is, I once entered an Ishin before (they are a small chain of sushi restaurants here in Berlin), it was a long time ago (in a galaxy far far away, oh, wait, never mind...), and I went with a colleague for lunch. I was so dissatisfied with it, and vowed never to enter an Ishin again. So I made it my personal goal to try to find the best sushi in Berlin, and I firmly believed that Ishin isn&#39;t the place to look for it.<br><br>Enter my companion, who swears by Ishin. I suppose he was able to convince me to give Ishin a second chance, so tonight, I did. We went on a Thursday (Thursday and Friday are the best days for sushi, by the way, due to the fish shipments), and tried their nigiri menu (for 16,50 EUR, you get to choose 15 pieces). That was a swanky deal. We additionally ordered gyoza, and hiya-yakko.<br><br>And oh my god. That was sushi that can kick ass. They had swanky offerings like uni, toro, amaebi, and others, and the quality of the fish is so evident from the way it melts in your mouth. <br><br>So yes, I give up. Ishin delivers, as long as it is Thursday (or Friday, perhaps), and you&#39;re not getting the lunch menu. It&#39;s a good thing this place is close to where we live.",

I lived around the corner from Kaffeemitte for a few months and went here nearly every morning when walking the dog (he loved it too).<br><br>They&#39;re a great place to have breakfast, lunch, or just grab a coffee to go. They have high-quality food that&#39;s a mix of standard cafe fare and German and Italian cuisine.<br><br>It can get crowded at times and their internet connection is great for a quick email check but don&#39;t expect to be able to work from the cafe for any length of time.<br><br>Definitely worth checking out if you&#39;re in the area.",

"reviewcomment":"This place is buzzing. Literally. I&#39;ve passed here a couple of times but didn&#39;t sit in.<br>Once I had a friend coming from out of town - I thought it was my chance to finally explore what&#39;s inside! So I did.<br>The entrance is already cool, followed by great music and beautiful people - if you come early you might even find a seat. The problem is though - if this seat is reserved the waiters will tell you to get up at some point which is quite annoying... I was sitting here first! <br>The drinks are not too cheap but my mojito was well maid. And I did enjoy every sip of it. <br>At first we were sitting on the stairs at the end of the bar, and then were moved to a couch, it is an open space blocked with quite a lot of seats, yet feels spacious enough, there is also a club downstairs that opens up later on and people are being charged for at the entrance after 22:00 or so on weekends, but as it started to get more and more crowded, we moved away to another bar.",

"reviewcomment":"Awesome service. Packed - make reservations. Pakistani food, NOT indian, as the only other english language reviewer, with no &#39;Friends&#39;, and one review, stipulates. It&#39;s not personal, or anything to do with her, though. It&#39;s this retarded, buggy &#39;Yelp&#39; system - eliminating many helpful reviews and yet leaving in a review from 2011, from a one-off reviewer.<br><br>{Edit: please also hunt for the mis-categorized  review from &#39;slowfood&#39;. &#39;It&#39;s too sweet/westernized&#39;, goes the review; worth reading. However, given the local community, this is expected. Menu items 108 through 113, are the hot and spicy items. And if you especially want hot and spicy, be sure to ask.}<br><br>Service was good, prompt; much more than can be expected for the city-area generally. This ethnic &#39;proud of my restaurant&#39; shines through. People spoiled on non-local service standards, may easily miss the extra, here, that good service provides.<br><br>The chai was respectable. The salzig lassi could have been saltier; otherwise excellent (salt to taste).<br><br>The fried vegetables were done correctly with a chickpea dough instead of wheat.<br><br>Murgh Salat was very sweet - not offensive - but sweeter than what i want for an evening meal. The mango pulp content made it incredibly sweet - i don&#39;t think any sugar was added. Says something for pakistani mangos, though. Mixed Pakora was good, however, again, the sauce was sweeter than i would have liked. A meat dish will be next.  ...<br><br>Music was not too loud. Bathrooms were private, heated and clean.<br><br>If you had a good experience at this restaurant, please let us know. If you want to thank me for this review, please mark below. Thanks :)",

"reviewcomment":"Craving Italian food at an affordable price? This is your lucky day! Let me walk you through the sequence of my meal<br>1. Starter: Bruschetta - it was good, but I&#39;ve had much better before.<br>2. Pasta: Linguine with tuna, cherry tomatoes etc - now this dish was seriously good, the pasta just cooked to perfection it disappeared effortlessly.<br>3. Dessert: Tiramisu. OMG. I have a weakness for these anyway, but this tiramisu is seriously dangerous. And it is massive. I have rarely come across such a good tiramisu and I would consider it a crime not to order it, even if I was completely full, which I was, incidentally :)<br>Now a quick note about everything not related to food, which is secondary anyway: The ambience was ok, it is definitely not cosy, the place is too big and too busy for that. I would strongly recommend reserving a table, as this place was fully packed even on a Monday.",

"reviewcomment":"I would say this was my first &#34;real&#34; german meal.... Was recommended to this place by a Berlin local and I have to say I am  a fan - the generous portions and heavy carbs may be a turn off to some, but to me, it was comfort food deliciousness!! <br>For our mains, my sister and I did the old half/half switch trick - which meant I got to try two different dishes, we chose Käsespätzle a cheesey, chewy pasta that with every mouthful I was thinking about the next, as well as the Rheinischer Sauerbraten which was a braised meat with red apple cabbage and potato dumplings. <br>The servings were HUGE! and although I was feeling full, decided to share a dessert. The three of us shared the Süßer Flammkuchen (Sweet Flambee) which was kind of like a dessert pizza/tart with apple and raisons with a shot poured over an set on fire - the flames added a bit of drama to the meal - it was quite exciting. <br>My only negative of the meal was the shot of alcohol poured over the dessert... I get that this is how the fire is lit, but it was a little overpowering in some parts which were quite heavily soaked in alcohol. Apart from that, I would recommend this place to anyone wanting an authentic german meal in berlin!!",

They have a good brunch buffet -- there are some pretty tasty things offered (German, Swiss and American style), but you do pay a premium for being able to sit in the sunshine and enjoy your coffee. <br><br>They also make wine at Nolas. We tried a bottle of the Riesling and it was a good evening drinking wine for sitting on the patio.<br><br>Finally, the ice cream -- it&#39;s nothing to write home about, really. The flavor is just ok and it doesn&#39;t seem super fresh. That said, I definitely recommend the Eiskaffee. Coffee + ice cream for an afternoon snack? Ja, bitte!",

"reviewcomment":"It&#39;s no Ruth Chris or Morton&#39;s but by golly it&#39;s pretty decent &#34;American&#34; fare. I&#39;d say it&#39;s like a Black Angus or Ruby Tuesday, an upscale coffee shop which features steaks, served with a house salad, baked potato with their &#34;house&#34; sour cream and a hunk of garlic bread.<br><br>The American dressing for the salad was more like 1000 island, while the French was more like Ranch dressing. Go figure.<br><br>I had the rib eye and my server thought I said Well instead of Rare. No biggie, it got sent back and came back perfectly cooked, piping hot!! The steak was tender but a tad salty from their seasoning. I devoured it anyway.<br><br>Stephen had the special prime and it looked as tender as it tasted. He finished his meal as well.<br><br>Quite honestly I can&#39;t find fault with our meal. My steak was €20,50 which is no different than what I pay in SoCal. I did sub the sour cream for the herb butter, and was glad I did. The German sour cream is thick, and not as creamy as the US version.<br><br>I would recommend this place and would come back too.",

"reviewcomment":"Awesome service. Packed - make reservations. Pakistani food, NOT indian, as the only other english language reviewer, with no &#39;Friends&#39;, and one review, stipulates. It&#39;s not personal, or anything to do with her, though. It&#39;s this retarded, buggy &#39;Yelp&#39; system - eliminating many helpful reviews and yet leaving in a review from 2011, from a one-off reviewer.<br><br>{Edit: please also hunt for the mis-categorized  review from &#39;slowfood&#39;. &#39;It&#39;s too sweet/westernized&#39;, goes the review; worth reading. However, given the local community, this is expected. Menu items 108 through 113, are the hot and spicy items. And if you especially want hot and spicy, be sure to ask.}<br><br>Service was good, prompt; much more than can be expected for the city-area generally. This ethnic &#39;proud of my restaurant&#39; shines through. People spoiled on non-local service standards, may easily miss the extra, here, that good service provides.<br><br>The chai was respectable. The salzig lassi could have been saltier; otherwise excellent (salt to taste).<br><br>The fried vegetables were done correctly with a chickpea dough instead of wheat.<br><br>Murgh Salat was very sweet - not offensive - but sweeter than what i want for an evening meal. The mango pulp content made it incredibly sweet - i don&#39;t think any sugar was added. Says something for pakistani mangos, though. Mixed Pakora was good, however, again, the sauce was sweeter than i would have liked. A meat dish will be next.  ...<br><br>Music was not too loud. Bathrooms were private, heated and clean.<br><br>If you had a good experience at this restaurant, please let us know. If you want to thank me for this review, please mark below. Thanks :)",

"reviewcomment":"My girlfriend and I went there along with my sister for her birthday dinner. The surroundings which could have been pretty idyllic, are sadly somewhat ruined by a large construction site right next to it. However, these are soon forgotten, as the food arrives. We chose the 8 course surprise menu with wine. This means the chef gets more or less free hands, but some of the courses are the same ones as on the 6 course tasting menu. The highlight was the eel with smoked pork bellies and eel tea, but all 8 courses were great tasting, all the way from the amuse bouche through to the surprise dessert consisting of no less than 8 tiny dessert dishes!<br>They try to use local or regional ingredients, lots of fresh herbs (some of which are home grown), and pack each dish full of flavour.<br>The service is impeccable and professional, but without the stiffness and formality you tend to find in fine dining. The atmosphere is relaxed and informal. This is all about the great food experience, and highly recommended.",

"reviewcomment":"This review is for dessert only. Last weekend, my companions were looking for apple strudel, and Yelp popped up this restaurant after searching for it, given our current location at that time. We were fortunate to jump upon a table whose occupants were clearing out at that time. <br><br>I wasn&#39;t too hungry, so I just shared my companion&#39;s strudel. I also got a beer. I have to say that the strudel was very tasty and well-done, though I don&#39;t have plenty of strudel data points. Their dessert rack near the counter was also superb, and if I were hungry, I would have ordered a cake slice (but I had cake two hours before that). <br><br>Service was not the most prompt, as is the case with most of Europe. The servers speak English, which was convenient for my visiting companions. I will probably be back here if I am in the area again.",

I had the Med Sun with tomatoes, both regular and sundried, and ruccola with tagliatelle and it was fab.

"reviewcomment":"Great place for steaks! Good service, too. Was in Berlin for business and went alone, so the waiter asked me if I cared for newspaper and was generally very friendly. They have a big steak menu, South American and USDA. Went for the boneless rib-eye and it was phantastic: tender, juicy, a tad smokey and cooked to perfection. Many times they tend to overcook steak in Europe, or at least in Germany, but this was perfect. Wanted medium-rare and that&#39;s exactly what I got. This was probably one of the best steaks I&#39;ve had in a very long time. Then they have an extra menu with about 20 or so different varieties of coarse salts for the steak, which is really neat. Salad was also very tasty (had the chopped one) and great wine by the glass. Very good experience overall.",

"reviewcomment":"My aunt brought us here and I had currywurst for the first time. I ordered it with frites and mayonnaise to get the whole experience. I had a bit of a kebab, which was tasty. When I first heard about currywurst, I couldn&#39;t really wrap my head around the idea of curry powder with sausage and ketchup but once I tasted it, it made sense. The fries were nice and crispy but they were drowning in ketchup and mayo. I&#39;m only assuming that&#39;s how it&#39;s served traditionally because I don&#39;t have anything to compare it to. Despite the condiment drowning, I liked it anyway.<br><br>It was late at night on a weekday so there weren&#39;t a lot of people around besides a few couples and some guys stopping by for a quick bite after a night of drinking. They have tables that you stand at - no chairs here. Like other currywurst spots, it&#39;s very casual. My aunt and mom each had a bottle of Berliner Kindl Pilsner to accompany their food. Something I found interesting was that they have bottles of Moet in the fridge. You know, just in case you feel like popping bottles while snacking on sausage.<br><br>I don&#39;t know if this is THE place to go for currywurst but I really enjoyed the food here.",

"reviewcomment":"A friend of mine and I visited this place in the Mitte.<br><br>I instantly fell in love. There is an outside patio area to sit on and enjoy your meal. There is also seating inside. There are pictures around the cafe. There are also French products to purchase.<br><br>This is a self service place, so I would advise to pick out which table you will be seated at and then go order. They will ask where your table to located.<br><br>I went here about 4-5 times for breakfast after discovering it, and I always ordered the same thing. <br><br>--Cappuccino which was strong and excellent. Way better than our watered down coffee in America..<br>--Rhubarb Tart, this was so delicious. It was sweet enough, and I loved the tartness which in my opinion balanced out the sweetness.<br><br>There was some language barriers, but some of the baristas spoke English and we made it work. <br><br>I am really going to miss this place!",

"reviewcomment":"My friend who lives in berlin showed me around to a few awesome spots and Freischwimmer WAS BY FAR my favorite restaurant in Berlin. It stood right up there with White Trash Fast Food Restaurant. The vibe here is much more relaxed and one that I never wanted to leave. If it was not for the rain we would have still been munching on olives and bread and feeding the ducks that swim in the canal. Freischwimmer is an old house boat and there are many along this canal that are converted into restaurants, lounges and clubs. It is situated outside with a portion that you can sit under the roof but still outside so if you get chilly BRING a sweater. The food is outstanding. I would say that the menu is a little bit of European and Asian dishes. Now, the full bar here is awesome and though they Whisky selection is sadly limited they can still make a good Whisky Sour. Priced very reasonably so perfect for those traveling on a budget. <br><br>The view is great and it is a short walk to the River Spree and on those warm days it is also close to Badeschiff (outdoor public pool on the River Spree)...",

"reviewcomment":"Awesome service. Packed - make reservations. Pakistani food, NOT indian, as the only other english language reviewer, with no &#39;Friends&#39;, and one review, stipulates. It&#39;s not personal, or anything to do with her, though. It&#39;s this retarded, buggy &#39;Yelp&#39; system - eliminating many helpful reviews and yet leaving in a review from 2011, from a one-off reviewer.<br><br>{Edit: please also hunt for the mis-categorized  review from &#39;slowfood&#39;. &#39;It&#39;s too sweet/westernized&#39;, goes the review; worth reading. However, given the local community, this is expected. Menu items 108 through 113, are the hot and spicy items. And if you especially want hot and spicy, be sure to ask.}<br><br>Service was good, prompt; much more than can be expected for the city-area generally. This ethnic &#39;proud of my restaurant&#39; shines through. People spoiled on non-local service standards, may easily miss the extra, here, that good service provides.<br><br>The chai was respectable. The salzig lassi could have been saltier; otherwise excellent (salt to taste).<br><br>The fried vegetables were done correctly with a chickpea dough instead of wheat.<br><br>Murgh Salat was very sweet - not offensive - but sweeter than what i want for an evening meal. The mango pulp content made it incredibly sweet - i don&#39;t think any sugar was added. Says something for pakistani mangos, though. Mixed Pakora was good, however, again, the sauce was sweeter than i would have liked. A meat dish will be next.  ...<br><br>Music was not too loud. Bathrooms were private, heated and clean.<br><br>If you had a good experience at this restaurant, please let us know. If you want to thank me for this review, please mark below. Thanks :)",

Can be fast if you are aggressive about getting served, but don&#39;t wait for someone to come to you - the girls working here don&#39;t care one bit about who gets served when. It can be a little off-putting but food this cheap has it&#39;s price to pay!<br><br> Very very busy on workdays during lunch. Wednesdays and Saturdays are happy days (cheap sushi specials and stuff). When you order you will be served a tea for free that you can fill up again (with hot water).<br><br> Outside of sushi the Sake-don is really good and under 5 bucks.<br><br> Overall the place is great if you know what to expect- a cheap cafeteria, not a friendly full service restaurant.",

Great for dinner with friends or family. <br><br>1 / 1 star<br><br>Service:<br>On our visit, there were still no English menu available, however, our awesome server translated and explained almost the entire menu to us. Because of that and how everyone was so welcoming, I really enjoyed Asado Restaurant. <br><br>1 / 1 star<br><br>Food:<br>Fillet Asador<br>- The fillet was nice and tender and the prawn was nicely prepared. The accompanying garlic cream sauce was not overly garlicky and not too rich. For reference, the fillet weighs 180g, which is approximately 6.3oz. Typical portion of fillet in US is about 8oz.<br><br>1.5 / 2 stars<br><br>Cost Performance:<br>The total of two steak entrées and two drinks were about €40.  Steakhouse Asador was definitely the best bang for the buck restaurant we ate in Berlin.<br><br>1 / 1 star",

"reviewcomment":"Awesome service. Packed - make reservations. Pakistani food, NOT indian, as the only other english language reviewer, with no &#39;Friends&#39;, and one review, stipulates. It&#39;s not personal, or anything to do with her, though. It&#39;s this retarded, buggy &#39;Yelp&#39; system - eliminating many helpful reviews and yet leaving in a review from 2011, from a one-off reviewer.<br><br>{Edit: please also hunt for the mis-categorized  review from &#39;slowfood&#39;. &#39;It&#39;s too sweet/westernized&#39;, goes the review; worth reading. However, given the local community, this is expected. Menu items 108 through 113, are the hot and spicy items. And if you especially want hot and spicy, be sure to ask.}<br><br>Service was good, prompt; much more than can be expected for the city-area generally. This ethnic &#39;proud of my restaurant&#39; shines through. People spoiled on non-local service standards, may easily miss the extra, here, that good service provides.<br><br>The chai was respectable. The salzig lassi could have been saltier; otherwise excellent (salt to taste).<br><br>The fried vegetables were done correctly with a chickpea dough instead of wheat.<br><br>Murgh Salat was very sweet - not offensive - but sweeter than what i want for an evening meal. The mango pulp content made it incredibly sweet - i don&#39;t think any sugar was added. Says something for pakistani mangos, though. Mixed Pakora was good, however, again, the sauce was sweeter than i would have liked. A meat dish will be next.  ...<br><br>Music was not too loud. Bathrooms were private, heated and clean.<br><br>If you had a good experience at this restaurant, please let us know. If you want to thank me for this review, please mark below. Thanks :)",

"reviewcomment":"On a rather cold and wet trip to Berlin, my travel companion and I were staying in the Prenzlauerberg area of Berlin and were looking for a place nearby that we could have dinner after a long day (we were both flying into Berlin very early that morning). Café Jacques was within walking distance from the U-Bahn station that we were adjacent to. This place has had some good reviews, but we wanted to give it a go anyway. The reviews are darn right about this small joint with an amazing menu and a great vibe. <br><br>Certainly make sure you make a reservation if you&#39;re coming here because it gets really packed and we were really lucky to get a spot in here without any reservations. The staff here are über friendly. We didn&#39;t speak any German, but the staff were willing to converse with us in English and even translate pretty much the entire menu for us (and yes, there&#39;s no English menu here - which is actually a good thing). We settled on a pita and hummous starter and pasta and a veal main for our mains. The wine list is absolutely amazing and even the basic wines are absolutely delicious. We both had the Temperanillo which arrived in huge glasses with generous pours. Serving sizes were also very large for Europe (albeit, everything is bigger in Germany ;)). <br><br>This place is definitely off the charts and for a somewhat &#34;hole in the wall&#34; type place, it was absolutely phenomenal. If I&#39;m ever in Berlin again, I would definitely come back here. Great food, great music, great atmosphere and certainly a great city.",

"reviewcomment":"I was here earlier this week with my companion, as well as a couple of other companions. We had a reservation for 6 people at 8 PM, and we got this table right by the balcony. <br><br>When our party all arrived, the servers were quite attentive to all our needs. With 5 people and different food needs, the servers were more than happy to answer our questions (Q: What&#39;s Zigeune sauce? A: That&#39;s a sauce with plenty of Zigeune inside, finely chopped, very delicious!). Seriously, the servers were part entertainers. They seemed to be really enjoying their job. It was a very relaxed environment.<br><br>Okay, let me talk about the food. It was delicious. I had the artichoke appetizer, baked with goat cheese and vegetables. I shared this with my companion. And for my main dish, I got the roast rabbit. That was divine. Finally, my companion and I shared a half-liter of Greek dry red wine.<br><br>One thing I didn&#39;t like about this place is the quantity. Oh my god. Their food servings are huge. My appetizer (which was shared) was 6,50 EUR and comes in a huge plate. And my rabbit was 12,50 EUR and also came in a huge platter. Next time, I would share everything with someone, say, order one appetizer and one main dish to share. Because ideally, they would serve just 60% of the current quantity and reduce the price a little bit. But oh well, there&#39;s a way to trick the system. Hence, I am only giving this place 4 stars.",

"reviewcomment":"Awesome service. Packed - make reservations. Pakistani food, NOT indian, as the only other english language reviewer, with no &#39;Friends&#39;, and one review, stipulates. It&#39;s not personal, or anything to do with her, though. It&#39;s this retarded, buggy &#39;Yelp&#39; system - eliminating many helpful reviews and yet leaving in a review from 2011, from a one-off reviewer.<br><br>{Edit: please also hunt for the mis-categorized  review from &#39;slowfood&#39;. &#39;It&#39;s too sweet/westernized&#39;, goes the review; worth reading. However, given the local community, this is expected. Menu items 108 through 113, are the hot and spicy items. And if you especially want hot and spicy, be sure to ask.}<br><br>Service was good, prompt; much more than can be expected for the city-area generally. This ethnic &#39;proud of my restaurant&#39; shines through. People spoiled on non-local service standards, may easily miss the extra, here, that good service provides.<br><br>The chai was respectable. The salzig lassi could have been saltier; otherwise excellent (salt to taste).<br><br>The fried vegetables were done correctly with a chickpea dough instead of wheat.<br><br>Murgh Salat was very sweet - not offensive - but sweeter than what i want for an evening meal. The mango pulp content made it incredibly sweet - i don&#39;t think any sugar was added. Says something for pakistani mangos, though. Mixed Pakora was good, however, again, the sauce was sweeter than i would have liked. A meat dish will be next.  ...<br><br>Music was not too loud. Bathrooms were private, heated and clean.<br><br>If you had a good experience at this restaurant, please let us know. If you want to thank me for this review, please mark below. Thanks :)",

The menu offers a good choice of ORGANIC meat dishes as well as fish dishes. The last time I was here I had a vegetarian lasagna (similar to moussaka without the meat) and a side order of souvlaki. All very tasty. The &#39;Mythos&#39; Greek beer is very pleasant too.<br><br>The atmosphere is very relaxed and casual - a great place to dine in laid-back surroundings with friends. Though be warned: book a table if you&#39;re going there on the weekend. And it may be advisable to book if you&#39;re going there earlier in the week too!

"reviewcomment":"After perusing Yelp to find a good Asian restaurant near Prenzlaurberg, I picked out Onkel Ho. Good reviews enticed me to it. My verdict is 4 stars. My husband and I really enjoyed the zen ambiance but I was not really impressed by the Pho. Firstly, they had a limited selection of pho. It was either chicken or beef so I ordered the beef soup. To me its a bit boring. I was looking for a combination of beef flank, tripe, tendon along with the beef steak (ohhh yeah I am a meat eater). Secondly, I thought that soup base was not as flavourful as the one I have elsewhere. I feel like it was missing a certain something (spicies or herbs) I cant quite figure out. Thirdly, since I am not so fond of sprouts, I was not too happy that the soup automatically came with it. I was so used to the separate plate of vegetables to accompany my soup. I am unsure if they provide fresh basil with the soup but I was not served with it.<br><br>On the other hand, my husband was impressed by the dish of the day which was vermicelli noodles and grilled beef topped with crushed peanut. They recalled it being juicy and tasty.<br><br>Overall, we were satisfied with out selections but I was not as impressed as my husband.",

"reviewcomment":"This place was almost deserted on an early Sunday evening, it took me quite by surprise seeing that this is usually such a buzzing area. It is - however- NOT the food that was kept the crowds away.<br><br>The udon soups are as hearty as they are delicious, the only catch: deciding which soup to opt for, they all sounds do tempting. I went for the fish soup and didn&#39;t look back to the menu in regret for even a split second. The fish was just slightly fried and melts on the tongue, while the seafood was chewy and oceany to the tee. The noodles were thick and moist, a real treat after getting a little bit fed up with the same old thin rice noodles at Berlins many vietnamese restaurants.<br><br>The decor is ok, large round modern communal tables, the service is decent, and they have an English menu! A perfect spot to grab a bit, or slurp a soup (hence the name) before catching a flick at Babylon up the road. I&#39;ll definitely go soon again!",

From the ridiculously overpriced hamburgers, the highly visible placement of Heinz and Coca-Cola products, to the fact they TAKE CREDIT CARDS and even let you pay in US currency - you&#39;ll feel right at home.<br><br>I had a bacon cheese burger and it was really, really good. Perfectly medium rare and succulently dripping with goodness - served, as it should be, with crisp lettuce, tomatoes, bacon, and an onion ring - I could have been in Texas. Except it was better because I had it with German beer on tap! Heaven!<br><br>WIth my hamburger cravings nicely sated I traipsed across the street to the Apple Store and my &#34;in America&#34; feeling continued.<br><br>Oh, and note to other reviews - why in the world would you order a currywurst here? Not recommend. Not here. No. Don&#39;t do it!",

"reviewcomment":"Awesome service. Packed - make reservations. Pakistani food, NOT indian, as the only other english language reviewer, with no &#39;Friends&#39;, and one review, stipulates. It&#39;s not personal, or anything to do with her, though. It&#39;s this retarded, buggy &#39;Yelp&#39; system - eliminating many helpful reviews and yet leaving in a review from 2011, from a one-off reviewer.<br><br>{Edit: please also hunt for the mis-categorized  review from &#39;slowfood&#39;. &#39;It&#39;s too sweet/westernized&#39;, goes the review; worth reading. However, given the local community, this is expected. Menu items 108 through 113, are the hot and spicy items. And if you especially want hot and spicy, be sure to ask.}<br><br>Service was good, prompt; much more than can be expected for the city-area generally. This ethnic &#39;proud of my restaurant&#39; shines through. People spoiled on non-local service standards, may easily miss the extra, here, that good service provides.<br><br>The chai was respectable. The salzig lassi could have been saltier; otherwise excellent (salt to taste).<br><br>The fried vegetables were done correctly with a chickpea dough instead of wheat.<br><br>Murgh Salat was very sweet - not offensive - but sweeter than what i want for an evening meal. The mango pulp content made it incredibly sweet - i don&#39;t think any sugar was added. Says something for pakistani mangos, though. Mixed Pakora was good, however, again, the sauce was sweeter than i would have liked. A meat dish will be next.  ...<br><br>Music was not too loud. Bathrooms were private, heated and clean.<br><br>If you had a good experience at this restaurant, please let us know. If you want to thank me for this review, please mark below. Thanks :)",

"reviewcomment":"Die Tiergartenquelle hat mir wirklich gut gefallen. Die Atmosphäre eines S-Bahn-Bogens ist schon recht einzigartig, das Gewölbe hebt sich merklich ab von vielen anderen Lokalen.<br>Das Essen ist deftig-deutsch und gut. Ich hatte Cordon-Bleu vom Schwein, meine Mitstreiter unter anderem Schnitzel.<br>Wir saßen zu viert an einem sehr langen Tisch mit unterschiedlichen Tischnachbarn, was mich nicht stört, im Gegenteil. Das Restaurant war an diesem Abend brechend voll, die Bedienung war freundlich, wenn auch bei so vielen Gästen nicht sehr flott, verständlich...<br><br> Das Bier ist sehr gut, wenn die Preise auch ruhig etwas niedriger liegen könnten wird dies meine erste Wahl sein, wenn Übernachtungsgäste aus Übersee ( ich bin &#39;Couchsurfer&#39;) wieder mal authentisch Deutsch essen gehen wollen.<br><br> Nachtrag: War kurz vor Neujahr noch mal dort, diesmal mit 5 Amerikanern und 1 Belgier. Erst jetzt wurden mir die riesigen Portionen bewusst, wir waren sehr früh dort, anscheinend werden die Portionen immer kleiner, wenn der Laden richtig voll ist. <br>Wie gesagt, wir hatten Riesenportionen und es hat uns allen hervorragend geschmeckt. Meine Gäste fanden das Restaurant toll und waren vollends zufrieden. Leider musste eines der Mädels unbedingt so eine schicke Glühweintasse mitgehen lassen, hoffe, ich darf das Lokal noch betreten, kann aber nix dafür, sie hat mir ihr Beutestück erst zuhause gezeigt.<br><br> For English Visitors:<br><br> Tiergartenquelle is THE place to experience an original Berlin atmosphere without being too touristy!<br>Portions are giant, prices reasonable and the beer is one of the best Berlin provides.<br>Even for larger groups tables are available in order to serve tourists as well as families and people living around the venue.<br>Some of my friends didnt found the place, but its sooo simple: its situated in the same building as Tiergarten S-Bahn-station, just fall on the street and take next door to your right.",

"reviewcomment":"Awesome service. Packed - make reservations. Pakistani food, NOT indian, as the only other english language reviewer, with no &#39;Friends&#39;, and one review, stipulates. It&#39;s not personal, or anything to do with her, though. It&#39;s this retarded, buggy &#39;Yelp&#39; system - eliminating many helpful reviews and yet leaving in a review from 2011, from a one-off reviewer.<br><br>{Edit: please also hunt for the mis-categorized  review from &#39;slowfood&#39;. &#39;It&#39;s too sweet/westernized&#39;, goes the review; worth reading. However, given the local community, this is expected. Menu items 108 through 113, are the hot and spicy items. And if you especially want hot and spicy, be sure to ask.}<br><br>Service was good, prompt; much more than can be expected for the city-area generally. This ethnic &#39;proud of my restaurant&#39; shines through. People spoiled on non-local service standards, may easily miss the extra, here, that good service provides.<br><br>The chai was respectable. The salzig lassi could have been saltier; otherwise excellent (salt to taste).<br><br>The fried vegetables were done correctly with a chickpea dough instead of wheat.<br><br>Murgh Salat was very sweet - not offensive - but sweeter than what i want for an evening meal. The mango pulp content made it incredibly sweet - i don&#39;t think any sugar was added. Says something for pakistani mangos, though. Mixed Pakora was good, however, again, the sauce was sweeter than i would have liked. A meat dish will be next.  ...<br><br>Music was not too loud. Bathrooms were private, heated and clean.<br><br>If you had a good experience at this restaurant, please let us know. If you want to thank me for this review, please mark below. Thanks :)",

"reviewcomment":"we were wandering around looking for a place for dinner away from what would for sure be tourist traps on Unter der Linden near Brandenberger Tor. i&#39;m sure we were not walking down the right roads but it seems like few options are available, and yet fewer are open on a Saturday evening.<br><br>trusty ol&#39; yelp led us to Maximilian&#39;s, tucked indoors on the main level of an office building. boy was it popular with the locals! there is a relaxed &#34;patio&#34; seating area and cozy tables and booths inside. service was a bit slow to get the menu, to take our orders, to get the cheque, to bring the bill. not sure if it&#39;s just the more relaxed atmosphere of Europe/Germany that we&#39;re not used to in North America so I won&#39;t hold it against this place.<br><br>- BERLINER EISBEIN MIT KARTOFFELN, SAUERKRAUT UND ERBSPÜREE (13,90€) - little ol&#39; me gets served this dish with Berlin-style pork hock the size of my HEAD with boiled potatoes, sauerkraut, and roasted pea puree. the pork was so flavourful and boiled to the point where the skin/fat/meat was all buttahhh. by the time I was finished, it looked like I had barely touched the plate form the opposite angle. more ridiculous, my leftovers proved enough for 3 tasty tasty sandwiches the following day and a half. wunderbar :)<br>- SCHWEINSHAXE MIT SEMMELKNÖDEL UND SAUERKRAUT (11,90€) - this traditionally Bavarian roasted pork knuckle comes with bread dumpling and sauerkraut. not a fan of bread dumpling, as it&#39;s much too dense for me, but the pork had an insanely crackling skin. so crispy!!<br><br>prices are verrrry decent for the portions! paulaner is a plenty here. this place is solid.",

The one with viges is really popular.<br><br>They have a lunch menu, a salad &amp; a pasta for a fair price. Their wine menu has some delicious choices from Italy and around. You can also order a plate of antipasti with a tasty glass of red wine. Great in the summer, sitting outside on the terras. Watching all those fashionable people walk past you. <br><br>Reserving a table might be a good idea, it is very popular so you&#39;ll have to be lucky for a table. It&#39;s located on a great spot if you want to go for drinks afterwords. Torstrasse <br>is full of great bars and small clubs. So enjoy your time there and let me know how it was!",

Overall the burger was very juicy and had good flavors. I would have wished for a larger bun, it seems somehow to be a trend to server burgers with larger buns. Also next time I would go for a smaller burger as these ones have better patty, bun and other ingredients ratios. Overall it was a good burger. The fries come with either mayo or ketchup. The ketchup is excellent, it seems to be some sort of homemade ketchup.",

"reviewcomment":"I came here on my trip to Europe by recommendation of  a Berliner local and it proved to be my favorite restaurant in all of Europe. And I&#39;m not even a vegetarian!   Actually, before this place, I had a FEAR of eating vegan and vegetarian food.  Everything served at this place was incredible and the atmosphere was the first place I finally felt comfortable and &#34;at home&#34;.  Plus it was my first place I finally got a decent cup of tea!  Thank you for having honey!!!!<br><br>Seriously, if you can only eat at one place in Berlin, this is where you MUST go.",

"reviewcomment":"Awesome service. Packed - make reservations. Pakistani food, NOT indian, as the only other english language reviewer, with no &#39;Friends&#39;, and one review, stipulates. It&#39;s not personal, or anything to do with her, though. It&#39;s this retarded, buggy &#39;Yelp&#39; system - eliminating many helpful reviews and yet leaving in a review from 2011, from a one-off reviewer.<br><br>{Edit: please also hunt for the mis-categorized  review from &#39;slowfood&#39;. &#39;It&#39;s too sweet/westernized&#39;, goes the review; worth reading. However, given the local community, this is expected. Menu items 108 through 113, are the hot and spicy items. And if you especially want hot and spicy, be sure to ask.}<br><br>Service was good, prompt; much more than can be expected for the city-area generally. This ethnic &#39;proud of my restaurant&#39; shines through. People spoiled on non-local service standards, may easily miss the extra, here, that good service provides.<br><br>The chai was respectable. The salzig lassi could have been saltier; otherwise excellent (salt to taste).<br><br>The fried vegetables were done correctly with a chickpea dough instead of wheat.<br><br>Murgh Salat was very sweet - not offensive - but sweeter than what i want for an evening meal. The mango pulp content made it incredibly sweet - i don&#39;t think any sugar was added. Says something for pakistani mangos, though. Mixed Pakora was good, however, again, the sauce was sweeter than i would have liked. A meat dish will be next.  ...<br><br>Music was not too loud. Bathrooms were private, heated and clean.<br><br>If you had a good experience at this restaurant, please let us know. If you want to thank me for this review, please mark below. Thanks :)",

"reviewcomment":"Today we once again sampled the wonder of Italy, while still at home in Berlin. Ristorante Masaniello (not to overstate it) is the shit.<br><br>Run by a family from Naples, the place charmed from the moment we entered and the wood powered oven cooked our divine pizza margherita. Who knew that a little tomato sauce, buffalo mozzarella and basil was all you really needed on a pizza? Oh right - the Italians. This place reconfirms that all you need is the right ingredients to make transcendent food.  <br><br>We ordered another pizza with salami and, olives &amp; artichokes....but that margherita stole our heart. Its pure creamy goodness was exactly what we wanted. And their spicy oil was even better than XXL - an impressive feat. On top of all this, our Italian server, homey decor, and temptress of a courtyard already have us planing for a return visit. Parents - we are taking you here. You&#39;re welcome.",

"reviewcomment":"The Tauro is an odd creature, Berlin&#39;s idea of what Spanish cuisine is or should be like.<br><br> The architecture is admittedly impressive - in the same way as a restaurant at Disney World. Too big, too tourist-friendly to be interesting.<br><br> There are many &#34;fish out of water&#34; moments when the German service tries to create the impression you&#39;re dining at a hospitable Spanish restaurant. It&#39;s obvious that these people do not have any emotional (or other) connection to the place they are working at. They will hardly understand when you order those Spanish dishes by their original names.<br><br> We came here twice, and frankly, it&#39;s improbable we&#39;ll try our luck again. The wines are quite good, but the food is generic, rather a well-meant simulation than &#34;the real thing&#34;.",

"reviewcomment":"I had a phenominal meal here last Saturday. This is a cozy little restaurant that features some amazing cuisine.  If you are looking for a normal menu and large serving sizes-- This isn&#39;t the right restaurant for you.  They create a gourmet experience for you using a lot of new techniques. Here it&#39;s about the variety and complexity of the flavors.  They offer things two ways-- You can pay individually for the menus items, which adorn the chalkboards around the restuarant, or you can choose one of their multi-course menus. If you do it this way you&#39;ll get a lot more value for your money. They also offer wine pairings- which I partook of.  The place is very small, with only 6-8 tables that seat between 2-4 people, and the kitchen is open and in the same room, so you are inundated with amazing smells as your food (and your fellow diners) is prepared.<br><br>Let&#39;s start with the service- Phenominal. The waiter was professional, friendy, and described each dish like he was the chef as he presented it. He worked with me to help me pick out the right choices, and fully explained the reasons why he chose he wine pairing for each dish as if he was a Sommelier (which he may have been).  His knowledge was extensive on both the food and wine, and the flavors of each and how they would interact.  I could not have been in better hands. <br><br>The dishes features aromas and flavors that were very complex but perfectly paired-- such as the Rabbit (cooked perfectly) served with mussels, langostino, edamame, and thinnly sliced chips of crispy blood sausage, all with a dense, luscious broth of intense buttery flavor made from the mussels and lord knows what else. This broth was easily one of the single best things I have ever had and I ended up pouring the remainder of it directly into my spoon and drinking it down.  The chefs also do an amazing job of incorporating dollops (spheres?) of pureed vegetables like roasted orange bell pepper or a dense, yet sweet tomato paste/puree (that was anything but tomato paste), or Parsnip... They had one dish that had Onions served three different ways- and one of the ways was a delicate sweet foam. <br><br>If you like great food and wine, you should come here. You&#39;ll drop a lot of Euros, but you&#39;ll leave very happy with an experience, not just a meal. You don&#39;t have to dress up to dine here- but you&#39;ll feel underdressed in comparrison to the service and food you are being given. It&#39;s a GREAT place for a date. Probably not a good place for small children as it is high cuisine.",

Service is normally attentive and friendly, though I had few cases (been there at least 8 times) which I got &#34;Berliner style&#34; replies... Good wines, even the &#34;normal&#34; house wines are surprisingly not that bad as in most places, but (as it is quite common in the area) truly overpriced. <br>One of the main advantages of the place is the terrace.

(unlike some other places I&#39;ve been to...but then again, there weren&#39;t any smokers at the time).  Lining the long wall were three large wooden &#34;steps&#34; padded with cushions and regularly interrupted by small tables with menus, pots of sugar, and books.  These stair/benches were decently but not super comfortable, but I still I enjoyed sitting there--it was the perfect people-watching spot, with great views out the large windows of the street.<br><br>Also in the café were sofas (which I later moved to), plentiful outlets, WIFI, and delicious drinks.  On the slightly pricier end of things, but the warm red currant juice (with a hint of cinnamon!) that I ordered was absolutely delectable.<br><br>Coming back for sure!",

Unlike many other cafes that I&#39;ve been to, Milch und Zucker offers fresh squeezed juice. They&#39;ll mix any 3 or 4 fruits of your choice!<br><br>The shop has a lunch period from about 12:30-14:30 where they ask for customers to enjoy and savor their lunch instead of using the wifi. I know this might seem strange to some but I like that they&#39;re trying to preserve the traditional coffee culture of drinking coffee without any external influences of work and such. <br><br>I wish there were more plugs, but wifi is great and a fantastic place to study.",

"reviewcomment":"Awesome service. Packed - make reservations. Pakistani food, NOT indian, as the only other english language reviewer, with no &#39;Friends&#39;, and one review, stipulates. It&#39;s not personal, or anything to do with her, though. It&#39;s this retarded, buggy &#39;Yelp&#39; system - eliminating many helpful reviews and yet leaving in a review from 2011, from a one-off reviewer.<br><br>{Edit: please also hunt for the mis-categorized  review from &#39;slowfood&#39;. &#39;It&#39;s too sweet/westernized&#39;, goes the review; worth reading. However, given the local community, this is expected. Menu items 108 through 113, are the hot and spicy items. And if you especially want hot and spicy, be sure to ask.}<br><br>Service was good, prompt; much more than can be expected for the city-area generally. This ethnic &#39;proud of my restaurant&#39; shines through. People spoiled on non-local service standards, may easily miss the extra, here, that good service provides.<br><br>The chai was respectable. The salzig lassi could have been saltier; otherwise excellent (salt to taste).<br><br>The fried vegetables were done correctly with a chickpea dough instead of wheat.<br><br>Murgh Salat was very sweet - not offensive - but sweeter than what i want for an evening meal. The mango pulp content made it incredibly sweet - i don&#39;t think any sugar was added. Says something for pakistani mangos, though. Mixed Pakora was good, however, again, the sauce was sweeter than i would have liked. A meat dish will be next.  ...<br><br>Music was not too loud. Bathrooms were private, heated and clean.<br><br>If you had a good experience at this restaurant, please let us know. If you want to thank me for this review, please mark below. Thanks :)",

"reviewcomment":"In my opinion, this is without a doubt one of the best places I have found in Berlin for Coffee. The cappuccino is technically perfect: a strong shot of dark brown, freshly roasted espresso topped with thick, creamy (full fat) milk with a dusting of chocolate and served with an amaretti biscuit.<br><br> On offer is a wide range of cakes, chocolates and other calorie laden sweet things which are pretty much irresistible to the hardiest dieter. Also worth noting is the nice selection of salads and sandwiches on offer during lunching hours, which in Berlin is anything from 1100 - 1800.<br>However, some may find the smell alone in the adjacent store to be satisfactory enough - you can buy all of the Coffee that they serve in the café and more, freshly ground. On offer is a wide range of high quality chocolate from Berlin, Germany and further afield such as Switzerland &amp; Austria.<br><br> Bear in mind, you do pay for the privilege of having an exceptional coffee in a fairly nice neighborhood, as a cappuccino was around 3,80EUR but it&#39;s so worth it!",

There is a smoking area inside which is such a great idea comes from heaven! (specially in winter in Berlin!) <br><br>Everything but the waitress! Yeah. The one star of the 5 stars falls because of the bitchy blondie waitress on last sunday morning. I am not even talking about how long i waited for a breakfast, I am just so annoyed because of the attitude. I disapprove the rude and spoiled waitress attitude which some people think it is cool and kind a hot! what is wrong with you people? Nobody has to be a smiley face all the time but also nobody has to be an ass.     <br><br>2 breakfast days spent in one week holiday. You should definitely try.",

Doing this is probably illegal in the US. We ordered our appetizer platter with a shot of vodka each (it&#39;s a combo special!) after hearing that these guys were generous with the pour. What we didn&#39;t expect is that they would keep coming back throughout the meal and giving us various different flavors of vodka.<br><br>All in all we received 4 ice cold shots of different flavors of vodka, EACH, and only paid for 1 pair of shots. The food wasn&#39;t even that pricey: we paid 12 euros for the appetizer platter (shots included) and 10 euros each for our mains. Best business model ever, I think?",

"reviewcomment":"Awesome service. Packed - make reservations. Pakistani food, NOT indian, as the only other english language reviewer, with no &#39;Friends&#39;, and one review, stipulates. It&#39;s not personal, or anything to do with her, though. It&#39;s this retarded, buggy &#39;Yelp&#39; system - eliminating many helpful reviews and yet leaving in a review from 2011, from a one-off reviewer.<br><br>{Edit: please also hunt for the mis-categorized  review from &#39;slowfood&#39;. &#39;It&#39;s too sweet/westernized&#39;, goes the review; worth reading. However, given the local community, this is expected. Menu items 108 through 113, are the hot and spicy items. And if you especially want hot and spicy, be sure to ask.}<br><br>Service was good, prompt; much more than can be expected for the city-area generally. This ethnic &#39;proud of my restaurant&#39; shines through. People spoiled on non-local service standards, may easily miss the extra, here, that good service provides.<br><br>The chai was respectable. The salzig lassi could have been saltier; otherwise excellent (salt to taste).<br><br>The fried vegetables were done correctly with a chickpea dough instead of wheat.<br><br>Murgh Salat was very sweet - not offensive - but sweeter than what i want for an evening meal. The mango pulp content made it incredibly sweet - i don&#39;t think any sugar was added. Says something for pakistani mangos, though. Mixed Pakora was good, however, again, the sauce was sweeter than i would have liked. A meat dish will be next.  ...<br><br>Music was not too loud. Bathrooms were private, heated and clean.<br><br>If you had a good experience at this restaurant, please let us know. If you want to thank me for this review, please mark below. Thanks :)",

During the week they offer a 16 EUR quick lunch option with 4 starters and 4 mains to choose from. Our food was excellent and the staff was very nice. They cook modern European cuisine, with local influences. I will certainly go back there. For dinner they offer a bit more elaborated menu which also seems extremely worth checking out.",

"reviewcomment":"Awesome service. Packed - make reservations. Pakistani food, NOT indian, as the only other english language reviewer, with no &#39;Friends&#39;, and one review, stipulates. It&#39;s not personal, or anything to do with her, though. It&#39;s this retarded, buggy &#39;Yelp&#39; system - eliminating many helpful reviews and yet leaving in a review from 2011, from a one-off reviewer.<br><br>{Edit: please also hunt for the mis-categorized  review from &#39;slowfood&#39;. &#39;It&#39;s too sweet/westernized&#39;, goes the review; worth reading. However, given the local community, this is expected. Menu items 108 through 113, are the hot and spicy items. And if you especially want hot and spicy, be sure to ask.}<br><br>Service was good, prompt; much more than can be expected for the city-area generally. This ethnic &#39;proud of my restaurant&#39; shines through. People spoiled on non-local service standards, may easily miss the extra, here, that good service provides.<br><br>The chai was respectable. The salzig lassi could have been saltier; otherwise excellent (salt to taste).<br><br>The fried vegetables were done correctly with a chickpea dough instead of wheat.<br><br>Murgh Salat was very sweet - not offensive - but sweeter than what i want for an evening meal. The mango pulp content made it incredibly sweet - i don&#39;t think any sugar was added. Says something for pakistani mangos, though. Mixed Pakora was good, however, again, the sauce was sweeter than i would have liked. A meat dish will be next.  ...<br><br>Music was not too loud. Bathrooms were private, heated and clean.<br><br>If you had a good experience at this restaurant, please let us know. If you want to thank me for this review, please mark below. Thanks :)",

That being said, the service was rather friendly and I was not even &#34;hooked&#34; by them while walking, I just thought that I could try the place because it had some decent food and I felt hungry (happens from time to time).<br><br>Here you may order a lunch menu (till 17h) for 5,50€ which seems very low to be but Berlin is definitely not a pricey place. I went for a vegetarian meal made from lentils mostly. I was also given an appetizer &#34;biscuit&#34; (spicy) along with a tomato sauce and the some flat-bread. Everything tasted really good already. I took a mango-yoghurt drink to go with that, for smoothing all the upcoming spiciness. Fair trade and organic, always good to know, but 2,90 which is quite high in comparison with the meal itself. Also took an Indian tea at the end, not amazing but OK with an honey aftertaste.",

"reviewcomment":"This is a cool place, with chunky modern dark wood tables and benches inducing a convivial atmosphere, as one often has to share the larger tables with strangers. The glass walls are illuminated by funky color-changing lights and adds to a slightly surreal ambience, like a fancy place from the film Blade Runner.<br><br> The food is generally very tasty, Thai of origin, with a healthy blend of Vietnamese and Singaporean, and you can order small or regular portions. My usual trick is to get a few starters and then order the 1 kilo of fried fresh king prawns, which means that one must always come here with a friend as that&#39;s a lot of prawns!<br><br> Service is usually pretty good, unless the place is packed, which is quite often during the weekends, so reservations are definitely recommended.<br><br> Overall, it&#39;s a nice place to take friends who want to try an unusual modern Asian bistro, and that&#39;s what I do.",

Which is always a good sign. <br>The food was fantastic.  Rustic italian style, no pizzas but alot of different pastas and salads and couple of fish and meat dishes... They also have a great vine selection, all Italian of cause :) <br>This place is highly recommendable<br><br>Dk:<br>Vi vidste ikke rigtig så meget som stedet da vi tog her til, ud over at det var italiensk mand. Men vi blev virkelig overrasket.<br>Restauranten var rigtig hyggelig, med en meget autentisk italiensk atmosfære. Alle bordene havde rødternet dug og et lille sterinlys, og vægene var rå mursten. Personalet snakkede italiensk til hinanden, og der var en del lokale italienere der for at spise (hvilket altid er et godt tegn).<br>Maden var fantastisk; rustik italiensk stil. De har ingen pizza, men der er en masse forskelliige pasta retter og lækre salater, og et par fiske- og kød retter (som viste bliver skiftet ud fra dag til dag). Det har også et ret fint vinkort, men noget for en hver smag, de er selvfølgelig allesammen italienske.<br>Dette sted er meget anbefalelsesværdigt!",

They even serve breakfast during weekdays until 3 pm or in weekends until 5 pm. That&#39;s very well needed in Berlin where you can party day and night and forget about when it&#39;s time for breakfast... But that aside...  I loved the burgers. Very nice chips that go with the burgers and an amazing taste. But next time I&#39;m going to order mine without the spread mayonnaise as it contains a lot of garlic. You&#39;re reminded of that after every little burp ;)",

"reviewcomment":"Awesome service. Packed - make reservations. Pakistani food, NOT indian, as the only other english language reviewer, with no &#39;Friends&#39;, and one review, stipulates. It&#39;s not personal, or anything to do with her, though. It&#39;s this retarded, buggy &#39;Yelp&#39; system - eliminating many helpful reviews and yet leaving in a review from 2011, from a one-off reviewer.<br><br>{Edit: please also hunt for the mis-categorized  review from &#39;slowfood&#39;. &#39;It&#39;s too sweet/westernized&#39;, goes the review; worth reading. However, given the local community, this is expected. Menu items 108 through 113, are the hot and spicy items. And if you especially want hot and spicy, be sure to ask.}<br><br>Service was good, prompt; much more than can be expected for the city-area generally. This ethnic &#39;proud of my restaurant&#39; shines through. People spoiled on non-local service standards, may easily miss the extra, here, that good service provides.<br><br>The chai was respectable. The salzig lassi could have been saltier; otherwise excellent (salt to taste).<br><br>The fried vegetables were done correctly with a chickpea dough instead of wheat.<br><br>Murgh Salat was very sweet - not offensive - but sweeter than what i want for an evening meal. The mango pulp content made it incredibly sweet - i don&#39;t think any sugar was added. Says something for pakistani mangos, though. Mixed Pakora was good, however, again, the sauce was sweeter than i would have liked. A meat dish will be next.  ...<br><br>Music was not too loud. Bathrooms were private, heated and clean.<br><br>If you had a good experience at this restaurant, please let us know. If you want to thank me for this review, please mark below. Thanks :)",

And what else do you want on your first evening in Berlin?<br><br>The pork knuckle was so tender and tasty, with potatoes boiled in a thick, tasty stock, sweet sourkraut. I also tried the shnitzel and it was tender and moist with crispy batter and good chips. The beer kept on coming, we kept on talking and I had to be rolled back to the appartment...all for about £13/person !<br><br>I need to learn how to speak German !",

"reviewcomment":"we arrived in berlin extremely hungry. by now, we&#39;d been on a 7-8 hour flight from delhi, followed by a 2-3 hour wait until we boarded multiple trains that took hours to get us from frankfurt to berlin. <br><br>the place with the best reviews was dicke wirtin - right around the corner from our hotel, and later we discovered was also suggested by our hotel. <br><br>the sign was very misleading being placed where it was. there was a door right next to it and we walked in only to find an empty abandoned building within. we were very confused, then peeped around the corner and found the patio and restaurant we were looking for.<br><br>the menu gives a brief background about the place:<br>&#34;welcome... in our typical berliner restaurant in a comfortable atmosphere directly in the berlin city-west.<br>located on savignyplatz in charlottenburg, the dicke wirtin (fat landlady) has been a berlin institution for decades and a student stronghold since the heady days of the 1960s demonstrations.<br>the clientele is a mix of students and locals who come here to dig into hearty portions of traditional german homemade dishes.<br>9 different beers on tap &amp; more than 30 in house brandies and liquers.&#34;<br><br>we each ordered a beer - i had the schnedier weisse hef and my s.o. had a pilsner. we ordered a riesen-bockwurst (large frankfurter) and the charlottenburger : zwiebelrostbraten vom rumpsteak mit bratkartoffeln &amp; salat or, onion beef roast with fried potatoes and salad (top left). between this &#34;burger&#34; as they called it (really it was just a steak/burger patty with an au jus type dressing, topped with grilled onions) and our beers, we were pretty full - but then we saw the warmer apfelstrudel (warm apple strudel with custard and cream).  a lot of people raved about this dessert, and i&#39;m a sucker for a warm apple dish, so we got it, and we&#39;re so glad we did. <br><br>we wanted to come back to dicke wirtin for at least a beer and another apple strudel, but unfortunately, our stay in berlin was very brief... and it was on to the next!",

"reviewcomment":"To be honest, I had not very high expectations for dinner, after peeking through the earlier reviews. But I went with a Swabian who highly recommended the place for authentic Schwabisch food and it was actually surprisingly unexpectedly amazingly rather good! I had the Badisches Schneckensüppchen (snail in cream) soup and it was simply great. Creamy, silky, aromatic, with the snails perfectly textured and tasty. Since Helmut Kohl was recently on TV, I ordered the Schwäbischer Saumagen (stuffed pig&#39;s stomach) in his honour, and I can now understand why he insisted that every head of state that visited Germany had to have one. And unlike President Chirac, I rather enjoyed mine, though I have to also add that it may be some time before I order another one as it was so substantial! I also have to confess that I left most of the sauerkraut uneaten as I hate the stuff, but then I always do this anywhere where they serve it (except for Borchardt).<br><br> I didn&#39;t recognise any of the German wines but the restaurant had federweiss (fermented grape juice, 10% alcohol) and we had that instead though it was rather expensive at 4,50 Eur per little glass.<br><br> Unlike the problems experienced by the other reviewers, I have to say that service was perfectly fine, although a little slow. Perhaps chatting politely to the staff and expressing genuine interest in the many (many) Swabian dishes helped. Speaking German also helps although they have an English menu (which we didn&#39;t need).<br><br> The atmosphere is pretty OK - it&#39;s not too fancy but it was pretty packed with Germans and very few tourists and everyone looked like they were enjoying themselves.<br><br> Anyway, I will definitely be back here to sample more authentic Swabian dishes here - it is different from the rather greasy and heavy local food in Berlin which I am not too fond of.<br><br> And one thing I would recommend is to try the dishes with the names you have never heard of. Who would have thought that the Swabians do snails so much better than the French? My friend had the tripe and that was also sensational, as good as the best tripola de Firentina in Florence.",

"reviewcomment":"Awesome service. Packed - make reservations. Pakistani food, NOT indian, as the only other english language reviewer, with no &#39;Friends&#39;, and one review, stipulates. It&#39;s not personal, or anything to do with her, though. It&#39;s this retarded, buggy &#39;Yelp&#39; system - eliminating many helpful reviews and yet leaving in a review from 2011, from a one-off reviewer.<br><br>{Edit: please also hunt for the mis-categorized  review from &#39;slowfood&#39;. &#39;It&#39;s too sweet/westernized&#39;, goes the review; worth reading. However, given the local community, this is expected. Menu items 108 through 113, are the hot and spicy items. And if you especially want hot and spicy, be sure to ask.}<br><br>Service was good, prompt; much more than can be expected for the city-area generally. This ethnic &#39;proud of my restaurant&#39; shines through. People spoiled on non-local service standards, may easily miss the extra, here, that good service provides.<br><br>The chai was respectable. The salzig lassi could have been saltier; otherwise excellent (salt to taste).<br><br>The fried vegetables were done correctly with a chickpea dough instead of wheat.<br><br>Murgh Salat was very sweet - not offensive - but sweeter than what i want for an evening meal. The mango pulp content made it incredibly sweet - i don&#39;t think any sugar was added. Says something for pakistani mangos, though. Mixed Pakora was good, however, again, the sauce was sweeter than i would have liked. A meat dish will be next.  ...<br><br>Music was not too loud. Bathrooms were private, heated and clean.<br><br>If you had a good experience at this restaurant, please let us know. If you want to thank me for this review, please mark below. Thanks :)",

"reviewcomment":"My companion and I were here one evening, as we were invited by some friends. We already had dinner, so all we did was drink beer. <br><br>They brew their own beer, and as with every German brewery, they only serve a pils, a hefeweizen, a dark beer, and some other special brew. Nothing else. Egal, purity laws aside, I do like their brews. <br><br>I took the four-beer sampler, which is basically 0,1 liter each of the four brews that are currently available. I enjoyed them very much, and it was very palatable and smooth to the touch. I just wish that they did more varieties than those allowed by draconian beer laws. But I suppose that&#39;s not the brewery&#39;s problem.<br><br>I won&#39;t mind going back here again for a beer. They also offer German pub food: it looked mouth-watering, but I was too full to eat at that time.",

"reviewcomment":"I&#39;ve had so much amazing Italian food while in Berlin... I didn&#39;t think it was possible to eat this good! Gorgonzola Club definitely tops the list.<br><br>Terrace seating out front, romantic dark interior with a lot of space, and a lovely little garden terrace nestled in the back of the restaurant. The menu was extensive - pasta, pizzas, main dishes, appetizers, etc. <br><br>We started the meal with a glass of Prosecco and a plate of bruschetta. The bruschetta is a bit different than the stale toasts topped with tomatoes that many are used to, instead it comes out looking a bit like a pizza and tasting a lot like heaven. A thin dough topped with juicy tomatoes, olive oil and tons of garlic. Don&#39;t skip it! <br><br>Next, I had the seafood pasta which was one of the daily specials. I received a large portion of spaghetti in red sauce filled with the tiniest, sweetest clams, shrimp, squid, and so on. The dish was delicious. <br><br>I also tried a bite of pizza that a friend ordered - it was very tasty. <br><br>We finished the meal with an espresso. The food was on-point and memorable. The service was also impeccable.<br><br>Whether you&#39;re in the area or not, Gorgonzola Club is worth a visit!",

"reviewcomment":"Ate here last night with my husband and had a wonderful meal!  Great atmosphere, food &amp; prices. <br>Zitrone is a great place for a dinner date - the inside seating is intimate and quiet.  There are tables outside as well but because it is right on the street it isn&#39;t the most intimate setting.  But the outside would be great for brunch or drinks with friends!  Service was solid, we were given menus right away and drinks came quickly. <br><br>They have a small menu with permanent options as well as specials (I&#39;m not sure how often they change) which Include most of the entrees.  The prices are awesome!  Most entrees were around 8-15 Euro.<br>I had the linguini with the Gorgonzola walnut sauce and slices of Asian pear - it was very good and very filling!  My husband enjoyed his prosciutto wrapped pork medallions with rosemary that came with potatoes and tomatoes on the side.<br><br>We were both very happy with our entrees and the whole experience!  Would definitely go back for dinner.  From other Yelp reviews it sounds like the brunch is good, too.",

This makes it great for functions as well as making the venue feel small and cosy despite how huge it is. <br><br>The food is OK. Nothing to rave about. Maybe I chose badly, or maybe I&#39;m just not a big fan of this cuisine. But the beer is cold and the open fires are toasty.<br><br>PS. There is an English menu available for tourists :p",

"reviewcomment":"As everyone has already said, the real secret to dining here while still holding onto some of your money is to come for lunch. I had a lovely experience here. They have a great online reservation system with an easy interface so I highly recommend that.<br><br>I ordered a 2 course meal for 35 euros. The main cost driver here is definitely drinks... I ordered water (stupid, should have just gotten tap water) which was 10 euros which is completely absurd, and a riesling by the glass (11 euros). The riesling was good for sure, but 11 euros for a few sips? uhhh no. Not a fan. <br><br>For the meal itself, I ordered the onsen egg because I&#39;ve never had one before and the skate wing. Both were excellent and I was more than pleased. My favorite part of the meal was definitely the amuse bouche though--always fun for me. When I went, it was an asparagus puree with king prawn mmmm delicious. The onsen egg was great--I didn&#39;t know what it was which is why I ordered it. It turned out to basically be a soft boiled egg that was fried on the outside. I don&#39;t even want to imagine how difficult that probably is to cook. It was on top of a potato puree with various mushrooms mixed in and then complemented with a nice lobster bisque. Great starter.<br><br>My main course was the skate wing which I&#39;ve always never had before and I&#39;m definitely a fan after this meal. Perfectly cooked and really well-seasoned, I was really pleased with it.<br><br>The service is precisely what you would expect from your standard double MIchelin. They were there when they needed to be and not there when they didn&#39;t need to. They were knowledgable about the food, and just polite and friendly. I am quite the fan.<br><br>Definitely a little torn on the rating here. For sure 5-star food but the drinks tab is really ridiculous, and I wasn&#39;t mind blown by anything here. When I go to a double or triple Michelin, I&#39;m really looking to have my mind-blown. Everything is great here, but nothing is spectacular or anything. <br><br>tldr; if you want to experience a double michelin for a cheaper price, come at lunch for a very reasonably priced lunch menu; avoid getting water though unless you want to dump 10 euros for it!",

"reviewcomment":"On my fifth day in Berlin, I ate at the Massai !<br><br>One star for the look : The Massai is an African restaurant. From the outside, you can totally get this feeling. Once inside, you have travelled in an instant to Africa. The waiters are dressed with a white african-like uniform and the menu are... How can I say ? When the menu arrived at the table, I thought there were severals XD Not. Actually, it is a fully binded book and each page is really thick. It looks like the menu has been carved in wood. Really funny, I would like to be the waiter with a table for 4 ! :D<br><br>One star for the food : I asked for an Antelope meat. One the menu there was no specification about the rest. Just that there would be wild rice and vegetables. I had a soup as a started, which I had not ordered. It was OMG delicious. They I had my plate. When I say plate, I should say PLATE: I had never seen such a huge plate, could barely stand on the table. On this plate I had the meat, perfectly cooked, some vegies in some kind of coconut shell, some beans in another shell, some wild rice kept warm under another shell. I cannot really explain how good it warm. It was just... Beautiful ! If you want to try this dish, look at the section Cap Special of the menu and Antelop meat.<br><br>One star for the people : Really nice and helpful AND fast !<br><br>One star for the presentation : Every plate, bowl, is decorated with African designs and the word MASSAI. Really exotic :)<br><br>Anything else to add ? I have not put a five star, though I would really like to, because my friend thought it was way too spicy. And it was not actually specified on the menu that it would be that much. If you are in Berlin, think of my recommandation and Enjoy !",

They were also serving a &#39;fest&#39; beer which I can vouch for, having drunk it somewhere else (<a href='/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.qype.co.uk%2Fplace%2F1866-Tiergartenquelle-Berlin&amp;s=17ba9b0a508bdcdcc473b5cde3efe630a89c8d12c20f7bdee0c821891a25b441' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>qype.co.uk/place/1866-Ti…</a>) . The one thing that was lacking to my mind was the option to order some kind of &#39;Bierprobe&#39; so that you can try all of their beers.

"reviewcomment":"Awesome service. Packed - make reservations. Pakistani food, NOT indian, as the only other english language reviewer, with no &#39;Friends&#39;, and one review, stipulates. It&#39;s not personal, or anything to do with her, though. It&#39;s this retarded, buggy &#39;Yelp&#39; system - eliminating many helpful reviews and yet leaving in a review from 2011, from a one-off reviewer.<br><br>{Edit: please also hunt for the mis-categorized  review from &#39;slowfood&#39;. &#39;It&#39;s too sweet/westernized&#39;, goes the review; worth reading. However, given the local community, this is expected. Menu items 108 through 113, are the hot and spicy items. And if you especially want hot and spicy, be sure to ask.}<br><br>Service was good, prompt; much more than can be expected for the city-area generally. This ethnic &#39;proud of my restaurant&#39; shines through. People spoiled on non-local service standards, may easily miss the extra, here, that good service provides.<br><br>The chai was respectable. The salzig lassi could have been saltier; otherwise excellent (salt to taste).<br><br>The fried vegetables were done correctly with a chickpea dough instead of wheat.<br><br>Murgh Salat was very sweet - not offensive - but sweeter than what i want for an evening meal. The mango pulp content made it incredibly sweet - i don&#39;t think any sugar was added. Says something for pakistani mangos, though. Mixed Pakora was good, however, again, the sauce was sweeter than i would have liked. A meat dish will be next.  ...<br><br>Music was not too loud. Bathrooms were private, heated and clean.<br><br>If you had a good experience at this restaurant, please let us know. If you want to thank me for this review, please mark below. Thanks :)",

"reviewcomment":"I eat here every time I go to Berlin. I recommend everyone who visits to check it out.<br><br>Having heard great reviews, we went over for Sunday brunch only to be greeted by staff that became even ruder when we didn&#39;t have a reservation. (Having just learned about Kopps and not knowing the culture of German brunch I feel is a good excuse.) They gave a reservation for a couple hours later so we had a wander around. When we returned, we were still treated poorly, despite having a reservation. <br><br>And then the chef came out. He was so nice, took us to our table personally (much to the chagrin of the front of house) and melted all of our foreign fears away. Once he left however, we were never spoken to again by the staff and had to get water ourselves by asking at the bar.<br><br>But on to the main bit: The Food! Vegan, traditional German food I wanted, and they delivered! A magnificent spread of all sorts of homemade food. Breads, jams, dips, creamy potato salads, &#34;meat&#34; boards, soup, so much more... I was surprised to see it was very heavy in replacement products; fake meat, fake mayo, fake egg, etc. I love that stuff, but I know many people who aren&#39;t. I think I went to the buffet 5 times. It was spectacular. <br><br>I also went back for a normal lunch with the omnivorous hubby, and he declared it &#34;was the best meal I&#39;ve had in a long time.&#34; He had the lunch special, which that day was fresh tomato soup, spaghetti, and wild green salad. I had the walnut and mushroom ravioli which were out of this world!!! The staff were a bit nicer, and respectfully spoke slower German to us rather than eye-rolling and reverting to English.<br><br>Positives:<br>FANTASTIC FOOD<br>The price is right<br>Great ambiance<br>Casual for lunch but nice enough for a date<br>The chef CARES!<br><br>Negative:<br>staff doesn&#39;t seem to care that much<br>The chocolate cake dessert is so disappointing, I didn&#39;t finish it (even with two peoples help)<br><br>Summary: Don&#39;t forget to RSVP! YUM!",

"reviewcomment":"Lovely restaurant/cafe open late into the night.  Always good for sitting and people watching.  There are several cafes with outdoor seating in this corner, but this one happened to have the least amount of smokers sitting outside during a big Kreuzberg wide music festival.  They were also open late into the night.  Seems like just about anywhere speaks English these days so if you&#39;re polite they&#39;ll likely be helpful and reply to your badly mangled german in English.  <br><br>Drinks are you standard fare here, but I ordered a large salad with grilled chicken and it was the bomb, lightly dressed in a mild vinaigrette, perfect for a late night dinner!",

"reviewcomment":"3.5/5<br><br>Rocco is the first in a long line of cafes with ample outdoor seating and live entertainment.<br><br>The staff were friendly and helpful and not at all overbearing. A typical menu offering brunch, snacks, appetizers, full-entrees, beer, wine &amp; alcohol. <br><br>The options are moderately priced but not dirt-cheap. I tried their currywurst (€8), which tasted fine but wasn&#39;t particularly memorable. Washed it down with a konig hefeweizen (€3). The menu also has pizza and pasta, a few German specialties, etc.<br><br>I split a tiramisu with my dining partner afterward, which was fine.<br><br>The inside of the restaurant is massive and well-decorated with a real &#34;pub&#34; feel. Bathrooms are located downstairs and are clean, with a number of stalls so you don&#39;t have to wait in line.<br><br>The best part of the restaurant is the outdoor seating, location, and atmosphere. Live musicians, street artists, and great people-watching add to the experience. It&#39;s a great location to pass a few hours resting after a long day of shopping nearby before heading in for the night.",

"reviewcomment":"Awesome service. Packed - make reservations. Pakistani food, NOT indian, as the only other english language reviewer, with no &#39;Friends&#39;, and one review, stipulates. It&#39;s not personal, or anything to do with her, though. It&#39;s this retarded, buggy &#39;Yelp&#39; system - eliminating many helpful reviews and yet leaving in a review from 2011, from a one-off reviewer.<br><br>{Edit: please also hunt for the mis-categorized  review from &#39;slowfood&#39;. &#39;It&#39;s too sweet/westernized&#39;, goes the review; worth reading. However, given the local community, this is expected. Menu items 108 through 113, are the hot and spicy items. And if you especially want hot and spicy, be sure to ask.}<br><br>Service was good, prompt; much more than can be expected for the city-area generally. This ethnic &#39;proud of my restaurant&#39; shines through. People spoiled on non-local service standards, may easily miss the extra, here, that good service provides.<br><br>The chai was respectable. The salzig lassi could have been saltier; otherwise excellent (salt to taste).<br><br>The fried vegetables were done correctly with a chickpea dough instead of wheat.<br><br>Murgh Salat was very sweet - not offensive - but sweeter than what i want for an evening meal. The mango pulp content made it incredibly sweet - i don&#39;t think any sugar was added. Says something for pakistani mangos, though. Mixed Pakora was good, however, again, the sauce was sweeter than i would have liked. A meat dish will be next.  ...<br><br>Music was not too loud. Bathrooms were private, heated and clean.<br><br>If you had a good experience at this restaurant, please let us know. If you want to thank me for this review, please mark below. Thanks :)",

"reviewcomment":"This is an amazing little restaurant! I grabbed takeaway from here my first night in Berlin and it was so amazing I decided to grab lunch here before I left. <br><br>It came out to less than 25 euros for 2 beers, the daily fish and spinach lasagna special, and a grilled salmon platter. The dishes were huge! Each platter comes with a small salad and the grilled salmon had a side of potatoes and garlic bread too. We sat inside but we noticed servers bringing dishes outside and to the right; not sure if there is a bigger dining room nearby? It&#39;s great watching your food get cooked and staring at the fresh seafood but the only caveat about sitting inside is you will leave smelling like grilled fish.<br><br>Another thing is that they accepted my credit card the first night but not the second time I went even though my bill was higher the second time around. Not sure if they only accept credit cards in the evenings or if it depends on your server?",

"reviewcomment":"W Der Imbiss is definitely not one of those places a TON of tourists are flocking too. It&#39;s one of those places you have to find deep in your guide book, but when  you do find it, you are more than impressed.  It&#39; was fantastic.  <br><br>My friends and I decided to head here after reading about it in Lonely Planet, and when we walked in, we were hit with the GREAT smells! It smelled like heaven.  There are a LOT of great Indian options from Naan Pizza to thali to dosa.  I tried the naan pizza with olive tapenade, parm cheese, and arugala - and it was HUGE. The serving sizes here are really big for the price (great bang for your buck).  I even took mine home and finished it the next day. <br><br>Definitely trek here if you can - but be warned, it&#39;s a tiny space!",

Adnan always greats everybody warm and friendly, no matter you are a VIP or no name guest. Kitchen is italian cuisine, always with a twist and really, really fresh. Fish, seafood and pasta are my favourites - no matter as a grilled, sauteed or raw dish! Try to also have a slice of the crispy and really thin homemade pizza together with your starter (share it with your, as it&#39;s too big in size). It&#39;s not a Michelin awarded restaurant, waiters are very &#34;casual&#34; - kind of cantine style restaurant. Don&#39;t try to get super correct and attentive service - that&#39;s not the way Adnan works!",

"reviewcomment":"Beer &#39;stock exchange&#39;, now that&#39;s something you have to experience! Prices of the beer go up or down depending on demand! Definitely a cool thing to check out if you are in the area! <br><br>The food was pretty good as well. We got the Italian pizza and the currywurst. Both tasted pretty amazing. We set outside right by the river and just enjoyed people watching and the boats go by. The waitress was really friendly but that place is a little understaffed! She definitely could use some help but definitely did her best to accommodate us. Also what I found interesting is she took our order on an iphone! I really thought she was texted when she was just standing near our table but she was just waiting for us to give her our order. Definitely an interesting place!",

"reviewcomment":"I love this place.<br><br> Like Koernerpark in Neukoelln, it&#39;s just such a complete surprise to find a true urban oasis smack in the middle of an otherwise not terribly compelling part of town. Also like Koernerpark, the pond/fountain is below street level, so traffic noise is minimal.<br><br> I sat here today, enjoyed a yummy toast and Bionade, while listening to the fountains and watching two turtles sunbathe on the small rocks at the edge of the Cafe&#39;s deck.<br><br> The menu is limited, but service was good (possibly less so if filled to capacitythere are quite a few tables, although only about 8 on the prime deck area in front of the cafe itself -- which is, interestingly, formed from several joined metal containers, such as you would find at a construction site).<br><br> Although not as lushly planted as some other urban nature spots, I highly recommend Engelbecken for a respite from sirens, S-bahn rumblings, and traffic noise.",

"reviewcomment":"Went to this Amrit @ Winderfeldtplatz in August...Didn&#39;t want to like it too much since it is a chain restaurant, but alas, they definitely won me over.  I LOVED the food...it was probably some of the best Indian food I have ever had (and trust me..I know my Indian food pretty well).<br><br>Sometimes you feel you need to go to a hole-in-the-wall place to get &#34;authentic&#34; ethnic food... some place off the beaten path, less pretentious looking,etc... but that is not the case with Amrit.  First of all it is a BEAUTIFUL restaurant.  Especially nice in the warmer months, when you sit outside...but regardless it&#39;s great.  Secondly, the prices are awesome, for such great quality food and generous portions.<br><br>Yummy lamb saag, curried chicken, rice, naan, bhathura, dipping sauces, cocktails, King Fisher beer (pilsner)... everything we ate/drank that evening rocked from start to finish.  I even had leftovers bagged up to take home... so that should indicate a) how good the food was and b)how nice the portions were.<br><br>SUGGESTIONS:  Why can&#39;t I get some good gulab jamun in Berlin, generally?  <br><br>VERDICT:  If you like Indian food and need a good fix, this is the place.  Great for families, singles, dates, taking visitors, etc.   I&#39;m definitely a fan and will definitely be heading back next time I crave some good Indian food in a nice restaurant....",

"reviewcomment":"I met a companion here for breakfast one weekend. He happens to be vegan, and from out of town, and was staying in Pankow. So my task was to find a place that is vegan-friendly, near the Pankow area, and open for breakfast at 9:00 AM, as we only had a two-hour window to meet, due to other imposing constraints. I found this one.<br><br>I found the shop very welcoming, and very clean. I arrived when they were still not open, and the staff was already hard at work arranging the fresh flowers they put on the tables, and so forth. When we entered, we found a table by the end of the room, and they gave us menus. English menus are also available, which my companion appreciated very much.<br><br>I ordered the spinach omelette, which came with a side salad, as well as a pair of English muffins that had some pesto spread on it. They were all vegetarian, and very tasty. I also ordered a Milchkaffee, which was very well-made.<br><br>I am not a vegetarian anymore, but at least I know there are good options like these in the city. I&#39;d go back here again if I am with someone who doesn&#39;t eat meat and needs a little bit of variety.",

"reviewcomment":"Awesome service. Packed - make reservations. Pakistani food, NOT indian, as the only other english language reviewer, with no &#39;Friends&#39;, and one review, stipulates. It&#39;s not personal, or anything to do with her, though. It&#39;s this retarded, buggy &#39;Yelp&#39; system - eliminating many helpful reviews and yet leaving in a review from 2011, from a one-off reviewer.<br><br>{Edit: please also hunt for the mis-categorized  review from &#39;slowfood&#39;. &#39;It&#39;s too sweet/westernized&#39;, goes the review; worth reading. However, given the local community, this is expected. Menu items 108 through 113, are the hot and spicy items. And if you especially want hot and spicy, be sure to ask.}<br><br>Service was good, prompt; much more than can be expected for the city-area generally. This ethnic &#39;proud of my restaurant&#39; shines through. People spoiled on non-local service standards, may easily miss the extra, here, that good service provides.<br><br>The chai was respectable. The salzig lassi could have been saltier; otherwise excellent (salt to taste).<br><br>The fried vegetables were done correctly with a chickpea dough instead of wheat.<br><br>Murgh Salat was very sweet - not offensive - but sweeter than what i want for an evening meal. The mango pulp content made it incredibly sweet - i don&#39;t think any sugar was added. Says something for pakistani mangos, though. Mixed Pakora was good, however, again, the sauce was sweeter than i would have liked. A meat dish will be next.  ...<br><br>Music was not too loud. Bathrooms were private, heated and clean.<br><br>If you had a good experience at this restaurant, please let us know. If you want to thank me for this review, please mark below. Thanks :)",

"reviewcomment":"Stopped by for a late lunch after reading about this place on Yelp. I was jet-lagged and Sissi was close to my hotel. It&#39;s small and very cute - flamboyant interior with pink wall paper and a very queer decor. The waiter was very nice, and spoke English. The menu was bilingual. I had the roast beef, which is nothing like US roast beef - it was a delicious filet! It came with frites and a beautiful salad that was a delight. I had a beer with it. They have a nice patio, and the restaurant as a whole can probably fit about 20 people. <br><br>A cute, off the beaten path treat!",

"reviewcomment":"When I came in I was really disappointed--hot, crowded, smelled a little bit like the fish tank. And then I was seated at a tiny table with strangers. Polite strangers, but strangers. Then the food came. It was AMAZING. Hands down the best Vietnamese food I&#39;ve had in Berlin, maybe the best food I&#39;ve had in Berlin. Fresh basil and lemon grass, just the right amount of sauce, chicken breast recognizable as chicken breast. I forgot where I was until the last drop was gone. I don&#39;t know when I&#39;ll go back--people were literally lined up to wait for a seat at one of the small tables--but I was there between twelve and one. Maybe it&#39;s less crowded later in the day? If it weren&#39;t for the crowds, I would go back again in a second.",

Einziger Wehmutstropfen: zieht mittlerweile für meinen Geschmack zuviele Touristen an.

Kein Szene-Lokal, und eben auch kein Gourmet-Tempel, sondern einfach nur gutes Essen in entspannter Atmosphäre. <br><br>Vorsicht: das Essen ist sehr scharf, und man sollte reservieren.",

It could serve authentic enough food, but it doesn&#39;t. The food wasn&#39;t bad, mind you, it just ended up being your generic germanized thai imbiss. We ordered two different curries and couldn&#39;t tell them really apart, besides than one had mushrooms. I still give it 4 stars, because I still enjoyed it and the service was friendly, though I secretly know that as soon as this place shop for the night, these people make the best possible thai food and eat it all themselves. Why not serve it to the public? Surely, germans are ready for it?!",

"reviewcomment":"Awesome service. Packed - make reservations. Pakistani food, NOT indian, as the only other english language reviewer, with no &#39;Friends&#39;, and one review, stipulates. It&#39;s not personal, or anything to do with her, though. It&#39;s this retarded, buggy &#39;Yelp&#39; system - eliminating many helpful reviews and yet leaving in a review from 2011, from a one-off reviewer.<br><br>{Edit: please also hunt for the mis-categorized  review from &#39;slowfood&#39;. &#39;It&#39;s too sweet/westernized&#39;, goes the review; worth reading. However, given the local community, this is expected. Menu items 108 through 113, are the hot and spicy items. And if you especially want hot and spicy, be sure to ask.}<br><br>Service was good, prompt; much more than can be expected for the city-area generally. This ethnic &#39;proud of my restaurant&#39; shines through. People spoiled on non-local service standards, may easily miss the extra, here, that good service provides.<br><br>The chai was respectable. The salzig lassi could have been saltier; otherwise excellent (salt to taste).<br><br>The fried vegetables were done correctly with a chickpea dough instead of wheat.<br><br>Murgh Salat was very sweet - not offensive - but sweeter than what i want for an evening meal. The mango pulp content made it incredibly sweet - i don&#39;t think any sugar was added. Says something for pakistani mangos, though. Mixed Pakora was good, however, again, the sauce was sweeter than i would have liked. A meat dish will be next.  ...<br><br>Music was not too loud. Bathrooms were private, heated and clean.<br><br>If you had a good experience at this restaurant, please let us know. If you want to thank me for this review, please mark below. Thanks :)",

You want to make a break in your noisy night activities in Berlin... this is the perfect place.<br>you will share the daily life of sight dissabled person and be served by them in complete darkness! So if you have lost hearing yesterday evening in a club, here you will lose your sight too! :-)<br>It&#39;s very interesting to realize how we are lost and how difficult it is to do simple things without light!<br>TIP: take the &#34;discovery menu&#34; where you don&#39;t know what will be served.

"reviewcomment":"One of the best places to have a decent breakfast. The selection of newspapers in great (though German) and the variety of food is big- from croissants to special lunches served already at 11:30. <br>I especially like the breakfast which comes with cheese, ham, boloney and other meats. With some vegetables one can build a sandwich to fit their taste exactly. The fresh orange juice is very good and not expensive.<br>The employees are always nice and welcoming, and they also speak good English. <br>The location is especially nice on the weekend when there are no school boys and sitting outside on the sun is very relaxing. <br>They also have wi-fi, but you have to ask the waitress for the password. Very easy location and I would recommend reserving the big table on the window if you come with a big crowd for brunch over the weekend.",

"reviewcomment":"After landing in TXL and getting lost in the subway system, we rolled in here at 8pm on a Tuesday for our first Berlin meal. To cut to the chase, we were very satisfied. <br><br>The customers at the time almost filled one of the rooms although it seems like the restaurant is much much bigger than the one room we were in. The waiter was friendly and understanding of our lack of German ability and provided us with the English menu. We got the weiner schnitzel because we saw everyone else getting it, and another dish that involved a fried pork cutlet covered in gravy. <br><br>The rumors are true: the weiner schnitzel was enormous, and the other dish was pretty substantial. After awhile, the dishes became too heavy and repetitive, so I would suggest you share or order for the table. <br><br>A lovely first evening in Berlin, and I almost wanted to return for my last. Nothing too special, but solid nonetheless.",

Although they have an extensive menu and two restaurants on the same freaking street, I choose to the go the smaller one closer to Simon-Dach. It&#39;s less crowded.<br><br> My husband and I have our preferences for thai food, so the stuff we don&#39;t get too often, stuff we don&#39;t cook, or stuff my parents didn&#39;t make are the stuff we order and eat. with that being said, I&#39;m very much into noodles and noodle soups. He gets the stir-fried types, pad woon sen . . I get wonton soups or noodle soups. Thai people are my favorite people for noodles. I know Pho food is noodle heavy, but it&#39;s often bland and requires you reaching for table condiments.<br><br> The wonton soup has another name which I don&#39;t know. But it was fresh and delicious and surprisingly filling. Wash it down with Lychee or Mango lassi / shake (Nahm Puhn) and you&#39;ve got yourself a typical meal for me. The papaya salad is also delicious, which of course is always an indicator of great thai food.<br><br> The neighborhood is great, so that&#39;s one more reason to draw you there.

"reviewcomment":"Awesome service. Packed - make reservations. Pakistani food, NOT indian, as the only other english language reviewer, with no &#39;Friends&#39;, and one review, stipulates. It&#39;s not personal, or anything to do with her, though. It&#39;s this retarded, buggy &#39;Yelp&#39; system - eliminating many helpful reviews and yet leaving in a review from 2011, from a one-off reviewer.<br><br>{Edit: please also hunt for the mis-categorized  review from &#39;slowfood&#39;. &#39;It&#39;s too sweet/westernized&#39;, goes the review; worth reading. However, given the local community, this is expected. Menu items 108 through 113, are the hot and spicy items. And if you especially want hot and spicy, be sure to ask.}<br><br>Service was good, prompt; much more than can be expected for the city-area generally. This ethnic &#39;proud of my restaurant&#39; shines through. People spoiled on non-local service standards, may easily miss the extra, here, that good service provides.<br><br>The chai was respectable. The salzig lassi could have been saltier; otherwise excellent (salt to taste).<br><br>The fried vegetables were done correctly with a chickpea dough instead of wheat.<br><br>Murgh Salat was very sweet - not offensive - but sweeter than what i want for an evening meal. The mango pulp content made it incredibly sweet - i don&#39;t think any sugar was added. Says something for pakistani mangos, though. Mixed Pakora was good, however, again, the sauce was sweeter than i would have liked. A meat dish will be next.  ...<br><br>Music was not too loud. Bathrooms were private, heated and clean.<br><br>If you had a good experience at this restaurant, please let us know. If you want to thank me for this review, please mark below. Thanks :)",

"reviewcomment":"Delicious melt-in-your mouth Falafels and schwarma. Please do not miss your chance to try these delicious dishes. We ordered the Falafelteller and Schwarma im Brot (akin to a kebab/durum). The Falafelteller was so beautiful to look at; it came with a variety of sauces (one which I suspect was humus, yogurty sauce and a spicy sauce (my favourite)), tabouleh, chilli pepper, salad and boom-chicka-wow-wow crispy tasty Falafels. There was also a side serving of flat bread. Biting into one of the Falafels was heaven. Seriously, you have to try to it understand what I mean. The sauces were perfectly balanced. The schwarma was just as good. The meat was beautiful and tender and they added a little bit of fried potato so it felt like I was eating it with potato chips. Also, try the pfefferminze Tee. It comes with fresh mint leaves and this interesting looking thing  that I think may be a preserved lemon?? The tee was actually a bit sweet (i think the preserved lemon caused that) for me since I prefer pure pfefferminz. THE BEST PART IS THE PRICE- 3€ for the Schwarma im Brot and 5€ for the Falafelteller! Before I forget the place is quite small so you may struggle to get a seat. However, people are pretty courteous in that they don&#39;t take too long to finish their meals so others can have a spot.",

"reviewcomment":"I was super excited to come for multiple reasons. Firstly, I was stoked to finally have made it to a Yelp event, secondly I love exploring new restaurants, and thirdly I love Scandinavian food.<br><br>Munch&#39;s Hus is in an area I normally don&#39;t frequent that much, but it is super close to a U-Bahn stop, so getting here is really easy. The atmosphere of the restaurant is very cosy with Norwegian music playing in the background. The menu ranging is not big, but all the dishes sound delicious and the ones we had, all were able to keep up with our expectations. It took me some time to be able to decide, but with a beer in one hand and Elkblood (mixed drink from berries and vodka - oh god), I was finally able to make my decision. I went with the Kjottkaker, Norwegian meatballs (I am sure many of you know the Swedish/Ikea version of that Köttbullar). I received 3 massive hand-made meatballs, potatoes and cabbage. Everything was delicious and filled me up to the max. <br><br>The service at Munch&#39;s Hus was also great. Very attentive waiters, who were up to explaining everything, if we had any questions. The prices are also ok, considering the quality and service.<br><br>All in all, a great discovery and I will definitely be coming back at some point.",

"reviewcomment":"Dinner here was surreal - it was a while ago but I distinctly remember arriving here after wandering through the dark and cold. It was like 9pm or something well past dinner, but November was aglow with orange light. There was no one inside but a waiter with a mysterious smile. He welcomed us in to a candle lit table. <br><br>My family and I ordered and shared quite a few dishes: some soups, schnitzel with chanterelles, whole grilled fish, a mushroom pasta, and a couple of desserts. The schnitzel was the best we had after several weeks in Germany, and the dish was pilled ridiculously high with delicious chanterelles. Everything about the plate exuded generosity and tastiness. <br><br>Mainly though, the reason I&#39;m back writing about this place now is because of the service. The guy probably kept the place open well past normal closing time for us, and was incredibly nice about everything.<br>At one point I commented that I really like the German beer mugs on this trip. At the end of the meal as we were standing up, he comes up to me with a new one from the bar and tells me to keep it as a little piece of Berlin. It&#39;s probably been almost two years now, but I still have the mug. Beer always seems to taste so much better in it",

"reviewcomment":"I&#39;ve eaten here a couple of times. Around 6-7 i would say. <br>I love their food, it&#39;s simple and delicious.<br><br>Their smoothies are a little boring, but i like their menucard detail where they tell you which smoothie is good for what, nice detail. <br><br>Their sushi is great! It&#39;s not the most creative or surprising sushi, but it&#39;s very good and satisfying. I could always eat their avocado-sushi, yum! And they have a little fun feature where you can select Kappa-rolls with either yellow, blue, pink, spotted or green, nori-wrapping, so cute.  <br><br>Last time i was there I got the Vegan duck in red curry. It was awesome! It could have used some more vegetables though, but other than that- Perfect. Very mild, with a nice red curry flavor, and the mockduck is so crispy and delicious! And with a smallish portion of rice, so you don&#39;t feel like they cheap out and make it 70% rice/30% other. The only thing it needed was more veggies. <br>The menu says that it&#39;s &#34;strong/Spicy&#34; which i wouldn&#39;t say, so be sure to tell them you want it extra &#34;scharf&#34; if that&#39;s what you&#39;re into :) <br><br>I&#39;ve gotta admit that i was close to bumping Papa nô down to a 3 because the service is bad, but the food is so nice. <br>The staff comes off lazy and uninterested in giving a good service. They are VERY impatient, and never smile. And they just call you when your food is ready even though it&#39;s a large restaurant with a pretty &#34;fancy&#34; look. <br>The person accompanying me on one of my visits does not speak or read german, and therefore made the mistake of looking in the &#34;only for take-out orders&#34;-fridge for a beer that he could buy. When the staff saw this all 3 started yelling at us in German, making it impossible for me to translate for him what he should do instead, pretty buttholish of them. <br><br>All in all<br>2 for the service<br>but 4 for the food :)",

It&#39;s not personal, or anything to do with her, though. It&#39;s this retarded, buggy &#39;Yelp&#39; system - eliminating many helpful reviews and yet leaving in a review from 2011, from a one-off reviewer.<br><br>{Edit: please also hunt for the mis-categorized  review from &#39;slowfood&#39;. &#39;It&#39;s too sweet/westernized&#39;, goes the review; worth reading. However, given the local community, this is expected. Menu items 108 through 113, are the hot and spicy items. And if you especially want hot and spicy, be sure to ask.}<br><br>Service was good, prompt; much more than can be expected for the city-area generally. This ethnic &#39;proud of my restaurant&#39; shines through. People spoiled on non-local service standards, may easily miss the extra, here, that good service provides.<br><br>The chai was respectable. The salzig lassi could have been saltier; otherwise excellent (salt to taste).<br><br>The fried vegetables were done correctly with a chickpea dough instead of wheat.<br><br>Murgh Salat was very sweet - not offensive - but sweeter than what i want for an evening meal. The mango pulp content made it incredibly sweet - i don&#39;t think any sugar was added. Says something for pakistani mangos, though. Mixed Pakora was good, however, again, the sauce was sweeter than i would have liked. A meat dish will be next.  ...<br><br>Music was not too loud. Bathrooms were private, heated and clean.<br><br>If you had a good experience at this restaurant, please let us know. If you want to thank me for this review, please mark below. Thanks :)",

"reviewcomment":"The first English review of Wirtshaus Hasenheide, I&#39;m honoured! And also feeling shameful that I don&#39;t speak German :( So I thought I&#39;d offer a tourist&#39;s view of this traditional German eatery. We had a supreme restaurant guide in the form of Svenja of course, who talked us through the menu with total efficiency and recommended what she thought would give us a well-rounded impression of German food. We were a table of one pescetarian, one meat-eater who hates mushrooms and one lady who was happy to have a little of everything, so we opted for three dishes to share.<br><br>Simple solution really, Svenja and I could partake the non-meat creamy cheesy pasta with crisped onions and mushroomy cheesy rosti option, she and my SO could share his meat dish as well as the pasta (he&#39;s the mushroom-hater, by the way) and that way everyone could have a bit of what they liked. Firstly we ordered drinks which were beers and wine, lovely enough and reasonably priced too, and when it came to ordering food we did get to that point where you feel horrendous for waving a member of staff over... but the wait was getting a little OTT and we were all very hungry little souls by this point.<br><br>Anyway, when the food came it did not disappoint. The mushrooms on the rosti had been cooked brilliantly, in that they offered none of that sliminess which indicates they&#39;ve been sweating in their own juices too long... rather they were tender, had bite to them and really retained the flavour of the dish. Yep, garlic to the max. Piles of melted cheese of course, as is requisite for the foodstyle, and oh, that melt in the mouth grated potato underneath! Heaven. The thick spaghetti noodles with the creamy cheese sauce were divine, and I did sneak a potato from the SO&#39;s plate but even they were full of bacon - that was one meaty dish! They even sliced the sausages in a really unusual style whereby they opened like flowers, or squids, much to his horror and my amusement.<br><br>The place is atmospheric and full of wood; you kind of feel like you&#39;re in a lodge. Overall it was an awesome start to our trip, the food was spot on and while the slow service did let it down somewhat it came with a friendly smile, so there&#39;s little to complain about really. A surprise winner, and I do want that rosti again... like right now, please.",

"reviewcomment":"We were staying at the nearby Radisson Blu hotel, and my girlfriend and I found this restaurant by Yelping a place within walking distance that serves traditional German/Berlin food. Two of the things I wanted to try in Berlin were a Berliner Weisse and Currywurst, and I was able to get both at Deponie Nr. 3.<br><br>The restaurant itself is attractively decorated. It sits under an S-Bahn line, so you&#39;ll hear the train zoom by every now and then. One part of the restaurant has tables and is quieter; the other part has benches and can get loud.<br><br>Berliner Weisse is a low-alcohol wheat beer, to which a flavoring is added. I ordered in German and was then asked &#34;rot oder grün?&#34; mean &#34;red or green?&#34; which confused me. It turns out that &#34;red&#34; is a raspberry syrup and &#34;green&#34; is a woodruff syrup. I got the red, which was very tasty, although it seemed funny to sip beer through a straw.<br><br>I wasn&#39;t sure I&#39;d like the Currywurst, but it was really good. Unlike later Currywurst I&#39;d eat, here at Deponie Nr. 3 I got one large, whole sausage, not small sausages cut into pieces. The curry-flavored ketchup is wonderful. Sweet at first, and then a few seconds later the curry flavor develops. It&#39;s flavorful but not too spicy, and goes extremely well with the accompanying fries.<br><br>My girlfriend got the Pilzpfanne or mushroom pan, which includes pork medallions, mushroom gravy with bacon, and roasted potatoes. This was very good, and had I not wanted the Currywurst might have been on my short list of options.<br><br>For dessert we got coffee and split an order of excellent Apfelstrudel with vanilla ice cream.<br><br>A very nice restaurant, and I&#39;d gladly eat there again if I had the chance.",

We ate soooo much that we were the whole next day still full. We tried the tasting platter and ordered the beef tartare on the side. I have been to a couple of Ethiopian restaurants, but the beef tartare at this restaurant was by far the best I have ever had. Prices are very good and portions more than generous. I will certainly go back there, a great find!",

"reviewcomment":"Awesome service. Packed - make reservations. Pakistani food, NOT indian, as the only other english language reviewer, with no &#39;Friends&#39;, and one review, stipulates. It&#39;s not personal, or anything to do with her, though. It&#39;s this retarded, buggy &#39;Yelp&#39; system - eliminating many helpful reviews and yet leaving in a review from 2011, from a one-off reviewer.<br><br>{Edit: please also hunt for the mis-categorized  review from &#39;slowfood&#39;. &#39;It&#39;s too sweet/westernized&#39;, goes the review; worth reading. However, given the local community, this is expected. Menu items 108 through 113, are the hot and spicy items. And if you especially want hot and spicy, be sure to ask.}<br><br>Service was good, prompt; much more than can be expected for the city-area generally. This ethnic &#39;proud of my restaurant&#39; shines through. People spoiled on non-local service standards, may easily miss the extra, here, that good service provides.<br><br>The chai was respectable. The salzig lassi could have been saltier; otherwise excellent (salt to taste).<br><br>The fried vegetables were done correctly with a chickpea dough instead of wheat.<br><br>Murgh Salat was very sweet - not offensive - but sweeter than what i want for an evening meal. The mango pulp content made it incredibly sweet - i don&#39;t think any sugar was added. Says something for pakistani mangos, though. Mixed Pakora was good, however, again, the sauce was sweeter than i would have liked. A meat dish will be next.  ...<br><br>Music was not too loud. Bathrooms were private, heated and clean.<br><br>If you had a good experience at this restaurant, please let us know. If you want to thank me for this review, please mark below. Thanks :)",

"reviewcomment":"Disappointing. I&#39;m beginning to doubt the ratings that I see on Qype. How can this place receive 4 out of 5 stars??? First, I was not pleased that the cashier upselled me from a simple 4 Euro Dürüm, to an Adana plate for 8 Euros. When they served the dish and I told them I wanted a Dürüm, the server simply waived off the comment stating that Adana is better. The Adana was generic, no spices to distinguish itself from any other Kebab from different Mediterranean countries. But it was worsened by 3 sauces: a sweet crossbreed of Mexican salsa/ketchup, Thousand Island, and ranch dressing. I realize that Döner began in Germany, but this sort of fast food fusion is not hitting the right note. The rice was plain and lifeless, the salad not super fresh. The faux decor of this restaurant imagines itself to be greater than what it really is: a cheap fast food stand, serving mediocre food for restaurant prices.",

"reviewcomment":"I was here the other day, having lunch with a friend I haven&#39;t seen since 1995. We were surprised that we both ended up living in Berlin, so we decided to meet up one day and have lunch together. We both work near Mitte, so after agreeing to meet near Checkpoint Charlie, we strolled around and found this Japanese restaurant. <br><br>As it was lunch, they had lunch set menus, so we both opted for the Menu A, which included 8 nigiri sushi, 6 pieces of maki sushi, a couple of other pieces, and miso soup. I paired mine with green tea, as usual. My meal cost about 15 EUR, which, as far as I can tell, is on the higher side, but I think with this one, I am willing to pay for that. Here&#39;s why.<br><br>First, I loved the soup. Miso soup sounds so easy to make, but if you mess up the ingredients, then it&#39;ll fail. They know what they&#39;re doing. The subtle taste of the soup was great. Second, the fish was on the fresh side. No, it&#39;s not glistening fresh, but it will do. I also liked the way they flavored the eel, with just the right amount of sweetness. <br><br>Overall, this is a good sushi place, at least, better than the others I have encountered. I am fine giving them 4 stars, which means that I am comfortable bringing people to lunch here. Probably not for dinner, but it will do for a lunch meeting or something similar.",

The atmosphere is very pleasant and thankfully it&#39;s not so dirty here :D Also they have a two hour free wifi session for the customers, which works super great-you don&#39;t even need a password. Anyone loves coffee and a quick snack- come here, it&#39;s wonderful.",

I&#39;ve been there twice in the last couple months but can&#39;t remember what I ate. The wine list was good but the service was lacking on both visits. In nice weather you can sit on the bank of the Spree and watch the tourist boats go by. I guess I&#39;d recommend the place more for the atmosphere and as a nice place to have a drink.",

"reviewcomment":"After wandering all about Viktoria Park this afternoon, a nosh and a drink were in order. I started to hit up the historic bungalow place, but wasn&#39;t feeling it - as I wandered up Kreuzberger Strasse I noticed STAROPRAMEN DARK on the awning...<br><br>Say WHAT? Czech Cerny pivo on TAP? No way.<br><br>Yes way.<br><br>So, after confirming the menu looked good and that Staropramen Cerny was -actually- available... I settled in and ordered a schnitzel. With the schnitzel came a salad that was - well, really terrible. I&#39;ll just pretend that wasn&#39;t actually delivered to my table.<br><br>Also included was a pile of fries, and those were fine - but here&#39;s the deal: All that was 3,75 euros. Adding the beer and a single scoop if ice cream brought my total to 6,75. For a full meal. Again, pretending that sad little salad never appeared. (honestly - epic piles of mayo does not make for a good &#39;dressing&#39;)<br><br>The waitress was friendly, prompt and quite helpful. I enjoyed tipping her.<br><br>The two guys sitting next to me ordered the Angus Burger - which looked AWESOME. Kinda grumpy I didn&#39;t get one of those myself... ok, not really. Next time for sure. Also: A table tent advertises a plate of wild North Sea mussels for 8,90. Thats gonna be a return trip item for sure.",

"reviewcomment":"When my girlfriend and I were planning our trip to Germany, one of the things we decided to do in Berlin is ascend the iconic Berlin Television Tower. It&#39;s the tallest structure in Germany and the fourth-tallest in all of Europe.<br><br>Regular tickets are €12.50, but we got the VIP tickets for €19.50 instead, which turned out to be worth the extra cost. You ascend and descend the tower by way of relatively small elevators, and if the line is long, you&#39;ll have to wait many times for the elevator to come and go before it&#39;s your turn. The VIP tickets not only let us go to the front of the line and get on the next available elevator, they also got us a guaranteed window seat at the restaurant above the observation level.<br><br>The restaurant is 679 feet above the ground, and the view is indeed spectacular. The restaurant used to revolve once every hour, but the speed was doubled after renovation more than a decade ago. It was a lot of fun looking for and snapping pictures of our hotel, the museums on Museum Island, the Brandenburg Gate, and the Reichstag.<br><br>My girlfriend had the baked potato with roast beef and coffee in the restaurant, and I was still full from breakfast and lunch at Curry 36, so I only had cheesecake and coffee. I love cheesecake, but prefer the baked German- or New York-style version of the sweeter, moister American version on a graham-cracker crust. The cheesecake here was just perfect, as was the coffee. Unfortunately, this being Germany, there were no free refills on the coffee.",

"reviewcomment":"Awesome service. Packed - make reservations. Pakistani food, NOT indian, as the only other english language reviewer, with no &#39;Friends&#39;, and one review, stipulates. It&#39;s not personal, or anything to do with her, though. It&#39;s this retarded, buggy &#39;Yelp&#39; system - eliminating many helpful reviews and yet leaving in a review from 2011, from a one-off reviewer.<br><br>{Edit: please also hunt for the mis-categorized  review from &#39;slowfood&#39;. &#39;It&#39;s too sweet/westernized&#39;, goes the review; worth reading. However, given the local community, this is expected. Menu items 108 through 113, are the hot and spicy items. And if you especially want hot and spicy, be sure to ask.}<br><br>Service was good, prompt; much more than can be expected for the city-area generally. This ethnic &#39;proud of my restaurant&#39; shines through. People spoiled on non-local service standards, may easily miss the extra, here, that good service provides.<br><br>The chai was respectable. The salzig lassi could have been saltier; otherwise excellent (salt to taste).<br><br>The fried vegetables were done correctly with a chickpea dough instead of wheat.<br><br>Murgh Salat was very sweet - not offensive - but sweeter than what i want for an evening meal. The mango pulp content made it incredibly sweet - i don&#39;t think any sugar was added. Says something for pakistani mangos, though. Mixed Pakora was good, however, again, the sauce was sweeter than i would have liked. A meat dish will be next.  ...<br><br>Music was not too loud. Bathrooms were private, heated and clean.<br><br>If you had a good experience at this restaurant, please let us know. If you want to thank me for this review, please mark below. Thanks :)",

The waitress was really friendly and came by the table a few times to make sure that everything was OK. <br>The daughter had a small portion of the schnitzel, but being an Austrian restaurant, there isn&#39;t such a thing as a small portion. It was accompanied by delicious potato salad and a cucumber salad. Wife had gulasch with semmelknödel, again a &#34;small&#34; portion, which was more than she could eat. The restaurant has a blackboard with specials that is worth checking. I had the sauer braten with kartoffelknödel. It was scrummy, as was all our dished.

"reviewcomment":"My companion brought me here last night for dinner. We made a reservation early in the day, which was actually useful because when we got there at 20:00, it was rather crowded. Hence, we were able to sit down in a large cubicle without waiting at all.<br><br>I selected items from the Winter Limited menu. I got a potato and goose stew, followed by a Rapunzel Salad (salad greens with apples, tomatoes, and fried goose liver). That was good. My companion on the other hand got a big pot of mussels in tomato and garlic sauce. <br><br>This place is relatively cheap, compared with other establishments that serve the same quality food. Main courses hover between 8 to 12 EUR, and the food is more pub food rather than swanky white linen. They also have some specialty beers on tap. <br><br>The missing star is due to the service. It&#39;s a little slow and unenthusiastic, as with many places here in Europe. If you need something, you have to grab the person&#39;s attention, as they won&#39;t do a good job monitoring every table making sure that the diners are satisfied with their dining needs. So if you need more napkins, or you want your plate of mussel shells emptied because it is not big enough, then you have to explicitly ask for that.",

"reviewcomment":"I can only confirm the many positive advices alredy posted here. The food is great but, watch out, this is by all means not the cheap chinese you might be used to. Prices are most reasonable for the quality you get (moreover considering that the location is in a posh area of town) but definitely not cheap. <br>Just considering the dishes in the menu is indeed a pleasure and the only problem you will have is choosing one they all look great in the pictures! I discovered the restaurant thanks to a friend of mine who has been several times here already. He told me: No matter what you choose, you are going to love it. He was right!<br>Ich kann nur die zahlreiche positive Bewertungen bestätigen. Man ißt <br>hier lecker; es ist einfach nicht das billige Chineser um die Ecke und <br>die Preise sind nicht übertrieben aber trotzdem dementsprechend höher <br>(bleiben dafür angemessen), wie man auch angesichts der Lage erwarten kann.<br> Die Karte ist ein Vergnügen und man hat nur die Qual der Wahl, denn das<br> Angebot ist vielfältig und die auf der Karte abgebildete Gerichte total<br> einladend. Ich habe das Restaurant dank eines Stammgastes entdeckt. Er <br>hatte mir versprochen Egal was du bestellst, es wird schmecken. Ich <br>kann ihm nur Recht geben.",

"reviewcomment":"I&#39;ve got to say that cafe cinema is a place we come back to time and time again when visiting Berlin. Very relaxed, fairly central in the Mitte/Alexaderplatz district and offering a very chilled table service experience - Cafe Cinema is somewhere to go if you&#39;re after a fairly lo-key night out. <br><br>Wine and Weiss bier is all served for less that €4 a pop but if the truth be known, I haven&#39;t explored the menu any more than this at this stage. <br><br>One thing to be aware is that it gets very busy in here and with most places in Berlin - they&#39;re not too keen on a load of Brits turning up to settle in for the night, however there is more seating towards the back area near the toilets. <br><br>If you do end up here and it&#39;s really busy, the next alley way has a nice little tucked away bar that is pretty big and means you can enjoy a drink here before returning to Cafe Cinema! <br><br>I&#39;d highly recommend this place, make sure you check out out if you&#39;re in Berlin.",

As one of them wanted some good Indian food, I asked for recommendations from the interwebs, and Kifah told me that this is one of the better Indian restaurants here in Berlin.<br><br>They open from noon, which was the time we were there. We ordered two different appetizers (and they were more than happy to accommodate us in asking for an extra samosa, as we were three), as well as three different main dishes. Unfortunately, they didn&#39;t have naan, simply because they just opened for the day, and that meant that their stone oven for making naan isn&#39;t ready yet. Understandable. <br><br>The main dishes were quite lovely. And what I liked the most, is that they never toned down their flavors to accommodate the cowardly German palate. Spicy things are indeed spicy. So that lamb curry was definitely potent!<br><br>I would definitely come back here again, perhaps even for dinner, when they have naan. I gladly give this place 5 stars, and I promise to be back.",

"reviewcomment":"Awesome service. Packed - make reservations. Pakistani food, NOT indian, as the only other english language reviewer, with no &#39;Friends&#39;, and one review, stipulates. It&#39;s not personal, or anything to do with her, though. It&#39;s this retarded, buggy &#39;Yelp&#39; system - eliminating many helpful reviews and yet leaving in a review from 2011, from a one-off reviewer.<br><br>{Edit: please also hunt for the mis-categorized  review from &#39;slowfood&#39;. &#39;It&#39;s too sweet/westernized&#39;, goes the review; worth reading. However, given the local community, this is expected. Menu items 108 through 113, are the hot and spicy items. And if you especially want hot and spicy, be sure to ask.}<br><br>Service was good, prompt; much more than can be expected for the city-area generally. This ethnic &#39;proud of my restaurant&#39; shines through. People spoiled on non-local service standards, may easily miss the extra, here, that good service provides.<br><br>The chai was respectable. The salzig lassi could have been saltier; otherwise excellent (salt to taste).<br><br>The fried vegetables were done correctly with a chickpea dough instead of wheat.<br><br>Murgh Salat was very sweet - not offensive - but sweeter than what i want for an evening meal. The mango pulp content made it incredibly sweet - i don&#39;t think any sugar was added. Says something for pakistani mangos, though. Mixed Pakora was good, however, again, the sauce was sweeter than i would have liked. A meat dish will be next.  ...<br><br>Music was not too loud. Bathrooms were private, heated and clean.<br><br>If you had a good experience at this restaurant, please let us know. If you want to thank me for this review, please mark below. Thanks :)",

Absolutely authentic, from the variety of tsukemono to the fluffy and perfectly seasoned agedashi nasu and tofu, it was delicious, filling, and left me with a warm fuzzy feeling.<br><br>The ambiance is excellent, all the hashi hanging from the ceiling is a fun touch. I was very impressed by the extensive izakaya menu!<br><br>I found the service to be speedy and attentive.",

Meatballs, meat salad, etc which all looked as though it had been standing there for some time.<br><br> The servers were rude, and we were somehow unable to order breakfast off the menu, although we could&#39;ve ordered main meals such as steak or pasta. This makes no sense.<br><br> Perhaps this place would be better suited to an evening meal (again, there is a serious lack of vegetarian options), but I would not go again during the day.

"reviewcomment":"Awesome service. Packed - make reservations. Pakistani food, NOT indian, as the only other english language reviewer, with no &#39;Friends&#39;, and one review, stipulates. It&#39;s not personal, or anything to do with her, though. It&#39;s this retarded, buggy &#39;Yelp&#39; system - eliminating many helpful reviews and yet leaving in a review from 2011, from a one-off reviewer.<br><br>{Edit: please also hunt for the mis-categorized  review from &#39;slowfood&#39;. &#39;It&#39;s too sweet/westernized&#39;, goes the review; worth reading. However, given the local community, this is expected. Menu items 108 through 113, are the hot and spicy items. And if you especially want hot and spicy, be sure to ask.}<br><br>Service was good, prompt; much more than can be expected for the city-area generally. This ethnic &#39;proud of my restaurant&#39; shines through. People spoiled on non-local service standards, may easily miss the extra, here, that good service provides.<br><br>The chai was respectable. The salzig lassi could have been saltier; otherwise excellent (salt to taste).<br><br>The fried vegetables were done correctly with a chickpea dough instead of wheat.<br><br>Murgh Salat was very sweet - not offensive - but sweeter than what i want for an evening meal. The mango pulp content made it incredibly sweet - i don&#39;t think any sugar was added. Says something for pakistani mangos, though. Mixed Pakora was good, however, again, the sauce was sweeter than i would have liked. A meat dish will be next.  ...<br><br>Music was not too loud. Bathrooms were private, heated and clean.<br><br>If you had a good experience at this restaurant, please let us know. If you want to thank me for this review, please mark below. Thanks :)",

"reviewcomment":"Berlin is one of my favourite  European cities without a doubt. It has countless cool things to see, places to eat and trendy areas to hang out in. <br>Some of the more up and coming areas are in the East side of Berlin and that is where you find this cool little restaurant/bar. We had been going for a saunter up Karl Marx Alley  and at one point turned off it and after a few more turns ended up here.<br><br>We had the breakfast platter to share. It was HUGE and really reasonably priced. There was an abundance of cold meats, cheeses , breads, eggs and fruit. To go along side that I had a great vanilla milk shake. Due to over indulgence on the alcohol front the night before, I was feeling a bit sensitive and this sorted me right out. <br>The decor inside the place is nice and the location is great . Only slight moan was the service was quite slow, but there was lots of plus points that meant I could generally overlook this.",

"reviewcomment":"OK, I confess, Herr Lehmann is one of my favorite films.  And that is probably why I made sure to come to Markthalle on my first trip to Berlin.  However, this is my fourth trip to Berlin, and I&#39;ve been to Markthalle each time, and sometimes multiple times.<br><br>I&#39;ve always come for dinner- just love this beer hall&#39;s roomy and ever so slightly nicer than average atmosphere, and I&#39;ve found the food to be consistently my favorite German food in its price range.   The Schweinebraten is indeed excellent, and I&#39;ve enjoyed the Schnitzel several times too.  I&#39;m not much of a steak eater, but I had an awesome one here on my last trip- so I ordered it again on my next visit and it was merely very good,- so I may have just had the perfect cut and perfect preparation the first time,- but I do say if you are a couple traveling and one of you wants to try a German specialty in a Beer Hall, and the other wants to stick to a steak, I think this is the place for you!<br><br>The wine list has actually proved pretty good- not extensive, but what we&#39;ve had we&#39;ve liked.  Service has always been very good, and it&#39;s been quite busy when I&#39;ve been in.  My only wish is that  Karl from Herr Lehmann would come out and wait my table with their finest bottle of wine in hand...",

The kitchen only use the best organic produce. Even the wines are organic (and if not, it&#39;s mentioned in the menu)<br>3. The interior is modern and clean, lots of &#34;brick a brack&#34;wood which I adore.<br>4. The simplicity of the dishes, they let the ingredients shine (see 2.)<br>5.

"reviewcomment":"All right, I&#39;m fibbing a bit on the Price Range bar below, giving this a rating of cheap which means 7 Euro or less.  The menu is three courses for 7.5 Euros.  At least that was the last time I was at Cafe Nord-Sud in September.  I will be there again within 3 days as I am Berlin-bound today, and can&#39;t wait to have lunch at Nord-Sud again soon.<br><br>If you are looking for fine dining, this isn&#39;t the atmosphere- it is absolutely casual, and as far as I can tell a two man show.  The owner/server is usually frantically busy, but remains to my mind extremely charming.  I always feel like I am seeing a theatre piece when I am here, as once the place is full, and it often is, he is definitely pulling off a performance piece to keep things running.<br><br>There are three menus each day.  Each is a different 3 course meal.  No mixing and matching, no interchanging,- you pick one and get those three courses.  One of the three has always had a main course of fish, and one has always been red meat or pork when I&#39;ve dined here.<br><br>Coming from the San Francisco Bay Area, I am always thrilled to be here and get a three course French meal for an amazing price.  And I very much appreciate the energy and dedication it takes to make it happen.<br><br>For travelers on a budget, who like French Cuisine, and especially those who appreciate the eclectic, Cafe Nord-Sud is worth a special trip.",

"reviewcomment":"Mutter... The name alone has that feeling of homeliness about it, but you would be wrong in this case to assume it refers to the German word for &#39;mother&#39;. Rather in this case it means &#39;Nut&#39; as in Nut and Bolts or as I see it, the Nut that keeps my screwy personality in balance... keeping me fed and watered is not a job to be undertaken by the weak and faint hearted!  Like a Nut it has many sides to its personality ...<br><br>During the day Mutter serves as a café where you can enjoy a nice breakfast, one of the lunchtime specials on offer or a simple coffee and slice of cake. Sometimes I have lunch meetings here because there are plenty of nice quiet corners to set up shop in, especially if you need to get connected to the interweb!<br>This is a bit like a home from home for me.<br><br>The place is bright and airy with plenty of areas to choose from. Inside there is a main dining area upstairs with its own bar, the principle bar is situated downstairs and separated by a smaller area at the entrance of Mutter. From the  Main Bar you can access the main outdoor seating area which in winter becomes tented complete with heaters. A little lounge area can also be found outside on the other side of mutter, nice to just hang with friends in the sun, shaded areas are also provided.<br><br>In the evening it transforms itself into a lively bar and bustling restaurant noted for its Thai cuisine.  The food is excellent especially for those who like their food sssssssssssspicy, perfect to extinguish with a nice cold beer or a tasty cocktail.  My go to dish here is the Beef Pad Kee Mao, a Chinese influenced spicy fried rice noodle dish, aka &#39;Drunken noodles&#39;... perfect to serve in a bar!  For an alternative I might have the Beef Krapao Nua sab, a stir fried beef in chilli and basil dish served with steamed rice or the Pad Prik Suii, Beef in a thick spicy pepper sauce.  But my all-time favourite is the Pad Kee Mao. Also available to go ;) <br><br>Other tasty things on the menu include: Gaeng Pet Ped Jangt (a roast duck with red curry), Gaeng Pet Gai (chicken coconut red curry) served in a pineapple or a nice juicy papaya salad. Sometimes you might find a tender roast beef on the daily specials menu, also good. Prices are fair considering the quality and the portions.<br><br>The Staff are very friendly and helpful! <br><br>During major Sporting events, Mutter provides screens inside and out so you can watch matches live whilst enjoying a nice cool beer amongst a friendly local and international crowd... rewind to World Cup 2010... only England supporter in bar full of Germans apart from the Irish guy who was obviously also supporting Germany!  What can I say...I survived...but then we did loose and there was that awkward moment when it seemed I was the only voice to be heard when England scored its only goal! Heavens this review might have taken a different turn had England won!<br><br>By the way Mutter is also a great location for private functions and parties complete with DJs that will make you want to dance until all hours of the morning, well at least until the Ordungsamt arrive!",

"reviewcomment":"Awesome service. Packed - make reservations. Pakistani food, NOT indian, as the only other english language reviewer, with no &#39;Friends&#39;, and one review, stipulates. It&#39;s not personal, or anything to do with her, though. It&#39;s this retarded, buggy &#39;Yelp&#39; system - eliminating many helpful reviews and yet leaving in a review from 2011, from a one-off reviewer.<br><br>{Edit: please also hunt for the mis-categorized  review from &#39;slowfood&#39;. &#39;It&#39;s too sweet/westernized&#39;, goes the review; worth reading. However, given the local community, this is expected. Menu items 108 through 113, are the hot and spicy items. And if you especially want hot and spicy, be sure to ask.}<br><br>Service was good, prompt; much more than can be expected for the city-area generally. This ethnic &#39;proud of my restaurant&#39; shines through. People spoiled on non-local service standards, may easily miss the extra, here, that good service provides.<br><br>The chai was respectable. The salzig lassi could have been saltier; otherwise excellent (salt to taste).<br><br>The fried vegetables were done correctly with a chickpea dough instead of wheat.<br><br>Murgh Salat was very sweet - not offensive - but sweeter than what i want for an evening meal. The mango pulp content made it incredibly sweet - i don&#39;t think any sugar was added. Says something for pakistani mangos, though. Mixed Pakora was good, however, again, the sauce was sweeter than i would have liked. A meat dish will be next.  ...<br><br>Music was not too loud. Bathrooms were private, heated and clean.<br><br>If you had a good experience at this restaurant, please let us know. If you want to thank me for this review, please mark below. Thanks :)",

I didn&#39;t have a human companion, so I took my book with me. As I already bookmarked this months ago, I was curious to see how this restaurant does given my standards.<br><br>They have a very small fixed menu, plus a daily menu that is ever-changing. You can find what they are cooking on their website, as well as written on the blackboard displayed in the restaurant. <br><br>I ordered the potato stew (large portion), as well as a latte macchiato. Service was quick (well, they&#39;d only scoop up a portion into a serving bowl), and the taste was good. I typically like restaurants with small menus; that&#39;s typically a sign that they do it well. I&#39;d rather pick a restaurant with a small menu, than one that has tons of possibilities, because I am not sure you can really deliver good food if you&#39;re trying to make lots of variants. <br><br>I also liked the atmosphere inside. It&#39;s not grandma-chic, but it definitely has an original feel to it. The tables are old, you almost expect it to smell musty, but that&#39;s just an illusion. I love the atmosphere, especially in the back room. I&#39;d totally come back here, either with a date, or with friends, drinking.",

It&#39;s somewhat isolated, hidden away among a bunch of apartment buildings, but worth coming if you&#39;re already close by.  The chairs are awesome!!",

Their generous portions are served by some of the nicest and most helpful servers in the city. It&#39;s almost always filled with locals, though those from the Indian sub-continent are missing.<br><br> 1. The Food<br>Well prepared standard Indian fare, with vegetarian options. Some dishes are on the oily/greasy side. The dishes are not very spicy, most likely because of their customer base, but are tinkered with on request. Their food is better seasoned than most Indian places in the city, with the brightness of their curries balanced out with the creaminess of their ghee and cream.<br><br> 2. The Staff <br>Kind, easy-going and quick.<br><br> 3. The atmosphere<br>A local neighbourhood hang-out. They also have a nice heated patio where you can sip on their numerous cocktails throughout the year.<br><br> 4. The damage<br>Most dishes are under 7 euros. Drinks are 2-5.<br><br> 5. Useful tidbits<br>Try their platter of mixed appetisers or creamy mango lassi.",

"reviewcomment":"Cafe Matilda is an almost-perfect cafe/bar mixture - so far I&#39;ve had breakfast and afternoon Kaffee und Kuchen there, but they also have drinks and probably other fare in the evenings. <br><br>The breakfast was an amazingly good deal - the Kleines Fruhstueck is actually huge, with two kinds of cheese and two kinds of meat (some kind of prosciutto and salami) along with a soft-boiled egg and various fruits and vegetables. Of course the requisite bread basket was there as well - all of this for EUR 5.60 (September 2012). <br><br>We saw the different types of Kuchen in the display when we were there for breakfast, and they looked great, so we came back in the afternoon. Also quite good. <br><br>There is seating out front on the sidewalk/pavement, and a front room and back room - all very comfortable. Inside the lighting is pretty low and relaxing, and they play a lot of soul-type music on LP. <br><br>I have to give a few negative marks to the lack of WiFi, and also our waitress in the morning was a bit scattered - dropping things and the like, but otherwise reasonably friendly. <br><br>Well worth it for breakfast - I doubt you could find a higher quality traditional German breakfast for less than EUR 5.60.<br><br>Quick edit: I got the prices wrong the first time - it&#39;s actually cheaper - EUR 5.60 for the Kleines Fruhstueck (changed above). Also, the second waitress we had when we came back was awesome - so definitely give it good marks for service all around.",

The dishes were overall very tasty, especially the curry with peanuts was great. The tandoori was also very moist and really well flavored. The only complaint I had was that the sauce of the curry seemed a bit to liquid for my taste. I also would have loved a bit more spicy dishes. But I will certainly go back there...",

"reviewcomment":"Awesome service. Packed - make reservations. Pakistani food, NOT indian, as the only other english language reviewer, with no &#39;Friends&#39;, and one review, stipulates. It&#39;s not personal, or anything to do with her, though. It&#39;s this retarded, buggy &#39;Yelp&#39; system - eliminating many helpful reviews and yet leaving in a review from 2011, from a one-off reviewer.<br><br>{Edit: please also hunt for the mis-categorized  review from &#39;slowfood&#39;. &#39;It&#39;s too sweet/westernized&#39;, goes the review; worth reading. However, given the local community, this is expected. Menu items 108 through 113, are the hot and spicy items. And if you especially want hot and spicy, be sure to ask.}<br><br>Service was good, prompt; much more than can be expected for the city-area generally. This ethnic &#39;proud of my restaurant&#39; shines through. People spoiled on non-local service standards, may easily miss the extra, here, that good service provides.<br><br>The chai was respectable. The salzig lassi could have been saltier; otherwise excellent (salt to taste).<br><br>The fried vegetables were done correctly with a chickpea dough instead of wheat.<br><br>Murgh Salat was very sweet - not offensive - but sweeter than what i want for an evening meal. The mango pulp content made it incredibly sweet - i don&#39;t think any sugar was added. Says something for pakistani mangos, though. Mixed Pakora was good, however, again, the sauce was sweeter than i would have liked. A meat dish will be next.  ...<br><br>Music was not too loud. Bathrooms were private, heated and clean.<br><br>If you had a good experience at this restaurant, please let us know. If you want to thank me for this review, please mark below. Thanks :)",

"reviewcomment":"My companion and I ended here after a botched attempt at having home-cooked dinner (yeah, Sunday doesn&#39;t feature a lot of open supermarkets). Anyway, since my companion is vegetarian, I suggested we try this place. <br><br>I ordered the Sudan-Teller, while my companion ordered the Vegan-Teller. I found my plate amazing, while she found hers lovely. My platter featured three falafels, an aubergine paste, some yoghurt-type thing, a salad, and something else that definitely had peanut butter in it. They served it in one large plate and coupled with a pair of pitas. <br><br>And believe it or not, my platter only cost 4,50 EUR. I thought it was worth more than that, given the taste and the quantity.<br><br>Needless to say, I will definitely be back. This place features a lot of vegetarian dishes, and even though I am not vegetarian anymore, they make me want to be one again.",

The area is darling and is often referred to as Paris in Berlin. That alone brought me into the restaurant, but it was the great service, creative drinks and fantastic food that kept me coming back.<br><br>Both times that I went for dinner, I ordered chicken dishes and the second was especially tasty (chicken with glass noodles? Yes please). Although MrHai is a bit pricey, it is right on par with other restaurants around it. Sadly, the higher Euro point made my visits limited, but well worth it!<br><br>A heads up: they have numerous restaurants - MrHai Kabuki, MrHai Shabuki, MrHai &amp; Friends, and MrHai Life. Avoid the mix up and make sure you clarify if you are meeting people.",

"reviewcomment":"It&#39;s a shame I hadn&#39;t stopped in sooner this summer, as I really love a very good (and very inexpensive!) Thai dinner with a cold Singha beer...but they are doing construction on the building, which obscures the entrance and makes the whole patio feel a bit dark and covered. <br><br>Hopefully it shapes up soon, because get past the construction equipment and there is a wonderful meal awaiting you! (and me!)  I am wholly and mightily impressed with this little Thai place on the corner of Christburgerstr. &amp; Prenzlauer Alle! <br><br>I had decided on my return trip home (after being soaked in a freak rainstorm) that I&#39;d pop into this place and check it out...it only took me a moment to understand I had made the right choice and that it was far preferable even to my takeout mainstay Xuan, in Kaiser&#39;s. Bangkok is roughly the same price and I would say a bit better quality, and much nicer atmosphere. After all, its not in a grocery market. <br><br>For 8,20 I got a good portion of chicken, veggies and rice in peanut sauce accompanied by my beloved Singha. Would&#39;ve been even less had I gone for a draft beer which are less than 1,50. I chose to indulge in an import...when you only have one, make it count right? <br><br>Besides the very low price point, I was very impressed with the super speedy and very friendly service. The two girls working the room were efficient and happy. From the time I sat down until I received my food could not have been more than 10 minutes. It was so hot I had to let it cool down, even! <br><br>Will definitely be stopping back in to try the summer rolls, soups, salads, etc...hot, filling, friendly service, inexpensive. Nice for a date, catch up with friends or even solo (like me!).",

"reviewcomment":"This place is not a quick grab and go join. It seems that the Germans don&#39;t like this place. I can understand the displeasure with it, considering the price. The meal is expensive, and its Berlin. There are a lot of the unemployed, and students here. Additionally, its in a section of town that isn&#39;t known for finance. [Ok there are a few tech shops, and hotels around] <br><br>The food at this place is good. I had the weinerschnitel. It came with bread prior to the meal. The food was excellently prepared and was quite tasty. The portions were just right. Its been a while [July 2011] since I&#39;ve been there so, I cannot recall what came with the meal. <br><br>The atmosphere: It was quiet, and the space was open. It appears that they are going for an atmosphere that is spacey and quiet. This place could very well be used as a lounge later in the evening. <br><br>The downsides to this place: <br><br> 1.  Its rather hard to find. Its down an alley and is out of sight from the road. <br> 2. Its pricey",

It&#39;s not personal, or anything to do with her, though. It&#39;s this retarded, buggy &#39;Yelp&#39; system - eliminating many helpful reviews and yet leaving in a review from 2011, from a one-off reviewer.<br><br>{Edit: please also hunt for the mis-categorized  review from &#39;slowfood&#39;. &#39;It&#39;s too sweet/westernized&#39;, goes the review; worth reading. However, given the local community, this is expected. Menu items 108 through 113, are the hot and spicy items. And if you especially want hot and spicy, be sure to ask.}<br><br>Service was good, prompt; much more than can be expected for the city-area generally. This ethnic &#39;proud of my restaurant&#39; shines through. People spoiled on non-local service standards, may easily miss the extra, here, that good service provides.<br><br>The chai was respectable. The salzig lassi could have been saltier; otherwise excellent (salt to taste).<br><br>The fried vegetables were done correctly with a chickpea dough instead of wheat.<br><br>Murgh Salat was very sweet - not offensive - but sweeter than what i want for an evening meal. The mango pulp content made it incredibly sweet - i don&#39;t think any sugar was added. Says something for pakistani mangos, though. Mixed Pakora was good, however, again, the sauce was sweeter than i would have liked. A meat dish will be next.  ...<br><br>Music was not too loud. Bathrooms were private, heated and clean.<br><br>If you had a good experience at this restaurant, please let us know. If you want to thank me for this review, please mark below. Thanks :)",

"reviewcomment":"I&#39;m thinking to myself, tacos in Berlin?  Am I setting myself up for trouble?  Luckily the answer is no and tipica comes through with some good representation of the taco arts.  And as you might guess from my yelp slogan I&#39;ve enjoyed many tacos over the years. <br><br>How things work here is you pick a a choice of taco fillings, some traditional some not so, some sides and salsa.  You get a plate with the items and a basket of warm tortillas to build your own.  The tortillas exceeded my expectations and so did the food.  The salsa not so much but who cares when they also provide the side of chopped onions an cilantro, the traditional garnish with a squirt of lime!<br><br>We tried the al pastor and carnitas, some of my favorites and a chance for me to be hyper critical.  The al pastor was very similar to things I&#39;ve had at various places in the states.  While the flavor was good, it wasn&#39;t the best, however the meat was tender And a better quality than you see back home.  The carnitas was the variety that uses more citrus than I typically like but flavor full and very tender.  Also the right amount of fat.  They remind me of caribbean style carnitas instead of what you might get in Cali or mainland mex.  <br><br>Not exactly cheap taco wagon fare but, good and much better than I imagined.  I put together about four or five tacos with the fixings they served and was very happy.  Btw, cheap taco wagon tacos are usually the best and something to search out.  But having some nice drinks at Tipica does have an advantage to eating at a taco wagon.<br><br>A hint to the Berliners and other Europeans going here, tacos are street food to be eaten with your hands!!! So stop trying to eat them with a knife and fork!  Pick it up and go to town!",

"reviewcomment":"Choosing your favourite Currywurst in Berlin, for a Berliner, comes down to parents choosing a favourite child: you can&#39;t. Yet, Curry Mitte delivers the full package.<br><br>The staff is inconsistent and each of them has a very own very Berlin personality. From sloppy answers to mild insults, they are very personal and charming. Typically Berlin.<br><br>The Curry sausage comes in the skin and no-skin varieties and with ketchup or home made hot sauce (which tastes great). If that&#39;s not enough, you can try to beat the scoville scale and try a really hot sauce.<br><br>The fries are super crispy and as good as fries get in Berlin. The crowd is untypical for Mitte: people are reasonable and nice. Blue and white collar<br> Reasonable prices (1.80 Euro curry sausage)",

"reviewcomment":"Awesome service. Packed - make reservations. Pakistani food, NOT indian, as the only other english language reviewer, with no &#39;Friends&#39;, and one review, stipulates. It&#39;s not personal, or anything to do with her, though. It&#39;s this retarded, buggy &#39;Yelp&#39; system - eliminating many helpful reviews and yet leaving in a review from 2011, from a one-off reviewer.<br><br>{Edit: please also hunt for the mis-categorized  review from &#39;slowfood&#39;. &#39;It&#39;s too sweet/westernized&#39;, goes the review; worth reading. However, given the local community, this is expected. Menu items 108 through 113, are the hot and spicy items. And if you especially want hot and spicy, be sure to ask.}<br><br>Service was good, prompt; much more than can be expected for the city-area generally. This ethnic &#39;proud of my restaurant&#39; shines through. People spoiled on non-local service standards, may easily miss the extra, here, that good service provides.<br><br>The chai was respectable. The salzig lassi could have been saltier; otherwise excellent (salt to taste).<br><br>The fried vegetables were done correctly with a chickpea dough instead of wheat.<br><br>Murgh Salat was very sweet - not offensive - but sweeter than what i want for an evening meal. The mango pulp content made it incredibly sweet - i don&#39;t think any sugar was added. Says something for pakistani mangos, though. Mixed Pakora was good, however, again, the sauce was sweeter than i would have liked. A meat dish will be next.  ...<br><br>Music was not too loud. Bathrooms were private, heated and clean.<br><br>If you had a good experience at this restaurant, please let us know. If you want to thank me for this review, please mark below. Thanks :)",

"reviewcomment":"I knew that today was going to be a long day (yes, I am writing this review during the 10 minutes free time that I found this late afternoon). I was in my office since before 9:00 AM and will be here until around 6:00 PM. So around mid-afternoon, I took a break and took some papers I needed to read, while trying to find a new cafe. I found the Sarotti Höfe, named after the chocolatier Sarotti. <br><br>True to the name, they offer plenty of chocolate-related drinks, both alcoholic and non-alcoholic. The temperature was a little chilly, so I asked for a grog and a slice of the sachertorte. That set me back 6,80 EUR. And yes, I enjoyed it, in many ways.<br><br>The grog was potent. The sachertorte was chocolatey. And I was light-headed after consuming these two items and walking back to my office. <br><br>I give this place 4 stars. Perhaps it&#39;s because I like the interior: it has charm and character, and gives off an old-world feel, at the same time making people of all walks of life welcome (they have a rainbow sticker at the door, among other things). I also like the plentiful choices of cakes. What I don&#39;t like is the lack of accessible electric plugs. So this isn&#39;t a place I would like to set up a laptop and work in, this is more a place where one would feel comfortable taking a little break from the hustle and bustle of life and sip a drink, potent or non-potent.",

It&#39;s all very fresh - the chef comes out with more pieces all the time, so you know they haven&#39;t been lying there all day. I also had a very tender pangasius filet and a delicious fried banana for dessert - all included in the buffet price.<br><br> Lots of people sharing the huge tables - each of them has a built in grill where the chef can come out and cook directly in front of the guests, something that happens only in the evenings I suppose.<br><br> 1/2 liter tap beer: 4 euro.<br><br> À la carte prices are about 15 euro per dish I think, and there are also quite elaborate menues for more persons - that&#39;s probably when the table grills are used.",

We ate here twice in our visit to Berlin because the food is fresh, tasty and a nice change from currywürst and döner kebab. Both times we had the Mix Platte for 2. The felafel was light and crispy, the tabbouleh salad and vegetables were dressed just right with lemon and olive oil and the meat kebab was delicately spiced. I am from LA so the Syrian flavor difference was apparent - I&#39;m used to a heavier hand with garlic and spices in the Armenian, Persian and Israeli cuisine in California though maybe it&#39;s just a German preference for milder flavors? Whatever the case my husband and I loved Yarok! <br><br>It gets busy but just squeeze in somewhere and be patient!",

"reviewcomment":"From the minimalistic decor - the light dusty blue walls, the modern meets vintage lightbulbs hanging from the ceiling - to the open sushi bar, to the &#34;i want everything on there&#34; menu, Omoni is my favourite Korean (bordering on Japanese) kitchen in Berlin.<br><br>Ooooor, at least it shares the no. 1 spot with Yam Yam, but whereas I go to Yam Yam for a bibimbap craving, korean pancakes and dumplings, I go to Omono for the more sushi like options. <br><br>I have a tendency to order the same things: the tuna tartar rolls ($4.80) are beyond tasty, and serve as the perfect entree. For a main it&#39;s all about #15 ($8.50):  a rice bowl served up with both raw and cooked salmon, salmon skin and bio-salad - hearty, yet fresh at the same time. And oh yes, the seaweed salad is pretty amazing too. <br><br>The place is popular, and is only open for dinner, so make sure to book if you are more than two people. Otherwise try to get a seat at the bar and watch the chef do his magic!",

"reviewcomment":"Food: delicious. The burger was impeccable--my only complaint was the relatively low quality lettuce and tomato, and less onion strings than I would&#39;ve liked. But those honeyed figs... DANG. I got &#34;The Egyptian,&#34; and would recommend it a thousand times over.<br><br>Drinks: The one and only place I&#39;ve ever had a satisfactory Gin cocktail. Still a bigger fan of whiskey--and they have that too--but it was on their specials list, and was definitely a good pick!<br><br>Atmosphere: Music: Great choice of jazzy pop covers, at just the right volume. Service: fantastic--they even took my coat and let us stay a little past our reservation. A little surprised when we got served by a dude in a dress (this is after all in the heart of Berlin&#39;s gay district), but hey, it&#39;s a free country!<br><br>The bill: less expensive than I would have thought, but then again we&#39;re talking Euros and I haven&#39;t gotten over the exchange difference... So, maybe a little pricy. 20€ including tip.<br><br>Final Statement: AMAZING burgers, good drinks (if the beer selection is a bit sparse, the bar is fantastic), great service, slightly unusual locale. Four stars, minus one for the lackluster condiments. But only just!",

"reviewcomment":"Walking up street, I immediately spotted the storefront to this Japanese restaurant- it&#39;s hard to miss with the most colorful and cute artwork painted on the storefront windows. <br><br>This is truly a special and unique place that will transport you to Japan. You will completely forget you&#39;re in Berlin as you enter this hip and very pink restaurant. Yumi (lady who runs the place) and the staff are all super-friendly - It was so nice to see so many happy smiling faces. With a little smile of my own, I ordered and settled in for a yummy meal and a feel-good Japanese cultural experience. <br><br>The menu is simple, fresh and authentic Japanese home cooking - the kind of stuff you&#39;d find coming from a real Japanese kitchen including: Grilled fishes, Yakiniku beef, Miso tofu, Teriyaki Chicken, Noodle bowls, Sushi, Japanese rice porridge and a range of authentic side dishes. The dishes are carefully prepared and arrive the table looking picture perfect - how often do you get a salad with little carrots cut into cute little flower shapes? <br><br>They also have bento boxes which are packaged boxes filled with a variety of tasty bites portioned and sectioned to make a really healthy and convenient meal to go. Growing up in Hawaii, I remember being able to grab these types of bento boxes all over the place. Seeing the bento boxes on the counter brought back some nice memories and I&#39;ll definitely be back to grab one next time I need a quick meal to go.<br><br>I also found out that Smart Deli also has an online food order/delivery service. The order form is on their website. I took a look and there is a nice wide range of all the Japanese basics you&#39;d need to cook a nice meal at home. So, if you&#39;re feeling inspired to cook some Japanese food in your own kitchen, you&#39;re all set here!<br><br>Before I left, Yumi came over to chat with me as I was looking at a flyer for an upcoming event they were hosting with handmade crafts and food demos. It was such a nice treat getting to learn about her life and the restaurant. Felt like being at a friends house for lunch and sitting around chatting after. All her hard work definitely shows as I found out it happened to be their 10 year anniversary on the day I was there and I got a free homemade smiley face cookie for their birthday as part of the celebration. <br><br>What more can I say? Go check this place out - you&#39;ll be hooked too",

When it&#39;s already sold out I get sad. The cook is not always consistent, sometimes it&#39;s cooked more than others. But it&#39;s nearly always done right. This should probably be a 4.5 star rating. And I am only holding back from a 5 star because, the cookie is gone when I&#39;m done eating it. If they could find a way to make it last after I had finished eating it, I&#39;d definitely give it a 5.",

You get as many helpings as you want and all they ask is that you don&#39;t die in the restaurant.<br><br> This place also has Brazilian dancing at the weekends so it&#39;s best to come around that time. The ambience is rather like a canteen in many ways, with rows of long tables where friends and strangers eat together. Eventually, the dancers (which includes the cooks, by the way) get around to convincing everyone to jump up and conga around the place.<br><br> Ridiculous, but fun!",

"reviewcomment":"Awesome service. Packed - make reservations. Pakistani food, NOT indian, as the only other english language reviewer, with no &#39;Friends&#39;, and one review, stipulates. It&#39;s not personal, or anything to do with her, though. It&#39;s this retarded, buggy &#39;Yelp&#39; system - eliminating many helpful reviews and yet leaving in a review from 2011, from a one-off reviewer.<br><br>{Edit: please also hunt for the mis-categorized  review from &#39;slowfood&#39;. &#39;It&#39;s too sweet/westernized&#39;, goes the review; worth reading. However, given the local community, this is expected. Menu items 108 through 113, are the hot and spicy items. And if you especially want hot and spicy, be sure to ask.}<br><br>Service was good, prompt; much more than can be expected for the city-area generally. This ethnic &#39;proud of my restaurant&#39; shines through. People spoiled on non-local service standards, may easily miss the extra, here, that good service provides.<br><br>The chai was respectable. The salzig lassi could have been saltier; otherwise excellent (salt to taste).<br><br>The fried vegetables were done correctly with a chickpea dough instead of wheat.<br><br>Murgh Salat was very sweet - not offensive - but sweeter than what i want for an evening meal. The mango pulp content made it incredibly sweet - i don&#39;t think any sugar was added. Says something for pakistani mangos, though. Mixed Pakora was good, however, again, the sauce was sweeter than i would have liked. A meat dish will be next.  ...<br><br>Music was not too loud. Bathrooms were private, heated and clean.<br><br>If you had a good experience at this restaurant, please let us know. If you want to thank me for this review, please mark below. Thanks :)",

"reviewcomment":"I love places with vegetarian burgers and homemade fries. This place is definitely one of them. My husband and I used to frequent the one on Oranientstr. but it was just too busy to make it worth it. Now it&#39;s in our back yard and before it gets busy, we&#39;re definitely there. Apparently the vegetarian burger menu has expanded and I&#39;ve been quite excited. My husband likes it because it&#39;s cheap, but it doesn&#39;t quite substitute a burger from The Bird.<br><br> The ambiance is okay, it&#39;s close enough to the M10 and Simon-Dach Str. However, there&#39;s a hostel nearby. That&#39;s fine for them, but makes locals a bit sketchy about lingering on. Nonetheless, I was quite excited for the Kreuzburgbers to open up here!",

"reviewcomment":"I LOVED this restaurant!<br><br>2 Schwestern is located inside a large building that was probably an old church or something of the sort, but don&#39;t let that deter you: the atmosphere in the restaurant isn&#39;t stuffy and pretentious at all! The decor id beautiful, with classic solid wood tables, french windows onto the yard, an old-fashioned bar and suffused lighting in the evening. It makes a great spot for a dinner with friends of for a date.<br><br>The food is delicious and clearly prepared with care and good-quality ingredients. The bread is fresh, comes in several variety and is served with homemade seasoned butter.<br><br>Everything is nicely presented, without anything pretentious.<br><br>Best of all, the staff is friendly, polite and accommodating.<br><br>I cannot think of a better place to have dinner on my last day in Berlin!",

"reviewcomment":"I agree with Jason&#39;s review below.  This place is tremendous!  <br>We absolutely loved our meal there last week (October 12th) The vichyssoise was served hot (traditionally served cold) and excellent.  The scallops, the braised pork cheek all exceptional.  <br>The sommelier was extremely knowledgeable and made some excellent recommendations on the wine for our meal and also a terrific sense of humor.<br>Jason is right tho&#39; the exceptional food, wine and service comes with a price, but it is worth the splurge.  <br>It was pretty empty when we were there as well. I hope this place stays in business.",

"reviewcomment":"Awesome service. Packed - make reservations. Pakistani food, NOT indian, as the only other english language reviewer, with no &#39;Friends&#39;, and one review, stipulates. It&#39;s not personal, or anything to do with her, though. It&#39;s this retarded, buggy &#39;Yelp&#39; system - eliminating many helpful reviews and yet leaving in a review from 2011, from a one-off reviewer.<br><br>{Edit: please also hunt for the mis-categorized  review from &#39;slowfood&#39;. &#39;It&#39;s too sweet/westernized&#39;, goes the review; worth reading. However, given the local community, this is expected. Menu items 108 through 113, are the hot and spicy items. And if you especially want hot and spicy, be sure to ask.}<br><br>Service was good, prompt; much more than can be expected for the city-area generally. This ethnic &#39;proud of my restaurant&#39; shines through. People spoiled on non-local service standards, may easily miss the extra, here, that good service provides.<br><br>The chai was respectable. The salzig lassi could have been saltier; otherwise excellent (salt to taste).<br><br>The fried vegetables were done correctly with a chickpea dough instead of wheat.<br><br>Murgh Salat was very sweet - not offensive - but sweeter than what i want for an evening meal. The mango pulp content made it incredibly sweet - i don&#39;t think any sugar was added. Says something for pakistani mangos, though. Mixed Pakora was good, however, again, the sauce was sweeter than i would have liked. A meat dish will be next.  ...<br><br>Music was not too loud. Bathrooms were private, heated and clean.<br><br>If you had a good experience at this restaurant, please let us know. If you want to thank me for this review, please mark below. Thanks :)",

I never order sashimi unless I have heard good things about the chef or if it just happens to be an extra side featured on the boat. I stumbled on this when I was in the mood for Asian food in Berlin with a group of friends. The bill did not come out to a whooping bill and we were remarkably full when we were done. I&#39;ve returned to it a couple of times afterwards and always had a good experience. We ordered the sushi boat and it cost the average price -- perhaps even a bit lower than it would have cost us at other bars on the street and in Berlin. They have nice drinks and they even have things for the non-fish eaters (one of my friends flat out dislikes fish). They even have a happy hour for sushi.",

"reviewcomment":"While this place is a restaurant, this review only applies for the drinks. My companion and I headed here after dinner last night because we wanted mojitos. So why not go to a Cuban place for it? <br><br>They are sort of a restaurant, sort of a bar. They have both a food menu and a drink menu. And their drink menu was enormous too, I almost regretted not sampling the other offerings. Though I have to say, the mojitos were very potent. Very potent that I was very tempted to order another one, if not for a pressing appointment later that night. So I settled for just one.<br><br>The place has a dark atmosphere; it is more a cavern-like dive bar than a restaurant. That being said, the acoustics are good enough to allow you to have a conversation with your companions. <br><br>The service was great; the staff regularly checked on us whether we were doing okay or whether we needed anything else. And yes, they were very visually appealing, which fuels one&#39;s imagination, to the point that I almost wished I took Spanish instead of German when I was taking foreign language courses in the university, just so that I can carry a longer conversation with them while visually appreciating them. I guess the mojitos were partly to blame.",

Wiener art means that its a pork schnitzel instead of the &#34;real&#34; veal schnitzel. <br><br>The schnitzel was tasty and good as always but the french fries where only ok. <br>Think they would have been tastier and more crispy if they would have been fried 1 more time.  The sallad buffé is always fresh at Maredo and this was as good as usual.  <br><br>With one bottle of house wine that was ok but nothing fancy and 2 beers the check was 60 € wich is good for two. <br><br>Service at this location was typically german friendly and i would return.",

"reviewcomment":"Awesome service. Packed - make reservations. Pakistani food, NOT indian, as the only other english language reviewer, with no &#39;Friends&#39;, and one review, stipulates. It&#39;s not personal, or anything to do with her, though. It&#39;s this retarded, buggy &#39;Yelp&#39; system - eliminating many helpful reviews and yet leaving in a review from 2011, from a one-off reviewer.<br><br>{Edit: please also hunt for the mis-categorized  review from &#39;slowfood&#39;. &#39;It&#39;s too sweet/westernized&#39;, goes the review; worth reading. However, given the local community, this is expected. Menu items 108 through 113, are the hot and spicy items. And if you especially want hot and spicy, be sure to ask.}<br><br>Service was good, prompt; much more than can be expected for the city-area generally. This ethnic &#39;proud of my restaurant&#39; shines through. People spoiled on non-local service standards, may easily miss the extra, here, that good service provides.<br><br>The chai was respectable. The salzig lassi could have been saltier; otherwise excellent (salt to taste).<br><br>The fried vegetables were done correctly with a chickpea dough instead of wheat.<br><br>Murgh Salat was very sweet - not offensive - but sweeter than what i want for an evening meal. The mango pulp content made it incredibly sweet - i don&#39;t think any sugar was added. Says something for pakistani mangos, though. Mixed Pakora was good, however, again, the sauce was sweeter than i would have liked. A meat dish will be next.  ...<br><br>Music was not too loud. Bathrooms were private, heated and clean.<br><br>If you had a good experience at this restaurant, please let us know. If you want to thank me for this review, please mark below. Thanks :)",

"reviewcomment":"This café/restaurant is one of the places I always go back to. I moved away from this sector of Berlin, but any time I get close, I get back here. Their Lunch menu and Dinner menus changes daily and whatever I ordered was always delicious and was made with best ingredients. In summer it&#39;s cool inside (the good old Berliner high ceilings do the trick), so don&#39;t be sad if you don&#39;t get an outdoor seat! The service is friendly any time of the day since they have quite a lot of waiters working in shifts, as I could notice in the last 7 years. <br><br>In the back there is a play room for kids. So it&#39;s pretty perfect for parents who want to take a time out and have some relaxing time with their friends and kids without being bothered. <br><br>Hooray to this place!",

Sitting at the teppanyaki and watching the cooks prepare your food (which is always top quality seeing as they can&#39;t hide any flaws with you having it right in front of your eyes) is something you should have done at least once in your life. The menus are carefully chosen, and although they&#39;re not cheap, it&#39;s well worth the money. Going back in December as Xmas treat!",

"reviewcomment":"My companion and I had a quick bite here before we headed to the symphony. We wanted a döner, but we didn&#39;t want to wait 45 minutes to get one. And since another companion of mine suggested this as an alternative, we headed here to try it out. The fact that it was very close to the metro station was also a good plus.<br><br>We didn&#39;t realize that there were two lines, which separates chicken and beef. It wasn&#39;t clear at the outset, so while we were still eyeing our options, the guy at the empty counter said &#34;Bitte schön&#34; and so we ordered. When we learned it was the chicken stand, I was a little disappointed, but still ordered one, as the beef stand had about 5 people lined up.<br><br>Anyway, even though it was chicken, it was a great choice, great enough that I am willing to give it 4 stars. I only wonder what the beef tasted like. But since the waiting time isn&#39;t 45 minutes, I am more than willing to give it a try. This is definitely a great alternative to the more famous one, though I still say that there is a reason why there is a 45-minute wait on the other one, because it really is very good.",

Naturally we would expect that in every restaurant but, it is, unfortunately, not the case. I have eaten in 3 Greek restaurants in the area (one closed a few years ago) and Taverna Dimokritos is the one that stands out for me, great food, great service, reasonable price  and no airs and graces.

And if you especially want hot and spicy, be sure to ask.}<br><br>Service was good, prompt; much more than can be expected for the city-area generally. This ethnic &#39;proud of my restaurant&#39; shines through. People spoiled on non-local service standards, may easily miss the extra, here, that good service provides.<br><br>The chai was respectable. The salzig lassi could have been saltier; otherwise excellent (salt to taste).<br><br>The fried vegetables were done correctly with a chickpea dough instead of wheat.<br><br>Murgh Salat was very sweet - not offensive - but sweeter than what i want for an evening meal. The mango pulp content made it incredibly sweet - i don&#39;t think any sugar was added. Says something for pakistani mangos, though. Mixed Pakora was good, however, again, the sauce was sweeter than i would have liked. A meat dish will be next.  ...<br><br>Music was not too loud. Bathrooms were private, heated and clean.<br><br>If you had a good experience at this restaurant, please let us know. If you want to thank me for this review, please mark below. Thanks :)",

"reviewcomment":"Found this on a recommendation from the owner of Little Ottik.  We had returned to Little Ottik one night as we really enjoyed it (and the owner is from Detroit like us),  but he didn&#39;t have any openings.  So we asked him where he&#39;d eat and he recommended Nansen.<br><br>So glad he did.  The food and service was great!  We ate outside--it&#39;s right on the canal, in a quiet area of Berlin.  Staff spoke great English (sorry, my German is passable, but not great.) and was very efficient and friendly.<br><br>Every course was wonderful.  Appetizers--an amazing yellow pepper soup that was so flavorful. (5.20 Euro)  Entrees--lamb (19.80 E) that tasted like lamb.  And perfectly cooked venison (23E).   This was some of the best food we had in Berlin.<br><br>Deserts shouldn&#39;t be passed up--it&#39;s like this is a 3* restaurant in hiding.<br><br>If we lived in Berlin, this would be our favorite place.  Not stuffy or too fancy--just a great location, great food and great service.",

It is a very simple place, I usually come to have a quick lunch on my break or sit for a good small sushi dinner. Prices are good, and between 11:00 and 16:00 you get %30 off. They allow my dog come in and sit with us, and they offer free Wi-Fi (just ask for the password). As a vegan, it is easy to order many great tastes, I love the avocado - peanut maki. I am glad to have this hidden gem next to my house!",

"reviewcomment":"This is a great place for lunch as the set menu is always very good and also very reasonably priced. Where else can one escape with 3 courses for 25 Euros including a glass of wine and coffee (and tip) in a top-class restaurant in the centre of Berlin?<br><br> I used to come here years ago for dinners and this elegant place was instrumental for my decision to move into the area. But since I moved in, the management changed and the restaurant fell down a deep crevice in terms of quality and service. Over the last 2-3 years, I saw signs that they are crawling back up but they still have not quite made it back to their old apex. In the past, they would have easily qualified for a Michelin star. As it is, they still do not have one (and it shows) but they are charging prices as if they do. Oh, by the way, they also do the most expensive sushi in Berlin, which you can see hand-made by Japanese-looking cooks.<br><br> There is a luxury cocktail bar lounge area just inside the restaurant where one can listen to great blues and soul music tinkled on the piano and sung by various artistes after dinner time. This is a wonderful lounge, if only the drinks were a little cheaper, but it&#39;s still worth coming here once in a while to pass the time away on a dull evening.<br><br> The restaurant itself is a lovely place to dine and watch either (a) life moseying by in Alte Potsdamer Strasse, or (b) the cooks in action in the open kitchen. Both are entertaining, with my preference for the latter. The ambience is dark executive as befits the main restaurant of the best Grand Hyatt in Europe, but is intimate and cosy enough to bring friends along. Service is generally good and they even remember your name if you go there a few times. Or maybe they just remember weirdos like me.<br><br> Some years ago, I recall that they had also mispriced a Chateau Margaux 1988 on their wine list and we took full advantage of that until they sold out.<br><br> Ah, those were the days. Maybe it will get back to where it belongs but at the moment, the fact is Vox is a classy refined restaurant, with a great music lounge, serving good quality hotel food at premium hotel prices at dinner time. So the best deal there is their lunch set menu.",

I ate a baby cow (veal) and man it was sincerely seasons perfect.  I hate to say that I loved eating a piece of that little guy.  I took a little cheat day and had a few bites of desert and it was absolutely incredible.  It all melted in my mouth, and turned a dream into reality.  The meal was great, the staff was knowledgable, helpful and accommodating.  Dope.",

"reviewcomment":"A friend suggested an impromptu lunch and fancied something Asian, so I had to leave my comfort zone and venture out of Schöneberg!  It had been a while since I was at Selig, which specialises  in Hunan, Sichuan and Lanzhou cuisine so for a brief moment I thought they had changed hands, the interior was completely different, where was the Aquarium, would I get my dumplings or hand pulled beef noodles? <br><br>Turns out Selig had just upped its game and gone all funky. Newly refurbished; actually it&#39;s still ongoing Daniel was just mounting up some of the old pictures to hang on the new walls. The toilets are all modern and tiled with Mah-jong pieces, very trendy! I really liked the alcove at the back made up of Abacuses or should one call them Abaci Who knows! <br><br>I had gone there intentionally for some homemade Jiaozi and Lanzhou Salad or perhaps a bowl of beef noodles. But the new décor steered me off course and I ended up having something else instead. They say everything happens for a reason and rightly so as I left feeling a whole lot more Asian than when I went in (I recently took a survey to determine my subconscious true nationality, the outcome was German.)!<br><br>Anyway, shortly after we ordered our drinks we were presented with a complimentary appetiser of cucumber dressed in a slightly spicy sesame sauce. Amazes me how something so simple can taste so good.  We perused the menu and settled on #012 Frühlingsente (crispy fried duck with Lanzhou salad and a peanut sauce), #013 Fritiert Tintenfish (deep fried salt and pepper squid) and #162 Dir Rauber von Hunan (Hunan spicy fried beef) .<br><br>The Lanzhou salad that came with the duck was how I remembered it. I just love the taste and textures, all mingled together in a delicious and slightly spicy dressing.  The Spicy beef was delicious, packed with fresh green chillies, garlic shoots, red peppers and coriander. It was fragrant and had a nice dry heat.  <br><br>My only disappointment was the squid. I expected pieces of fried squid in a salt and pepper coating but it was actually more like battered calamari rings, without the salt and pepper, having said that it was really tender. I soon got over it as Daniel the manager had added a complimentary fish dish to our surprise. This was really, really good and off menu, Carp in a chilli sauce, a speciality from his province. Seriously, the fish just melted into your mouth and the sauce was to die for!  I was quite happy just to have the sauce with the rice it was that good. <br><br>My lunch companion said the Chinese food here made a very good impression on him; Chinese is not usually his first choice when it comes to Asian food in Berlin. Something I tend to agree with!<br><br>The whole meal including a beer and a pot of green tea came to about €27. <br>Will come back again soon for my Jiaozi fix, or maybe I will have the beef noodles mmm... Watch this space!",

The small restaurant has a nice modern Asian Ambience and is serving fresh sushi and thai-vietnam cuisine. I had a vietnamese dish and a refreshing lime juice with mint leaves on ice. The food is tasty, the staff is quick and friendly and on top of it all, the prices are unbeatable for this place and quality. They have a small terrace where you can enjoy your meal while watching the busy streets around one of Berlin&#39;s busiest places.",

"reviewcomment":"I had been waiting over 6months to visit this place. I am allergic to gluten and lactose, so naturally the paleo lifestyle fits with me. Having stumbled across the restaurant during a google search I was super excited to visit Berlin.<br><br>I am an Aussie, so when i stumbled across this restaurant i was 6months away from eating there, and my excitement was pretty intense when i finally got to eat there. <br><br>So a few hours before we went to eat at Sauvage, we checked out online what we were going to order. <br><br>When we arrived at Sauvage we were surprised by the atmosphere and the layout of the restaurant. We were seated at a cute little wooden table with candles as the only lighting. The rest of the restaurant is quite dark with candles lighting the way, which sets a great mood. <br><br>When we were given the menu to look over, i was disappointed to notice the two things i had decided on at the hotel before arriving were not on this menu. I was very disappointed, but also excited that i was able to eat and order anything off the menu, this has never happened before.<br><br>My friend and i each ordered a starter, a main, a dessert and a bottle of wine. The food was AMAZING!!! I was in heaven with each bite. My friend doesn&#39;t follow a paleo lifestyle, however was still impressed by the grain free bread and crackers, the apple and rhubarb crumble and the bacon wrapped quail. <br><br>I wished i&#39;d had more time in Berlin to go back to Sauvage for Breakfast, their grain free, gluten free, dairy free and sugar free options looked amazing. <br><br>For the 3 courses and a bottle of wine, we were only set back 70ish euro, which in my eyes is pretty good for the quality and the portion sizes we were served.<br><br>Will recommend this place to any one visiting Berlin regardless of allergies or health choices.",

"reviewcomment":"This was the perfect dinner for one of the coldest days this winter. With the outside temperture of -10C, we were warmed up with some interesting fondues, which are not just the typical Swiss fondues but also meat fondues with interesting chocolate or chili sauces. Each plate also came with a nice salad with a good balsamico dressing and everyone shared around their fondues. The only slightly negative point was that we had to wait quite long (as we were quite a big group) but at the end everyone was pretty happy and completely stuffed. The restaurant had no wine list but a very big selection of wines from various countries. So the waiters kindly made some suggestions which we could try, ponder over before deciding on a selection.<br><br> We had a great night out with lots of chatting and it was pretty difficult to leave around midnight and return to the cold. By the way, a couple of people complained about the &#34;stale&#34; bread. Just for your information, bread has to be hard and a little stale before they can go into a fondue. Otherwise fresh bread will just crumble away and dissolve into the cheese!",

It&#39;s not personal, or anything to do with her, though. It&#39;s this retarded, buggy &#39;Yelp&#39; system - eliminating many helpful reviews and yet leaving in a review from 2011, from a one-off reviewer.<br><br>{Edit: please also hunt for the mis-categorized  review from &#39;slowfood&#39;. &#39;It&#39;s too sweet/westernized&#39;, goes the review; worth reading. However, given the local community, this is expected. Menu items 108 through 113, are the hot and spicy items. And if you especially want hot and spicy, be sure to ask.}<br><br>Service was good, prompt; much more than can be expected for the city-area generally. This ethnic &#39;proud of my restaurant&#39; shines through. People spoiled on non-local service standards, may easily miss the extra, here, that good service provides.<br><br>The chai was respectable. The salzig lassi could have been saltier; otherwise excellent (salt to taste).<br><br>The fried vegetables were done correctly with a chickpea dough instead of wheat.<br><br>Murgh Salat was very sweet - not offensive - but sweeter than what i want for an evening meal. The mango pulp content made it incredibly sweet - i don&#39;t think any sugar was added. Says something for pakistani mangos, though. Mixed Pakora was good, however, again, the sauce was sweeter than i would have liked. A meat dish will be next.  ...<br><br>Music was not too loud. Bathrooms were private, heated and clean.<br><br>If you had a good experience at this restaurant, please let us know. If you want to thank me for this review, please mark below. Thanks :)",

"reviewcomment":"This modern European bistro is located a few blocks away from where I live. They were also open early. Hence, when we needed brunch, this was a place we decided to try.<br><br>They serve brunch from 8:00 AM to 3:00 PM. They have several types of &#34;breakfast platters&#34; but given the amount of stuff in there, they are more brunch than breakfast. Perhaps I am just used to the idea of a small breakfast, and the things they offer look like lunch to me. <br><br>My companion got the Italian breakfast, which consists of several types of cured meat, cheese, an egg, and many other goodies. I on the other hand got the salmon omelette. They both come with complimentary bread, which definitely looked fresh. <br><br>The food was great, but the drinks were spectacular. I whole-heartedly recommend the &#34;Kaffee al Sheikh&#34; which is this shot of espresso, made with Arabian spices and cardamom. It&#39;s strong, bitter, and they serve it with a glass of water on the side, but it is amazing. It&#39;s a coffee experience. I also recommend the &#34;Karkadee Tee&#34; which I tried the next day, which is a herbal tea made from Egyptian herbs and spices.<br><br>Yes, things were so good here we decided to pay them a visit again the next day. So yes, this place gets 5 stars in my book. It is definitely as good as it gets.",

The food was fresh and tasty , the ambiance cosy, and the service very friendly and willing to speak English (I&#39;m ashamed to say my German was very rusty, but they were gracious and offered English menus). My husband, who is the gluten-free one, had Mediterranean veg for a starter, a side salad and a wonderful sort of reverse-cheese burger (cheese inside a minced-beef patty) with fries. <br><br>We&#34;d be happy to go back....",

They did an incredible job renovating it and turn it into a modern Beergarden &amp; Restaurant at the Schlachtensee.<br>I spent some great evenings sipping their tasty Bowle and chatting with friends the night away over there. But its pretty nice all year long, in winter time they serve hot chocolate and mullet wine to warm you up after a stroll around the lake or even some ice skating if you dare to step on it. During the Weekends it tends to get too packed and you could queue for ages to get a refreshment or a sunny spot. <br> If you look for a &#34;nature break&#34; of Berlin busy city life, take the Sbahn down there and enjoy a chilled glass of Bowle during the summer!",

It&#39;s not personal, or anything to do with her, though. It&#39;s this retarded, buggy &#39;Yelp&#39; system - eliminating many helpful reviews and yet leaving in a review from 2011, from a one-off reviewer.<br><br>{Edit: please also hunt for the mis-categorized  review from &#39;slowfood&#39;. &#39;It&#39;s too sweet/westernized&#39;, goes the review; worth reading. However, given the local community, this is expected. Menu items 108 through 113, are the hot and spicy items. And if you especially want hot and spicy, be sure to ask.}<br><br>Service was good, prompt; much more than can be expected for the city-area generally. This ethnic &#39;proud of my restaurant&#39; shines through. People spoiled on non-local service standards, may easily miss the extra, here, that good service provides.<br><br>The chai was respectable. The salzig lassi could have been saltier; otherwise excellent (salt to taste).<br><br>The fried vegetables were done correctly with a chickpea dough instead of wheat.<br><br>Murgh Salat was very sweet - not offensive - but sweeter than what i want for an evening meal. The mango pulp content made it incredibly sweet - i don&#39;t think any sugar was added. Says something for pakistani mangos, though. Mixed Pakora was good, however, again, the sauce was sweeter than i would have liked. A meat dish will be next.  ...<br><br>Music was not too loud. Bathrooms were private, heated and clean.<br><br>If you had a good experience at this restaurant, please let us know. If you want to thank me for this review, please mark below. Thanks :)",

"reviewcomment":"Well it was late and we were very hungry and we found this place near Alexanderplatz. The menu looks good so we got in however a bouncer asked us our age... We were surprised but we have soon realised that it was a kind of &#34;club restaurant&#34;. There was no place inside so we sat outside, it wasn&#39;t cold because we were given plaids.<br>I got the carambar salad without knowing what it really was (prawns and leaf salad).<br>Quantity was perfect but there was no leaf salad but roquette.<br>It was very dark and very loud. <br>You can&#39;t have a conversation properly here because of the music but food is cheap .<br>One thing we didn&#39;t like was the fact that the bottle of water we ordered came at the very end of the dinner when we were about to pay the bill.<br>However this place is great if you want to eat something good and not very pricey.<br>3 stars for you Carambar !<br><br>Il était tard et nous avions très faim, ce restaurant est tout près de la station Alexanderplatz. Le menu semblait bon et pas très cher.<br>En voulant y entrer un serveur qui gardait la porte (qui s&#39;avère être un videur) nous a demandé notre âge et nous avions vite compris que ça n&#39;était pas un restaurant lambda mais une sorte de boite de nuit restaurant.<br>Nous avions été placé dehors sous un chapiteau car il n&#39;y avait plus de places à l&#39;intérieur et des plaids nous ont été fourni. Il faisait très sombre et très bruyant à cause des nombreux écrans qui passaient des clips musicaux.<br>J&#39;ai pris une salade &#34;Carambar&#34; (11€90) qui consistait en une salade de roquette (même si le menu ne l&#39;indiquait pas) et de grandes crevettes cuisinés à l&#39;huile de sésame. Les quantités sont grandes ce qui est un bon point mais il est difficile de tenir une conversation tellement la musique est forte.<br>Nous n&#39;avions également pas beaucoup apprécié le fait que la bouteille d&#39;eau que nous avons commandé soit arrivé à la fin du repas.",

"reviewcomment":"Rustic, cozy restaurant right next to the Koepenick castle serving traditional Berliner dishes at very reasonable prices. Add outdoor seating, friendly service and micro-brews on tap, you can&#39;t go wrong. The Ratskeller is a basement under the civil hall complete with wooden tables, stained glass windows and Gothic ceilings. <br><br>My parents and I came here for dinner midweek and everyone raved at how delicious their food was. My mom went healthy with a garden salad topped with fresh fruit, grilled chicken and raspberry vinaigrette. <br>My dad chose the pork goulash in beer sauce with red cabbage and bread dumplings. The dumplings were fantastic, first steamed then sautéed crispy, awesome, a meal in itself. <br>The BF chose the beef Sauerbraten in red wine sauce, smoky potato mash and red cabbage. The roast was so tender he was able to fork-shred it.<br>Finally, there are three vegetarian dishes on the menu (somewhat non-German but to my delight) but I chose the Koepenicker Doppeldecker, which was 2 crispy potato roesti (hash browns) topped with graved salmon. The salmon was so tender it melted like butter on the tongue. Awesome dish as well.<br><br>If you&#39;d like to get out of the city center, especially the show-offy and touristy Kurfuerstendamm Area, and eat where the locals eat, this is worth a half hour trip on the S-Bahn. I guarantee it.",

The service was a bit less attentive but the drinks were strong. Kinda wish we&#39;d had dinner there and tried the pizza. It smelled heavenly.

"reviewcomment":"Awesome service. Packed - make reservations. Pakistani food, NOT indian, as the only other english language reviewer, with no &#39;Friends&#39;, and one review, stipulates. It&#39;s not personal, or anything to do with her, though. It&#39;s this retarded, buggy &#39;Yelp&#39; system - eliminating many helpful reviews and yet leaving in a review from 2011, from a one-off reviewer.<br><br>{Edit: please also hunt for the mis-categorized  review from &#39;slowfood&#39;. &#39;It&#39;s too sweet/westernized&#39;, goes the review; worth reading. However, given the local community, this is expected. Menu items 108 through 113, are the hot and spicy items. And if you especially want hot and spicy, be sure to ask.}<br><br>Service was good, prompt; much more than can be expected for the city-area generally. This ethnic &#39;proud of my restaurant&#39; shines through. People spoiled on non-local service standards, may easily miss the extra, here, that good service provides.<br><br>The chai was respectable. The salzig lassi could have been saltier; otherwise excellent (salt to taste).<br><br>The fried vegetables were done correctly with a chickpea dough instead of wheat.<br><br>Murgh Salat was very sweet - not offensive - but sweeter than what i want for an evening meal. The mango pulp content made it incredibly sweet - i don&#39;t think any sugar was added. Says something for pakistani mangos, though. Mixed Pakora was good, however, again, the sauce was sweeter than i would have liked. A meat dish will be next.  ...<br><br>Music was not too loud. Bathrooms were private, heated and clean.<br><br>If you had a good experience at this restaurant, please let us know. If you want to thank me for this review, please mark below. Thanks :)",

"reviewcomment":"We were here for a late dinner yesterday, wanting to try out a new restaurant. So we tried this one, which I have to say, was an experience with good and not so good items. <br><br>Let me start with what I like. I like the design of their menu. Most restaurants (even those serving non-Western cuisine) follow a Western format, beginning with appetizers, a huge main dish section, and some desserts. Saigon Green doesn&#39;t follow that. Instead, they have just a few main dishes, and the bulk of the menu are these small appetizers (Vietnamese-style tapas, so to speak). So what we did last night was order 5 of those for two people, plus drinks. <br><br>Of those 5 dishes, most were very palatable. I loved the very spicy papaya salad, as well as the chicken and vegetable salad and the shrimp fritters. However, what I didn&#39;t like were the dishes that I thought were the staple of every Vietnamese restaurant. Their spring rolls were too dry; yes, there was sauce provided, but I should say it was not enough to mitigate the dryness of the wrapper and the vegetables inside. Also, their bunh bao had too much dough in it. What&#39;s supposed to be a steamed rice mini-bread with meat filling turned out to be just steamed rice mini-bread. I should say I have had better bunh bao elsewhere, notably in that restaurant sharing a part of their name near Görlitzer Bahnhof.<br><br>So, overall, I am giving this place 3 stars. They had good things that doesn&#39;t make me want to not come back here again, but they also had not-so-good things that makes me want to continue and search for other better Vietnamese places.",

"reviewcomment":"This place really should have over 100 reviews but it&#39;s sort of hidden although it&#39;s nearby public transport and around the corner of the Friedrichst. But the street is kinda dark, quiet and looks like there are only flats with nothing note worthy.<br><br>Wellll guess again! It has a hidden bbq spot you really should visit and we&#39;ve had some of the best bbq I&#39;ve known! The meat platter is huge, for €25 you get to choose 3 types of meat and 1 side, real American style. You get a platter with 3 big heaps of meat and a regular sized bowl with whatever side you ordered. <br><br>The staff is very friendly and funny, real cool guys. The atmosphere is very chill and you sit at big tables that you share with other people. The decor is cool too, brick walls, big paint outs of a pig and cow, vintage lamps and chairs. <br><br>I haven&#39;t had that many real bbq in my life so I don&#39;t know if this is the best I&#39;ll ever have but for now it sure is!",

The service was friendly and with a smile which I haven&#39;t experienced before. This could be because its quite close to Messe Berlin so they are used to tips. <br><br>The steak was good though a little gristle-y. They served this with a baked potato and side salad. Germans do potato well, but I don&#39;t think they&#39;ve figured out salad yet. It seems to be considered a random side that you douse with dressing. <br><br>The atmosphere was good - sit outside if you can, though away from the smokers if possible. Good beer and relatively quick service.",

"reviewcomment":"Awesome service. Packed - make reservations. Pakistani food, NOT indian, as the only other english language reviewer, with no &#39;Friends&#39;, and one review, stipulates. It&#39;s not personal, or anything to do with her, though. It&#39;s this retarded, buggy &#39;Yelp&#39; system - eliminating many helpful reviews and yet leaving in a review from 2011, from a one-off reviewer.<br><br>{Edit: please also hunt for the mis-categorized  review from &#39;slowfood&#39;. &#39;It&#39;s too sweet/westernized&#39;, goes the review; worth reading. However, given the local community, this is expected. Menu items 108 through 113, are the hot and spicy items. And if you especially want hot and spicy, be sure to ask.}<br><br>Service was good, prompt; much more than can be expected for the city-area generally. This ethnic &#39;proud of my restaurant&#39; shines through. People spoiled on non-local service standards, may easily miss the extra, here, that good service provides.<br><br>The chai was respectable. The salzig lassi could have been saltier; otherwise excellent (salt to taste).<br><br>The fried vegetables were done correctly with a chickpea dough instead of wheat.<br><br>Murgh Salat was very sweet - not offensive - but sweeter than what i want for an evening meal. The mango pulp content made it incredibly sweet - i don&#39;t think any sugar was added. Says something for pakistani mangos, though. Mixed Pakora was good, however, again, the sauce was sweeter than i would have liked. A meat dish will be next.  ...<br><br>Music was not too loud. Bathrooms were private, heated and clean.<br><br>If you had a good experience at this restaurant, please let us know. If you want to thank me for this review, please mark below. Thanks :)",

"reviewcomment":"Sometimes you sleep in on the first day of your holiday, especially after getting up at 5.30am the morning prior. It&#39;s nothing to be ashamed of, but often we berate ourselves for doing so. &#39;We&#39;re missing bits of the day! There&#39;s so much to see! We can&#39;t justify breakfast at this hour!&#39; Perhaps not, but 1pm is a perfectly feasible time for brunch... and in this case, as opposed to it equalling a meal between breakfast and lunch, it served as a combination of the two.<br><br>Hotly tipped Kültürzeit was the choice we opted for, and boy is this place great value. Not only is it decorated quirkily (you know how I dig this) and set up with a great selection of fun group tables and romantic little mini ones for two (to which they add candles... candles during the day! I love this decadence), you can choose wherever you want to be. Any apprehension we felt at being cheesy tourists at a local place was soon quashed by a) a friendly waitress who spoke to us in English and told us just what to do and b) a loud group of Aussies. We weren&#39;t alone in our rubbishness at German.<br><br>So basically the deal is thus: you pay 8 euros but not until you&#39;re done, and you can attack the brunch buffet as many times as you like. Drinks are on top but this doesn&#39;t hurt in the slightest. I&#39;ve always had a strange relationship with buffets - I love them at parties and in select restaurants, but sometimes they&#39;ve proved godawful. This one was so far from godawful I can&#39;t even begin to heap the hyperbole upon it that it deserves. It had me at this conversation:<br><br>Boyfriend (after nipping up to the buffet for the first round whilst I held the table): Could you test this out and tell me if it&#39;s onion ring or calamari?<br>Me (munched): It&#39;s calamari.<br>Boyfriend (calamari-hater): *Various expletives*<br>Me: And it just happens to be the best calamari I&#39;ve ever tasted.<br><br>Seriously. I think it&#39;s ruined all other calamari for me. Every bit of it. In the world. Never have I not had to chew squid at least a little - this stuff just melted in your mouth. So that was there, piping hot, alongside cous cous, various fish and seafood, scrambled eggs, tuna salad, bean salad, pasta, bread, cheese, cold cuts, chicken, cereals, nutella, jam, piles more... just a brilliantly eclectic range of food that yelled, yeah, this is brunch. Deal with it.<br><br>My first experience of German coffee knocked my socks clean off and the OJ was fresh and refreshing, and goodness me were we set up for the day after that meal. This is the fuel you need for sightseeing, and at less than 10 euros a pop you simply cannot complain!",

The steak way to fatty, the ice with the dessert was the wrong one  but it was the only thing really tasting good. We&#39;ll not go there again, and I wouldn&#39;t recommend it.

"reviewcomment":"This place serves excellent Italian fare. It has its charm and is a place where one can have a long meal with friends and chat the night away. Their service is quite top notch for a little local restaurant in Germany. Personally, I have rarely received good service from any restaurant here, especially in Berlin.The wait staff was very attentive and actually took care of our table, came around with multiple utensils and extras, without us having to ask for new cutlery (which I find is absolutely ridiculous in some restaurants where you are having a few courses). Anyways, I was impressed by their attentiveness. <br><br>The olive oil tasted like the authentic stuff. You know, from the lady across the town in that little corner store, who hoards the flavorful variety. Also nice to note is the FRESH ground pepper. It really makes a difference folks. Combined with the good olive oil, the bread was yummilicious.<br><br>Their pasta is delicious and really rich. I forget what I had, but it was the one with pine nuts, raisins, swiss chard, and penne pasta, covered in a cream sauce. It was the perfect serving size after sharing some appetizers.<br><br>Our table had a bottle of Chianti, a few bottles of water, about 3 beers, 4 cocktails, the classic appetizer dish, and three main courses and the total bill came out to around 80 euros, which I think is ridiculously cheap considering our happy and full bellies, the great conversation, the nice atmosphere, and our slightly buzzed mood. We were fully prepared to conquer our next mission: operation dance dance dance. <br><br>Definitely will be coming back here again. I am not giving the place 5 stars because although the food is pretty good, I still have had better Italian food in Berlin. Also, looking at other tables, the pizza didn&#39;t look so appetizing.",

"reviewcomment":"Every time I visit my former home town of Berlin, I make it a point to stop at Opern Palais for a pot of coffee and a slice (or two) of their delicious cakes. The cafe is very old world European. They have a huge selection of pastries and cakes made in house, the best freshly brewed coffee and a few cafe style menu items such as soups, sandwiches and baked camembert. There is also a beer garden outside. My American friends love this place for its charm. I love it for the cakes! I could literally spend an hour browsing the glass displays without being able to choose!<br><br>The location is right in the historical center of former East Berlin, on the main street connecting the Brandenburg Gate and Alexanderplatz, Unter den Linden. Be sure to stop here on your way for coffee and pastries. It is a little pricey but worth it.",

"reviewcomment":"Awesome service. Packed - make reservations. Pakistani food, NOT indian, as the only other english language reviewer, with no &#39;Friends&#39;, and one review, stipulates. It&#39;s not personal, or anything to do with her, though. It&#39;s this retarded, buggy &#39;Yelp&#39; system - eliminating many helpful reviews and yet leaving in a review from 2011, from a one-off reviewer.<br><br>{Edit: please also hunt for the mis-categorized  review from &#39;slowfood&#39;. &#39;It&#39;s too sweet/westernized&#39;, goes the review; worth reading. However, given the local community, this is expected. Menu items 108 through 113, are the hot and spicy items. And if you especially want hot and spicy, be sure to ask.}<br><br>Service was good, prompt; much more than can be expected for the city-area generally. This ethnic &#39;proud of my restaurant&#39; shines through. People spoiled on non-local service standards, may easily miss the extra, here, that good service provides.<br><br>The chai was respectable. The salzig lassi could have been saltier; otherwise excellent (salt to taste).<br><br>The fried vegetables were done correctly with a chickpea dough instead of wheat.<br><br>Murgh Salat was very sweet - not offensive - but sweeter than what i want for an evening meal. The mango pulp content made it incredibly sweet - i don&#39;t think any sugar was added. Says something for pakistani mangos, though. Mixed Pakora was good, however, again, the sauce was sweeter than i would have liked. A meat dish will be next.  ...<br><br>Music was not too loud. Bathrooms were private, heated and clean.<br><br>If you had a good experience at this restaurant, please let us know. If you want to thank me for this review, please mark below. Thanks :)",

"reviewcomment":"Potatoes potatoes potatoes! Seriously, if you are a spuds fan, this restaurant is for you. I was in Berlin last fall for a work conference and a few of us stopped in here for dinner our first night. Since I didn&#39;t have Yelp Germany to rely on at that time, I had to count on my good friend Google (and Google translate) to help me scope out some spots before we left the states. My co-workers were grateful that I had come prepared and had some idea of the places that were in the vicinity of our hotel and the conference center. This place was the first stop on our list, and it definitely impressed.<br><br>The food seemed to  be typical German fare (based solely on one other prior visit to this fine city). Lots of pork. And endless potatoes, in any variety you could imagine. I went with the roasted pork with saurkraut and potato dumplings. Very filling, and very delicious. <br><br>Aside from the food, this is a good spot just for the interior ambiance. Very cute and homey decor. There were also an interesting variety of eclectic trinkets and wall hangings that kept us entertained throughout the night each time we spotted a new one. <br><br>If you&#39;re looking for something light, you should probably look elsewhere. But, if you&#39;re in the mood fora hearty German meal, look no further, this place will have what you need!",

"reviewcomment":"I managed to try Currywurst on my first night in Berlin, at a real, sit-down restaurant. But the dish initially was sold from small street stands and became popular with construction workers after the war, and I wanted to try Currywurst from one of these stands. At our hotel, we were told the most iconic Currywurst places in Berlin are Curry 36 in the west and Konnopke&#39;s Imbiss in the east.<br><br>We got our Currywurst with casing, and just the curry ketchup on the fries, no mayonnaise. It&#39;s fast food, so the order is ready very quickly and is relatively inexpensive. There&#39;s no seating near the stand, you just eat quickly, standing up at one of the high tables, and then go about your way.<br><br>As far as taste, I think it was delicious. The fries took me back decades to my childhood. Germans use different potatoes than we do in America, and I hadn&#39;t tasted fries like that since I was a kid and lived in Germany.",

Vino e Libri is a real, proper Italian restaurant, which is also why the staff speaks cute broken German. If you speak Italian go ahead and have a chat with them. The menu has a decent size, ranging from pizza and pasta to risotto and fish dishes. They also have a weekly menu with dishes ranging from €5-€10. It is a save place to go if you want good Italian food. The staff is nice here, but once in a while you will get a &#34;grumpy&#34; italian, especially when you come in a bigger group.

It&#39;s not personal, or anything to do with her, though. It&#39;s this retarded, buggy &#39;Yelp&#39; system - eliminating many helpful reviews and yet leaving in a review from 2011, from a one-off reviewer.<br><br>{Edit: please also hunt for the mis-categorized  review from &#39;slowfood&#39;. &#39;It&#39;s too sweet/westernized&#39;, goes the review; worth reading. However, given the local community, this is expected. Menu items 108 through 113, are the hot and spicy items. And if you especially want hot and spicy, be sure to ask.}<br><br>Service was good, prompt; much more than can be expected for the city-area generally. This ethnic &#39;proud of my restaurant&#39; shines through. People spoiled on non-local service standards, may easily miss the extra, here, that good service provides.<br><br>The chai was respectable. The salzig lassi could have been saltier; otherwise excellent (salt to taste).<br><br>The fried vegetables were done correctly with a chickpea dough instead of wheat.<br><br>Murgh Salat was very sweet - not offensive - but sweeter than what i want for an evening meal. The mango pulp content made it incredibly sweet - i don&#39;t think any sugar was added. Says something for pakistani mangos, though. Mixed Pakora was good, however, again, the sauce was sweeter than i would have liked. A meat dish will be next.  ...<br><br>Music was not too loud. Bathrooms were private, heated and clean.<br><br>If you had a good experience at this restaurant, please let us know. If you want to thank me for this review, please mark below. Thanks :)",

Because it was late, the restaurant wasn&#39;t full, and we immediately found an empty table.<br><br>I ordered the No. 42, which according to the English description in the trilingual menu, was a platter of the eternally turning skewer of meat. My companion on the other hand ordered something else; the plate looked pretty, but I didn&#39;t try it. My platter on the other hand came with a lot of meat, and some bread, or was that bread? Underneath the meat?<br><br>We both ordered the ayran, which is a yoghurt drink. It&#39;s a little saltier than the Indian lassi; I almost wanted to put sugar in it. But it was good too.<br><br>I am glad I had a good experience here; Hasir is a restaurant with at least 3 different branches in the city, and I had a bad experience with the one in Kreuzberg.

"reviewcomment":"Awesome service. Packed - make reservations. Pakistani food, NOT indian, as the only other english language reviewer, with no &#39;Friends&#39;, and one review, stipulates. It&#39;s not personal, or anything to do with her, though. It&#39;s this retarded, buggy &#39;Yelp&#39; system - eliminating many helpful reviews and yet leaving in a review from 2011, from a one-off reviewer.<br><br>{Edit: please also hunt for the mis-categorized  review from &#39;slowfood&#39;. &#39;It&#39;s too sweet/westernized&#39;, goes the review; worth reading. However, given the local community, this is expected. Menu items 108 through 113, are the hot and spicy items. And if you especially want hot and spicy, be sure to ask.}<br><br>Service was good, prompt; much more than can be expected for the city-area generally. This ethnic &#39;proud of my restaurant&#39; shines through. People spoiled on non-local service standards, may easily miss the extra, here, that good service provides.<br><br>The chai was respectable. The salzig lassi could have been saltier; otherwise excellent (salt to taste).<br><br>The fried vegetables were done correctly with a chickpea dough instead of wheat.<br><br>Murgh Salat was very sweet - not offensive - but sweeter than what i want for an evening meal. The mango pulp content made it incredibly sweet - i don&#39;t think any sugar was added. Says something for pakistani mangos, though. Mixed Pakora was good, however, again, the sauce was sweeter than i would have liked. A meat dish will be next.  ...<br><br>Music was not too loud. Bathrooms were private, heated and clean.<br><br>If you had a good experience at this restaurant, please let us know. If you want to thank me for this review, please mark below. Thanks :)",

It was warm, cosy, welcoming and everyone spoke Italian, which was useful (beuacuse my Italian is a thousand times better than my German).

"reviewcomment":"Wow. Vux is located a short walk from my flat and I am astounded it has taken me this long to finally try it.<br><br>The verdict: nothing short of amazing. The bagel sandwiches are reasonably priced and loaded with all sorts of goodies. Mine came with seitan, a spicy-fruit habanero-mango sauce, veggies and fake cheese. It was perfectly spicy and filling, and a complete step up from the generic &#34;bagel with hummus and sprouts&#34; that I&#39;m typically limited to in American cafes.<br><br>The coffee I had along with my meal was normal, which means it was good, and came with a small coconut-y cookie, which pleased me, because normally I can&#39;t eat the cookies that come with coffee. <br><br>For dessert I had a chocolate cupcake with peanut butter frosting. For the pricetag of 2,50 the cupcake itself was pretty standard - similar to every vegan cupcake I&#39;ve tried or made. But the frosting was out-of-this-world delicious. I think frosting shots are stupid but I totally would have bought one if Vux sold them.<br><br>The location itself is great. Small and cozy and clean inside, with a couple additional tables outside on a quiet street. The only thing keeping this cafe from five stars are subsequent visits.",

But at lunch time when the sun is shining, then it is really great. And it does taste too! The view from the boat and the moving vibrations of the boat are unique. There are often very long waiting times at lunch time because they don&#39;t have enough staff on board.<br>Video link: <a href='/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DBo9woO3-2EM&amp;s=119be9a44cc0f8ac6f706395391dd6e97f63dcc2051225c638f6d4e1d20a57ad' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>youtube.com/watch?v=Bo9w…</a>",

"reviewcomment":"Went there for lunch, ended up ordering so much food it looked more like dinner! And we loved it! <br>It&#39;s pretty cheap as well, between 3-6 euro each dish, and the portions are so big! <br>Personally I found the ajoli a little strange, but my boyfriend loved it, so I guess it&#39;s a matter of taste. <br>The atmosphere is great, it&#39;s very relaxing, and not stuck up. Hate that about restaurants, but this one is great. <br>Can really recomand the chorizo, the fried one on page two on the menu. so good and spicy. The wine is also very good, bread perfect ( that says a lot about the place, bad bread, usually bad food) <br>The potetoes isn&#39;t the best I&#39;ve had, but then again, we ate them all, so they worn&#39;t bad! haha!<br>It&#39;s located in a great area as well, and if you like tapas, I can really recommend this one!",

"reviewcomment":"A very cute shabby chic cafe with lots of outdoor seating on sunny days, as well as ample seating indoors. <br><br>There are vegetarian options but not the best for Vegan at breakfast time as there is a lot of egg and cheese. They serve coffee and honestly my only complaint was the fact that it was bitter (but not worth docking a star). There is a display cooler with lots delicious looking divine treats and baked goods, as well as some bottle drink options. The hubby had egg sandwich for 3 Euro and I had a 3 egg scramble with cheese and added tomato with a small bread for 3 Euro, can&#39;t beat those prices especially when the food was good and served with a smile.<br><br>Both times we went we had no problems ordering as the lovely ladies spoke English (I really need to work on my German).",

"reviewcomment":"The Cafe Hardenberg. Yes. Spacious with some flair. Being opposite of the Uni and near the Art Uni as well it is every time when I go packed or near packed, Sunday afternoon being worst. The food is not bad and not so expensive, but I am a person who eats there breakfast or have just a &#34;Milchkaffee&#34;, which comes Berliner style in what in other places is used as a soup bowl and to soak it up you get a cookie with it. I never asked, but the calories of that in itself might actually equal a bowl of soup, the thing is rather filling, but then again I am not sure if one should count it as an actual &#34;meal&#34;?<br>The place is stretched over two floors, and has palm trees and shabby red velvet seats along the walls, where the shabby-ness is very essential to contribute to the flair. It has a great counter bar that reminds of Paris in the 1900&#39;s. It also has a huge mirror on one wall, so it seems even bigger than it already is. It has at some extremely attractive and at the same time annoyingly vain waitresses and once and a while same style waiters, so if you like that it is a great place to try your flirting skills, if you don&#39;t like that, well... the obvious, don&#39;t go there.<br>It has all in all an interesting atmosphere to hang out and be seen, and if you are young and pretty yourself you can sit there and after at least 20 minutes some eager guy will ask you if there is a seat free at your table, so that is not bad on a rainy cold afternoon on Berlin. Sadly, if you are not that young any longer this phenomena drizzles out, I guess there are other places then. On the other hand, once a boyfriend at the time was very pissed off with me, as I had waited for him there and one guy had asked to sit at my table, as the rest of the Cafe was totally packed (see above, Sunday...), so you can also get in trouble for the same thing, but maybe your boyfriend is not so possessive. <br>There are better avant-garde places in town, but for the relatively posh area this one will do to write on your novel and have a coffee with it, or to just sit there with only the coffee and no novel, and look great doing so.",

"reviewcomment":"Awesome service. Packed - make reservations. Pakistani food, NOT indian, as the only other english language reviewer, with no &#39;Friends&#39;, and one review, stipulates. It&#39;s not personal, or anything to do with her, though. It&#39;s this retarded, buggy &#39;Yelp&#39; system - eliminating many helpful reviews and yet leaving in a review from 2011, from a one-off reviewer.<br><br>{Edit: please also hunt for the mis-categorized  review from &#39;slowfood&#39;. &#39;It&#39;s too sweet/westernized&#39;, goes the review; worth reading. However, given the local community, this is expected. Menu items 108 through 113, are the hot and spicy items. And if you especially want hot and spicy, be sure to ask.}<br><br>Service was good, prompt; much more than can be expected for the city-area generally. This ethnic &#39;proud of my restaurant&#39; shines through. People spoiled on non-local service standards, may easily miss the extra, here, that good service provides.<br><br>The chai was respectable. The salzig lassi could have been saltier; otherwise excellent (salt to taste).<br><br>The fried vegetables were done correctly with a chickpea dough instead of wheat.<br><br>Murgh Salat was very sweet - not offensive - but sweeter than what i want for an evening meal. The mango pulp content made it incredibly sweet - i don&#39;t think any sugar was added. Says something for pakistani mangos, though. Mixed Pakora was good, however, again, the sauce was sweeter than i would have liked. A meat dish will be next.  ...<br><br>Music was not too loud. Bathrooms were private, heated and clean.<br><br>If you had a good experience at this restaurant, please let us know. If you want to thank me for this review, please mark below. Thanks :)",

"reviewcomment":"I was here with a companion yesterday for lunch. I was interested in what they offer since most of the South Asian restaurants I find here in Berlin are so tame and non-spicy at all, as they taper the taste to the German palates. So I didn&#39;t have high expectations of this place.<br><br>Anyway, when we got there, the place was not crowded at all, but we can see several tables marked reserved, and I suppose that was a good sign. I ordered a vegetarian aubergine curry, as well as a mango lassi. My companion on the other hand ordered some samosas and a lentil curry. <br><br>They gave us some of those crisp wafers for appetizers. The sauce was hot and spicy. That was a good sign. I almost wanted to order a portion of raita to cool things down, but my mango lassi did the trick as well. I liked the eggplant as well as the spiced coconut that came with it. My companion didn&#39;t like the samosas too much, however. <br><br>Overall, I am giving this place 4 stars, because for the first time, I found a place that serves spicy food. However, their service needs improvement. But then again this is Europe, customer service isn&#39;t on par with that in North America. So expect a little bit of a delay when you finally decided what you want to order and want to tell it to the waiter.",

"reviewcomment":"Awesome service. Packed - make reservations. Pakistani food, NOT indian, as the only other english language reviewer, with no &#39;Friends&#39;, and one review, stipulates. It&#39;s not personal, or anything to do with her, though. It&#39;s this retarded, buggy &#39;Yelp&#39; system - eliminating many helpful reviews and yet leaving in a review from 2011, from a one-off reviewer.<br><br>{Edit: please also hunt for the mis-categorized  review from &#39;slowfood&#39;. &#39;It&#39;s too sweet/westernized&#39;, goes the review; worth reading. However, given the local community, this is expected. Menu items 108 through 113, are the hot and spicy items. And if you especially want hot and spicy, be sure to ask.}<br><br>Service was good, prompt; much more than can be expected for the city-area generally. This ethnic &#39;proud of my restaurant&#39; shines through. People spoiled on non-local service standards, may easily miss the extra, here, that good service provides.<br><br>The chai was respectable. The salzig lassi could have been saltier; otherwise excellent (salt to taste).<br><br>The fried vegetables were done correctly with a chickpea dough instead of wheat.<br><br>Murgh Salat was very sweet - not offensive - but sweeter than what i want for an evening meal. The mango pulp content made it incredibly sweet - i don&#39;t think any sugar was added. Says something for pakistani mangos, though. Mixed Pakora was good, however, again, the sauce was sweeter than i would have liked. A meat dish will be next.  ...<br><br>Music was not too loud. Bathrooms were private, heated and clean.<br><br>If you had a good experience at this restaurant, please let us know. If you want to thank me for this review, please mark below. Thanks :)",

"reviewcomment":"Quiet family island... Not far from railwaystation Tiergarten. In a very green area, around - a big park or even forest in the middle of the city. Most amaizing things - rabbits which are looking around for some delicious food as well as visitors. <br>Most interesting that they are open until 2.00 am! Good place for a family with candles on the tables, a room for children with different toys and even a small billiard which is used also by older visitors. The whole room is devided into different sections on different levels so you really can enjoy the calm athmosphere without seeing many peoples. <br>I give to the place 4 stars because the prices where are a little bit high - eg about 3 euro for a small glass of tee or a normal dish for 10-12 euro especially for a place situated not in a tourist area without distinct cuisine positioning. Everything is delicious but I would say nothing special. I took rice sate one day and big potatoe with mushrooms the other day but I would say that I was shaken, so the cuisine is good for everyday eating but not with their prices. <br>Summing up - good place for family or couples, quiet, big, but without any special zest.",

"reviewcomment":"Living nearby my husband and I enjoy dining here, however, the service can be very nice and plain awful.  Last time we were there, a tall blond lady treated us and a guest very rudely. An example of her patronizing demeanor that evening was, when we asked for extra plates to share appetizers and were told that the bread plates should suffice.   I&#39;d like to think that  a restaurant that holds itself to<br>a certain standard would  not have a shortage of dinnerware. <br>The food is always pleasant and we enjoy the small but thought through menu. I do agree, however, with another reviewer who mentioned that sometimes they mix in too many ingredients.",

"reviewcomment":"One of the best meals I&#39;ve had in Berlin. Absolutely perfect in every way. I came with a party of 6, we were seated immediately and met with very friendly service right away. We ordered some calamari, the appetizer sampler and some carpaccio. Everything was nothing short of incredible. The wine was delicious, they didn&#39;t make any fuss about bringing 6 hungry guys bread every 20 seconds as we inhaled it.<br><br>For the main I ordered the farfalle with salsiccia. it was so good! Al dente house-made pasta (very fresh anyway, if not house-made), seasoned and sauced perfectly, and just the right amount. I&#39;m a big eater and this left me in great shape, not too stuffed, not wanting more.<br><br>I tried my friend&#39;s calzone which was so nice and perfectly spicy. Very well made. <br><br>The ambience is nice, the music selection is incredible (this was one of the main points of the guy in our group who took us here), and the service was fast and friendly. Prices are definitely decent. It&#39;s not the cheapest night out, but for 3 apps, 6 mains, 3 bottles of great wine and a bottle of sparkling water we ended up at €35 each. Pretty damn good, I think!<br><br>Highly recommend this place. Good for dates and small groups, though not a place to be loud and wildly festive.",

There is a wide selection of vegetarian dishes, and although there is a sign saying &#39;Vegetarian Mexican&#39; there are still some meat dishes.<br>As well as a wide choice of food, there are alos loads of cocktails to choose from. Happy hour runs til 2am (like many bars in this area) and the cocktails are actually really decent. They are freshly prepared, have huge pieces of fruit (bananas, pineapple) as decorations. They taste delicious and aren&#39;t stingy on the alcohol content.<br>The waiter we had was amazing, making jokes with us because one cocktail took longer to make than the others, and had a chat with us at the end.<br>Overall a really good find, I&#39;m definitely going back!",

"reviewcomment":"Awesome service. Packed - make reservations. Pakistani food, NOT indian, as the only other english language reviewer, with no &#39;Friends&#39;, and one review, stipulates. It&#39;s not personal, or anything to do with her, though. It&#39;s this retarded, buggy &#39;Yelp&#39; system - eliminating many helpful reviews and yet leaving in a review from 2011, from a one-off reviewer.<br><br>{Edit: please also hunt for the mis-categorized  review from &#39;slowfood&#39;. &#39;It&#39;s too sweet/westernized&#39;, goes the review; worth reading. However, given the local community, this is expected. Menu items 108 through 113, are the hot and spicy items. And if you especially want hot and spicy, be sure to ask.}<br><br>Service was good, prompt; much more than can be expected for the city-area generally. This ethnic &#39;proud of my restaurant&#39; shines through. People spoiled on non-local service standards, may easily miss the extra, here, that good service provides.<br><br>The chai was respectable. The salzig lassi could have been saltier; otherwise excellent (salt to taste).<br><br>The fried vegetables were done correctly with a chickpea dough instead of wheat.<br><br>Murgh Salat was very sweet - not offensive - but sweeter than what i want for an evening meal. The mango pulp content made it incredibly sweet - i don&#39;t think any sugar was added. Says something for pakistani mangos, though. Mixed Pakora was good, however, again, the sauce was sweeter than i would have liked. A meat dish will be next.  ...<br><br>Music was not too loud. Bathrooms were private, heated and clean.<br><br>If you had a good experience at this restaurant, please let us know. If you want to thank me for this review, please mark below. Thanks :)",

Die Spezialität des Hauses oder Kumpir ist eine Ofenkartoffel mit Butter und Käse, zu der man viele diverse Salate bestellen kann, die dann auf die Kartoffel als Topping kommen. Es gibt: Couscous, Karottensalat, Nudelsalat, russischen Salat (der eigentlich nicht wirklich russisch ist, da andere Zutaten wie grüne Erbsen, Würstchen, Salzgurken etc fehlen), Mais, Oliven, türkische Würstchen, Pepperoni und vieles mehr. Das ganze kostet nur EUR3,90 und ist gerade für den Wedding angemessen. Die Ofenkartoffel gibt es auch außer Haus und die nehme ich häufig mit. <br>Allerdings lässt der Service zu wünschen übrig. Ich habe dort früher immer Köfte zum mitnehmen bestellt und habe jedes Mal deutlich gesagt, dass ich den Salat ohne Dressing und die Pommes ohne Mayo haben möchte. Das wurde zwar an die Küche so weitergegeben, wurde von der Küche wiederum nicht umgesetzt. Ich bekam dann die Speise natürlich mit Mayo und den Salat mit Dressing. Und jedes Mal, als ich die Bedienung darauf hinwies, gab es zunächst lange Diskussionen mit der Küche etc. und ich musste weiterhin auf mein Essen warten. Schade darum<br>Aber da die Ofenkartoffeln immer vorne zubereitet werden, kann man vor Ort bestimmen, welche Toppings man auf der Kartoffel haben möchte. <br>Für mich kein Köfte mehr, aber definitiv wieder Kumpir!",

The salzig lassi could have been saltier; otherwise excellent (salt to taste).<br><br>The fried vegetables were done correctly with a chickpea dough instead of wheat.<br><br>Murgh Salat was very sweet - not offensive - but sweeter than what i want for an evening meal. The mango pulp content made it incredibly sweet - i don&#39;t think any sugar was added. Says something for pakistani mangos, though. Mixed Pakora was good, however, again, the sauce was sweeter than i would have liked. A meat dish will be next.  ...<br><br>Music was not too loud.

Clean, sparkly, plenty of outside tables, counter service, lovely light menu and desserts...it&#39;s calling your name! <br><br>I had just finished a massage at Schoenerie (across the street) and wasn&#39;t quite ready to head back home and tend to my chores. IN fact I was walking around like a noodle, dazed. Need some coffee! I spied Kaffee Raum and popped in quietly, took a seat at a plush green couch in the corner, settled up with a good book....<br><br>A bowl of Cafe Au Lait (a bowl! I love it...) and the eggs, bacon and toast plate was just perfect. A light little brunch that left me full, but not feeling heavy. A quiet place to read (it seems a lot of readers cluster inside!) and polite service.<br><br>I returned again for a breakfast meeting a few days later, and enjoyed their outside seating, sunshine, the Fitness Fruhstuck (I liked the one at Alpenstuck Backeri a bit better) which was nice...and another bowl o&#39; coffee. Cheers all around... <br><br>Definitely a lovely cafe. A part of the coffee rounds (Grounds?) from now on. :)",

I even bought the Mensa card though I am only a visitor to get even cheaper prices. <br>The quality of the food is excellent and there is always a choice for vegans and vegetarians. <br>It&#39;s very clean. The system to give the trays back is also very practical and the people that work in all the services are really kind. Only the ones at the cafeteria rush you a bit when there&#39;s a long queue.

They provided what may have been some of the worst hamburgers I&#39;ve ever tasted. They don&#39;t ask you how you want your hamburger cooked and so you get it cooked well-done. <br><br>I should thank them though, because I&#39;d never suffered the experience of truly tasteless french fries and they were kind enough to serve me up a portion. Finally that ketchup is that weird sweet marinara sauce style German ketchup which is just not very good. This review is really for Americans. I&#39;m a New Yorker who loves Berlin and really enjoys the food there, but I recommend not eating the German version of American food, unless you are not looking for American food. The one saving grace is the cook who was exceptionally nice.",

We ordered our food eggs Benedict with ham and fried eggs with Texas style sausage links and hashbrowns (which I ordered extra crispy but that didn&#39;t work out)  apart from that the food tasted great and to go along with it I ordered a extra spicy bloddy marry and that was great. The place still needs some work but it kind of goes with the theme I guess but the service we received was really really good. Surprisingly I&#39;m already looking forward to going back and trying the rest of the menu. <br><br>Must try in my eyes... Enjoy",

It&#39;s not personal, or anything to do with her, though. It&#39;s this retarded, buggy &#39;Yelp&#39; system - eliminating many helpful reviews and yet leaving in a review from 2011, from a one-off reviewer.<br><br>{Edit: please also hunt for the mis-categorized  review from &#39;slowfood&#39;. &#39;It&#39;s too sweet/westernized&#39;, goes the review; worth reading. However, given the local community, this is expected. Menu items 108 through 113, are the hot and spicy items. And if you especially want hot and spicy, be sure to ask.}<br><br>Service was good, prompt; much more than can be expected for the city-area generally. This ethnic &#39;proud of my restaurant&#39; shines through. People spoiled on non-local service standards, may easily miss the extra, here, that good service provides.<br><br>The chai was respectable. The salzig lassi could have been saltier; otherwise excellent (salt to taste).<br><br>The fried vegetables were done correctly with a chickpea dough instead of wheat.<br><br>Murgh Salat was very sweet - not offensive - but sweeter than what i want for an evening meal. The mango pulp content made it incredibly sweet - i don&#39;t think any sugar was added. Says something for pakistani mangos, though. Mixed Pakora was good, however, again, the sauce was sweeter than i would have liked. A meat dish will be next.  ...<br><br>Music was not too loud. Bathrooms were private, heated and clean.<br><br>If you had a good experience at this restaurant, please let us know. If you want to thank me for this review, please mark below. Thanks :)",

"reviewcomment":"I met up with a companion here for some coffee after work. The weather was nice so we opted to sit outside, watching people pass by while chatting away. <br><br>I don&#39;t think I can give more than 3 stars for this place. The furniture was nice; this place has major retro style, with old chairs, old atmosphere, old ambiance. But perhaps the staff was old as well, because we waited more than 10 minutes outside and nobody came to take our order, even though we were clearly visible through the window.<br><br>So, ten minutes waiting, and my companion already just couldn&#39;t wait so he went inside and placed our order at the bar. Note that the place wasn&#39;t busy at all. Anyway, our coffees arrived, and somehow, the moment we finished them, then the staff came out and asked if we wanted another one. We said no. <br><br>Overall, the place is nice, but it&#39;s lacking in other aspects. The staff needs to fix their timing skills. This is primarily a drinks-only place, so don&#39;t expect any substantial food here, except for those that are typically eaten to accompany or amplify drinking.",

They also have breakfast here, but I would rate it as average (with a star for the toast on avocado). The prices are ok, can even be cheap if you order a panini. Th eggs florentine are great (especially with a side order of avocado!). The pancakes disappointed me though, the serving size is pretty small and will leave you hungry. The toast on avocado is more american sized though and yummy! All in all the menu is not that big, but if you&#39;re craving eggs and/or avocado they have great options. If you like both you need to do a DIY order, but I think we can all handle that. I was not able to do any desserts, but the carrot cake looked delicious.",

"reviewcomment":"Awesome service. Packed - make reservations. Pakistani food, NOT indian, as the only other english language reviewer, with no &#39;Friends&#39;, and one review, stipulates. It&#39;s not personal, or anything to do with her, though. It&#39;s this retarded, buggy &#39;Yelp&#39; system - eliminating many helpful reviews and yet leaving in a review from 2011, from a one-off reviewer.<br><br>{Edit: please also hunt for the mis-categorized  review from &#39;slowfood&#39;. &#39;It&#39;s too sweet/westernized&#39;, goes the review; worth reading. However, given the local community, this is expected. Menu items 108 through 113, are the hot and spicy items. And if you especially want hot and spicy, be sure to ask.}<br><br>Service was good, prompt; much more than can be expected for the city-area generally. This ethnic &#39;proud of my restaurant&#39; shines through. People spoiled on non-local service standards, may easily miss the extra, here, that good service provides.<br><br>The chai was respectable. The salzig lassi could have been saltier; otherwise excellent (salt to taste).<br><br>The fried vegetables were done correctly with a chickpea dough instead of wheat.<br><br>Murgh Salat was very sweet - not offensive - but sweeter than what i want for an evening meal. The mango pulp content made it incredibly sweet - i don&#39;t think any sugar was added. Says something for pakistani mangos, though. Mixed Pakora was good, however, again, the sauce was sweeter than i would have liked. A meat dish will be next.  ...<br><br>Music was not too loud. Bathrooms were private, heated and clean.<br><br>If you had a good experience at this restaurant, please let us know. If you want to thank me for this review, please mark below. Thanks :)",

It may look small from the outside, but it is actually quite commodious on the inside, and it also exudes a warm environment.<br><br>The servers are quick to welcome guests, and they also speak English! Which is great because my German did not get me very far, but they still went ahead and tried to converse with me in German! (Good for practicing!)<br><br>I had the lambrusco wine, and I am generally not a fan of wine, but this was really good! And it was a little over 4 Euros for 0,25L, not too bad. (: I also ordered the spaghetti with bacon and egg. The proportion was really good, and the price was only about 7,50 Euros. This DEFINITELY beats most Italian restaurants I have been to in California -- especially Olive Garden!!<br><br>I really enjoyed my service and meal here.

"reviewcomment":"I walked in by chance, and I was lucky! I had carrot-orange soup and a redbeet spread with dark bread as a welcome (excellent), and then I ordered a veal consommé and a wiener schnitzel. The consommé was good and very well presented. The veal schnitzel was thin with a puffy crust, what a sight!<br>Although it was a little salty, it was very good. Two sides (potato salad and cucumber salad) were really good as well.<br>I would have given 5 stars, but the schnitzel was a bit too salty for that!",

"reviewcomment":"Discovered this place after my visit to Anne Frank Zentrum nearby. It is a small shop that serves different variety of sausages. There is no seat but two high tables to stand around when eating.<br><br>Normally I don&#39;t allow ketchup to touch my food. But this? Exception:) I had quite a few  currywursts during my short stay in Germany. This stall made them tastier. I ordered Berliner currywurst (€2.50) and boy, it is so yummy! Love the combination of the tangy sweet ketchup with a hint of curry and the savoury taste of the wurst! I almost ordered one more but in the end, I decide not to waste my calorie intake on the same food. So I ordered bockwurst instead. It is cooked by steaming instead of the usual grilling for the other sausages. This is tad saltier with a smoked taste, served with mustard. <br><br>Great for on-the-go or those feeling a little peckish:)",

"reviewcomment":"Awesome service. Packed - make reservations. Pakistani food, NOT indian, as the only other english language reviewer, with no &#39;Friends&#39;, and one review, stipulates. It&#39;s not personal, or anything to do with her, though. It&#39;s this retarded, buggy &#39;Yelp&#39; system - eliminating many helpful reviews and yet leaving in a review from 2011, from a one-off reviewer.<br><br>{Edit: please also hunt for the mis-categorized  review from &#39;slowfood&#39;. &#39;It&#39;s too sweet/westernized&#39;, goes the review; worth reading. However, given the local community, this is expected. Menu items 108 through 113, are the hot and spicy items. And if you especially want hot and spicy, be sure to ask.}<br><br>Service was good, prompt; much more than can be expected for the city-area generally. This ethnic &#39;proud of my restaurant&#39; shines through. People spoiled on non-local service standards, may easily miss the extra, here, that good service provides.<br><br>The chai was respectable. The salzig lassi could have been saltier; otherwise excellent (salt to taste).<br><br>The fried vegetables were done correctly with a chickpea dough instead of wheat.<br><br>Murgh Salat was very sweet - not offensive - but sweeter than what i want for an evening meal. The mango pulp content made it incredibly sweet - i don&#39;t think any sugar was added. Says something for pakistani mangos, though. Mixed Pakora was good, however, again, the sauce was sweeter than i would have liked. A meat dish will be next.  ...<br><br>Music was not too loud. Bathrooms were private, heated and clean.<br><br>If you had a good experience at this restaurant, please let us know. If you want to thank me for this review, please mark below. Thanks :)",

"reviewcomment":"Awesome service. Packed - make reservations. Pakistani food, NOT indian, as the only other english language reviewer, with no &#39;Friends&#39;, and one review, stipulates. It&#39;s not personal, or anything to do with her, though. It&#39;s this retarded, buggy &#39;Yelp&#39; system - eliminating many helpful reviews and yet leaving in a review from 2011, from a one-off reviewer.<br><br>{Edit: please also hunt for the mis-categorized  review from &#39;slowfood&#39;. &#39;It&#39;s too sweet/westernized&#39;, goes the review; worth reading. However, given the local community, this is expected. Menu items 108 through 113, are the hot and spicy items. And if you especially want hot and spicy, be sure to ask.}<br><br>Service was good, prompt; much more than can be expected for the city-area generally. This ethnic &#39;proud of my restaurant&#39; shines through. People spoiled on non-local service standards, may easily miss the extra, here, that good service provides.<br><br>The chai was respectable. The salzig lassi could have been saltier; otherwise excellent (salt to taste).<br><br>The fried vegetables were done correctly with a chickpea dough instead of wheat.<br><br>Murgh Salat was very sweet - not offensive - but sweeter than what i want for an evening meal. The mango pulp content made it incredibly sweet - i don&#39;t think any sugar was added. Says something for pakistani mangos, though. Mixed Pakora was good, however, again, the sauce was sweeter than i would have liked. A meat dish will be next.  ...<br><br>Music was not too loud. Bathrooms were private, heated and clean.<br><br>If you had a good experience at this restaurant, please let us know. If you want to thank me for this review, please mark below. Thanks :)",

"reviewcomment":"While walking through Kreuzberg for the first time the other day, I stumbled upon Görlitzer park, and then in the park I spotted this interesting looking building with people chilling out on deckchairs out the front. Upon closer inspection the place was called das edelweiss and is a cafe serving all sorts of breakfasts, which was handy seeing as I&#39;d not yet had any breakfast!<br><br> Inside it was more designed and cool than I was expecting it to be (you should see the state of the surrounding park). One other very noticeable thing was the number of dogs that they had around (there were 4). When someone walks in with a dog, someone will often bring over a dish with water for the dog! I guess you shouldn&#39;t come here if you don&#39;t like dogs :p<br><br> I ordered a standard cheese/meat/fruit/bread breakfast and was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the ingredients that they used, especially the meats.<br><br> There is free wifi, but unfortunately the guy working when I was in didn&#39;t know the password. Organisation fail. Oh well, I didn&#39;t actually need any internet.",

"reviewcomment":"Simply the best Italian food I ever had... The meal commenced with Chianti and olives... Next, we enjoyed the steak carpaccio (which was momentarily baked with black truffles and parmesan cheese.)  We also also had the roasted white asparagus au gratin. (Spargel).  This was paired with a small salad and Schinken.  As an entrée, we had two variations of the pork platter; one with wine sauce, the other was lemon sauce.  This was accompanied by roasted rosemary potatoes, broccoli, and carrots.<br><br>Our waiter deserves an A+ for service, hospitality, and humor.  He was passionate about the food, and perfectly accommodating.  The interior and exterior are charming.  A Moto Guzzi theme... Absolutely perfect!!   We will be back.",

"reviewcomment":"Awesome service. Packed - make reservations. Pakistani food, NOT indian, as the only other english language reviewer, with no &#39;Friends&#39;, and one review, stipulates. It&#39;s not personal, or anything to do with her, though. It&#39;s this retarded, buggy &#39;Yelp&#39; system - eliminating many helpful reviews and yet leaving in a review from 2011, from a one-off reviewer.<br><br>{Edit: please also hunt for the mis-categorized  review from &#39;slowfood&#39;. &#39;It&#39;s too sweet/westernized&#39;, goes the review; worth reading. However, given the local community, this is expected. Menu items 108 through 113, are the hot and spicy items. And if you especially want hot and spicy, be sure to ask.}<br><br>Service was good, prompt; much more than can be expected for the city-area generally. This ethnic &#39;proud of my restaurant&#39; shines through. People spoiled on non-local service standards, may easily miss the extra, here, that good service provides.<br><br>The chai was respectable. The salzig lassi could have been saltier; otherwise excellent (salt to taste).<br><br>The fried vegetables were done correctly with a chickpea dough instead of wheat.<br><br>Murgh Salat was very sweet - not offensive - but sweeter than what i want for an evening meal. The mango pulp content made it incredibly sweet - i don&#39;t think any sugar was added. Says something for pakistani mangos, though. Mixed Pakora was good, however, again, the sauce was sweeter than i would have liked. A meat dish will be next.  ...<br><br>Music was not too loud. Bathrooms were private, heated and clean.<br><br>If you had a good experience at this restaurant, please let us know. If you want to thank me for this review, please mark below. Thanks :)",

"reviewcomment":"Alarabi is a quaint and comfortable restaurant in the heart of Friedrichshain, serving a delicious array of Middle Eastern dishes, along with an extensive cocktail menu and a smaller but still very respectable roster of shishas.<br><br>On a pleasant summer evening, I was drawn to Alarabi by the clean, uncrowded outdoor seating and the specials board which listed dishes that went beyond the usual Berlin fare. The presence of a stuffed squid dish especially drew my eye. The outdoor seating is directly on the sidewalk; however, the sidewalk is wide enough that pedestrians and al fresco diners can share it without much nuisance. The picnic-like tables and chairs were clean and decorated with pots of flowers in various states of vitality. Later in the evening, when the sun went down, staff replaced the flowerpots with candles--a nice touch. The restaurant sits directly across the street from the popular Boxhagenerplatz municipal park, which makes it a prime spot for people-watching.<br><br>Visitors from the U.S. who dine out in Germany are accustomed to adjusting their expectations of service. I am pleased to say that at Alarabi no such lowering of expectations is necessary. A few minutes after I took my seat, a smiling server appeared with a menu and asked for my drink order. About five minutes later, she took my food order. The food arrived about ten minutes after that. And so on. Two servers attended the diners eating outside, and rarely did much time go by without seeing one. Both were friendly and competent.<br><br>The menu includes a range of mezze--Middle Eastern appetizers such as hummus, mohammara (a paprika-walnut dip), eggplant dip, chicken skewers, etc. You can also order a variety of mezze in combinations designed for either one or two diners.<br><br>I briefly contemplated this option but then opted for the chicken shawarma. This is a fairly standard dish that one will find offered by food vendors all over Berlin. What made this particular version stand out was the description in the menu: this shawarma was made with poulard breast.<br><br>Poulard is not a very common ingredient in the U.S.; in any case, I had never encountered it until I came to Berlin for the first time several years ago. A poulard is a hen that has been spayed. The spaying process makes the hen&#39;s flesh fattier, juicier, and more tender.<br><br>So this shawarma was going to be a cut above.<br><br>The platter came to my table and made a stunning impression. The food was beautifully plated and included: a generous swirl of hummus drizzled with olive oil; eggplant dip decorated with six plump red currants on top; a glorious pile of dark green tabbouleh salad; and of course, about twelve strips of succulent, crisp-skinned poulard breast nestled in a small pool of thin yogurt.<br><br>The chicken shawarma was a knockout. It combined the fatty tenderness usually only found in dark meat with the mild, delicate flavor of chicken breast. The skin stayed perfectly crispy even as the chicken mingled with the slightly tangy yogurt.<br><br>The hummus was good, presentable, and relatively light, but not otherwise remarkable. It was certainly tasty enough to scoop up every bit of it with a few of the provided slices of thin pita bread, though, which is exactly what I did.<br><br>The eggplant dip (I would normally call this baba ganoush, but it had a different name on the menu--a name that escapes me now) had the sharp flavor of undercooked eggplant, which is one of my culinary pet peeves. It was also too heavy on the tahini. I took one bite of it and that was quite enough.<br><br>The tabbouleh was lemony, bright, and refreshing. The parsley was almost kale-green in color, very fresh and bursting with flavor. Dotted with just a light smattering of bulgur, the salad was very visually appealing as well. I would absolutely encourage you not to skip the tabbouleh.<br><br>The platter cost about seven Euro and was a good deal, even by the standards of a local restaurant scene that tends to support much lower prices than other cities&#39; do. Cocktails and shishas are also affordable at just four Euro each.<br><br>I would definitely recommend Alarabi as a nice spot to have a delicious, relaxed meal with good service at a great price.",

"reviewcomment":"I was here yesterday evening with two companions. I wanted to try this restaurant as I have passed by this place several times before, and I finally had the chance to do that when one of my companions said that we should go out.<br><br>Anyway, we figured 7PM would be a good time to go, and since it was a Tuesday, we figured a reservation was not necessary. I showed up and immediately was given a table for 3. <br><br>We all ordered tagines; different kinds. In addition, I asked for a pot of Moroccan mint tea. While we were waiting for our food, as typical Moroccan places do it, they wash your hands with rosewater. That was a nice touch, which I haven&#39;t seen since I ate at a Moroccan restaurant in Boston in 2009. <br><br>My lamb tagine was perfect; it was melting and not tough at all. Very tasty, and the combination of spices as well as plums and almonds were perfect. My companions also seemed to enjoy their meal as well. <br><br>Perhaps the only thing that prevents me from giving them a full 5 stars is the price. I had the impression that it was a little pricier than it should be, given the quality of the food and overall impression. For its price range, I almost expect to see white table linen, but then again, for a restaurant that tries to give its customers an &#34;ethnic&#34; experience (as opposed to just &#34;ethnic&#34; food), then this one does the trick well.",

"reviewcomment":"Awesome service. Packed - make reservations. Pakistani food, NOT indian, as the only other english language reviewer, with no &#39;Friends&#39;, and one review, stipulates. It&#39;s not personal, or anything to do with her, though. It&#39;s this retarded, buggy &#39;Yelp&#39; system - eliminating many helpful reviews and yet leaving in a review from 2011, from a one-off reviewer.<br><br>{Edit: please also hunt for the mis-categorized  review from &#39;slowfood&#39;. &#39;It&#39;s too sweet/westernized&#39;, goes the review; worth reading. However, given the local community, this is expected. Menu items 108 through 113, are the hot and spicy items. And if you especially want hot and spicy, be sure to ask.}<br><br>Service was good, prompt; much more than can be expected for the city-area generally. This ethnic &#39;proud of my restaurant&#39; shines through. People spoiled on non-local service standards, may easily miss the extra, here, that good service provides.<br><br>The chai was respectable. The salzig lassi could have been saltier; otherwise excellent (salt to taste).<br><br>The fried vegetables were done correctly with a chickpea dough instead of wheat.<br><br>Murgh Salat was very sweet - not offensive - but sweeter than what i want for an evening meal. The mango pulp content made it incredibly sweet - i don&#39;t think any sugar was added. Says something for pakistani mangos, though. Mixed Pakora was good, however, again, the sauce was sweeter than i would have liked. A meat dish will be next.  ...<br><br>Music was not too loud. Bathrooms were private, heated and clean.<br><br>If you had a good experience at this restaurant, please let us know. If you want to thank me for this review, please mark below. Thanks :)",

And the accompanying strawberry marmelade is more like a &#34;mus&#34; - it tastes like the blended it with fresh strawberries. awesome, awesome.<br><br>Prices are absolutely okay since there is a lot of handwork to do to achieve a quality like  this.<br><br>Staff is always great. There is Tagesspiegel and other newspapers to read.<br><br>One flaw is that the coffee is very good, but not third wave style. Well, that&#39;s the one for coffee-freaks. If you expect third wave coffee, it might be four star. I expected a great breakfast. So i give it a five star ranking.<br><br>A lot of locals (families, hipsters) do go there.

"reviewcomment":"Awesome service. Packed - make reservations. Pakistani food, NOT indian, as the only other english language reviewer, with no &#39;Friends&#39;, and one review, stipulates. It&#39;s not personal, or anything to do with her, though. It&#39;s this retarded, buggy &#39;Yelp&#39; system - eliminating many helpful reviews and yet leaving in a review from 2011, from a one-off reviewer.<br><br>{Edit: please also hunt for the mis-categorized  review from &#39;slowfood&#39;. &#39;It&#39;s too sweet/westernized&#39;, goes the review; worth reading. However, given the local community, this is expected. Menu items 108 through 113, are the hot and spicy items. And if you especially want hot and spicy, be sure to ask.}<br><br>Service was good, prompt; much more than can be expected for the city-area generally. This ethnic &#39;proud of my restaurant&#39; shines through. People spoiled on non-local service standards, may easily miss the extra, here, that good service provides.<br><br>The chai was respectable. The salzig lassi could have been saltier; otherwise excellent (salt to taste).<br><br>The fried vegetables were done correctly with a chickpea dough instead of wheat.<br><br>Murgh Salat was very sweet - not offensive - but sweeter than what i want for an evening meal. The mango pulp content made it incredibly sweet - i don&#39;t think any sugar was added. Says something for pakistani mangos, though. Mixed Pakora was good, however, again, the sauce was sweeter than i would have liked. A meat dish will be next.  ...<br><br>Music was not too loud. Bathrooms were private, heated and clean.<br><br>If you had a good experience at this restaurant, please let us know. If you want to thank me for this review, please mark below. Thanks :)",

The food is OK and I can recommend the Nürnberger Wurstchen which is a dish of small grilled german sausages with mashed potatoes and sauerkraut. This is not a bad place. The staff is real nice and the interior is lovely. They have a lot of nice things on the menu and has a calm atmosphere.",

"reviewcomment":"The food was lackluster to start. It is getting better--the pizza dough in particular. Despite looking delicious, the pasta dishes are not seasoned thoroughly, which makes it even more disappointing. They also make a decent wrap. They have oil and vinegar, dried chili peppers, and dried oregano that you can use on your pizza or pasta. Service is quick and friendly (even though the place is often full). German is not necessary to order, in fact many of the workers are young Italians. The restaurant attracts the young, new denizens of the area. Opened late, but not a place you can hit up after the bars. Makes a nice stop, though, to refuel as you can your way down Weserstraße. Beer and wine available.",

"reviewcomment":"Service &amp; Atmosphere: Very friendly and prompt service. I love how this restaurant is busy but the good kind where you can still hear your own conversations and don&#39;t have to wait long for food<br><br>Food: We ordered the nasi goreng and 2 small dishes and a side of plain rice. The nasi goreng came as a massive serving and it tasted great and authentic. There is this section at the back of the menu, where instead of ordering large mains, you can try mini versions of them to try a variety of dishes. I ordered the spicy fish which was not really spicy but delicious. The fish fillets were fried!! The second dish was chicken with sumatra sauce which is a coconut milk sauce with spices. They were very filling! <br><br>Drinks: A large variety but I ordered a pot of Jasmine which was perfect.<br><br>Price: I don&#39;t know the exact price but it was definitely worth it. The mini versions of main dishes were about $2.90 each? Which is great if you want to try a lot of things and works out to be a similar price as a main!<br><br>In short: Definitely recommend this place!!",

Luckily since I had been craving artichokes and today&#39;s cheapest special was an artichoke risotto, my task was made somewhat easier. But I was still tempted by the tomato and broccoli-and-goat-cheese options.<br>I added a small side salad to my order and loved that the greens and dressing were handed to me in small jars. Plus the dressing was delish.<br>For that and my risotto I ended up paying about 7eur, which is not too bad considering the quality.<br>From the lovely heavy silverware to the friendly service to the decor, I loved everything about this place.

If I was to order again I&#39;d get the duck curry instead of the pad thai, it was very good, but the duck was amazing! All the main dishes were between 10-15 euro. The service was a little slow, but we could see our server running around, so it wasn&#39;t like we were being ignored, he was just very busy. The staff was extremely nice. Don&#39;t get the mango sticky rice... it was delicious but the portion size was tiny for the price. So easy to make at home.",

"reviewcomment":"We ate here one night on a recent stay in Berlin, as it was close to our apartment. The place was quite quiet, with less than half the tables full, so we could choose any table we wanted. We sat outside, with those lovely fleecy throws that everyone in Berlin seems to use (a GREAT idea, by the way - can we make this catch on in other places too please?).<br>The restaurant had a pleasant atmosphere, with some quiet music and everyone talking amongst themselves. The waitress who greeted us was helpful and attentive and spoke excellent English. Overall, it looked very nice and we decided it was as good a place as any, so we gave it a shot.<br>And then the food arrived! Oh my, but it was tasty!! All six of us went quiet for quite a long time as we devoured everything on our plates. It was all so fresh and tasty, and just...just lovely. Above all else, it was the meat that did it: cooked to absolute perfection - so much so that it makes my mouth water thinking about it even now...",

"reviewcomment":"I went for dinner on the recommendation of a friend who knows how much I like seafood. And I have to say that the seafood here is not too bad, with a huge Spanish influence but they still managed to convey a Portugese flavour to their dishes (mainly by the judicious use of some extra paprika and various dried herbs). The krake (octopus) was quite good, to the point where we stole a krake galicia accidentally from someone else and had to hurriedly re-order it again. The rest of the fish was well-cooked and tasty and one cannot complain at all.<br><br> It is not quite and will never be the standard of Fischer Fritz, but for the price, it was really very tolerable. What was also a pleasant surprise was the table wine, which was not overpowering or contentious and quite drinkable and very good value at 13 Euro a litre! I had 2 litres before I noticed anything wrong but by then it was, as usual, too late. Oh well.<br><br> The atmosphere is also quite authentic, done up like a fishing village&#39;s taverna, so overall, it is a reasonably-priced place to take your friends for fresh fish.",

"reviewcomment":"Awesome service. Packed - make reservations. Pakistani food, NOT indian, as the only other english language reviewer, with no &#39;Friends&#39;, and one review, stipulates. It&#39;s not personal, or anything to do with her, though. It&#39;s this retarded, buggy &#39;Yelp&#39; system - eliminating many helpful reviews and yet leaving in a review from 2011, from a one-off reviewer.<br><br>{Edit: please also hunt for the mis-categorized  review from &#39;slowfood&#39;. &#39;It&#39;s too sweet/westernized&#39;, goes the review; worth reading. However, given the local community, this is expected. Menu items 108 through 113, are the hot and spicy items. And if you especially want hot and spicy, be sure to ask.}<br><br>Service was good, prompt; much more than can be expected for the city-area generally. This ethnic &#39;proud of my restaurant&#39; shines through. People spoiled on non-local service standards, may easily miss the extra, here, that good service provides.<br><br>The chai was respectable. The salzig lassi could have been saltier; otherwise excellent (salt to taste).<br><br>The fried vegetables were done correctly with a chickpea dough instead of wheat.<br><br>Murgh Salat was very sweet - not offensive - but sweeter than what i want for an evening meal. The mango pulp content made it incredibly sweet - i don&#39;t think any sugar was added. Says something for pakistani mangos, though. Mixed Pakora was good, however, again, the sauce was sweeter than i would have liked. A meat dish will be next.  ...<br><br>Music was not too loud. Bathrooms were private, heated and clean.<br><br>If you had a good experience at this restaurant, please let us know. If you want to thank me for this review, please mark below. Thanks :)",

"reviewcomment":"Stopped here for lunch while waiting out an imminent rain storm.  a few tapas sounded like a plan.  We ordered the fried sardines, lamb diablo, croquets with ham, and a salad.  The sardines needed a pinch of salt, and were just above room temp.  Kind of like they were made first and then sat around of a few minutes before being brought out to us.  Not up to snuff at all.  On the other hand the croquets were creamy and yummy.  The lamb was tender and flavor full but not spicy as advertised.  I guess they were meaning some other devil when they wrote the menu.  The final kicker, however, was the salad.  About every third or fourth bite included some sand.  A little careful food prep might have gotten them another star.  Not really on planing on coming back. <br><br>A side note, the pallela looked and smelled good.  But not sure if I would get it as I saw more wurst come out of this restaurant than Spanish food.  I&#39;m sure they do that to meet a market, but it does seem odd they sell more German things than Spanish.",

"reviewcomment":"Italian food is probably the most appreciated food amongst Germans - and Italians, of course :o)<br><br> A Trattoria is not a simple pizza place as the name implies. And the Trattoria Romana is the best I found so far in Berlin (2010).<br><br> Be it pasta (noodles), pizza or &#34;just&#34; a salad. It is all fresh ingredients and served with pleasure by a hoard of well dressed and educated waiters. Il cameriere speaks enough languages to help you pick your favorite!<br><br> After the main dish (with Bavarian beer) you should have some dolci (sweet deserts).<br><br> Enjoy - stop looking for a better Italian restaurant in this district.<br><br> Rauchfreikategorie: *** einwandfrei im Sommer/Winter<br>smoke free index: *** no complaints summers like winters",

"reviewcomment":"I&#39;d recommend this to any American that is scrounging for free wi-fi in a fantastic neighborhood. Situated right off of Gneisenaustr., Espressolounge is super convenient to get too. Coffee isn&#39;t too expensive but tasty nonetheless. They even have a fantastic Mango Lassi here too. However, I had the carrot cake here once that I was pretty sure was a day old. <br><br>My only big complaint with this cafe is the noise. It&#39;s not the most ideal place to study because it&#39;s loud and rowdy, but on days when you&#39;re just trying to get on the internet and access instagram on your phone, it&#39;s a great place to be!",

My salad was good - nothing too special about it though. It comes with grilled mushrooms but I only had like 4 slices in my salad. The raspberry vinaigrette, however, was delicious. It tasted super fresh and had actual raspberries in it. Overall I was pretty satisfied with my salad. I tried my friend&#39;s crepe too and it was good but could have had a bit more seasoning for my taste. The waiter was very friendly! I would definitely go there again. It was a nice atmosphere for a friends dinner too",

"reviewcomment":"Awesome service. Packed - make reservations. Pakistani food, NOT indian, as the only other english language reviewer, with no &#39;Friends&#39;, and one review, stipulates. It&#39;s not personal, or anything to do with her, though. It&#39;s this retarded, buggy &#39;Yelp&#39; system - eliminating many helpful reviews and yet leaving in a review from 2011, from a one-off reviewer.<br><br>{Edit: please also hunt for the mis-categorized  review from &#39;slowfood&#39;. &#39;It&#39;s too sweet/westernized&#39;, goes the review; worth reading. However, given the local community, this is expected. Menu items 108 through 113, are the hot and spicy items. And if you especially want hot and spicy, be sure to ask.}<br><br>Service was good, prompt; much more than can be expected for the city-area generally. This ethnic &#39;proud of my restaurant&#39; shines through. People spoiled on non-local service standards, may easily miss the extra, here, that good service provides.<br><br>The chai was respectable. The salzig lassi could have been saltier; otherwise excellent (salt to taste).<br><br>The fried vegetables were done correctly with a chickpea dough instead of wheat.<br><br>Murgh Salat was very sweet - not offensive - but sweeter than what i want for an evening meal. The mango pulp content made it incredibly sweet - i don&#39;t think any sugar was added. Says something for pakistani mangos, though. Mixed Pakora was good, however, again, the sauce was sweeter than i would have liked. A meat dish will be next.  ...<br><br>Music was not too loud. Bathrooms were private, heated and clean.<br><br>If you had a good experience at this restaurant, please let us know. If you want to thank me for this review, please mark below. Thanks :)",

"reviewcomment":"A Thai that also has a Vietnamese and sushi menu. Ok, well, let&#39;s judge not too fast, shall we?<br>We ordered a Tom Ka Kai and two main dishes. A red curry with shrimps and a broccoli dish with tofu.<br>Unfortunately, we didn&#39;t really (really didn&#39;t) like it. All the dishes were way sweet, and also a bit salty.<br>Because of the sweetness both the soup and the curry almost tasted like a sweet &amp; sour Chinese dish!<br>Service was nice, place looks ok as well, but for a real thai experience you&#39;d better look elsewhere.<br>Update: tried it again because of all the good reviews. Still didn&#39;t like the food: it&#39;s like they added 5 spoons of sugar to every dish. Well, I guess some like that. I prefer the authentic Thai kitchen though, not this Germanized version.",

"reviewcomment":"Awesome service. Packed - make reservations. Pakistani food, NOT indian, as the only other english language reviewer, with no &#39;Friends&#39;, and one review, stipulates. It&#39;s not personal, or anything to do with her, though. It&#39;s this retarded, buggy &#39;Yelp&#39; system - eliminating many helpful reviews and yet leaving in a review from 2011, from a one-off reviewer.<br><br>{Edit: please also hunt for the mis-categorized  review from &#39;slowfood&#39;. &#39;It&#39;s too sweet/westernized&#39;, goes the review; worth reading. However, given the local community, this is expected. Menu items 108 through 113, are the hot and spicy items. And if you especially want hot and spicy, be sure to ask.}<br><br>Service was good, prompt; much more than can be expected for the city-area generally. This ethnic &#39;proud of my restaurant&#39; shines through. People spoiled on non-local service standards, may easily miss the extra, here, that good service provides.<br><br>The chai was respectable. The salzig lassi could have been saltier; otherwise excellent (salt to taste).<br><br>The fried vegetables were done correctly with a chickpea dough instead of wheat.<br><br>Murgh Salat was very sweet - not offensive - but sweeter than what i want for an evening meal. The mango pulp content made it incredibly sweet - i don&#39;t think any sugar was added. Says something for pakistani mangos, though. Mixed Pakora was good, however, again, the sauce was sweeter than i would have liked. A meat dish will be next.  ...<br><br>Music was not too loud. Bathrooms were private, heated and clean.<br><br>If you had a good experience at this restaurant, please let us know. If you want to thank me for this review, please mark below. Thanks :)",

"reviewcomment":"I&#39;ve been to Pomodorino a couple of times now, and I&#39;ve always had good pizza and super nice service, and I will be going back again and again. However, the restaurant is so tiny and always very crowded, so I would not recommend to eat there. There is even a table placed right in front of the counter, so the people sitting there will have the queuing/ordering people sort of hanging over their table to while choosing, ordering and paying. Due to their popularity (I guess) it&#39;s also most of the time a matter of good timing whether you&#39;ll get to have your personal favorite pizza, or simply have to choose between what&#39;s left when it&#39;s your turn. I guess it&#39;s hard to keep up the pizza baking with the amount of customers they have. Besides this, the place is really cosy so when it&#39;s not super crowded it&#39;s a nice place to eat. (Also very good price for very good pizza =)",

It might take a while. On the other hand: If you are not in a hurry, they are really fast. :-)<br>Take a second look at Schönebergs interesting people, that differ a lot from the crowd in near Kreuzberg.

"reviewcomment":"Awesome service. Packed - make reservations. Pakistani food, NOT indian, as the only other english language reviewer, with no &#39;Friends&#39;, and one review, stipulates. It&#39;s not personal, or anything to do with her, though. It&#39;s this retarded, buggy &#39;Yelp&#39; system - eliminating many helpful reviews and yet leaving in a review from 2011, from a one-off reviewer.<br><br>{Edit: please also hunt for the mis-categorized  review from &#39;slowfood&#39;. &#39;It&#39;s too sweet/westernized&#39;, goes the review; worth reading. However, given the local community, this is expected. Menu items 108 through 113, are the hot and spicy items. And if you especially want hot and spicy, be sure to ask.}<br><br>Service was good, prompt; much more than can be expected for the city-area generally. This ethnic &#39;proud of my restaurant&#39; shines through. People spoiled on non-local service standards, may easily miss the extra, here, that good service provides.<br><br>The chai was respectable. The salzig lassi could have been saltier; otherwise excellent (salt to taste).<br><br>The fried vegetables were done correctly with a chickpea dough instead of wheat.<br><br>Murgh Salat was very sweet - not offensive - but sweeter than what i want for an evening meal. The mango pulp content made it incredibly sweet - i don&#39;t think any sugar was added. Says something for pakistani mangos, though. Mixed Pakora was good, however, again, the sauce was sweeter than i would have liked. A meat dish will be next.  ...<br><br>Music was not too loud. Bathrooms were private, heated and clean.<br><br>If you had a good experience at this restaurant, please let us know. If you want to thank me for this review, please mark below. Thanks :)",

"reviewcomment":"Awesome service. Packed - make reservations. Pakistani food, NOT indian, as the only other english language reviewer, with no &#39;Friends&#39;, and one review, stipulates. It&#39;s not personal, or anything to do with her, though. It&#39;s this retarded, buggy &#39;Yelp&#39; system - eliminating many helpful reviews and yet leaving in a review from 2011, from a one-off reviewer.<br><br>{Edit: please also hunt for the mis-categorized  review from &#39;slowfood&#39;. &#39;It&#39;s too sweet/westernized&#39;, goes the review; worth reading. However, given the local community, this is expected. Menu items 108 through 113, are the hot and spicy items. And if you especially want hot and spicy, be sure to ask.}<br><br>Service was good, prompt; much more than can be expected for the city-area generally. This ethnic &#39;proud of my restaurant&#39; shines through. People spoiled on non-local service standards, may easily miss the extra, here, that good service provides.<br><br>The chai was respectable. The salzig lassi could have been saltier; otherwise excellent (salt to taste).<br><br>The fried vegetables were done correctly with a chickpea dough instead of wheat.<br><br>Murgh Salat was very sweet - not offensive - but sweeter than what i want for an evening meal. The mango pulp content made it incredibly sweet - i don&#39;t think any sugar was added. Says something for pakistani mangos, though. Mixed Pakora was good, however, again, the sauce was sweeter than i would have liked. A meat dish will be next.  ...<br><br>Music was not too loud. Bathrooms were private, heated and clean.<br><br>If you had a good experience at this restaurant, please let us know. If you want to thank me for this review, please mark below. Thanks :)",

It&#39;s not personal, or anything to do with her, though. It&#39;s this retarded, buggy &#39;Yelp&#39; system - eliminating many helpful reviews and yet leaving in a review from 2011, from a one-off reviewer.<br><br>{Edit: please also hunt for the mis-categorized  review from &#39;slowfood&#39;. &#39;It&#39;s too sweet/westernized&#39;, goes the review; worth reading. However, given the local community, this is expected. Menu items 108 through 113, are the hot and spicy items. And if you especially want hot and spicy, be sure to ask.}<br><br>Service was good, prompt; much more than can be expected for the city-area generally. This ethnic &#39;proud of my restaurant&#39; shines through. People spoiled on non-local service standards, may easily miss the extra, here, that good service provides.<br><br>The chai was respectable. The salzig lassi could have been saltier; otherwise excellent (salt to taste).<br><br>The fried vegetables were done correctly with a chickpea dough instead of wheat.<br><br>Murgh Salat was very sweet - not offensive - but sweeter than what i want for an evening meal. The mango pulp content made it incredibly sweet - i don&#39;t think any sugar was added. Says something for pakistani mangos, though. Mixed Pakora was good, however, again, the sauce was sweeter than i would have liked. A meat dish will be next.  ...<br><br>Music was not too loud. Bathrooms were private, heated and clean.<br><br>If you had a good experience at this restaurant, please let us know. If you want to thank me for this review, please mark below. Thanks :)",

Full of flavor and you could tell the noodles were homemade and fresh.  <br><br>At this time of year the speciality was white asparagus aka &#34;spargel&#34;.  If you don&#39;t see it on the menu get the wiener schnitzel (fried pork cutlet) and the spaetzle (german mac and cheese). <br><br>Note: You won&#39;t find an english menu.  The menu is on the counter and the specials are on the board.  I wouldn&#39;t call this a tourist friendly place so arrive prepared.",

It has about 10 tables and serves hot drinks, alcohol, etc and some food (mostly snacks, not main meals). The prices are good for the size and taste, but not downright cheap. The best thing about this cafe however, is that the history of Karl-Marx-Allee (formerly Stalinallee) is displayed on panels down the side wall. It is a nice touch and is very interesting to have a look at. The staff are also very friendly and speak English as well as German. I would advise you to visit this place, even just for the little history lesson!",

To start we were served Chinese sweet-chili sauce with mass-produced chips masquerading as &#34;chips with salsa&#34; to name only one grave disappointment. When my partner complained that the food here wasn&#39;t Mexican in the least, the waiter shrugged. Clearly it wasn&#39;t a concern. At all. We couldn&#39;t understand what drew all the people there, the place is always full. I guess they come for the drinks, or for the fact that they are &#34;Hunde-freundlich&#34;. <br>If you&#39;re looking for Mexican food, keep looking.<br><br> Oh, one star cause it doesn&#39;t allow 0 stars...",

The bar was basically only 20 metres away from my apartment, and it felt like a safe haven, even when at home.. just knowing it was there if I felt like heading out.<br><br>The only thing I don&#39;t like is the smoke, but for that I blame Berlin (in general). It doesn&#39;t hurt that they have a tendency to play Nicolas Jaar over the speakers, and that they serve up cremant and not only sekt - it gives a classy touch to the vintage-y looking space. Although I must confess I love the typical run down Berlin-y interior.<br><br>And for those long summer nights, the outdoor seating is also great!",

"reviewcomment":"This is another place in Berlin where you can eat African wildlife and probably enjoy doing so. They serve various meats like zebra, antelope and emu and some tolerable South African wines.<br><br> The atmosphere is rather ordinary with a few mementos of South Africa scattered around the place. The service is better and they also kindly advised us about the sort of meats and textures to expect, which is nice.<br><br> Would I come again? I don&#39;t know. It&#39;s not expensive, but neither is it a whopping bargain, and to be honest, I was not too enamoured by the food, which tasted all rather samey, even if they are different species of wildlife. However, as an experience for visitor friends to Berlin, it is quite different and enjoyable and will remain a talking point for some time.",

However, they also have a couple of schnitzels, some very good Tarte Flambée, and a variety of other goodies for people who prefer upper-class cuts of meat.<br><br> The atmosphere is great, and the service -- performed by a guy who I can only assume is the owner or co-owner -- is also very good.

Overall a superb dining experience, and a place I would recommend to anyone who likes serious, beautifully prepared food.  While there&#39;s no getting around that it&#39;s expensive, for this level of restaurant it&#39;s actually something of a bargain.

"reviewcomment":"Awesome service. Packed - make reservations. Pakistani food, NOT indian, as the only other english language reviewer, with no &#39;Friends&#39;, and one review, stipulates. It&#39;s not personal, or anything to do with her, though. It&#39;s this retarded, buggy &#39;Yelp&#39; system - eliminating many helpful reviews and yet leaving in a review from 2011, from a one-off reviewer.<br><br>{Edit: please also hunt for the mis-categorized  review from &#39;slowfood&#39;. &#39;It&#39;s too sweet/westernized&#39;, goes the review; worth reading. However, given the local community, this is expected. Menu items 108 through 113, are the hot and spicy items. And if you especially want hot and spicy, be sure to ask.}<br><br>Service was good, prompt; much more than can be expected for the city-area generally. This ethnic &#39;proud of my restaurant&#39; shines through. People spoiled on non-local service standards, may easily miss the extra, here, that good service provides.<br><br>The chai was respectable. The salzig lassi could have been saltier; otherwise excellent (salt to taste).<br><br>The fried vegetables were done correctly with a chickpea dough instead of wheat.<br><br>Murgh Salat was very sweet - not offensive - but sweeter than what i want for an evening meal. The mango pulp content made it incredibly sweet - i don&#39;t think any sugar was added. Says something for pakistani mangos, though. Mixed Pakora was good, however, again, the sauce was sweeter than i would have liked. A meat dish will be next.  ...<br><br>Music was not too loud. Bathrooms were private, heated and clean.<br><br>If you had a good experience at this restaurant, please let us know. If you want to thank me for this review, please mark below. Thanks :)",

"reviewcomment":"A friend and I were hungry after work and decided to go out for dinner last week. As we were both after ethnic cuisine, we decided to try Shayan, a Persian restaurant in Schöneberg. After dinner, we emerged full and satisfied.<br><br>We decided to try the Appetizer platter for two. It included a bunch of things, like eggplant dip, pickled rice in grape leaves, some fried fritters, spinach and raisin balls, and so forth. That was cool, I liked it. <br><br>For the main dish, I tried the fessenjan, as I figured I should try this signature dish in every Persian restaurant I visit. It was amazing; the pomegranate sauce was so rich and perfect for the fragrant rice that it came with. Not to mention that the chicken pieces that were simmering in it were bigger than how I have seen it so far. <br><br>My friend on the other hand tried a lamb curry with peanuts and raisins. She let me try it, and I have no complaints on that either.<br><br>So overall, the place was a good experience. The restaurant was small, but cozy. Enough room for two yuppies feeling lazy and wanting dinner after work.",

Das Große Buffet, bei dem man sich aus rohem Gemüse und verschiedenen Fleischsorten einen Teller zusammenstellen kann, der dann frisch in einer Schauküche zubereitet wird, kostet um die 14 Euro.<br><br>Das Essen ist vielleicht nicht überragend aber mir hat es bis jetzt immer geschmeckt und ich bin garantiert nie hungrig rausgegangen. Eher überfüllt ;D<br><br>Die Einrichtung ist auch schön, etwas laut von der Küche her, aber perfekt von der Hauptstraße abgeschottet und gut belüftet.<br><br>Das personal ist auch freundlich und es ist interessant den Köchen zusehen zu können.<br><br>Allerdings ist das Salatbuffet und das Dessert Buffet sehr einfach...damit meine ich Dosenfrüchte und Vanillepuddings die nach nichts schmecken. Das ist etwas schade und gibt dem Restaurant etwas sehr einfaches, als wollten sie sich dort keine Mühe mit geben.<br><br>Fazit:<br><br>Einfaches, leckeres Essen zu einem guten Preis und netter Bedienung.<br><br>Zudem muss ich sagen...ich finde Buffets ab und zu mal ganz gut. Da ist man gezwungen, wenn man sich schon mit Essen vollstopft, sich wenigstens mal zwischendurch zu bewegen;DD",

"reviewcomment":"My companion took me here one night for a feast. He was telling me that this is an awesome place, as the people who manage this restaurant are actual Thai people, unlike most other places here. And sure enough, when the waiter realized that one of us spoke Thai, German was turned off, and Thai became the lingua franca.<br><br>Gosh, this place was amazing. We ordered several things; unfortunately, as I did not do the ordering (except for one item, the entrails soup), I don&#39;t really know what they were called in Thai. So we ordered 1) the entrails soup, consisting of lungs, liver, blood, stomach, and other items simmered in noodles and tofu; 2) hot papaya salad; 3) a ground chicken dish with interesting herbs; and 4) sauteed shrimp. All of the orders were ordered &#34;Thai spicy&#34; which meant that the Thai people made it the way they usually eat it. Oh, we also ordered sticky rice to accompany things.<br><br>Oh my god, my pores screamed. My throat got parched. Good thing the Thai iced tea was amazing. It was hot, but it was great. I loved it. I would definitely go back here. I would love to try their other offerings, but I would still get another round of that entrails soup. So yes, this is amazing, and is one place that I wouldn&#39;t mind bringing someone to enjoy some authentic Thai cuisine.",

"reviewcomment":"Im Samowar war ich ziemlich oft und immer am So zum tollen Buffet. Für EUR12,50 pro Person kann man von 11.30 bis 16 Uhr im Samowar richtig leckere russische Speisen essen. Ich werde einigen Kritiken hier nicht zustimmen, denn russische Küche an sich ist ziemlich heftig und wer es nicht gewohnt ist, Mayo-Salate oder so viele Fleischgerichte zu essen, sollte vielleicht ein anderes russisches (oder nicht russisches) Restaurant aufsuchen. Nun zum Buffet: es gibt buchstäblich alles, was das Herz begehrt  russische und mediterrane Salate, Pelmeni, Wareniki, Blili, Frikadellen, Piroggen, Hering auf Kartoffel (typisch russisch), Borsch, einpaar wechselnde Hauptspeisen wie geschmortes Rindfleisch mit diversen Beilagen dazu und natürlich schwarzen Tee aus dem berühmten Samowar. Dazu gibt es unendlich viel Dessert, wie der leckere russische Kuchen Napoleon, Apfeltaschen, Quarktaschen, reichlich Obst und Joghurt. Das Angebot ist wirklich wundervoll und für den Preis auch in Ordnung. Man kann sich also im Laufe von einpaar Stunden im<br>Samowar richtig gutgehen lassen. Ich war stets zufrieden mit dem Essen  war immer lecker und hat jedes mal gleich gut geschmeckt. Zum Service kann ich nichts anderes sagen außer ihn zu loben. Die Inhaberin des Restaurants kümmert sich gerne um ihre Gäste und ist sehr aufmerksam. Bei Samowar sieht man sehr oft viele Touristen, aber auch einheimische (Deutsche und Russen) kommen oft zum Sonntagsbuffet. Die Einrichtung ist rustikal und erinnert an Russland Mitte des 19. Jahrhunderts. Insgesamt ein großes Lob an die Küchenchefs für die Köstlichkeiten und an die Chefin für ihre Mühe! Gerne wieder!",

"reviewcomment":"Awesome service. Packed - make reservations. Pakistani food, NOT indian, as the only other english language reviewer, with no &#39;Friends&#39;, and one review, stipulates. It&#39;s not personal, or anything to do with her, though. It&#39;s this retarded, buggy &#39;Yelp&#39; system - eliminating many helpful reviews and yet leaving in a review from 2011, from a one-off reviewer.<br><br>{Edit: please also hunt for the mis-categorized  review from &#39;slowfood&#39;. &#39;It&#39;s too sweet/westernized&#39;, goes the review; worth reading. However, given the local community, this is expected. Menu items 108 through 113, are the hot and spicy items. And if you especially want hot and spicy, be sure to ask.}<br><br>Service was good, prompt; much more than can be expected for the city-area generally. This ethnic &#39;proud of my restaurant&#39; shines through. People spoiled on non-local service standards, may easily miss the extra, here, that good service provides.<br><br>The chai was respectable. The salzig lassi could have been saltier; otherwise excellent (salt to taste).<br><br>The fried vegetables were done correctly with a chickpea dough instead of wheat.<br><br>Murgh Salat was very sweet - not offensive - but sweeter than what i want for an evening meal. The mango pulp content made it incredibly sweet - i don&#39;t think any sugar was added. Says something for pakistani mangos, though. Mixed Pakora was good, however, again, the sauce was sweeter than i would have liked. A meat dish will be next.  ...<br><br>Music was not too loud. Bathrooms were private, heated and clean.<br><br>If you had a good experience at this restaurant, please let us know. If you want to thank me for this review, please mark below. Thanks :)",

Great place to hang out and watch what happens around you. Friendly service, good, simple food and snacks and relaxing atmosphere. We haven&#39;t had bad service and have been here multiple times. Actually find the waiters to be atypically nice for Berlin standards. Only annoyance now is that there is a scaffolding on the building which detracts from sitting outside.",

"reviewcomment":"I have had a hell of a time finding real Thai food in Berlin.  The fact that most &#34;Thai&#34; restaurants have confused pan-Asian menus is only part of the problem.  Even restaurants that offer specifically &#34;Thai&#34; food often cater to local tastes so much that the food isn&#39;t recognizable as Thai.  <br><br>The first time I visited Royal Elephant, I was thrilled that I had finally found a place that could make spicy Thai food, like I received on the West Coast of the US.  I had specifically asked them, as I ask all Thai places in Berlin, if they could make it &#34;sehr, sehr scharf&#34;.  And unlike most Thai places in Berlin, Royal Elephant actually makes a point of offering three different spice levels.  So for my first visit, when I ordered some spicy octopus stir fry, it was perfect.  It was spicier than other Thai restaurants in Berlin, but not too spicy.  On the West Coast scale, it probably would have been an 8/10.  <br><br>However, over the course of three subsequent visits, I haven&#39;t had that same experience.  The food is generally made according to local tastes, and unfortunately Berliners don&#39;t like spice.  This most recent time, I again specifically asked if my fried rice could be made very very spicy.  It was served to me cooked with no discernable spices, but with a small squirt of sriracha sauce on the side.  I didn&#39;t even finish it, it was so bland and disappointing.  When I explained to the server how disappointed I was in the lack of spice, she comped me a free shot of mango liqueur.  So, that was ok.<br><br>Overall, I&#39;m not sure what to think of this place.  The first experience was great, but I&#39;ve been disappointed in the lack of spice three times since.  I should note, however, that the quality of the ingredients is good, and that the cocktails are strong and tasty too.",

"reviewcomment":"Whatever you take here it will be tasty. On the plate or in bread you will have your falafel served with fresh tomatos and a dainty cabbage salad. 2,50 Euro for a sandwich, 4 or 4,50 for a plate. My fav is the halumi plate (with fried cheese). The pity is that they do not serve the parsley salad with it. And if you still wish you will have to pay 50 cent more which is not such a big deal after all.<br><br> I prefer this place in summer as you can also sit outside and if not, the door is still open so you can breath. In winter it is quite cold inside as they save by not heating, and then your clothes will smell like an old falafel for the rest of the day. Lately they stoped serving free tea so now you have to pay to get one.<br><br> P.S.<br>A couple of months ago I used to like this place but I am changing my mind. It seems they are getting worse every day Last week I took a Halumi Plate and discovered that the portion got noticeable smaller. May be the crisis is to blame for that but I do not think I gonna visit them again soon.",

In fact, I would consider this as part of the museum and you can&#39;t go there without stopping off here for some food!<br><br>It was great to journey back in time to the days of the DDR. I am from England so a lot of these dishes were new to me. They were all very tasty, especially the soljanka which I now regularly make at home.

Well, that has all changed.<br><br>I saw an empty &#34;paellera&#34; (paella pan) on a table and thought it didn&#39;t look bad at all. I talked my friend in to trying arroz negro (black rice) as they only do paellas and rices for two persons. It was 22 € for two people. It really was a very very well done arroz negro. I would like to try their paella now. It took about 30 minutes preparation time. We ordered an ensaladilla rusa tapa to eat until the rice came... but it didn&#39;t arrive until after the rice... :( I had a crema catalana as well for dessert. It was also quite good.<br><br>The service was not great, I have to say but the food was so good it made up for the lousy service.<br><br>I will definitely go back again!!!!

"reviewcomment":"Easily overlooked, hidden just off, Potsdamer Strasse, in a side street called Großgörschenstrasse, you will find this gem of an Indonesian Restaurant. <br>On the outside Tuk Tuk has a rickety bamboo façade and on the inside I would best describe it as having this sort of dated charm about it with a bit of shabbiness village feel thrown in.  Almost showing my age here!<br><br>The restaurant is divided into little rooms so you have an even chance of an intimate setting regardless of the numbers in your party. When we were there, the place was surprisingly full with customers of all ages. The family sitting nearby seemed like regulars as the kids knew exactly what they wanted and how spicy they did or did not want their food. <br><br>What can I say the food is delicious! There are so many Asian restaurants out there quintessentially serving the same stuff...not here!<br><br>I started off with a rose flavoured drink with lychees, only because it sounded interesting and I was curious as to how it might taste. It was surprisingly good, I half expected an over perfumed beverage. Thankfully not!<br><br>For starters we went with the Orange Chicken off the &#39;specials&#39; menu (sorry I can&#39;t remember the price of that dish) and the Rissoles (€4) filled with a chicken ragout and vegetables. Both were appetizing, the orange sauce was really good... I mean it was an orange sauce, something I never really get too excited about but have to say this was thumbs up situation. <br><br>I followed this with Rawon Black Beef  (€10) which wasn&#39;t as dark as I had envisioned, I imagined it to be black as night, but my over active imagination gave way to a melt in your mouth beef dish steeped  in a rich brown spicy sauce so I was easily appeased.<br><br>We also had a stir fried vegetable salad as a side dish... pretty average nothing special there otherwise I found the food totally agreeable. It suited my bf&#39;s palette too. <br><br>He really liked the different lingering flavours of his Bebek Sayur Lodeh, which was duck in spicy chilli and coconut milk, also for around €10. He even remarked that he would definitely have that again and he doesn&#39;t get as excited about food as I do!<br><br>We or rather I topped the meal off with Ketan Hitam, a black rice pudding laced with coconut milk and banana slices (€4.10)<br><br>It was a lovely date night meal.",

It is strongly adviced to eat there and enjoy the atmosphere (that room has a capability of about 25-30 persons).<br><br> Prices are really reasonable (10-30 Euro).

"reviewcomment":"Awesome service. Packed - make reservations. Pakistani food, NOT indian, as the only other english language reviewer, with no &#39;Friends&#39;, and one review, stipulates. It&#39;s not personal, or anything to do with her, though. It&#39;s this retarded, buggy &#39;Yelp&#39; system - eliminating many helpful reviews and yet leaving in a review from 2011, from a one-off reviewer.<br><br>{Edit: please also hunt for the mis-categorized  review from &#39;slowfood&#39;. &#39;It&#39;s too sweet/westernized&#39;, goes the review; worth reading. However, given the local community, this is expected. Menu items 108 through 113, are the hot and spicy items. And if you especially want hot and spicy, be sure to ask.}<br><br>Service was good, prompt; much more than can be expected for the city-area generally. This ethnic &#39;proud of my restaurant&#39; shines through. People spoiled on non-local service standards, may easily miss the extra, here, that good service provides.<br><br>The chai was respectable. The salzig lassi could have been saltier; otherwise excellent (salt to taste).<br><br>The fried vegetables were done correctly with a chickpea dough instead of wheat.<br><br>Murgh Salat was very sweet - not offensive - but sweeter than what i want for an evening meal. The mango pulp content made it incredibly sweet - i don&#39;t think any sugar was added. Says something for pakistani mangos, though. Mixed Pakora was good, however, again, the sauce was sweeter than i would have liked. A meat dish will be next.  ...<br><br>Music was not too loud. Bathrooms were private, heated and clean.<br><br>If you had a good experience at this restaurant, please let us know. If you want to thank me for this review, please mark below. Thanks :)",

"reviewcomment":"Awesome service. Packed - make reservations. Pakistani food, NOT indian, as the only other english language reviewer, with no &#39;Friends&#39;, and one review, stipulates. It&#39;s not personal, or anything to do with her, though. It&#39;s this retarded, buggy &#39;Yelp&#39; system - eliminating many helpful reviews and yet leaving in a review from 2011, from a one-off reviewer.<br><br>{Edit: please also hunt for the mis-categorized  review from &#39;slowfood&#39;. &#39;It&#39;s too sweet/westernized&#39;, goes the review; worth reading. However, given the local community, this is expected. Menu items 108 through 113, are the hot and spicy items. And if you especially want hot and spicy, be sure to ask.}<br><br>Service was good, prompt; much more than can be expected for the city-area generally. This ethnic &#39;proud of my restaurant&#39; shines through. People spoiled on non-local service standards, may easily miss the extra, here, that good service provides.<br><br>The chai was respectable. The salzig lassi could have been saltier; otherwise excellent (salt to taste).<br><br>The fried vegetables were done correctly with a chickpea dough instead of wheat.<br><br>Murgh Salat was very sweet - not offensive - but sweeter than what i want for an evening meal. The mango pulp content made it incredibly sweet - i don&#39;t think any sugar was added. Says something for pakistani mangos, though. Mixed Pakora was good, however, again, the sauce was sweeter than i would have liked. A meat dish will be next.  ...<br><br>Music was not too loud. Bathrooms were private, heated and clean.<br><br>If you had a good experience at this restaurant, please let us know. If you want to thank me for this review, please mark below. Thanks :)",

"reviewcomment":"Authentic Gourmet Style Indian Cuisine<br><br>This is a pretty good North Indian Restaurant in West Berlin. The food is fresh and the owner is very friendly. She makes an effort to go around and socialize with the customers, which is much appreciated. <br><br>My favorite appetizer is the samosa. It is absolutely delicious. For dinner, the tandoori chicken is great. The daal has an interestingly unique smoky flavor to it. A must try is the garlic naan. They actually use fresh garlic and you can really taste it. <br><br>The only conn is the portion sizes. They are extremely small. For example, the samosa appetizer has 1 samosa...that&#39;s it! The same goes for the rest of the food. Therefore you have to order tons and tons of food in order to make a real meal and that really adds up. It is much more expensive than other Indian restaurants. <br><br>Value: Is the high cost of this Indian gourmet restaurant justifiable? Maybe once in a while. And of course if you are traveling, this is the time to indulge!",

"reviewcomment":"I think this place is always open throughout the week - well maybe the close briefly in the night, but they are always still around when (not very often) I walk by late and they are already open early in the morning.<br><br> Speaking of morning - a fresh made bagel costs 1,70 EUR which is a serious bargain for any breakfast in Mitte. You have the choice of different creme cheeses (dried tomatoes, rucola?) and different bagels. The bagel is heated briefly and off you go to a good breakfast. Coffee ain&#39;t too expensive either. A bargain, seriously.<br><br> I&#39;m not sure when but probably recently, they also switched the interior. They now even have a couple places to sit.<br><br> Aside from bagels they also have other stuff - such as falafel, sandwiches, schawarma, soup and so on.<br><br> Sometimes the people working there are not too friendly (1 star off), but most of the time it&#39;s alright. And if you are in Berlin, you are probably used to it anyway. ;-)",

So much food it&#39;s untrue. They also do desserts including what seemed to be a Berlin favourite - pancakes! Once you have been seated you can stay as long as you like up until 3pm.<br><br> Great value for money and a good way to while away a Sunday and ensure you won&#39;t need to eat again for hours. Also full of lots of locals so it has a really authentically German feel.",

"reviewcomment":"Have been here about 10 times now and brought many friends here. Everyone always loved it.<br><br> Fantastic sushi and other Japanese bites for fair prices in a nice decor. <br>They offer the classic sushi dishes but also offer some amazing original dishes like the Onsel roll, which is a crispy bakes sushi roll... Mjom!<br><br> When the weather allows it you can sit outside.<br><br> Inside it looks like your average Japanese place, with new &amp; clean toilets.<br><br> Everything is made fresh for you.... and you can also order the Thai dishes from Lemongrass Thai next door.<br><br> Service is very sweet and attentive...but when it&#39;s really crowded it can be a bit hectic and you have to wait a little while for your food.<br><br> My advice is to go in the afternoon when they offer menus with a discount and it&#39;s not so crowded.<br><br> Sushi can be a bit cold, so best is to leave it for a couple of minutes before eating.<br><br> Loving it!",

"reviewcomment":"Awesome service. Packed - make reservations. Pakistani food, NOT indian, as the only other english language reviewer, with no &#39;Friends&#39;, and one review, stipulates. It&#39;s not personal, or anything to do with her, though. It&#39;s this retarded, buggy &#39;Yelp&#39; system - eliminating many helpful reviews and yet leaving in a review from 2011, from a one-off reviewer.<br><br>{Edit: please also hunt for the mis-categorized  review from &#39;slowfood&#39;. &#39;It&#39;s too sweet/westernized&#39;, goes the review; worth reading. However, given the local community, this is expected. Menu items 108 through 113, are the hot and spicy items. And if you especially want hot and spicy, be sure to ask.}<br><br>Service was good, prompt; much more than can be expected for the city-area generally. This ethnic &#39;proud of my restaurant&#39; shines through. People spoiled on non-local service standards, may easily miss the extra, here, that good service provides.<br><br>The chai was respectable. The salzig lassi could have been saltier; otherwise excellent (salt to taste).<br><br>The fried vegetables were done correctly with a chickpea dough instead of wheat.<br><br>Murgh Salat was very sweet - not offensive - but sweeter than what i want for an evening meal. The mango pulp content made it incredibly sweet - i don&#39;t think any sugar was added. Says something for pakistani mangos, though. Mixed Pakora was good, however, again, the sauce was sweeter than i would have liked. A meat dish will be next.  ...<br><br>Music was not too loud. Bathrooms were private, heated and clean.<br><br>If you had a good experience at this restaurant, please let us know. If you want to thank me for this review, please mark below. Thanks :)",

Just to create an image the flambé trufflepasta - that was skillfully prepared in a 18 month old wheel of parmesan by our table - almost made me cry. The grilled salmon was perfectly cooked and it was served with a salad &amp; boiled veggies (broccoli, potatoes, mangold &amp; carrots). We tried the recommended Pinot grigio wine which was light &amp; tasty. The buffalo mozzarella in the Caprese starter was the only thing that could have been better. <br><br>The interior is basic &amp; nothing fancy. You can enjoy a pizza just as well as a pasta.

Cube blew me away with the variety, creativity, and quality of their food. <br><br>My husband and I shared several rolls and were very pleased with all of them  (including one with prosciutto that seemed like an odd flavour combination, but totally worked!). Despite the business of the restaurant and the fact that we speak limited German, the server deftly took our orders, checked on drinks, brought us food, and cleared the table. <br><br>We frequently find German service a little indifferent (Canadian servers often seem like they&#39;ve decided to be your new best friend, which tends to go too far the other way), but Cube was the perfect balance of efficiency and friendliness. <br><br>The bill was reasonable and reflected the quality of the food and the number of rolls we consumed (there were too many interesting ones to hold back!). <br><br>I&#39;d certainly recommend Cube and suggest trying one of the very non-traditional Italian-inspired rolls :)",

"reviewcomment":"Lemon Leaf bills itself as an &#34;Indochine Restaurant&#34;, and its menu focuses on Laotian and Cambodian dishes, with a few Thai and Vietnamese-influenced offerings as well. I was drawn in by the array of dishes which looked a bit off the beaten path and different from things I&#39;ve eaten before.<br><br>I ordered the &#34;Angkor Teigtaschen&#34; which were crispy dumplings filled with pumpkin and served with marinated veggies and a tamarind dipping sauce. They managed to be light, crispy, and yet just a little sinfully greasy all at once. Not at all heavy or gross, though. And the dipping sauce was sweet, tart, and a yummy counterpoint to the dumplings.<br><br>I also tried the Tam Mag Hung which is a Laotian salad with papaya, tomato, carrots, and mung beans, with spicy chili and roasted peanuts. It was so fresh, light, and delicious. I loved the play of flavors, all perfectly balanced. And, rare for Germany, the &#34;spicy&#34; dish actually did have a nice kick to it.<br><br>The Goi Wunsen is a Laotian rice noodle salad with chilis, lime juice, herbs, shallots, sprouts, and other veggies. It was again packed with fresh, delicious veggies, and the rice noodles were added with a light touch so you had the texture of the noodles without this being an overly carby dish. The salad comes with a protein of your choice. We did tofu, and it came out as little cubes of deep-fried and seasoned tofu. <br><br>The Pakse Basil was a delicious Laotian entree (main), with cauliflower, paprika, basil leaves, mushrooms, etc., stir-fried with a spicy kick and protein of your choice. We went with the crispy duck and were not disappointed at all. In fact it is some of the best restaurant duck I can remember having! It was a very large duck breast and the meat was tender, not fatty, and richly flavorful without going over into gaminess.<br><br>The appetizer, two salads, and one main dish were enough food for two people to have a very satisfying dinner, and it all came up to 21,50 Euro. Not bad at all, especially for food prepared with such fresh, high-quality ingredients and such expertly crafted flavors.<br><br>We did take-out, but I waited inside the restaurant and thought it had a nice, fun decor. There is plenty of outdoor seating as well. All of the staff I interacted with were pleasant, friendly, and efficient. They gave me updates on how the wait was going, which I appreciated. It ended up not taking long, maybe around 15 minutes from the time I ordered to the time I paid.<br><br>All in all, I was very pleased with my experience and would try this place again!",

"reviewcomment":"Awesome service. Packed - make reservations. Pakistani food, NOT indian, as the only other english language reviewer, with no &#39;Friends&#39;, and one review, stipulates. It&#39;s not personal, or anything to do with her, though. It&#39;s this retarded, buggy &#39;Yelp&#39; system - eliminating many helpful reviews and yet leaving in a review from 2011, from a one-off reviewer.<br><br>{Edit: please also hunt for the mis-categorized  review from &#39;slowfood&#39;. &#39;It&#39;s too sweet/westernized&#39;, goes the review; worth reading. However, given the local community, this is expected. Menu items 108 through 113, are the hot and spicy items. And if you especially want hot and spicy, be sure to ask.}<br><br>Service was good, prompt; much more than can be expected for the city-area generally. This ethnic &#39;proud of my restaurant&#39; shines through. People spoiled on non-local service standards, may easily miss the extra, here, that good service provides.<br><br>The chai was respectable. The salzig lassi could have been saltier; otherwise excellent (salt to taste).<br><br>The fried vegetables were done correctly with a chickpea dough instead of wheat.<br><br>Murgh Salat was very sweet - not offensive - but sweeter than what i want for an evening meal. The mango pulp content made it incredibly sweet - i don&#39;t think any sugar was added. Says something for pakistani mangos, though. Mixed Pakora was good, however, again, the sauce was sweeter than i would have liked. A meat dish will be next.  ...<br><br>Music was not too loud. Bathrooms were private, heated and clean.<br><br>If you had a good experience at this restaurant, please let us know. If you want to thank me for this review, please mark below. Thanks :)",

"reviewcomment":"I was here for brunch with my companion yesterday, as this place has been on my radar for a bit now, and wanted to try it sometime. It is close to where we live, so we just walked for a few minutes until we reached Viktoria-Luise-Platz. <br><br>During winter, they have an enclosed outdoor eating area; it is divided into a smoking and non-smoking section. We first sat at the non-smoking section, but my companion still felt cold, so we switched and sat indoors. The indoor decor looked like an American diner, complete with bright glaring-red furnishings and jukeboxes. Though they happen to be a Russian restaurant, so it was a little cognitively dissonant.<br><br>They have both English and German menus, not that I needed the English menu. I was amazed at their long list of breakfasts. I picked the vegetarian breakfast (it had a pretty name, but I forgot), while my companion had some fried eggs and sides. I was very satisfied with my breakfast, though it&#39;s not the best vegetarian breakfast I have had. That being said, I would still come back here if asked.<br><br>I am deducting a star for a couple of things. First, the decor is not my liking. Too diner-ish and really mismatching given the cuisine they offer. Second, they could use a bigger plate for the breakfast. I almost forgot some of the items in my plate because they were very hidden by some salad greens. So the next time I am back, I will try not to look at anything else except my companion, and make a thorough exploration of my plate.",

I was rather sad to hear that Facil got mentioned in some budget airline magazines as I think Facil caters for a rather refined clientele who appreciates good cooking, simple elegance and refined indulgence. But maybe more people will get to understand that great food is not about strong tastes and big portions, but just enough to stimulate the senses and satisfy, and that is what Facil does so sublimely well.<br><br> PS. Don&#39;t take teenagers there - MacDonalds is around the corner. Leave them there with 50 Euro and sneak back to Facil! :o)",

"reviewcomment":"Awesome service. Packed - make reservations. Pakistani food, NOT indian, as the only other english language reviewer, with no &#39;Friends&#39;, and one review, stipulates. It&#39;s not personal, or anything to do with her, though. It&#39;s this retarded, buggy &#39;Yelp&#39; system - eliminating many helpful reviews and yet leaving in a review from 2011, from a one-off reviewer.<br><br>{Edit: please also hunt for the mis-categorized  review from &#39;slowfood&#39;. &#39;It&#39;s too sweet/westernized&#39;, goes the review; worth reading. However, given the local community, this is expected. Menu items 108 through 113, are the hot and spicy items. And if you especially want hot and spicy, be sure to ask.}<br><br>Service was good, prompt; much more than can be expected for the city-area generally. This ethnic &#39;proud of my restaurant&#39; shines through. People spoiled on non-local service standards, may easily miss the extra, here, that good service provides.<br><br>The chai was respectable. The salzig lassi could have been saltier; otherwise excellent (salt to taste).<br><br>The fried vegetables were done correctly with a chickpea dough instead of wheat.<br><br>Murgh Salat was very sweet - not offensive - but sweeter than what i want for an evening meal. The mango pulp content made it incredibly sweet - i don&#39;t think any sugar was added. Says something for pakistani mangos, though. Mixed Pakora was good, however, again, the sauce was sweeter than i would have liked. A meat dish will be next.  ...<br><br>Music was not too loud. Bathrooms were private, heated and clean.<br><br>If you had a good experience at this restaurant, please let us know. If you want to thank me for this review, please mark below. Thanks :)",

Here you can expect more than just penne arrabiata or spaghetti Bolognese. Portions are rather big but it&#39;s always a pity to leave anything on the dish as pastas taste really well. The Italian staff is very funny and always of good cheer. They will make you smile even if you&#39;ve planned to be a gloomy pill whole evening long.<br><br> In summer it&#39;s also nice to sit outside watching people rambling along the cute street.

"reviewcomment":"Of the cluster of Himalayan-themed restaurants around Western Kreuzberg, Little Tibet is both the best and, apparently, the only one run by actual Tibetans. For the first indication of their authenticity, be sure to order the Butter Tea, a frothy, salty, buttery traditional brew that is somewhere between a beverage and a soup on the western palate.<br>Tibetan food is not known for its showiness or intense flavors, but it is ideally suited for a cold winter night, and the dishes here are reliably hearty and satisfying. The standout, of course, is Momos, housemade Tibetan dumplings (steamed or fried) which are easily the best in town. A combination platter is great value and a meal unto itself, although a dipping sauce other than the default sweet-chili condiment would be an improvement. <br>Meat and vegetable dishes here don&#39;t veer far from the path trod by many of Berlin&#39;s Asian restaurants, with Tibetan specialties fighting for attention with more Thai and Indian-influenced fare. There&#39;s nothing wrong with the fried duck or coconut soups, but they do rather dilute the concept. Still, they&#39;re a notch above nearby competitors; nothing comes off as greasy, and the vegetables are uniformly fresh and tasty.<br>Service is also reliably friendly and fast, and the very cheap wine list makes it very easy to have a nice evening out here for under EUR20 p/p.",

However, given the local community, this is expected. Menu items 108 through 113, are the hot and spicy items. And if you especially want hot and spicy, be sure to ask.}<br><br>Service was good, prompt; much more than can be expected for the city-area generally. This ethnic &#39;proud of my restaurant&#39; shines through. People spoiled on non-local service standards, may easily miss the extra, here, that good service provides.<br><br>The chai was respectable. The salzig lassi could have been saltier; otherwise excellent (salt to taste).<br><br>The fried vegetables were done correctly with a chickpea dough instead of wheat.<br><br>Murgh Salat was very sweet - not offensive - but sweeter than what i want for an evening meal. The mango pulp content made it incredibly sweet - i don&#39;t think any sugar was added. Says something for pakistani mangos, though. Mixed Pakora was good, however, again, the sauce was sweeter than i would have liked. A meat dish will be next.  ...<br><br>Music was not too loud. Bathrooms were private, heated and clean.<br><br>If you had a good experience at this restaurant, please let us know. If you want to thank me for this review, please mark below. Thanks :)",

"reviewcomment":"Pho house is a nice place when you&#39;re not sure what you want and you want something asian and simple. I like the concept, you go up to the counter and order from a myriad of menus with the same number. Some nice woman takes your oder and asks you for a selection of sauces and you get a summer roll from all of it. I&#39;m sure the same pattern may not be repeated by everyone, but it&#39;s pretty nicely priced.<br><br> My husband always gets some curry or sweet and sour dish with rice. I always go for the pho madness of noodle soups. I&#39;m always adding chillis and whatever, but that&#39;s the point of a Pho house.<br><br> It&#39;s very conveinetly located at Ostkreuz, so that won&#39;t be a problem. There&#39;s a lot of people watching you can do as you sit on their nice long benches that can be a bit uncomfortable if you don&#39;t like benches or wood.<br><br> It&#39;s a good selection if you&#39;re in the Ostkreuz area and want something for everyone.",

"reviewcomment":"The revamped Volksbar is worth a visit. Well done upstairs area with a mish-mosh of couches and sofas. Comfortable seating and a fairly large room to hang out. Service was super nice (but one star was deducted for being a bit slow.she seemed to be new.) Didn&#39;t visit the club when it was full but a fun location. Drinks were well mixed and the crowd seemed a bit touristy yet relaxed and talkative. The location is perfectly situated between Prenzlauer Berg and Mitte and is easy to find. Fun places around to hit before or after trying out this bar. Do recommend that you stop by.",

"reviewcomment":"Well. So, I&#39;m wandering about Alex trying to guess if the construction will ever be over... and decide I want a drink and a nature break. I spy slices in the window and think &#34;mmm pizza&#34;. Once I entered, I realized its a white tablecloth place, but sat and checked out the menu (in English as well as Italian and German)... glad I did!<br><br>Lunch specials are a great deal. 6,30 euros for Medallions Pomodoro. I could see into the kitchen (not the best view usually, but this was fine in this case) and saw the cook cutting the medallions off the pork loin and pounding them out for my dish. Can&#39;t beat that for fresh! A salad arrived (twas a bit more &#39;oil&#39; and a bit less &#39;vinegar&#39; for my taste). Service was attentive and swift. Nice place to sit and watch the world of Alex go by. Note: They did nick me 3 euros for a diet coke. C&#39;est la vie. Gotta make the coin somehow.<br><br>I&#39;d have liked a basket of bread to go with the meal - guess I&#39;m used to that showing up in the US and you have to order it here... but the meal was excellent. The potatoes were just a tad salty, and the broccoli was pretty forgettable - but the sauce was **magnificent**. 3.5 stars. Oh heck. They get 4 since I can&#39;t do half stars... they get the extra half star for not being a tourist trap.<br><br>Note: Like most places the bathrooms are downstairs. Not ADA accessible my any means. But then, neither is most of Europe.",

A refreshing change of pace from all the other doner spots around here.<br>Big and with lots of seating, the owners here are Lebanese and are friendly as hell.<br><br>The meat here is delicious; definitely not the mystery meat you can get from the Turkish spots. The hot sauce on the tables is pretty interesting; it&#39;s a low, slow heat but also tastes kind of fruity? Kind of like they made a mash of cherries/tomatoes/peppers. Delicious!<br><br>For around 5€ you can get a &#34;small&#34; plate of food, which is really not small. They PILE the food on!! The hummus is tasty, the bread is delicious and the meat, the meat!!! It&#39;s awesome.<br><br>Get there early because they DO run out of the beef shwarma. <br><br>Side note: I&#39;m Persian and when I was here the other night, they were rocking some Iranian jams. I asked the owner if he was Persian, and he said no, he just loved Persian music. Extra star for excellent taste in music ;)",

However, given the local community, this is expected. Menu items 108 through 113, are the hot and spicy items. And if you especially want hot and spicy, be sure to ask.}<br><br>Service was good, prompt; much more than can be expected for the city-area generally.

The salzig lassi could have been saltier; otherwise excellent (salt to taste).<br><br>The fried vegetables were done correctly with a chickpea dough instead of wheat.<br><br>Murgh Salat was very sweet - not offensive - but sweeter than what i want for an evening meal. The mango pulp content made it incredibly sweet - i don&#39;t think any sugar was added. Says something for pakistani mangos, though.

"reviewcomment":"It&#39;s time to venture out of Mitte and find non-chain coffee shops. So for my first attempt, I ended up in Le Johann Rose, a coffee shop that has plenty of interesting things, thingies, and things to eat and drink. <br><br>I tried this place with fresh ginger tea, and for 2,80 EUR, it is way cheaper than the offerings in the chain coffee shops that are found everywhere in Mitte. They have other stuff, from hot chocolate, to speciality coffees, to beer, of course. The line between bar and coffee shop of course is blurry here in Berlin. <br><br>The interior is amazing. I feel like I am in a living room of a dollhouse. There are plenty of places to sit, and each coffee table set seems to be a set of its own. There&#39;s a sofa that looks like something from grandma&#39;s house, there&#39;s a pair of chairs that looks like it&#39;s the product of Scandinavian minimalist design, there&#39;s a wooden chair set, and so on. There&#39;s even an upright piano at the corner.<br><br>Oh, they even have free wifi. Just ask for the password at the counter.<br><br>So, the only reason I am giving this 4 stars and not 5 is because as much as they are friendly to people who have laptops, I have a hard time finding a plug. Every outlet seems to be hidden. If that were different, then I would be more than willing to give this place 5 stars. In the meantime, it has to settle for 4, and I&#39;ll come here only when my power is fully charged.",

"reviewcomment":"Of all the things that I am, connoisseur of Vietnamese food is certainly not one of them. I suppose I have avoided the cuisine for so long because so many dishes make use of fish sauce, and asking for it to be omitted can sometimes be a hassle (particularly when some cooks insist it is the cornerstone of a recipe). <br><br>But when I first heard about Huong Que - incidentally on the first date with my now-dude - I was intrigued. In particular, he spoke of the faux duck dish, which he said is not only exceptional, but also 100% vegan. Naturally, this was welcome news to me.<br><br>Fast forward a couple months and he decided to treat me to a meal here so I could experience it for myself. We rode our bikes over to the hip yet quaint Bergmannstraße, and since it was a Sunday afternoon, and Easter day no less, the place was relatively deserted.<br><br>We were seated immediately in a quiet corner, where we were able to take in the decor (dark furniture with splashes of colour, like the bright green ceiling) as well as partake in a bit of people watching. We both ordered the duck - one with peanut sauce and the other with coconut milk - and naturally shared bites with one another. And my goodness, it was amazing.<br><br>I&#39;ve only had duck one time in my pre-veg days, and I remember it being rich but greasy. This vegan duck was rich but not so greasy, yet definitely full of flavour, and with a wonderful consistency to boot! <br><br>I know there are other veg options on the menu, but in all likelihood, I will not ever try them, because this is the only thing I am interested in; you just can&#39;t try to one-up perfection.",

"reviewcomment":"When I read in the NY Times that Mogg and Melzer import their pastrami from the States, I knew these guys meant business. <br><br>In the past few weeks I tried hunting down a decent reuben in Amsterdam but sadly had no luck and was beginning to give up on Europe. Enter Mogg and Melzer! <br><br>The restaurant is located in an old girls school down a quiet street in Mitte. If you didn&#39;t know about this place there is no way you would find it but I think this is the way they want it. After speaking to the chef, I was told they import the pastrami from the US but conduct all the preparation in Berlin including smoking the meat. <br><br>They have a pastrami on rye (large and small) and a reuben on offer (one size). After around 20 minutes the reuben arrived accompanied by a small bowl of coleslaw and a pickle (nice touch). The reuben was stacked maybe 10-12 layers high of perfectly smoked pastrami with the right amount of fat content, thickness and juiciness. They also go very lightly on the sauerkraut which is how it should be as it can dominate the taste of the sandwich. The Russian dressing and Swiss cheese were also perfectly applied. All in all they have really nailed this sandwich on toasted rye albeit on the slightly expensive side (12 Euro). <br><br>I have recently eaten a variety of reuben sandwiches in Australia that have tried to copy the US deli&#39;s and none have really been a contender. I can confidently say that Mogg and Melzer is the real deal and certainly is by far the best reuben I have eaten since living outside the States. <br><br>5 stars all the way! <br><br>Only small thing I would say, is that there is 1 chef madly making sandwiches so expect a small wait - it ain&#39;t Katz deli....yet!",

"reviewcomment":"I popped into this place this afternoon, as Yelp Berlin&#39;s office hours was held here this week. And since I work just two blocks away from this place, there is no excuse not to say &#34;Hello!&#34; to Berlin&#39;s lovely Community Managerin, Svenja.<br><br>Based on the information I gathered, they seem to have a rotating menu. They only offer a few select dishes, which changes every day. In addition, they have a large drink menu, but it is camouflaged in the form of a worn-out newspaper. After all, what do you expect from the cafe attached to a newspaper company?<br><br>Anyway, I went in wanting tea, but got apple instead. Yes, I was tempted to try the Bratapfel, which is a baked apple filled with marzipan, and with vanilla ice cream on the side. Wow, that was amazing. It&#39;s ingenious to have the idea of transforming a crunchy apple into a brick of amazing sweet goodness.<br><br>So yes, I am impressed, although I felt the need to save the fifth star for later, when I have more data points than a dessert. That being said, it was a wonderful dessert, and I had a wonderful tea-turned-dessert break. Thanks again to Svenja for the apple and the nice chat.",

It&#39;s a small place divided in to two rooms with some outside seating as well.<br><br>I ordered the Pizza Tomas (with mozzarella and potatoes with fresh rosemary sprigs) for under 6€. I had never tried a pizza with potatoes before and it was very nice. The crust was perfect as well. It was very good. I also tried the chocolate soufflé which was nice but not great.<br><br>I was surprised by the prices though. They can be quite high. The staff was friendly and one guy didn&#39;t speak German and asked me to tell him what I wanted in English... I will probably go back again. This review was written in 2010.",

"reviewcomment":"I selected Defne out of a guidebook, being in search of some flavors hard to find in my home state of Oregon. The restaurant was small and intimate, but well staffed with efficient service. Ambiance was dark and made reading/translating the menu a little challenging, so being adventurous my selections were made with a general &#34;jist&#34; of featured ingredients.<br><br>The appetizer sampler platter was wonderful. There was fresh hummus, red pepper/chili paste, fresh tzaziki, green olive salad, garlic carrots and walnut chili paste with slices of tomato and cucumber. I shared a plate of jumbo prawns sauteed in tomato, onion, and other veggies, with rice and salad as an entree. Prawns were excellent, and the sauce very tasty. Dessert was walnut stuffed figs with chocolate and vanilla sauces.<br><br>Really wonderful meal, and fully enjoyed!",

"reviewcomment":"I came here to do a beer brewing course conducted by Thorsten Schoppe, a man who looks more at home in a dojo than a brewery. However, looks can be deceiving as this gentleman really knows his stuff. The course was quite interesting and it was even more interesting to hear the (long detailed) questions asked by the other attendees (Germans take their beers very seriously). So I actually learnt quite a lot.<br><br> Lunch was also provided and it was pretty ordinary - what one would expect from any kneipe in Berlin. The place is quite big, with a stage for live music, so it looks like a happening sort of place in the evenings and weekends.<br><br> Well, I have now concocted my own beer recipe (thanks to Thorsten&#39;s expert guidance) and all I now need is an empty basement to make my brew...<br><br> By the way, we were compelled to sample the beers here and the general verdict was that it&#39;s &#34;nicht schlecht&#34;, which, as it came from German beer pros, translates roughly in English to &#34;damn bloody good - gissus another!&#34;.",

"reviewcomment":"Let me start off by stating how much I love the facade of this cafe, it was certainly that alone which lured me in the first time. Then after that, it was the ambience, the service, and the food. Not amazing, but on the better side. They serve those crispy thin french pizzas with various toppings, which are perfect as an after-work snack. I just wish they stayed open longer than 8 PM, if they did - you would certainly find me here quite often reading the night away. On weekends they serve up a pretty decent breakfast/brunch, I opt for the vegetarian option - and the cheeses are tasty, without being too much (it is the first meal of the day we are talking about after all). With an espresso macchiato, and a glass of fresh OJ on the side - you can&#39;t go wrong. But you could, of course, also opt for an after breakfast coffee at Bonanza down the road - take away on your way to Mauer Park of course.",

"reviewcomment":"Awesome service. Packed - make reservations. Pakistani food, NOT indian, as the only other english language reviewer, with no &#39;Friends&#39;, and one review, stipulates. It&#39;s not personal, or anything to do with her, though. It&#39;s this retarded, buggy &#39;Yelp&#39; system - eliminating many helpful reviews and yet leaving in a review from 2011, from a one-off reviewer.<br><br>{Edit: please also hunt for the mis-categorized  review from &#39;slowfood&#39;. &#39;It&#39;s too sweet/westernized&#39;, goes the review; worth reading. However, given the local community, this is expected. Menu items 108 through 113, are the hot and spicy items. And if you especially want hot and spicy, be sure to ask.}<br><br>Service was good, prompt; much more than can be expected for the city-area generally. This ethnic &#39;proud of my restaurant&#39; shines through. People spoiled on non-local service standards, may easily miss the extra, here, that good service provides.<br><br>The chai was respectable. The salzig lassi could have been saltier; otherwise excellent (salt to taste).<br><br>The fried vegetables were done correctly with a chickpea dough instead of wheat.<br><br>Murgh Salat was very sweet - not offensive - but sweeter than what i want for an evening meal. The mango pulp content made it incredibly sweet - i don&#39;t think any sugar was added. Says something for pakistani mangos, though. Mixed Pakora was good, however, again, the sauce was sweeter than i would have liked. A meat dish will be next.  ...<br><br>Music was not too loud. Bathrooms were private, heated and clean.<br><br>If you had a good experience at this restaurant, please let us know. If you want to thank me for this review, please mark below. Thanks :)",

"reviewcomment":"A restaurant that probably sees itself as a bit funky (although it&#39;s probably that funky it wouldn&#39;t ever dream of using the word &#39;funky&#39;). It&#39;s a little hard to describe the food here. The name of the restaurant would suggest it was modern French cuisine, and I suppose that&#39;s the main theme, although the inclusion of pasta dishes confused the personality.<br><br> My main of scallops on mango and lime chutney was generally well cooked, although the salt crust was far too thick. The scallops are accompanied by a basil sorbet that didn&#39;t quite work. My main of spaghetti with prawns in a tomato and curry(!) sauce was better, although not fantastic.<br><br> The problem with this restaurant is mainly that the surroundings (and the foodie twists, like my basil sorbet) suggest you&#39;re getting something better than the food on offer.",

Their ribs are a massive proportion, worthy of American style servings, while everything else is made with a lot of attention to detail and full of flavor and fresh ingredients.  Trey have a lot of variety on their menu and won&#39;t disappoint. <br><br>Highly recommend, one of my favorite food spots in Berlin. <br><br>Aaron the American.",

"reviewcomment":"Awesome service. Packed - make reservations. Pakistani food, NOT indian, as the only other english language reviewer, with no &#39;Friends&#39;, and one review, stipulates. It&#39;s not personal, or anything to do with her, though. It&#39;s this retarded, buggy &#39;Yelp&#39; system - eliminating many helpful reviews and yet leaving in a review from 2011, from a one-off reviewer.<br><br>{Edit: please also hunt for the mis-categorized  review from &#39;slowfood&#39;. &#39;It&#39;s too sweet/westernized&#39;, goes the review; worth reading. However, given the local community, this is expected. Menu items 108 through 113, are the hot and spicy items. And if you especially want hot and spicy, be sure to ask.}<br><br>Service was good, prompt; much more than can be expected for the city-area generally. This ethnic &#39;proud of my restaurant&#39; shines through. People spoiled on non-local service standards, may easily miss the extra, here, that good service provides.<br><br>The chai was respectable. The salzig lassi could have been saltier; otherwise excellent (salt to taste).<br><br>The fried vegetables were done correctly with a chickpea dough instead of wheat.<br><br>Murgh Salat was very sweet - not offensive - but sweeter than what i want for an evening meal. The mango pulp content made it incredibly sweet - i don&#39;t think any sugar was added. Says something for pakistani mangos, though. Mixed Pakora was good, however, again, the sauce was sweeter than i would have liked. A meat dish will be next.  ...<br><br>Music was not too loud. Bathrooms were private, heated and clean.<br><br>If you had a good experience at this restaurant, please let us know. If you want to thank me for this review, please mark below. Thanks :)",

"reviewcomment":"Good quality food for reasonable price. <br><br>We were looking for a good breakfast place and we&#39;ve found one. This looks like a bar too and is probably more busy in the evening. But it served breakfast propose very well too.<br><br>Menu has few good choices of breakfasts, including eggs, salmon, meats accompanied by juices and milkshakes. Everything they served was fresh and tasty. <br><br>Additionally they ha free wifi and power sockets donut was easy to work there little bit as well. <br><br>Interior is not my type, but nice big windows overlooking big square make you feel the morning pace.<br><br>Will be back anytime from now maybe to also try the dark side if this place!",

"reviewcomment":"Pizzeria near the Zoologischer Garten train station. If you are looking for the best delicacies of the italian cuisine, just turn round. But if you expect a decent meal for a decent price, this is the place.<br><br>The pizzeria offers a wide range of the most well-known specialities of the italian cuisine (pasta, pizza, lasagna...). Waiting times fairly short (makes sence since pasta is pre-cooked).<br><br>The meals may not be hyper-mega-supercalifragilisticexpialidocious but they are more than all right. For instance: pizza margherita, tagliatelle alla checca, large and small mineral waters (0,4 l. and 0,2 l.). All for 17,50 euros.<br><br>As central as it gets, between Zoo Station and Ku&#39;damm<br>Small stair to reach the dining room. Not suitable for handicapped.",

"reviewcomment":"Awesome service. Packed - make reservations. Pakistani food, NOT indian, as the only other english language reviewer, with no &#39;Friends&#39;, and one review, stipulates. It&#39;s not personal, or anything to do with her, though. It&#39;s this retarded, buggy &#39;Yelp&#39; system - eliminating many helpful reviews and yet leaving in a review from 2011, from a one-off reviewer.<br><br>{Edit: please also hunt for the mis-categorized  review from &#39;slowfood&#39;. &#39;It&#39;s too sweet/westernized&#39;, goes the review; worth reading. However, given the local community, this is expected. Menu items 108 through 113, are the hot and spicy items. And if you especially want hot and spicy, be sure to ask.}<br><br>Service was good, prompt; much more than can be expected for the city-area generally. This ethnic &#39;proud of my restaurant&#39; shines through. People spoiled on non-local service standards, may easily miss the extra, here, that good service provides.<br><br>The chai was respectable. The salzig lassi could have been saltier; otherwise excellent (salt to taste).<br><br>The fried vegetables were done correctly with a chickpea dough instead of wheat.<br><br>Murgh Salat was very sweet - not offensive - but sweeter than what i want for an evening meal. The mango pulp content made it incredibly sweet - i don&#39;t think any sugar was added. Says something for pakistani mangos, though. Mixed Pakora was good, however, again, the sauce was sweeter than i would have liked. A meat dish will be next.  ...<br><br>Music was not too loud. Bathrooms were private, heated and clean.<br><br>If you had a good experience at this restaurant, please let us know. If you want to thank me for this review, please mark below. Thanks :)",
