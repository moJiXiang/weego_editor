"reviewcomment":"I was totally blown away by their food &amp; service last night! my S/O suggested this place as it was in the neighbourhood but I hadn&#39;t been there before. We decided on take out. So I called in our order, and the gentlemen who answered the phone was SO friendly and attentive (which is not the case sometimes at other restaurants when you call to place an order) and told me about 10 - 15 minutes. When I went to pick up the order I was greeted very politely by the staff, and told it would be just a moment and offered a drink while I waited.  Every interaction I had with a staff member was done politely, professional, and welcoming. The place was bustling for a Friday night... but everyone seemed to be on their A-game and happy to be there. <br>I got my food and took it home. <br><br>We ordered a prawn souvlaki and a chicken souvlaki. the food was carefully packaged and divided. They have a unique take-a-way tray that has individual portioned areas for the rice, vegetables, protein/potatoes. they had a separate container for the Greek salad, and another one for the tzakiki. Let me just say this... everything was awesome but the roasted potatoes blew me away. I have NEVER tasted roasted potatoes that were so good in my life. I don&#39;t know what your secret is but they were phenomenal (and I don&#39;t even usually like potatoes too much). Over all it was delicious. Portion sizes were fabulous (I have a little leftover for lunch today.. excited!), and the food was yummy! <br><br>Will definitely be back!!",

"reviewcomment":"After a crazy night, an awesome solution for hangover is to me (and my bff!) is having a bowl of Japanese ramen! Sometimes an instant ramen will do the job but I&#39;m living large nowadays! Harhar~ :-p Just like most Japanese ramen places, this very famous ramen restaurant is of medium to tiny space. Many of my friends are sort of not fond of its space and atmosphere, but I do don&#39;t mind and I actually like them. I think they make this restaurant feel more ... Japanese(?).<br><br>My favourite here is Shoyu (sometimes Shio, harhar). The Shoyu is &#34;Japanese ramen in Kintaro&#39;s special soy sauce soup with pork-bone stock.&#34; Of course, as with every Japanese ramen, it comes with bean sprouts, bamboo shoots, and green onions. And in this case, BBQ porks! Great great &#34;humble food&#34; indeed. Smooth noodles in a bowl of hot soup with fat meat, a perfect cure for hangover, this girl says! I&#39;d keep coming back. Of course you need to choose the time wisely because when it&#39;s not too lined up, you might have to be wait 30~40 minutes. Still, it&#39;s a good sign, yes? ^^",

"reviewcomment":"Yum, so happy to finally get to try the Guu Original location, we&#39;ve been big fans of the Water St. spot for a bit now so it was long overdue. <br>We went for a late dinner with friends around 9pm on a Tuesday and waited only three mins or so for a table for four, not bad considering the spot is pretty small and from what I&#39;ve seen walking by steadily busy. <br>The food, ohmygod the food - they have a changing fresh sheet with specials you should look to first, stand outs for us were the kimchi, calamari and sashimi plates. <br>Love the cheap drinks and jovial atmosphere, we&#39;ll be back soon!",

"reviewcomment":"It&#39;s been a week that I came back from Vancouver. I miss this place soo much! I waited here for at least 30 mins at breakfast time on a weekday,well more like 11am, but doesn&#39;t matter, the point is it&#39;s well worth the wait! <br><br>This place is a little small but it can sure fit a lot of people at once! We sat at the breakfast bar in front of the barista to avoid longer wait. <br><br>We already figured out what to order so not wasting time we ordered a large lavender latte and a small mocha. According to the server, all sizes have 2 shots of espresso so the smaller it is, the stronger it is. Interesting, but lighter is better for me so my stomach won&#39;t get mad at me. Other then that, we ordered the fricasse, a side of waffle with white chocolate pistachio rosewater sauce, and a side of bacon. <br><br>The fricasse is a dish with braised short ribs,  roasted potatoes, 2 sunny side up eggs, and served with grilled focaccia. I&#39;m not a fan of braised short ribs or any kind of shredded meat bc of the soft texture and tastes so meaty. My boyfriend loved it though. I only tried a little of the meat, it&#39;s bearable and better than the short ribs I had from Roy&#39;s. I had everything else from that dish, the potatoes were flavorful and the focaccia was great with the sauce and the runny egg yolk. The julienne strips of green apple on top also made the dish less heavy. <br><br>The bacon on the side was delicious!! It was thick cut, not too salty, glazed and garnished with cilantro. Best bacon I had so far!!! I would actually call it pork belly than bacon. Drool...<br><br>Last, we ended the meal with the precious waffle (I consider anything that I like are precious) :-) Poured half of the white chocolate pistachio rosewater on top of it and what to do with the remaining half? Being a fatty, I poured the rest of the sauce to my latte since it was kinda light..they have that flavor latte anyways! It was so sweet but tastes better :-P <br><br>Overall, I don&#39;t have anything to complain about. <br><br>A good breakfast makes everything better!",

Everything from the friendly greeting to your gut busting last bite is memorable here! I have never had a bad experience. <br><br>The scones are TO DIE FOR!

Their bottomless french press coffee is so yummy and of course, all their egg dishes are all wonderful too!<br><br>Come early to avoid the line! But even if you don&#39;t, they have a text messaging system that lets you know when your table is almost ready!

"reviewcomment":"My husband and I found ourselves at Meat and Bread after receiving a recommendation from a bartender in Seattle. We were not disappointed. My husband ordered the Porchetta, which is their signature sandwich, and I ordered the daily special, which was a slow roasted lamb sandwich. Both sandwiches were delicious and paired well with the cold Kolsch that we washed them down with. <br><br>The service was quick and everyone was very courteous. When we first walked in to the shop, it was packed and we were unsure of the wait time. The hostess quickly assured us that by the time we finished ordering our sandwiches some space would open up. Sure enough, by the time we got our sandwiches we were able to enjoy them at the long, community table. Between our dining experiences in Seattle and the rest of Vancouver, I have to say that the sandwich I ate at Meat and Bread was probably my favorite meal of the trip.",

We ended up splitting our group of nine, into a group of four and five; but even so, it was a long wait. And I can get very hangry. <br>Sitting down at the bench style tables, we were greeted by a call and response in Japanese: party! This really helped set the scene, letting us know it was okay to be a little loud. <br>We literally ordered everything on the menu. We figured we would eat family style. We all wanted to get a taste of what was offered, and we might have been half drunk. Regardless of the logic, this was a very smart choice on our part and we ended up ordering even more. <br>There is a small upstairs dining area that is set up like a traditional Japanese seiza dinning experience. I notice most people were sitting with their legs crossed instead of knelling, and two guys were even laying to the side. Interesting somehting I have not seen in the Northwest before.",

"reviewcomment":"I have been to Salt Tasting Room several times, but they really proved themselves this past Friday evening. We were celebrating a special occasion, so I called prior to see if we could bring a bottle of champagne as I expected they wouldn&#39;t have much selection on their menu. Management happily agreed, with a $25 corkage fee. Once our friends arrived, I told our sever to bring out the bottle and serve four glasses immediately - which she did and it was perfect timing. Then, we enjoyed the tasting menu and wine flight pairings. Between the four of us, we were quite surprised by the selection of white, red and port that was poured - it was delicious, exciting and all new tastes. <br><br>Salt has such a great ambiance, and the service is always amazing - one of the best in Gastown for a fun night out with friends.",

It wasn&#39;t opened at 11 am on a weekday so me and my husband walked around gas town .. And by noon there was luckily a table for us.. They opened at 11:30.<br><br>We had la feast cuz I wanted a bit of everything. The fried cauliflower and the lentils were the best in my opinion.  Their jalapeño sauce wash very special and zesty.  We also had 2 lamb meat balls.

I&#39;ve tried to replicate at home with no luck, but hey these chef are masters.<br><br>For the appetizer we got the seafood tower.  Huge selection of fresh cold seafood with a beautiful display and lost of accompaniments.  I love this restaurant.",

"reviewcomment":"I&#39;ve been here a few times for happy hour, but today I had the best experience so far, thanks to our awesome server, Wade. It was a Friday, so I expected it to be quite busy. We arrived at 5pm and for the first time, they said they would seat us instead of us seating ourselves, and only if everyone in our party was there. So when the 3rd person arrived, they said we could sit at one of their low tables (not normally for happy hour but near the bar) as long as they had the table back in an hour. We were fine with that and those seats are actually more comfortable anyway.<br><br>We were promptly served by Wade. He had a great attitude and was super pleasant. Sometimes I find that servers do not appreciate younger patrons as much especially when they ask questions or say silly things. Wade was not like this at all and was very fun to talk to. Even though we didn&#39;t get drinks or rack up a large bill, he continued to provide great service. He made effortless conversation and I really enjoyed talking to him. He was efficient and quick when serving our dishes, clearing the table, and refilling the water when he noticed my glass was empty. He made our happy hour experience even better (and normally the service here is already pretty good!). He was really personable and I even gave him some of my chocolate haha :)<br><br>I got the shrimp ceviche for myself as I was not too hungry at the time since I had a late lunch. It was really tasty as usual. At first it seems like there are not enough chips for the ceviche but it works out fine. My friends got yam fries, calamari, and buck a shuck oysters. I tried the fries and calamari and they were excellent as usual.<br><br>Wade was happy to split our bill for easy payment. We were in and out within an hour.<br><br>I wish that we were provided those survey slips at the end of our meal because I really want to acknowledge his hospitality. Instead I&#39;ll hope that this review will suffice! I&#39;ll definitely be back for the lunch specials or happy hour, and when I do, I definitely hope to see Wade!",

"reviewcomment":"Vancouver&#39;s late night food scene (or rather lack thereof) was a hole that had yet to be filled in my heart. So when we came to the Naam under many recommendations, this restaurant literally made our night.<br><br>Chill atmosphere if you go late at night and in the afternoon. If you go during the dinner rush though, get ready to wait until your stomach is screaming purgatory. The food is fucking amazing and you don&#39;t have to feel guilty after engorging your digestive tract with this delicious goodness - all of it is damn good for you.<br><br>I&#39;m sounding very much like a broken record here but I have to definitely echo the sentiments of everyone who raves about the miso gravy. It&#39;s gotta be laced with crack to be that good. Try the enchilada; it tastes so amazing I feel like I should be guilty for having it but it&#39;s full of healthy veggies and beans.<br><br>Tl;dr: this is a 24 hour restaurant. Go at night when it&#39;s quiet (because any other time is an aggravating wait). Everything on the menu is fucking majestic.",

"reviewcomment":"This place is fantastic. Atmosphere and service are always top notch.<br>The one dish I can&#39;t stop ordering whenever I&#39;m here are the mussels with a tomato curry sauce. The sauce is unlike any other mussels I&#39;ve ever eaten. The fries that come with them are PERFECT. They are the right level of crispy and salty and the potato they use is slightly sweet.  <br><br>I had the lamb shank this time as well, I&#39;m not a lamb fan so it wasn&#39;t my favourite, as the sauce seemed to bring out the lamb&#39;s flavour which isn&#39;t great when you don&#39;t like lamb... Although I&#39;m sure people love this dish.<br><br>I can&#39;t wait to go back here and try more dishes. Also, their cocktails are outstanding.

"reviewcomment":"All reviews about this place are correct. I came here with my parents around noon on a Saturday and it was packed, but well worth the extra 10 minute wait. We started with 8 orders (2 each)of Asada, Beef tongue, Pescado, and carnitas, and then after happily finishing everything to the last drop, we wound up going back up and ordering 4 more of the beef tongue. It&#39;s so tender and full of beef tongue-y flavor.<br><br>Right from the get-go, the guy at the cashier asked us for our names with a smile and remembered it when I came back a second time. Everything came out within 5 minutes and was devoured within 3 minutes. Different levels of salsa were available on the side to add, but I personally found the way they made everything perfect to taste.<br><br>This reminded me of the taco trucks parked in the back of some Brooklyn bars where they serve $5 for 2 tacos. Here it was $9.75 for 4, so it&#39;s certainly around the same ballpark. Ingredients were fresh and I just got a great vibe from everyone eating there. Literally, everyone left with a smile and a thumbs up.<br><br>Beef tongue was my favorite. Also the horchata isn&#39;t half bad.",

"reviewcomment":"Came here twice - once in a group of 4, and once in a large group of about 20. Both times were satisfying, and I would come here again. A unique and popular option for groups is their set menu, which comes with samples of their most popular pastas and items for people to share. I originally wanted to come here for my birthday dinner, since it is a nice, classy establishment with lots of seating. If you want to reserve seats for a large group here, you have to reserve ahead of time - 1 month before! This place is very popular for groups, and you should confirm with the restaurant again closer to the date in case it does not work out. <br><br>The first time, we had spaghetti alle vongole (with clams), beef carpaccio, calamari, a pizza, spaghetti carbonara, and their classic meatball spaghetti.  I personally did not like the spaghetti with clams, since there was a heavy flavor of the clams, though I was glad that there was no sand in them (I&#39;ve had bad experiences with clams in restaurants before). They provided a bowl for me to de-shell the clams myself, and there were a lot of them! The pizza looked like a regular italian-style pizza, nothing special or interesting about it. Beef carpaccio was great, though not great enough to warrant me to purchase it again. Maybe I&#39;d get the calamari, which came with a unique tomato-based sauce. The spaghetti carbonara and classic meatball spaghetti were absolutely amazing, from what I&#39;ve heard and tried myself. Dang, that spaghetti carbonara! <br><br>The second time was a group set menu uniquely designed for us. We had complimentary bread and olive oil &amp; balsamic vinegar (?), followed by their most famous meatballs spaghetti with truffle cream. Absolutely divine. Meatballs were tender, and the truffle cream added a perfect richness to the pasta. The portion looked small, but we couldn&#39;t finish it! This was followed by tiramisu for dessert. The plating looked beautiful, and came with a small shortbread cookie, but I would have liked more coffee liquor in the dessert&#39;s sweet flavor.",

"reviewcomment":"You know what? This is pretty damn near perfect bar. Note how I didn&#39;t say club or pub or cantina, but a bar.<br><br>The ambiance is a great combination of trendy and casual (not hipster... there&#39;s a difference). It has the great renovated warehouse ambiance, with exposed wood and brick, right next to the rail tracks to emphasize its post-industrial chiciness. <br><br>Long wooden tables and countertops allow tons of people fit in here, especially if you don&#39;t mind sharing tables. Downstairs seems more intimate, and I think they only have it open on weekends or for private events. <br><br>One thing I love: they don&#39;t do shots. Only beer, wine, and cocktails.<br><br>Awesome beer selection, especially for those hopheads out there. I always order one of their signature cocktails; none of them will disappoint. <br><br>Over the several times I&#39;ve been here, I can&#39;t remember the food I had. Therefore no comment on the quality. Judging by the photos, it looks quite nice for bar food. <br><br>Service has always been friendly and professional. They do their job well and don&#39;t stand around to make conversation when they notice my friends and I are in deep conversation.<br><br>One of the gems of Gastown",

"reviewcomment":"I was totally blown away by their food &amp; service last night! my S/O suggested this place as it was in the neighbourhood but I hadn&#39;t been there before. We decided on take out. So I called in our order, and the gentlemen who answered the phone was SO friendly and attentive (which is not the case sometimes at other restaurants when you call to place an order) and told me about 10 - 15 minutes. When I went to pick up the order I was greeted very politely by the staff, and told it would be just a moment and offered a drink while I waited.  Every interaction I had with a staff member was done politely, professional, and welcoming. The place was bustling for a Friday night... but everyone seemed to be on their A-game and happy to be there. <br>I got my food and took it home. <br><br>We ordered a prawn souvlaki and a chicken souvlaki. the food was carefully packaged and divided. They have a unique take-a-way tray that has individual portioned areas for the rice, vegetables, protein/potatoes. they had a separate container for the Greek salad, and another one for the tzakiki. Let me just say this... everything was awesome but the roasted potatoes blew me away. I have NEVER tasted roasted potatoes that were so good in my life. I don&#39;t know what your secret is but they were phenomenal (and I don&#39;t even usually like potatoes too much). Over all it was delicious. Portion sizes were fabulous (I have a little leftover for lunch today.. excited!), and the food was yummy! <br><br>Will definitely be back!!",

And let me tell you, this place is the bomb for artisan sandwiches. Their sandwiches are made with the freshest ingredients leaving you feeling healthy while enjoying every flavourful bite. I ordered the pear which includes prosciutto , Brie, roasted walnuts and of course pear. My guess is there is also balsamic vinegar drizzled on top. The atmosphere is very vintage and the scene is hipster. Decor is nice and well thought out! <br><br>Would I revisit? Most definitely :) hands down one of the finest sandwich joints in town.",

"reviewcomment":"I was totally blown away by their food &amp; service last night! my S/O suggested this place as it was in the neighbourhood but I hadn&#39;t been there before. We decided on take out. So I called in our order, and the gentlemen who answered the phone was SO friendly and attentive (which is not the case sometimes at other restaurants when you call to place an order) and told me about 10 - 15 minutes. When I went to pick up the order I was greeted very politely by the staff, and told it would be just a moment and offered a drink while I waited.  Every interaction I had with a staff member was done politely, professional, and welcoming. The place was bustling for a Friday night... but everyone seemed to be on their A-game and happy to be there. <br>I got my food and took it home. <br><br>We ordered a prawn souvlaki and a chicken souvlaki. the food was carefully packaged and divided.

"reviewcomment":"I had my going away party here and I just want to say that Nathan was super helpful. I had a pretty large group (40 or so people) and the servers managed to keep separate bills and I was pretty content with the level of service (although some of my guests felt otherwise). The food was only medium, some items were quite good and others not so much. It is a bit over priced too for what it is. I would think it would be the prices of Earls or Cactus but it is a bit more. I knew that going in but some of my guests did comment on it so be sure to check the menu out before you commit and let people know. And for the price, the food should have been tastier. I heard complaints about the Beef ribs and the curry noodle bowl (not sure of the official names). The onion rings were delicious as was the mushroom flatbread ) thin crust) and cheese cake...people kept offering me bites of what they had.<br><br>But because Nathan came over and checked on us and brought a piece of cake for my 2nd cousin who was turning 75 and brought me a shot and even a t-shirt that people could sign, I am giving what would normally be a 3 a 4. I give him a 5 though for being great at his job.<br><br>I also liked the back area which could accommodate our party and was kind of a separate area. The music was pretty amazing too and they have delicious micro brewed beer. I highly recommend the raspberry wheat ale.<br><br>The patio is also beautiful and the pub side is a great place to go (and from what I remember, a great place to chat up attractive guys and they are more in the 30 age range instead of the 20 somethings at most other pubs).",

"reviewcomment":"I&#39;ve lived in Vancouver a long time and I had no idea this place existed... but now that I do, it&#39;s going to be a go-to place for meeting up with friends.  I&#39;ve only been once, but I gave it five stars because I love what it has going for it:  great service, great vibe, location, and I loved the food they brought me:  the Porto Burger with a Cesar Salad.  Really delicious and a complete mess to eat.  My friend, who has dietary restrictions, had lots to choose from and had the special, the Vegan Sun-dried Tomato and Pesto Quesadilla, which they kindly put on a gluten free bread.  She inhaled it.<br><br>It was very busy, and crammed, very loud, but that&#39;s how they roll.  My friends fries were meh, but whatever.  And for a place that is really affordable they offered a few really nice wines, not the rotgut you usually get at lower-priced places.<br><br>I&#39;ll be back for sure...",

"reviewcomment":"When we left Montreal for Vancouver, we really wanted to find a new Szechuan dig to pig out at. We found it in Peaceful. The food is awesome and done right. <br><br>My recommendation.. the spicy and salty tofu. It&#39;s out of this world.<br><br>Edit: I&#39;m eating the chilli and garlic noodles the day after (we ordered too much) and they&#39;re sooo good when served cold. The garlic flavour really punches you in the face.<br><br>2nd edit: After going back a 3rd time and having the spicy/salty tofu I noticed a piece of bone in the dish. After asking the waitress she said they fry the tofu the same place as their meat. Just a warning for vegetarians out there.. it&#39;s not really vegetarian. It might be common among restaurants even though I really don&#39;t think it&#39;s right.",

"reviewcomment":"I came here on a busy Saturday night for a belated Mother&#39;s Day dinner.  My mum and I arrived at 7pm for our reservation and were led to a lovely table upstairs which was a little more intimate and quiet.  Despite my sister not arriving for another 20 minutes, we were never made to feel we were taking up valuable real estate. <br><br>As far as food, between the three of us we ended up ordering the Apple Chopped Salad, Burrata Salad, Halibut Karaage (from the feature sheet), Pan Roasted Sea Scallops, Truffle Crusted Halibut (also a feature), Crispy Brussels Sprouts and Truffle Fries.  Everything I tasted (pretty much everything on the table) was delicious - I had the halibut appetizer and the entrée and both were absolutely divine.  My mother, who generally finds *something* wrong with everything, absolutely raved about her scallops.  Unfortunately my sister told me her halibut was almost cold, but she didn&#39;t mention it until after dinner when my mum had left the table, so I can&#39;t put that on the restaurant as I know full well they would have swept her plate away and presented another one without missing a beat.<br><br>Our server, whose name unfortunately escapes me, was excellent from beginning to end.  She clearly has a knack for &#34;reading&#34; her tables, which is a dying talent in the service world these days. <br><br>I agree that it can be loud if seated in the downstairs area; I do suggest requesting the upstairs if you&#39;re looking for something a little more intimate - I&#39;ve sat at the bar before and it was definitely a different experience being upstairs (though there&#39;s definitely a time and a place to sit at the bar!!).  All in all, it was a wonderful experience and I would certainly recommend it.",

"reviewcomment":"Being from Hawaii and having a Japanese Wife from Osaka Japan, there are so many Izakaya&#39;s in Hawaii and there are only two places that we hold in high regard when it comes to eating authentic Japanese Fare with the consistency and taste of being in Japan and these two places are Imana&#39;s Tei and Sushi Izakaya Gaku in Hawaii. These are places that i would eat at every single day if i had the funds to do so when we were going on our Alaskan Boat Cruise this year and were going to Vancouver to board on the Holland America Line, we had the opportunity to see what kind of Japanese Fare Vancouver had and see if it was up to snuff with those in Hawaii.<br><br> We studied dilligently and looked at each and every angle we could find on the Internet,Yelp,Trip Advisor, and my wife&#39;s Japanese Blogs for people that have dined in Vancouver during their stay there. After all was said and done, it seems that Miku and Kingyo stood above and beyond everyone else, so these were the two places we were going to eat at for dinner on our limited stay here in Vancouver.<br><br> After our first dining experience at Miku, we were both very disappointed in terms of the quality and authenticity of the food here at Miku. It sort of reminded me of eating at Nobu&#39;s and Morimoto&#39;s in Hawaii where the food here isn&#39;t traditional and simple Izakaya fare but seems like they want to impress the younger hip crowd with a flashy style of presenting Japanese food and not offering the simplicity of good old fashoined Izakaya fare. And by looking at the people dining there at Miku, i couldn&#39;t find a single Japanese National eating there which isn&#39;t a good sign at all.<br><br> Enter Kingyo Izakaya. Just by looking at this place and seeing Japanese People greet you with a Irashaimase, i knew i was in for a special treat with this being our last night in Vancouver. The atmosphere here isn&#39;t anything like Miku nor is it as big as Miku. Kingyo definitely has the feel of dining in an Izakaya as opposed to Miku where you feel like you are walking into a Nightclub. The atmosphere at Kingyo was simply electric and it was hopping from when we walked in the Izakaya at 7:00 in the evening. Me and my wife looked at each other with a sigh of relief knowing that this meal might be the one to make us forget the disappointment of dining at Miku and at the end of our meal, we left very happy and satisfied.<br><br> Let&#39;s start off with the amazing food we had here at Kingyo...<br><br>*Sashimi Moriawase for $29: Ok people, you either go big or go home. Eating this type of Sashimi in Hawaii would defintely run you fifty to sixty bucks, but eating this kind of Sashimi for under 30 bucks is an absolute steal. I highly recommend this for all you Sashimi Fanatics out there <a href='http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/kingyo-vancouver?select=KNFUL5H9xj_WxAOJF59vNQ#KAcnWYxioz8rouxeSd7Vkw'>yelp.com/biz_photos/king…</a><br><br>*Stone Grilled Beef Tongue $9.20: Just the presentation alone will blow you away. Raw Beef Tongue served with a Hot Stone where you cook the Beef Tongue on. Genius, pure Genius <a href='http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/kingyo-vancouver?select=KNFUL5H9xj_WxAOJF59vNQ#_gZiXE9zDHnOVLoHgTToNQ'>yelp.com/biz_photos/king…</a><br><br>*Grilled Pork Cheek $7.80: Pork Cheeks that just melt in your mouth <a href='http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/kingyo-vancouver?select=KNFUL5H9xj_WxAOJF59vNQ#q0d43n_n4dK7CViHMigeNA'>yelp.com/biz_photos/king…</a><br><br>*The Famous and Undefeated TanTan Noodles $9.80: For those of you Noodle Lover&#39;s out there, this is what to order ",

"reviewcomment":"I&#39;ve driven by this place a few times and was curious to check it out.<br><br>So tonight I did.<br><br>We got in and wanted to sit out on the patio. The wait was about 5 minutes.<br><br>After sitting down, we found it was getting a bit chilly and we were offered blankets. I gotta say, I&#39;ve never been offered a blanket to cover up at a restaurant.<br><br>In any case, we each ordered the After School Special. Mine was with the Dos Diablos sandwich and Crab Bisque. My wife&#39;s was the Tastiest Chicken sandwich and also the Crab Bisque.<br><br>My sandwich came out nicely grilled with melted cheese everywhere and a huge pool of burnt cheese. This is not a minus. Burnt cheese is one of my favourite things in life. (All of my favourite things involve a lot of cholesterol). The bread they use is nice and crusty and holds up very well to all the cheese. The chorizo was had the perfect amount of heat and the roasted red peppers had a little bit of sweetness. All in all, a very excellent sandwich.<br><br>My wife&#39;s sandwich came open-faced but she found it difficult to eat that way so it got closed up and consumed the classic way. There was a lot of chicken in it which is why I think they serve it open. They also do not skimp on the bacon. You always got a good mouthful with every bite.<br><br>The crab bisque was also very good. I like that it wasn&#39;t super-rich like most bisques and it had a good amount of crab meat in it. I will say that they need to not cook down the crab meat so much as it was starting to disintegrate.<br><br>The service was kind of mediocre. Drinks came fast enough but the waitress was hard to find for the rest of the duration.<br><br>We will definitely come here again.",

"reviewcomment":"I finally got around to giving this place a try on a date; it was both my and my date&#39;s first time at this place. The concept interested me: vegetarian Mexican food. I was also delighted that the establishment gave customers the option of &#39;vegan-ising&#39; their dishes using Daiya cheese. <br><br>I ordered the Dant&#39;s enchilada dish: corn tortillas stuffed with (Daiya) cheese and butternut squash, asked for the enchilada sauce and the rice-and-beans side. <br><br>The dish was beyond delish. The enchiladas have lots of creaminess and body, no need for meat...did not miss the meat at all! The rice-and-beans side could use a bit more kick but it&#39;s nothing a little bit of hot sauce (provided right at the table) could fix! <br><br>The place itself is typical &#39;Commercial Drive eating joint:&#39; hipster feel, hip people (I definitely felt a tad outta place), hip decor (they turn off the lights at dinner time forcing you to use their table candles (I used the light from my smart phone) to read their menus but I was given very friendly attentive service! I gave their gluten-free chocolate cake a try and it was pretty darn good!<br><br>My memo to the restaurant: PLEASE find out for sure if your tempeh is gluten free. The beauty of Mexican cuisine is that wheat can easily be avoided as Mexican is highly corn based. I did ask the waitress but she said the label has been thrown out, so she could not confirm.",

"reviewcomment":"Fresh and tasty. Came here for a celebratory birthday dinner, and ordered the cold seafood platter for two, which was actually quite a lot of food. The most memorable thing that stood out to me was the raw scallops that were served with a miso cauliflower purée, topped with shaved black truffle. So good.<br><br>We also split the panfried steelhead trout, served with beautifully roasted mini beets and carrots, beet greens, and a vanilla bean magical sauce of fluffy clouds and happiness. Everything worked together perfectly -- the fish was cooked exactly right, and the earthy beets and carrots gave some great dimension to the dish.<br><br>For dessert, we tried the deconstructed s&#39;more. Totally dramatic &#34;wow&#34; moment when our delightful server came out with this dish, placed it in the middle of the table, and lifted up a glass bell cover full of ACTUAL smoke, which wafted up beautifully. By this point we were stuffed beyond belief, but the dessert was really tasty (and despite the upscale presentation, would be a total kid-pleaser). <br><br>Oh and don&#39;t miss their interesting and tasty cocktails!",

"reviewcomment":"Took a couple of out-of-town foodies here the other night wanting to showcase some of what YVR has to offer restaurant-wise. I am so very glad I did. We all agreed it was the very best meal we ALL had ever had! EVER! <br>First off I was very pleasantly surprised (and flattered) when both the bartender William and a host (?) remembered me and specifically came over to say hello!  I had only been there once a couple of months ago and don&#39;t remember doing or saying anything remarkable but that set the tone nicely. <br>Next William listened to our likes and crafted some amazing cocktails for each of us (try the Smoke and Mirrors!) which were amazing,<br>We had seen an Appy and a Main being served at the bar which looked good so one of us knew what he was ordering (Veal Tartare and BBQ Octopus). Another had the Foie Gras and the Duck and I had two Appys - the Fish Tartare and a double order of Sweetbreads ( I LOVE Sweetbreads and it is rare to find them so....). Then we all had desserts - two of us chose the Lemon Tart and the other a Profiteroles-style offering. Talk about died and gone to heaven!!! Simply the very best meal EVER!  After each course we each said what an amazing dish it was and that it couldn&#39;t be beat .... And then the next dish tasted even better! <br>I cannot recommend this place highly enough. You simply cannot get a meal any better. Anywhere in the world.  Bravo!   I can hardly wait to go back!",

"reviewcomment":"My friend and I were excited about trying Vancouver sushi- we heard it was excellent, and probably much better than what we got back in Boston. And indeed it was! We both ordered lychee cocktails, which were sweet and refreshing. I ordered the nigiri plate and a lobster and asparagus temaki. My friend ordered one of the rolls. <br><br>The fish was incredibly tender and fresh- almost buttery in how soft it was. The temaki was great, but could have used a bit more lobster. I did like how easy it was to eat though- sometimes the seaweed wrapper is hard to bite through without totally destroying the roll.<br><br>The staff was attentive, friendly, and joked about that whole Boston-Vancouver hockey thing (we&#39;re not sports fans, so joke away!). <br><br>Very pricey, but I would recommend it.",

"reviewcomment":"I was totally blown away by their food &amp; service last night! my S/O suggested this place as it was in the neighbourhood but I hadn&#39;t been there before. We decided on take out. So I called in our order, and the gentlemen who answered the phone was SO friendly and attentive (which is not the case sometimes at other restaurants when you call to place an order) and told me about 10 - 15 minutes. When I went to pick up the order I was greeted very politely by the staff, and told it would be just a moment and offered a drink while I waited.  Every interaction I had with a staff member was done politely, professional, and welcoming. The place was bustling for a Friday night... but everyone seemed to be on their A-game and happy to be there. <br>I got my food and took it home. <br><br>We ordered a prawn souvlaki and a chicken souvlaki. the food was carefully packaged and divided. They have a unique take-a-way tray that has individual portioned areas for the rice, vegetables, protein/potatoes. they had a separate container for the Greek salad, and another one for the tzakiki. Let me just say this... everything was awesome but the roasted potatoes blew me away. I have NEVER tasted roasted potatoes that were so good in my life. I don&#39;t know what your secret is but they were phenomenal (and I don&#39;t even usually like potatoes too much). Over all it was delicious. Portion sizes were fabulous (I have a little leftover for lunch today.. excited!), and the food was yummy! <br><br>Will definitely be back!!",

"reviewcomment":"Came here the other day for a friend&#39;s birthday and had a great time. Glowbal has always been a fixture in the heart of Yaletown and it never disappoints. I used to get a lot more joy coming here when I was younger - perhaps because there were less restaurants like Glowbal and it&#39;s starting to get overshadowed by many of the other dining options in the area. <br><br>Anyhow, food was excellent as always. I started with the Satay platter (which was shared). Everything came on a stick which I&#39;m a sucker for. I really enjoyed the albacore tuna and the mac and cheese sticks. Who knew mac and cheese could come on a stick? This is a great little sampler that gives you a little of everything for the indecisive.<br><br>I had the lamb shank for my main. The meat was juicy and tender - cooked to perfection. The size of the dish was a little on the small size (I&#39;m a big eater) but I did have the satay plate to start so the post-dinner Micky-D&#39;s run was not necessary.<br><br>Value-wise, I would say it&#39;s okay. For the price, it&#39;s not an amazing deal but Glowbal is consistent and you know what you&#39;re going to get - excellent food in a nice restaurant. Our server was also very friendly and attentive.<br><br>Oh, and parking&#39;s a B*tch.",

"reviewcomment":"Visited for the first time seeing that the reviews were raving. Decors are vintage 70&#39;s with decent upkeep and clean washrooms. This venue is a bistro style eatery so it&#39;s fairly casual- staff and patrons dress smart casual. &#34;Possible&#34; place for a date but seats are tightly spaced and ambient chatter is at a mediocre. If you value privacy and quietness fine dining would be more suitable. <br>It&#39;s a very popular place and a reservation would likely be necessary. On a Friday night (and I assume most other nights) reservations are set at 5:30 or 7:30. There are bar seats which seem to be first come first served.<br>Menu is short and simple, about a dozen appetizers and dito for entrees. Specials are written on the blackboard and they are not introduced by the waiter (casual dining). Pricing is a reasonable average of $19. Our party had the Steak Frites (Hanger Steak) and  FRUITS DE MER PROVENÇAL (assorted seafood in tomato sauce). Both were done to perfection, very fresh seafood and sauce was homemade and not too salty. <br>We split a chocolate mouse cake (forget the exact name) but it had a nutty crust and creamy upper. Very rich, not overly sweet and if you&#39;re not used to eating heavy rich items it&#39;s a good choice for sharing. <br>Although food was great, I would expect better service and slightly &#34;nicer&#34; decors for a 5star wow factor. This venue is comparable to Salade de Fruits.<br>A very trusty venue and I&#39;m sure their quality will continue for years to come.",

"reviewcomment":"I came here with a friend for lunch. I was very hesitant to &#34;settle&#34; for Fable because the lunch menu looked so, for a lack of better word, simple. I gave the benefit of the doubt, walked in with no expectations and came out feeling grateful that I made the right decision to dine here.<br><br>My girlfriend and I shared a Chick Pea Fritter. I ordered a vegetarian tagliatelle. She ordered a duck confit salad minus the goat cheese.<br><br>Chick Pea Fritter was a tad salty but the texture was fantastic. Fritters were shaped individually like the size of a golf ball. It had a great crunch on the outside. I am so glad it wasn&#39;t dry. The saltiness balanced beautifully with the slightly sweet curry mayo. Pickled red onions and fresh pea shoots were refreshing.<br><br>My vegetarian tagliatelle knocked my socks off! The broccolini, tomatoes, etc were cooked beautifully. The tagliatelle was very toothsome. The parmesan foam made the pasta creamy but it didn&#39;t make it heavy. I can rave about this pasta dish all day. It was very very good, seasoned perfectly!<br><br>I had a bite of my girlfriend&#39;s duck confit and it was crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. <br><br>Alana, our server, was attentive, friendly, and just wonderful considering the time we went the restaurant was pretty busy.<br><br>Simple food made with lots of love and fresh quality ingredients coupled with superb service, this place deserves a full 5 stars.",

"reviewcomment":"Because I was visiting Vancouver with my girlfriend, I knew that I had to take her to the famous Hawksworth restaurant (also nice since we were staying at the Rosewood anyway).  My first impression as we entered was that this place was quite a hangout for young professionals.  There seemed to be way too many tables for such a limited dining area.  We were seated and I realized that we were seated so close to the tables beside us that it felt like we were all dining together as a large group.  That being said, everything else was perfect.  <br><br>The food (the only thing I really care about anyways) was immaculate and prepared flawlessly.  It was edgy and familiar all at the same time.  I would highly recommend the tandoori grilled sturgeon!  My girlfriend loved the parmesan crusted chicken (a unique way to prepare chicken, you&#39;ll see).  You can thank me later.  Just kidding, thank me now.<br><br>Pros: The FOOD, the attentive waitstaff, the FOOD<br><br>Cons: Intimate but very noisy, felt a bit too crowded",

"reviewcomment":"I was totally blown away by their food &amp; service last night! my S/O suggested this place as it was in the neighbourhood but I hadn&#39;t been there before. We decided on take out. So I called in our order, and the gentlemen who answered the phone was SO friendly and attentive (which is not the case sometimes at other restaurants when you call to place an order) and told me about 10 - 15 minutes. When I went to pick up the order I was greeted very politely by the staff, and told it would be just a moment and offered a drink while I waited.  Every interaction I had with a staff member was done politely, professional, and welcoming. The place was bustling for a Friday night... but everyone seemed to be on their A-game and happy to be there. <br>I got my food and took it home. <br><br>We ordered a prawn souvlaki and a chicken souvlaki. the food was carefully packaged and divided. They have a unique take-a-way tray that has individual portioned areas for the rice, vegetables, protein/potatoes. they had a separate container for the Greek salad, and another one for the tzakiki. Let me just say this... everything was awesome but the roasted potatoes blew me away. I have NEVER tasted roasted potatoes that were so good in my life. I don&#39;t know what your secret is but they were phenomenal (and I don&#39;t even usually like potatoes too much). Over all it was delicious. Portion sizes were fabulous (I have a little leftover for lunch today.. excited!), and the food was yummy! <br><br>Will definitely be back!!",

"reviewcomment":"This place had great reviews so my dad and I were stoked to try it while on vacation in Vancouver. The place is covered in potted plants and painted in warm colors which was so welcoming after the cold weather outside - it made the place seem cozy and comfortable. We were immediately greeted by the owner of Scoozi&#39;s when we entered, he was really friendly and showed us to our seats. <br>I ordered the eggs Benedict - easily some of the best I&#39;ve ever had. My dad got a deep dish omelette, which was delicious. <br>Everything was awesome - the food, the service, the coffee, the atmosphere. Desert was this brilliant fruit and phyllo dough concoction that was drizzled with honey. Highly recommended. <br>We weren&#39;t disappointed and we&#39;ll definitely come back next time we&#39;re in town. I can&#39;t wait to try the rest of the menu.",

"reviewcomment":"I, just like almost every Vancouver-ite, am a huuuuge brunch fan and after hearing rave reviews about Oakwood, it did not disappoint. <br><br>We made a last minute decision to head over and didn&#39;t get there until about 1:45 and their brunch ends at 2:45. Still a decent amount of people waiting for a table but we did get seated about 2:15. Service was good and fast. Caesars are amazingly good. I ordered a tea, which was fine but I will say the glass beaker thing they serve the hot water in is not great... it does drip a lot of water over the edges.<br><br>We ordered the pork belly with scrambled eggs, fries, etc and the french toast. The pork belly was really really good but the French toast... holy crap I haven&#39;t had anything that good in a long time! Filled with lemon mascarpone, lots of blueberry sauce poured over and then maple syrup to drizzle over to your taste. The size was massive! 3 huge slices and from someone who usually no matter how good it is cannot finish a full plate of food, I was thisclose to licking the plate clean. <br><br>Great food, worth the wait and can&#39;t wait to go back (although not too often as my waistline can&#39;t afford the French toast every week...)",

"reviewcomment":"We&#39;ve been meaning to try this restaurant for a really long time but it kept getting pushed back. Finally got around to it on a nice sunny day after doing a quick check on OpenTable and making a reservation - nice that you can make one on a weekend for brunch!<br><br>We sat on the patio and it took a good 15mins before we even knew who our server was so we didn&#39;t have high hopes for a faster meal, but thankfully it got better. We ordered the homemade lemonade ($2.50, cheap and good!) and an Earl Grey Tea (so good and creamy, I think it&#39;s from Granville Island Tea Co). For our meals, we ordered the Edible Canada Breakfast (scrambled eggs, a sausage, 2 pieces of bacon and either a biscuit or hash browns - we got the biscuit and it was really good!) and the Mushroom Benny (comes with a large salad and the eggs were nice and runny). Portion-wise, we felt the EC Breakfast was on the small side, maybe especially the way it was presented on the plate, looked really sparse. Everything was good, just not quite enough of it. The benny was excellent though, loved the mushrooms and it&#39;s done on a thin biscuit which was so good. <br><br>Service started slow but after we placed our order, our wait for our drinks and then our meal was quick. Really enjoyed being on the patio and they have really pretty hanging baskets and planters!",

Half a star for that visit.<br><br>Second visit six months later we sat in the dining area and it was much better.  The server checked up on us regularly.  There was a separate person checking and refilling water cups every 15 minutes. The host at the front of the restaurant came around to ask each table how everything was. Food was great!  I had a 3 course meal and was thoroughly satiated. Only issue was the table side caesar salad where the server does not announce he is making your salad. You need to pay attention that the salad cart is somewhere nearby.  <br><br>It looks like maybe management is finally taking notice for all those bad reviews here and on urbanspoon. A business can only survive so long with horrible customer service. 4 stars for last visit.",

"reviewcomment":"I LOVE this patio and it is one of my favourite spots in Vancouver to relax with a cold cider in hand. The view is fantastic and I also like the fact that they have a good cider on tap. I also enjoy their tacos. Their menu is not the most celiac-friendly one you could find (they used to offer gluten free pasta and buns but no longer do, as I understand) but they do have gluten free pizza.<br><br>I have had multiple good experiences here, including one where we managed to get a large group on the patio, which is always very challenging in Vancouver&#39;s very popular and very short patio season. The food is nothing special for me but the attraction here is the good service and the patio atmosphere.",

"reviewcomment":"Best AYCE place I&#39;ve ever been to hands down. When you combine Korean and Japanese food... It can&#39;t get any better! It&#39;s Yakiniku style and we went here for dinner. It was about $25 each person for dinner and boy we made our monies worth. I don&#39;t usually eat much, but luckily that night I could handle my own. <br><br>It&#39;s crazy how the night before we came here we ate at a Japanese restaurant where the toro (5-7 pieces or so) was pretty pricey and then we come here and order over 20 toro sushi plus all our other food for WAY less. <br><br>We got seated pretty quickly for a party of 4. You sit down and you can look over the menu and then the guy hands you a sheet of paper to tally how many you would like to order. After they bring your food and it looks like you need to order some more, they give you another sheet of paper to order and so on.<br><br>If I ever come back to Vancouver, this will be the spot to hit up.",

"reviewcomment":"I was totally blown away by their food &amp; service last night! my S/O suggested this place as it was in the neighbourhood but I hadn&#39;t been there before. We decided on take out. So I called in our order, and the gentlemen who answered the phone was SO friendly and attentive (which is not the case sometimes at other restaurants when you call to place an order) and told me about 10 - 15 minutes. When I went to pick up the order I was greeted very politely by the staff, and told it would be just a moment and offered a drink while I waited.  Every interaction I had with a staff member was done politely, professional, and welcoming. The place was bustling for a Friday night... but everyone seemed to be on their A-game and happy to be there. <br>I got my food and took it home. <br><br>We ordered a prawn souvlaki and a chicken souvlaki. the food was carefully packaged and divided. They have a unique take-a-way tray that has individual portioned areas for the rice, vegetables, protein/potatoes. they had a separate container for the Greek salad, and another one for the tzakiki. Let me just say this... everything was awesome but the roasted potatoes blew me away. I have NEVER tasted roasted potatoes that were so good in my life. I don&#39;t know what your secret is but they were phenomenal (and I don&#39;t even usually like potatoes too much). Over all it was delicious. Portion sizes were fabulous (I have a little leftover for lunch today.. excited!), and the food was yummy! <br><br>Will definitely be back!!",

How did they get their hands on such bomb ass fish?<br><br>I ordered a la carte while my girlfriend and her mom ordered omakase. While I didn&#39;t get to try the whole sequence, I was thoroughly impressed by the unique variety of fish the chef prepared for them. Believe me, it&#39;s not just some hack serving you salmon and tamago, it&#39;s some fish I ain&#39;t even heard of before (and I used to work at a sushi restaurant)!<br><br>It ain&#39;t cheap though: I believe it was a minimum of $40 per person, but boy was it worth it. My girlfriend&#39;s mom was so happy with the food she told me it was the best meal she had in years.<br><br>As for myself, I ordered hamachi (yellowtail), tuna, and toro (tuna belly) ngiri. The tuna was sooo good. I thought they made a mistake and gave me all tuna belly. When I order yellowtail, I usually only order it for some variety so that I&#39;m not only eating tuna. However, their&#39;s here was just on another level.<br><br>This place has made me give sushi a second chance. It really is that outstanding. <br><br>My recommendation: skip the all you can eat and take your money here instead. You won&#39;t be disappointed.<br><br>100th review yay!",

"reviewcomment":"I had a really lovely evening here on Sunday...first time at the Main Street location although I&#39;ve been to the Kits one many times.<br><br>On this occasion, my friend and I didn&#39;t have solid plans aside from having a great dinner but it evolved into a memorable experience. We were seated in the area between the upper and lower floor fairly quickly upon arrival. <br><br>I didn&#39;t feel up to doing the feast so I went with a single roti roll--the Ghandi&#39;s breakfast which has spinach and mushrooms. These plates come with a side salad and cup of dhal. This was a very tasty vegetarian roll...in the past, I&#39;ve also really enjoyed the Mughal and the Silk Route but I&#39;ve been making an effort to do a meatless dinner at least once a week and dinners out count!<br><br>We decided to stick around to have some chai after dinner (the little cup they give you upon sitting down makes you want more!) and then the magic happened in the form of a live band playing on stage. As the room got dark after the sun went down, the ambiance dialled up.<br><br>Our server explained to us that the owners really support music...that the band isn&#39;t just brought in for the benefit of the restaurant. Apparently a cover charge of $2 is collected on live music nights (shows start around 7:30) but we started our meal closer to 6 pm so the host wasn&#39;t sure of our intentions. We happily threw in a little extra to the bill to support the band. Furthermore, the server mentioned that she is a musician herself and that when she needs time to record or anything else related to her music, the owners happily accommodate her needs. <br><br>Did I mention that the chai is highly addictive and will have you dreaming of it for days?? <br><br>This is a great casual spot, cute for a date or a group dinner--there was a mix of different diners from families with young kids to older couples to groups of friends. I think it&#39;d be fun to splurge on the feast with a bunch of other people and enjoy music on another occasion.",

The winter punch was something I could drink a gallon of (or drink until I got drunk).",

"reviewcomment":"I have been to Las Margaritas twice so in the last 3 months. Once for a Dine Out and the other just casually with a friend of mine.<br><br> For you drivers out there, there are plenty of parking spaces down 4th Ave as well as some free spaces in the neighborhood.<br><br>If you go here, you MUST get one of their margaritas, I love their strawberry margarita as it is quite fresh (Strawberry pieces in it)  and has a slushy texture to it.<br><br>The food is very fresh and flavorful both times I ate here. My last visit I had the Enchiladas and my friend had the Baha Tacos. We both enjoyed our meals but the Baha Tacos were just &#34;ok.&#34;  The Enchiladas were delicious and very filling as it comes with rice and beans as well. We had the jalapeno poppers as an appy and I do not recommend them.<br><br>The atmosphere of this place was very friendly and while we waited for our spot in line, we had a few drinks at the bar and the service was quick and friendly. My friend actually forgot her expensive jacket at the bar when we were seated and the bartender brought it over to us. Bonus points.<br><br>Now comes where I knocked down a star. The service. The restaurant gets very busy and orders may have been muddled up. What happened was we waited quite a long time for our food. We decided to order everything at once and we ordered margaritas, an appetizer, and our entrees. After about 15-20 minutes of waiting we asked where the food was and turns out there was an issue with the kitchen. Now here&#39;s the kicker, our food came out in reverse order which they should have been served. We got our entrees, then came the appetizer, and then our drinks!<br><br>I am a pretty easy going guy so I still left a good tip considering how good the food was and everyone working there seemed to be very welcoming and nice.",

"reviewcomment":"Another great find in Vancouver! <br>- Fast and friendly service. <br>- Plenty of meter parking on Broadway.<br>- Very busy on the weekends. If you want a table I would recommend making a reservation.<br>-  Open kitchen, so the atmosphere is loud as the kitchen crew communicates.<br>- Movies play on the projection screen near the bar... Last night was Star Wars lol.<br>-  Sharing menu, so portions are small, you&#39;ll need to order quite a bit... But don&#39;t worry prices are reasonable.<br><br>Food<br>Tomato kimchi - good to try for the first time, I wouldn&#39;t order it again my self because I didn&#39;t like the texture but the flavours are nice.<br>Tuna Tataki - delicious, love the chilli oil on it.<br>My Ebi Mayo - deep fried prawns with spicy mayo sauce, to die for, this was my fav.<br>Oxtail ramen - Good, wish there was more meat, wasn&#39;t sure if I liked the broth or not, don&#39;t know if ill order again. I never had oxtail before so I gave it a try.<br>Grilled duck - very good, comes with tomato and green apple yum!<br>Earl grey creme brûlée - so good! A must try.<br><br>Can&#39;t wait to go again, so many other things I want to try on the menu.",

"reviewcomment":"Great down town location. One of the best dim sum restaurants in Vancouver. Arrived at 1pm for lunch and were seated immediately. The service was professional and fast, other than one dish. But we were told that it takes longer time to prepare it. I&#39;ve read some reviews complaining that the dishes are small?!! We are talking about Dim Sum here!!! I did not find them to be small at all. Prices are a bit high, but they are in line, if not cheaper, with similar &#34;posh&#34; restaurants.<br><br>Large restaurant with modern décor. I like more of the traditional Chinese décor, but the food is most important for evaluation.",

"reviewcomment":"I was totally blown away by their food &amp; service last night! my S/O suggested this place as it was in the neighbourhood but I hadn&#39;t been there before. We decided on take out. So I called in our order, and the gentlemen who answered the phone was SO friendly and attentive (which is not the case sometimes at other restaurants when you call to place an order) and told me about 10 - 15 minutes. When I went to pick up the order I was greeted very politely by the staff, and told it would be just a moment and offered a drink while I waited.  Every interaction I had with a staff member was done politely, professional, and welcoming. The place was bustling for a Friday night... but everyone seemed to be on their A-game and happy to be there. <br>I got my food and took it home. <br><br>We ordered a prawn souvlaki and a chicken souvlaki. the food was carefully packaged and divided. They have a unique take-a-way tray that has individual portioned areas for the rice, vegetables, protein/potatoes. they had a separate container for the Greek salad, and another one for the tzakiki. Let me just say this... everything was awesome but the roasted potatoes blew me away. I have NEVER tasted roasted potatoes that were so good in my life. I don&#39;t know what your secret is but they were phenomenal (and I don&#39;t even usually like potatoes too much). Over all it was delicious. Portion sizes were fabulous (I have a little leftover for lunch today.. excited!), and the food was yummy! <br><br>Will definitely be back!!",

If you&#39;re expecting the regular simple wooden furniture found in a modest Japanese Restaurant, then this isn&#39;t the place for you. The stylist decor comes along with equally stylist looking servers who gives good recommendations and are very attentive at all times.<br>The food is not more fusion than traditional but is very delicious, nevertheless. The alcohol pricing are on the higher side.<br>However, with great service and good food comes huge prices too!

"reviewcomment":"CinCin does not disappoint!<br><br>I was asked to find a restaurant with available reservations by 7 pm on a friday evening (yikes!). I was pleasantly surprised to see an opening at CinCin.<br>The four of us set out not knowing what to expect --- two members of the group are &#39;paleo&#39; while my other half has to eat gluten-free out of necessity.<br><br>We arrived a little under dressed, but they didn&#39;t seem to mind and still treated us well. We started out with a few drinks at the bar; mine being one of the best old fashioned&#39;s I&#39;d had in a very long time. <br><br>We had the Carpaccio as a starter - perfectly tender and seasoned. I had the Halibut special (in season!) served with white bean puree, swiss chard, and magic. I have no idea how that piece of fish was so tender and juicy. My husband was well-informed about his gluten options and loved the Sea Bass with fingerling potatoes. Our paleo friends were happy with their perfectly cooked, tender, well seasoned venison loin and short ribs. We topped it off with chocolate mousse (beautiful presentation) and a good coffee.<br><br>This place is top notch: great service, good drinks, fantastic food etc... It is on the pricey side, but worth every penny.",

"reviewcomment":"Yes indeed the &#39;too cool for school&#39; vibe was present even without anyone else around. We arrived just as they opened. Definitely cocktail-centric, though the food offerings were really quite tasty. <br><br>No, the &#39;seared&#39; rockfish was NOT seared, but breaded and fried.. Not my favourite at all but oh well just a small part of a fun appetizer styled meal. We did enjoy and we also enjoyed the pricey gourmet drinks. <br><br>My  only legit complaint (I knew it&#39;d be pricey so no complainin&#39; bout dat!) was the 1960&#39;s Beatles elevator music. Seriously, you guys may think it&#39;s cool because no one plays it, but maybe it&#39;s because no one wants to hear it!  Muzak sucked back then and even more today. I declined another drink so we could get the hell out. Sadly they changed it to good ole Blue Eyes as we were leaving.. Oh well. <br><br>Would be an awesome after work place..

Also got the noodle salad and it was vinegery, refreshing, and tasty w/ octopus. The bf and I also ordered a rainbow roll and a couple pieces of ikura. <br><br>All the fish used here were fresh, especially the salmon. They only use atlantic salmon, not the farm fresh kind. Service was efficient and quick. We dined in for dinner and they offer a large communal table as well as some bar seats. It filled up pretty fast and there were tons of to-go orders waiting to be picked up, but we came early enough that we just missed the rush. <br><br>Definitely would go back.",

"reviewcomment":"I was totally blown away by their food &amp; service last night! my S/O suggested this place as it was in the neighbourhood but I hadn&#39;t been there before. We decided on take out. So I called in our order, and the gentlemen who answered the phone was SO friendly and attentive (which is not the case sometimes at other restaurants when you call to place an order) and told me about 10 - 15 minutes. When I went to pick up the order I was greeted very politely by the staff, and told it would be just a moment and offered a drink while I waited.  Every interaction I had with a staff member was done politely, professional, and welcoming. The place was bustling for a Friday night... but everyone seemed to be on their A-game and happy to be there. <br>I got my food and took it home. <br><br>We ordered a prawn souvlaki and a chicken souvlaki. the food was carefully packaged and divided. They have a unique take-a-way tray that has individual portioned areas for the rice, vegetables, protein/potatoes. they had a separate container for the Greek salad, and another one for the tzakiki. Let me just say this... everything was awesome but the roasted potatoes blew me away. I have NEVER tasted roasted potatoes that were so good in my life. I don&#39;t know what your secret is but they were phenomenal (and I don&#39;t even usually like potatoes too much). Over all it was delicious. Portion sizes were fabulous (I have a little leftover for lunch today.. excited!), and the food was yummy! <br><br>Will definitely be back!!",

I kind of feel it deserves an extra star for being a great &#34;space&#34; and an anchor of the revival of Chinatown (while keeping within the theme).<br><br>This place is just plain cool,.. a place to be seen.  The beautiful people go here to have their iPhone pictures taken with nice backgrounds. <br><br>The cocktail menu is expensive but interesting.  The same goes for the food and I really like the adherence to an asian style dish.  However,.. the portions are very, very small for what you pay.  <br><br>In many ways, I feel this place is kind of like Wild Rice used to be,.. maybe the hipster evolution of there would be a good way to describe it.",

"reviewcomment":"Solid Cantonese style food. Go in the morning for some congee and fried dough bread w some noodles. Their congee is really smooth and yummy. The best should be the preserved egg w porc or the beef congee.<br><br>For dim sum you can get their rice noodle wraps as now they have the lotus leaf rice which is very savory and filling. Try their noodle soup with braised beef or wonton noodles. Don&#39;t forget to try the delicious BBQ porc and duck that they have made themselves!<br><br>Always good about fresh seafood- order a steamed fish or a crab at night time. Don&#39;t forget to try the silky smooth scrambles egg rice w beef with rice noodles. Delish!<br><br>Love their lemon iced tea drink and their HK style milk coffee tea, too bad they don&#39;t give you chip ice w it.<br><br>Pretty fast service and if packed you usually have to wait 10-15 min or not if you don&#39;t mid sharing w other hungry strangers. Don&#39;t min the noise level- it&#39;s the usual canto banter you&#39;ll hear at any congee noodle house cheap eat anywhere in the world. Immerse yourself in the culture;)",

They are so nice and they know when to come. A great costumer service will give you a great environment to enjoy the food.  <br>Last time I went there with my husband and we orders the dinner meals for two. It was so much food! The mongo sales are so fresh, I can tests the summer! The cod fish is the best! So yummy and so much favors! The seafood are well prepared and fresh like just from the ocean! The beef curry an beans were a bit spicy for me, but my husband love it! The four main dish just a great balance! Oh my god the fried banana with ice cream! It always makes my day! In the middle, the waiter always come the right moment to take the empty place, ask about the food or add water! I don&#39;t feel them but enjoy the great service! The services make the biggest different between this place and others! <br>Of course they have other great food there too! Like pineapple rice or the shrimp! Go a head, u won&#39;t order any bad dish! <br>Love it and they are the best!",

"reviewcomment":"I was totally blown away by their food &amp; service last night! my S/O suggested this place as it was in the neighbourhood but I hadn&#39;t been there before. We decided on take out. So I called in our order, and the gentlemen who answered the phone was SO friendly and attentive (which is not the case sometimes at other restaurants when you call to place an order) and told me about 10 - 15 minutes. When I went to pick up the order I was greeted very politely by the staff, and told it would be just a moment and offered a drink while I waited.  Every interaction I had with a staff member was done politely, professional, and welcoming. The place was bustling for a Friday night... but everyone seemed to be on their A-game and happy to be there. <br>I got my food and took it home. <br><br>We ordered a prawn souvlaki and a chicken souvlaki. the food was carefully packaged and divided. They have a unique take-a-way tray that has individual portioned areas for the rice, vegetables, protein/potatoes. they had a separate container for the Greek salad, and another one for the tzakiki. Let me just say this... everything was awesome but the roasted potatoes blew me away. I have NEVER tasted roasted potatoes that were so good in my life. I don&#39;t know what your secret is but they were phenomenal (and I don&#39;t even usually like potatoes too much). Over all it was delicious. Portion sizes were fabulous (I have a little leftover for lunch today.. excited!), and the food was yummy! <br><br>Will definitely be back!!",

"reviewcomment":"[Pull my noodle]<br><br>I&#39;ve been coming here over the last month or so to get my noodle fix. The noodles are prepared fresh each day in one of many ways - pulled, sliced, dragged, pushed, etc. It&#39;s made from the same dough and it really just dictates how the noodles look in the end. I found it really cool that they have the big glass window so you can watch the chef make them. The soup they come in is very tasty as well - a lot less salty than other noodle houses. Portion sizes are decent as well - a big eater would certainly be full. If not, I&#39;d recommend adding a side of pork&amp;chive dumplings. I quite enjoy them with malt vinegar.<br><br>Shaolin is located a block from the main hub that is Cambie and Broadway. It can get busy in there but I&#39;ve never had to wait for a table. There&#39;s street parking on Broadway and they also have a limited number of free spots in the back. The decor inside looks straight out of a 70s American movie - over the top tacky chinese decor but it almost seems they do it purposely. And it works. Service is just okay nothing to write home about.<br><br>All in all, great little noodle house worth a visit.",

"reviewcomment":"Warning: Extremely busy brunch time, and you may not get seated right away. Once inside, waiting for food may also take a long time. BUT IT IS TOTALLY WORTH IT.<br><br>My boyfriend&#39;s family was in town and I thought it&#39;d be nice to buy them brunch before they left (as they have been very kind to me over the years). My original plan was to take them to Cafe Medina but I didn&#39;t anticipate the long line on Sunday (now that I look back, WHAT WAS I THINKING??). Looking up Provence Marinaside as another option, we quickly made a reservation over the phone, which they graciously accepted. <br><br>The decor is very warm and fancy-esque, but we were more impressed with the menu itself! The Seafood Crepe was so delicate yet flavourful, which is now enlisted as my favourite dish to have. Aside from their amazing dishes, the sexy drinks of various mimosa were also wonderful as well. <br><br>Overall, the family really enjoyed it, even the pickiest members to please! I highly recommend this place for their flavours and portion!",

"reviewcomment":"Vancouver has a way of doing &#34;hipster&#34; right, with all the funky aesthetic and far less of the crap attitude. This place, on the surface looked a bit &#34;quirky for quirky&#39;s sake&#34;, but was actually really charming. The staff were super friendly and down-to-earth in that awesome way that only Canadians seem to have mastered, but by far the most amazing thing was the food. WOW. Each dish was even more incredible than the last, and the portions were hefty for tapas. The place is a bit spendy, but the quality is great and the entire dining experience was fantastic. The only complaint (from not just us but other tables) was that the music was a bit too loud for such a small space.<br><br>Note for Disabled: Reasonably accessible, but space is very small and  crowded. Metered street parking or pay lot only.<br><br>* Know that if you have a Washington State disabled placard it will work for parking in disabled spaces in B.C., but unlike here you actually have to feed the parking meters if you park on the street (learned that one the hard way).*",

"reviewcomment":"I was totally blown away by their food &amp; service last night! my S/O suggested this place as it was in the neighbourhood but I hadn&#39;t been there before. We decided on take out. So I called in our order, and the gentlemen who answered the phone was SO friendly and attentive (which is not the case sometimes at other restaurants when you call to place an order) and told me about 10 - 15 minutes. When I went to pick up the order I was greeted very politely by the staff, and told it would be just a moment and offered a drink while I waited.  Every interaction I had with a staff member was done politely, professional, and welcoming. The place was bustling for a Friday night... but everyone seemed to be on their A-game and happy to be there. <br>I got my food and took it home. <br><br>We ordered a prawn souvlaki and a chicken souvlaki. the food was carefully packaged and divided. They have a unique take-a-way tray that has individual portioned areas for the rice, vegetables, protein/potatoes. they had a separate container for the Greek salad, and another one for the tzakiki. Let me just say this... everything was awesome but the roasted potatoes blew me away. I have NEVER tasted roasted potatoes that were so good in my life. I don&#39;t know what your secret is but they were phenomenal (and I don&#39;t even usually like potatoes too much). Over all it was delicious. Portion sizes were fabulous (I have a little leftover for lunch today.. excited!), and the food was yummy! <br><br>Will definitely be back!!",

"reviewcomment":"To the guy who burst into the front of the line on a very busy Friday night complaining that you didn&#39;t get salsa with your order, then threatened to walk out when you were going to be charged for it, I just want you to know that I payed for it. Enjoy it. <br><br>Afterwards, I proceeded to enjoy (without complaint or regret) the best burrito I have ever had. This is the second time I&#39;ve been to this place and I will continue to bring friends here. The atmosphere is happy and bright, the staff are very hard working and friendly, and the food is just damn delicious. I would personally recommend the chorizo con queso burrito. Breathtaking. <br><br>However, if you have a large takeout order, be prepared to pay for salsa. Please don&#39;t be a dick about it.",

"reviewcomment":"I was totally blown away by their food &amp; service last night! my S/O suggested this place as it was in the neighbourhood but I hadn&#39;t been there before. We decided on take out. So I called in our order, and the gentlemen who answered the phone was SO friendly and attentive (which is not the case sometimes at other restaurants when you call to place an order) and told me about 10 - 15 minutes. When I went to pick up the order I was greeted very politely by the staff, and told it would be just a moment and offered a drink while I waited.  Every interaction I had with a staff member was done politely, professional, and welcoming. The place was bustling for a Friday night... but everyone seemed to be on their A-game and happy to be there. <br>I got my food and took it home. <br><br>We ordered a prawn souvlaki and a chicken souvlaki. the food was carefully packaged and divided. They have a unique take-a-way tray that has individual portioned areas for the rice, vegetables, protein/potatoes. they had a separate container for the Greek salad, and another one for the tzakiki. Let me just say this... everything was awesome but the roasted potatoes blew me away. I have NEVER tasted roasted potatoes that were so good in my life. I don&#39;t know what your secret is but they were phenomenal (and I don&#39;t even usually like potatoes too much). Over all it was delicious. Portion sizes were fabulous (I have a little leftover for lunch today.. excited!), and the food was yummy! <br><br>Will definitely be back!!",

Attentive but not intrusive, polite and classy. <br>Atmosphere: Love the balance of space and intimacy. <br>Price: expect first tier restaurant pricing and weighing all aspects, I deem worthy of a visit. <br><br>I had my doubts about West, especially given there are a few comparable choices in downtown and in close proximity to après-dinner activities but I believe it&#39;s spotlight is overshadowed and deserves a revisit. <br><br>Cherrio!",

"reviewcomment":"I would say that Lins is one of the better Chinese restaurants in Vancouver--great Chinese comfort food! I would recommend you to go for the lunch special. With the price set at 7.99 (before tax and tip), its definitely more worth it than doing dinner here. The lunch special comes with 1 soup, 1 main course and 1 rice. I usually get the mixed vegetable tofu while my partner gets the honey prawns, which is absolutely delicious (but you do get thirsty after awhile)! The chicken corn soup is also very tasty and its served quickly, assuaging your hunger. <br><br>Like many other reviewers have commented, the xiao long baos are phenomenal. The skin is not too thick and its very juicy. Its also pretty cool to watch some of the staff members work on making the xiao long baos at the counter.  <br><br>If there&#39;s anything to be improved on, it would be the service offered... sometimes they may be a little abrasive (totally dependent on their mood) If they raise this standard, this place would be a solid 4-star restaurant with affordable offerings.",

It was flavorful - HOT!!! I have no clue what kind of sauces (green and orange) are provided on the table, but they are worth trying. Overall, the food is cheap and worth every penny. It has a great hip vibe.<br><br>My only criticisms are about dining in. The dining area is kind of tight. There is extra seating downstairs in the basement. The trash was overflowing with garbage and flies. I will argue that it adds to the experience.",

"reviewcomment":"I was totally blown away by their food &amp; service last night! my S/O suggested this place as it was in the neighbourhood but I hadn&#39;t been there before. We decided on take out. So I called in our order, and the gentlemen who answered the phone was SO friendly and attentive (which is not the case sometimes at other restaurants when you call to place an order) and told me about 10 - 15 minutes. When I went to pick up the order I was greeted very politely by the staff, and told it would be just a moment and offered a drink while I waited.  Every interaction I had with a staff member was done politely, professional, and welcoming. The place was bustling for a Friday night... but everyone seemed to be on their A-game and happy to be there. <br>I got my food and took it home. <br><br>We ordered a prawn souvlaki and a chicken souvlaki. the food was carefully packaged and divided. They have a unique take-a-way tray that has individual portioned areas for the rice, vegetables, protein/potatoes. they had a separate container for the Greek salad, and another one for the tzakiki. Let me just say this... everything was awesome but the roasted potatoes blew me away. I have NEVER tasted roasted potatoes that were so good in my life. I don&#39;t know what your secret is but they were phenomenal (and I don&#39;t even usually like potatoes too much). Over all it was delicious. Portion sizes were fabulous (I have a little leftover for lunch today.. excited!), and the food was yummy! <br><br>Will definitely be back!!",

High quality, fresh ingredients. At under $15 for a meal, the value is also amazing.<br><br>To boot, the decor is beautiful and the service is friendly.<br><br>Unfortunately, no booze at this location; I would have never thought I&#39;d rate a &#39;dry&#39; restaurant 5 stars, but the food is just that good!

This was REAL apple juice; it wasn&#39;t that apple-flavored sugar water we were used to. My boyfriend ordered the Zimmer and a side of potatoes. I ordered the Meat Lovers  omelette that came with two slices of multigrain toast.<br><br>As the morning went on even more people came in. The customer service was good and so was our food.

"reviewcomment":"OH WHAT A GLORIOUS DAY! The day I finally get to try this hallowed of all food trucks. Because melted Cheese between bread is just. that. awesome.<br><br>I had the gluten free dairy free plain old grilled cheese. I was concerned that it would be super small and disappointing. BUT what&#39;s this?? They gave me two sandwiches! Arrrr! (Pirate voice of approval)<br><br>I don&#39;t eat grilled cheese that often. It would be a LOT cheaper to just buy a loaf of gf bread and some daiya cheese and make this myself. That being said, this is a special downtown experience that we don&#39;t get on a regular basis so the price was fine with me. My husband&#39;s regular grilled cheese looked amazing. They put potato chips at the bottom of the paper and give you a tasty pickle. I don&#39;t like potato chips (gave them to hubby) but it makes for a well balanced meal. Carbs with your Carbs and salty carbs. Yes, that is balanced. On a weekend that is what I call a fine meal.<br><br>Super friendly service! They all waved at our little one and the one lady came out to say hi to her. They offered her a piece of cheese, but alas, like me, she gets zits if she has any dairy products. Poor little one. She had a potato chip which she loved.. doesn&#39;t take after me in that department. (And no I don&#39;t normally feed her potato chips. She was dying to have what I was eating so that kept her busy. Have to put that in cuz some people FREAK out about babies. Mine is on a super healthy mostly veggie diet FYI)<br><br>So yes, it IS pricey. And not very healthy. But I will go back. And I will bring others. If I was a rich downtownie I would throw caution to the wind and frequent this truck. Cuz if I was rich I could also laser off any fat deposits right? That&#39;s what rich people do right? haha <br><br>Gluten free/Diary free Grilled cheese is a rare delicacy worth checking out ! Bring cash (LOTS) or power walk to the nearest bank like we did. Already counting the minutes until my next visit. 57... 58... 59...",

"reviewcomment":"We held our wedding here and felt they really delivered.<br><br>I have eaten here years ago and felt that the food was excellent, and service equally so, but not pushing the envelope in any way.  The review below was specifically about our wedding experience.<br><br>The servers were fantastic, as was the woman that dealt with all of the wedding arrangements.  No details was not covered (though I suspect we were low maintenance). They really went out of their way to make our 50 person party feel special.  The &#34;fireplace room&#34; was perfect for a wedding, private yet we could feel the vibe of the place in the other parts.  We had use of the patio which was also great as it was sunny.<br><br>You can opt for many custom meal packages and the standard cake cutting fees apply, plus there are options for microphones etc.  The room itself hardly needs any decorations and is lined with nice windows on 2 sides.<br><br>The food was maybe a slight notch below the restaurant fare but that is a high standard to hit when you are talking 50 people and still fantastic (many of our guests really, really were enthusiastic about it and the service and told us so).  I had the seafood medley form our set menu choices as did my new wife!<br><br>I highly recommend this place for your wedding, in part because the lighting helped the photographer quite a bit.",

"reviewcomment":"Be prepared for a heavier, meat centered meal where the food is boldly flavoured and meant for sharing. Atmosphere is great. It&#39;s comfortable, stylish, perfect for trying new types of expertly prepared food. They&#39;re constantly updating their menu, which keeps me coming back. <br><br>Servers are welcoming, informative, and efficient. Sometimes it&#39;s hard to pay attention to what is on the fresh sheet due to unfamiliar ingredients, but the servers are capable of answering questions. I recommend ordering from the fresh sheet!!!<br><br>Drink list is wonderfully extensive. Cocktails are fun to try and neatly organized under specific flavour profiles for easier decision making. They also come in pretty glassware! <br><br>Some dishes I&#39;ve had in the past...<br>Pork rinds: taste good but stick to your teeth<br>Bone marrow: very rich, delicious if you&#39;re into the fatty texture<br>Farm egg tapioca: if you are open minded, and like runny yolk, you have to try this<br>Foie gras torchon: generous amounts of foie gras for the amount of bread (not complaining)<br>Halibut: one of the lighter dishes in my opinion, fish was cooked perfectly, seaweed gives it a great taste<br>Smoked quail: the time I had it, it was slightly undercooked. More difficult to eat with the small bones and all... A hands on dish.<br>Dessert: always had a good experience with their cheesecakes.",

"reviewcomment":"I was totally blown away by their food &amp; service last night! my S/O suggested this place as it was in the neighbourhood but I hadn&#39;t been there before. We decided on take out. So I called in our order, and the gentlemen who answered the phone was SO friendly and attentive (which is not the case sometimes at other restaurants when you call to place an order) and told me about 10 - 15 minutes. When I went to pick up the order I was greeted very politely by the staff, and told it would be just a moment and offered a drink while I waited.  Every interaction I had with a staff member was done politely, professional, and welcoming. The place was bustling for a Friday night... but everyone seemed to be on their A-game and happy to be there. <br>I got my food and took it home. <br><br>We ordered a prawn souvlaki and a chicken souvlaki. the food was carefully packaged and divided. They have a unique take-a-way tray that has individual portioned areas for the rice, vegetables, protein/potatoes. they had a separate container for the Greek salad, and another one for the tzakiki. Let me just say this... everything was awesome but the roasted potatoes blew me away. I have NEVER tasted roasted potatoes that were so good in my life. I don&#39;t know what your secret is but they were phenomenal (and I don&#39;t even usually like potatoes too much). Over all it was delicious. Portion sizes were fabulous (I have a little leftover for lunch today.. excited!), and the food was yummy! <br><br>Will definitely be back!!",

Cinnamon and spiced butter that accompanied the bread were great.<br><br>Unfortunately 3 of the popular items, including the one that caught my attention, the pulled duck benny, sold out. <br><br>I ordered the protein and It did not disappoint was great balance of egg, bacon and veg on a crispy tart crust. It tasted really fresh, I would definitely order it again. <br><br>The atmosphere is cool and funky in the inside - a tad too dark for me, but luckily I got to seated beside the windows where I got to enjoy a rare sunny day.",

I&#39;ve tried the other ramen as well and they are all very tasty but I always end up with the black tonkotsu because of the rich broth.  My boyfriend and I always share the gyoza as well. It&#39;s always cooked just right. <br><br>It can get quite busy here. If it&#39;s full inside and people are queued outside, you write your name down on the clipboard and wait for your name to be called. The staff here are all friendly. They are all Japanese and their service reflects that - you need to flag them down if you want something (although they will refill your water glasses). My only gripe is that when it&#39;s full, it&#39;s quite tight inside and you need to be careful not to go bumping the next tables when you try to sit in/get out.",

We were seated away into a more secluded spot, away from the busy areas, which was a quick bonus.<br><br>The menu is well composed and the prices are not a big bother to the wallet, considering the location of the restaurant and the overall presentation. I ordered the chicken souvlaki with a side of skinny fries. The food arrived shortly after ordering and I fell in love with the thin, crispy fries. The only thing was that the chicken was a bit overly charred and the souvlaki had too much hummus to my liking. I couldn&#39;t finish my meal even though I really wish I could&#39;ve.<br><br>Joeys finished our night in a great tone, and I can&#39;t wait to go for another little special occasion.",

"reviewcomment":"This place is exceptional and really puts other not-so-great fine-dining options on Granville St. to shame. Ambience, food, drinks, service - they nailed it all. We were a party of 3 served by Keith and was incredibly impressed by his care and timing in fulfilling our special occasion requests, asking how we&#39;re doing throughout the meal (with good humor), refilling our glasses at just the right moments. All of this reminded me of my first time at The Refinery some time ago and why I was so glad to be back.<br><br>Their food&#39;s wonderful. I think I&#39;ve tried several plates that were too similar in flavors (Ratatouilles, gnoccchi, meatballs, prawns), but I trust they have something for everyone. Next time I&#39;m going for the scallops and charcuterie.",

"reviewcomment":"This little PINK hole in the wall Vietnamese joint is on main st before 33rd. It is manned by staff of Cantonese speaking Vietnamese. The restaurant is not that large and is pretty much seat yourself and you shall be serviced. Parking might be difficult to find during peak dining hours but it shouldn&#39;t be hard.<br><br>The restaurant is pretty dang small, its the size of a normal house&#39;s living room. The menu is just as simplistic as the restaurant itself! Mostly staple items found in all Pho houses, no more and no less. Their pho soup base is the real deal, not overly sweet and rich. If you&#39;ve ever encountered a very sweet pho soup, its a sign of powdered crap and not from the natural stewing of daikon radish and spices. Also they allow substitutions for noodles of choices such as lai-fun, hor-fun, etc. The meatballs are of the good stuff, probably made by Kim Chau on Kingsway which is the main supplier of Vietnamese products in Vancouver.<br><br>It was on a rainy cold night where my brother brought me to Au Petit because I was dying from a cold and couldnt eat much solid foods. You cant go wrong with a regular Pho can you? So I ordered that with hor-fun because the dried rice noodles that come with most Pho is disgusting and over-filling. Remember, true Pho is always served with fresh hor-fun and not that dried stuff, same with Bun Bo Hue which gets lai-fun. At last, some food...and it smelt and looked good! It reminded me of those weekends where I would go to my aunt&#39;s place to eat pho because i asked her to make it. So good~~~~~~<br><br>Not much to say as of yet, but preliminary meal suggests its daymn good.<br><br>An authentic four, out of five!",

"reviewcomment":"I was totally blown away by their food &amp; service last night! my S/O suggested this place as it was in the neighbourhood but I hadn&#39;t been there before. We decided on take out. So I called in our order, and the gentlemen who answered the phone was SO friendly and attentive (which is not the case sometimes at other restaurants when you call to place an order) and told me about 10 - 15 minutes. When I went to pick up the order I was greeted very politely by the staff, and told it would be just a moment and offered a drink while I waited.  Every interaction I had with a staff member was done politely, professional, and welcoming. The place was bustling for a Friday night... but everyone seemed to be on their A-game and happy to be there. <br>I got my food and took it home. <br><br>We ordered a prawn souvlaki and a chicken souvlaki. the food was carefully packaged and divided. They have a unique take-a-way tray that has individual portioned areas for the rice, vegetables, protein/potatoes. they had a separate container for the Greek salad, and another one for the tzakiki. Let me just say this... everything was awesome but the roasted potatoes blew me away. I have NEVER tasted roasted potatoes that were so good in my life. I don&#39;t know what your secret is but they were phenomenal (and I don&#39;t even usually like potatoes too much). Over all it was delicious. Portion sizes were fabulous (I have a little leftover for lunch today.. excited!), and the food was yummy! <br><br>Will definitely be back!!",

"reviewcomment":"Kishimoto is one of my fave Japanese restaurants in Vancouver and the only reason why I don&#39;t go more often is because it&#39;s so small and the lineups are so long unless you&#39;re there early or late. You can tell how busy they&#39;ve gotten by the big signs outside and inside the door explaining their wait system. Make sure you put your name down on the sheet as soon as you get there! We had a friend who went for dinner but the rest of his party wasn&#39;t there yet and it was his first time and so he stood there for 15mins without putting it down! <br><br>Hands down favourite menu items: Aburi Salmon (I think my absolute fave is still at Minami/Miku, but this is still delicious and I love the jalapeño on top to give it that extra kick!), Tuna Salad (very simple but refreshing and the tuna is delicious!) and the toro nigiri (last visit was the best melty piece I have had in a long time!). <br><br>Service is friendly and pretty quick and I really like the tea that they serve when you sit, I think it&#39;s a green tea and I&#39;m not sure what it is about it but it&#39;s really good! Last call is at about 9:45pm so if, like us, you&#39;re still waiting in line at 9:30, you can take a look at their menu and give them your order so it&#39;s ready to go by the time you are seated!

It was always a treat. Vancouver downtown offers an abundance of ramen restaurants, but not many pho places.<br><br>Spicy Beef Noodles Bun bo Hue: I usually like to change my noodles to pho noodles. That&#39;st just how I prefer it. The spiciness, tart and salty lemongrass was delicious. Even for me, I didn&#39;t need to add extra chili oil. It was spicy on its own.<br><br>Lemongrass chicken with fried egg broken rice: The chicken was brine with flavorful lemongrass and spices. Served with pickled vegetables, some shredded pork. If you are tired of the same lemongrass chicken or pork, do give the lemongrass fish at Joyeaux Cafe a try. Not many places has this. It is lightly breaded, dusted with spices then deep fried.",

"reviewcomment":"Horchada... Mmmm.<br><br>First of all, this place doesn&#39;t seem to use powdered horchada mix, which in itself deserves 4 stars. There is a serious lack of awesome mexican food in Vancouver, and I personally feel like S&amp;A makes up for this, if only slightly, because I live in Burnaby, and Yaletown is a long way to go for tacos.<br><br>That being said, the place is lovely. There is outdoor seating for those sunny days where it seems like a margarita and bowl of corn chips with salsa is the only solution to the cravings that follow beautiful weather around. <br><br>I had never been, and a friend suggested this as a place to go for lunch, so off we went. I was instantly excited by the appealing smells, the cleanliness, and the smile from the server as we made our way in and she directed us to sit where we pleased.<br><br>The seating is fairly limited and generally a first come, first served style of place. It reminded me a lot of noodle box, actually: walk-in, sit down, get served. There also appeared to be an a la carte ordering process, but I didn&#39;t really investigate that too heavily.<br><br>We were served quite quickly, the servers were polite and friendly. We ordered our delicious milk beverage and that arrived within minutes.<br><br>I can&#39;t remember exactly what the name of my dish was, but it was two large strips of flat steak/beef meat, red rice, refried beans, and obviously home made guacamole (the large chunks of firm avocado and the feta cheese tipped me off). My lunch mate finished his food quickly, and I was kind of disappointed that I didn&#39;t finish mine (should have packed it up!)<br><br>I will definitely be coming back here. I loved the excessive lime in the guacamole, the tender and flavourful steak, and the thick refried beans. If I lived in Yaletown I would be here regularly. My only complaint was that, for a Mexican place, there didn&#39;t seem to be a lot of spice to the food, which is something I usually look forward too, but it could just be the dish I chose. Incentive to return!<br><br>Reasonable prices, good hot food, and beautiful scenery. Viva Vancouver!",

"reviewcomment":"&#34;One star for being unhygienic and having a ridiculous policy of not allowing Starbucks coffee inside their cafe. We got Starbucks specifically because of the bad reviews of Cafe Crepe&#39;s coffee.  However that is not as bad as watching your crepe being folded and made by hand with NO GLOVES. What restaurant allows food prep like that in a world class city like Vancouver?&#34;<br><br>Just wanted to respond to this review and give a tip to all restaurant goers: policy or not,  it is extremely rude to bring in your own food or drinks to a restaurant, especially when what you bring in is something that the restaurant offers. It&#39;s advertisement for the cafe&#39;s competitor inside their own establishment, and blatantly says that you will not be buying their product. Take a few minutes to finish your coffee/meal/whatever before you step into a restaurant.  It is not a cafeteria where you can just come in and eat/drink whatever you brought with you, it&#39;s a business trying to make money. They do have a to-go window which you can make use of if you want to go elsewhere for coffee :)<br><br>Plus, most cooks use their bare hands to prepare food, unless it&#39;s raw poultry etc. While most kitchens are invisible to the customer, Cafe Crepe&#39;s is visible to the public.",

"reviewcomment":"I was totally blown away by their food &amp; service last night! my S/O suggested this place as it was in the neighbourhood but I hadn&#39;t been there before. We decided on take out. So I called in our order, and the gentlemen who answered the phone was SO friendly and attentive (which is not the case sometimes at other restaurants when you call to place an order) and told me about 10 - 15 minutes. When I went to pick up the order I was greeted very politely by the staff, and told it would be just a moment and offered a drink while I waited.  Every interaction I had with a staff member was done politely, professional, and welcoming. The place was bustling for a Friday night... but everyone seemed to be on their A-game and happy to be there. <br>I got my food and took it home. <br><br>We ordered a prawn souvlaki and a chicken souvlaki. the food was carefully packaged and divided. They have a unique take-a-way tray that has individual portioned areas for the rice, vegetables, protein/potatoes. they had a separate container for the Greek salad, and another one for the tzakiki. Let me just say this... everything was awesome but the roasted potatoes blew me away. I have NEVER tasted roasted potatoes that were so good in my life. I don&#39;t know what your secret is but they were phenomenal (and I don&#39;t even usually like potatoes too much). Over all it was delicious. Portion sizes were fabulous (I have a little leftover for lunch today.. excited!), and the food was yummy! <br><br>Will definitely be back!!",

"reviewcomment":"3rd time as a charm ^_^<br><br>My best friend from the US was coming up for a visit and really wanted to go to Stormcrow for her birthday. I wasn&#39;t sure if they took reservations or not and then we weren&#39;t even sure how many people were going to show up. But we set the time for 7pm.<br><br>We both up at 5pm with one other person, the woman who was going to seat us asked how many....I said maybe 15...but not until 7.<br><br>She was totally cool with that and said when another table came free she&#39;d just push it up against the one we were at. I that that was super awesome of them, especially seeing how busy the place was.<br><br>The food was great, everybody really enjoyed what they ordered. Luna decided to roll for a drink and ended up getting some peach thing, but she doesn&#39;t like peach. It worked out though because another friend rolled, got a 20 and just traded with her. So not only did she get a drink she liked....she got a Storm Crow shot glass as well. Perfect end to a birthday dinner.<br><br>My poutine was super yummy and that is coming from someone who refused to even TRY the stuff previously (srsl, poutine always looked nasty to me... o_o). And the bread pudding? OMG. <br><br>They did forget one girls drink but brought it to us right away when someone pointed it out. Looking forward to going back, maybe for brunch when the place might be a little quieter~<br><br>Thanks Storm Crow, for being so awesome.",

"reviewcomment":"What a difference a restaurant can make when they hire the right people. It was 9:59 on a sunday night, literally a minute before the restaurant was scheduled to close. I made a desperate attempt to get some pasta that would hopefully heal the hangover that reigned my body for the last 9 hours . In my previous review I had such a bad experience with a certain  staff member and the quality of the food that I had written off the restaurant for good. I am so glad I decided to give them another try for take out and it was nothing short of spectacular.<br><br>I called in exactly one minute before closing and a very pleasant woman answered the phone and she was more than happy to ask the kitchen staff to accommodate my small order of spaghetti al pomodoro. When I got there she happily seated me at the bar and asked not once not twice but three times if I wanted anything to drink or water.   She wrapped up my bread nicely in foil, showed it to me and asked me if it was enough (she basically gave me a mini baguette size of bread which is more than plenty). She did the same thing with the parmesan cheese. The food came promptly after and it was piping hot. <br><br>This is a great example of world class customer service. The restaurant was closed but yet they still accommodated to my needs and for once I didn&#39;t feel like I was intruding on them, nor did she make you feel rushed to get out of here so she could go home. Amazing! <br><br>The pomodoro was very nice with and balanced. The pasta was cooked al dente. I got four huge delicious pieces of crusty garlic bread along with a mini baguette loaf; which I could not to my dismay finish. Great job Zefferelis, this restaurant is so lucky to have such a good front of house/manager. I&#39;ll definitely be back",

"reviewcomment":"I was visiting Vancouver with some friends that had never been, and one had this guide book of things to do, places to eat, etc. One of the recommended places was this place. We walked in with no reservation and didn&#39;t seem to need one although it did get busier as the evening went on. <br>I had the Insalata Goat Cheese since I&#39;m a sucker for anything goat cheese and a butternut soup (I think it was the soup of the day) and both were very nice. My friends were also very happy with their meals, although to be honest I can only remember one got the mussels (or oysters) and was pleased. <br>The service was great and the ambience and location was nice as well.

"reviewcomment":"I was totally blown away by their food &amp; service last night! my S/O suggested this place as it was in the neighbourhood but I hadn&#39;t been there before. We decided on take out. So I called in our order, and the gentlemen who answered the phone was SO friendly and attentive (which is not the case sometimes at other restaurants when you call to place an order) and told me about 10 - 15 minutes. When I went to pick up the order I was greeted very politely by the staff, and told it would be just a moment and offered a drink while I waited.  Every interaction I had with a staff member was done politely, professional, and welcoming. The place was bustling for a Friday night... but everyone seemed to be on their A-game and happy to be there. <br>I got my food and took it home. <br><br>We ordered a prawn souvlaki and a chicken souvlaki. the food was carefully packaged and divided. They have a unique take-a-way tray that has individual portioned areas for the rice, vegetables, protein/potatoes. they had a separate container for the Greek salad, and another one for the tzakiki. Let me just say this... everything was awesome but the roasted potatoes blew me away. I have NEVER tasted roasted potatoes that were so good in my life. I don&#39;t know what your secret is but they were phenomenal (and I don&#39;t even usually like potatoes too much). Over all it was delicious. Portion sizes were fabulous (I have a little leftover for lunch today.. excited!), and the food was yummy! <br><br>Will definitely be back!!",

I go there often for takeout during lunchtime. <br><br>Their prices are pretty reasonable and the options are fantastic. I usually get a couple of rolls to go, and my bill is about $10. I have not had any issues at lunchtime getting takeout. They are pretty fast with the food. <br><br>I have eaten in as well, and I noticed that the service is mediocre and the food also comes out a tad slower, but this for me is the norm with most sushi restaurants. <br><br>The restaurant is large, but they are consistently busy. The longest I have ever had to wait for a table is less than 10 minutes. That would increase however, if you have a party larger than 4.<br><br>There are other sushi places in the area, but if you are wanting quick and cheap sushi that is actually pretty tasty, I would recommend going to Sushiyama.",

I was visiting Vancouver and stumbled upon this little gem. <br><br>Chicken Sandwich on Baguette -  A solid deal at $4 but lacks enough chicken. Maybe list an option to add more chicken for an upcharge ($1)?. Bread &amp;  ingredients were fresh and flavors were great. <br><br>Chicken Pho - I believe this is made in a beef broth, but I didn&#39;t mind at all. The portion was good, smaller than what I am use to in Los Angeles, but they added some additional items to make up for it: Boiled quail eggs and some sort of beef chunk that I could not identify. <br><br>Overall a good spot to stop in for to grab a quick Vietnamese bite.",

Nice and hot when you get it. They also give you a nice portion of egg, and I DO LOVE MY EGGS! If you get this and a coffee, that should be a nice little breakfast.<br><br>Chicken and Brie Sandwich ($4.75)<br>Nice chunks of chicken. The cheese was melted. Great sandwich, but I do like the Tuscan Ham a little better. This is more of a lunch sandwich (FYI).<br><br>Chocolate Chip Cookie<br>A very big cookie (that I couldn&#39;t even finish in one sitting). Nice and soft. Not too sweet. I would for sure get this cookie again!<br><br>I&#39;d love to come here if I had some work to do. It&#39;s relaxing and pretty quiet, despite how many people are actually in there.",

I have a feeling it would stay that way anyways. <br><br>Two words of advice for the owners on how to improve the joint. <br><br>1) Please buy napkins that don&#39;t disintegrate upon use. Just a little thicker so I don&#39;t have to go through 10 of them as I&#39;m eating saucy burger. <br><br>2) Do your cashier a favor and simplify your menu sign! Anytime a newb walks in and looks up at it, their eyes glaze over. It&#39;s daunting! Simplified with a nice bold faced font would do wonders. <br><br>Otherwise everything is juicy, saucy, lightly charred and completely delicious. Wicked fries too!",

What I love the most is all the options for vegetarian pizza lovers like me. Potato pizza? You betcha, not to mention Sundried tomatoes on the Greek pizza that&#39;s covered with a blanket of feta cheese!<br><br>It is a pretty small place with very limited seating, and when it&#39;s a rainy and windy day, you don&#39;t exactly feel like sitting outside to eat either.

Doesn&#39;t really feel like a chain when visiting, and located in a really attractive charming urban neighborhood area of Vancouver when visiting.  <br><br>I equally prefer going to restaurants that have an impressive ambiance, and tasty full of flavor restaurant food items. Old Spaghetti Factory delivers in both main characteristics, yet I prefer a more independent restaurant in the end. All types of pizza, spaghetti pasta, and spicy herbal garlic cheese breadsticks are some basic Italian essentials in food. <br><br>Reminds me of when I go to Cheesecake Factory in Seattle feeling very Independent when in fact it is a chain store.",

The cheese really elevated this pizza above it&#39;s vegetarian status. The pizza dough tasted great as well. Perfect thickness and fluff, baked just right not burned.<br><br>Seems like there are some 3 stars reviews complaining about it&#39;s cashier. She&#39;s not particularly friendly or unfriendly IMO, just feel busy and tired. But it&#39;s a pizza place! It&#39;s friendliness and service shouldn&#39;t be judge on the same level as a restaurant especially they get little tips. So I personally wouldn&#39;t care as long as they keep making amazing pizzas!",

"reviewcomment":"I was totally blown away by their food &amp; service last night! my S/O suggested this place as it was in the neighbourhood but I hadn&#39;t been there before. We decided on take out. So I called in our order, and the gentlemen who answered the phone was SO friendly and attentive (which is not the case sometimes at other restaurants when you call to place an order) and told me about 10 - 15 minutes. When I went to pick up the order I was greeted very politely by the staff, and told it would be just a moment and offered a drink while I waited.  Every interaction I had with a staff member was done politely, professional, and welcoming. The place was bustling for a Friday night... but everyone seemed to be on their A-game and happy to be there. <br>I got my food and took it home. <br><br>We ordered a prawn souvlaki and a chicken souvlaki. the food was carefully packaged and divided. They have a unique take-a-way tray that has individual portioned areas for the rice, vegetables, protein/potatoes. they had a separate container for the Greek salad, and another one for the tzakiki. Let me just say this... everything was awesome but the roasted potatoes blew me away. I have NEVER tasted roasted potatoes that were so good in my life. I don&#39;t know what your secret is but they were phenomenal (and I don&#39;t even usually like potatoes too much). Over all it was delicious. Portion sizes were fabulous (I have a little leftover for lunch today.. excited!), and the food was yummy! <br><br>Will definitely be back!!",

Or, about a 15 minute walk straight down leading you north towards coal harbour or historic gastown district.<br>About a month ago the restaurant went though a very needed update. They installed larger tv&#39;s and very comfortable seating arrangements. They kept the large booths on the one wall and the lower dining area is awesome for big groups.<br>The menu still offers discounted wing specials daily however it ends exactly at 5pm. Choose from about 20 different varieties. <br>If you are visiting Vancouver it is located in Howard Johnston hotel. Never stayed there so can&#39;t review that aspect of the property.",

"reviewcomment":"I&#39;m a lover of Chipotle from NYC to southern California!  It&#39;s fast and reasonably priced and although I wish they would offer more guac, it is what it is everywhere!<br><br>That said, the Vancouver location has a less efficient layout, less comfortable seating, and is much slower than the American version.  The only difference in food is that the meat has slightly less flavour and they ran out of the corn salsa when I was there (and noticed online that running out of things happens from time to time there).  The chips and salsa (mild salsa was tasteless) had less flavour (salt didn&#39;t stay on chips?) than in the US.  This is more management than anything.  They may be a bit slower, but it still is a favourite go-to for me, now!  I just hope they speed it up while maintaining the quality.  <br><br>DEFINITELY my favourite mexican in Vancouver right now!!!!",

"reviewcomment":"My friend and I went here tonight after much debate about what we&#39;d have for dinner. We started naming off places on Commercial and both agreed that we&#39;d never been to Famoso and that they probably had gluten free options for him..so off we went. <br><br>We were greeted instantly, scored a sweet table and were given the rundown. Then another awesome server came over and gave us the rundown again. A third doll came by to make sure we had the rundown. Solid guys!! <br><br>We ordered 2 pizzas, a salad and the Italian Soda. It was all AMAZING! So delicious, service is SUPER friendly and efficient. <br><br>We decided to grab desserts even though we were stuffed. If you only ever do one thing again in your life - get that Dolce-Banana dessert. Holy mother of pearl!!! My mouth just watered...and I ate it an hour ago!!! <br><br>Service is top notch. And the food is amazing!! <br><br>Will 100% be a customer for life.",

"reviewcomment":"Normally I would&#39;ve wanted to go to Sawasdee Thai while in Vancouver, but being that they have odd hours on Saturday, I opted for this place. I wasn&#39;t really expecting anything great after reading some of the reviews, but when I&#39;m craving pad thai, I&#39;m craving pad thai. My boyfriend and I were immediately greeted and sat by our waitress, and despite the fact they were just recovering from a blackout, drinks were at our table in no time. I ordered the pad thai with tiger prawns and my boyfriend ordered the pad se ew with pork. The pad thai was a-mazing. So much flavor in every bite. I usually add a lot of chili and lemon to give it that extra umph, but I found myself not needing to do that this time (partly because our server failed to bring me the lemon after asking twice, but it&#39;s okay). The pad se ew was just alright. There was sort of a funny aftertaste to it, and the balance of noodles to vegetables was really off. If I came back, I probably wouldn&#39;t order that again.<br><br>Our server was extremely friendly and never let our water cups go empty. She was the only server at the time and I know she was really busy, so I appreciated her hard work to make our stay an enjoyable one. If you&#39;re in Yaletown, I would recommend this place!",

I got crab cake salad, and he got pulled pork grilled cheese sandwich with tomato and beef soup.<br><br>I love how the crab cake was crunchy and crusty on the outside and delicious with the accompanying aioli sauce. The sandwich was oozing with melted cheese and perfectly cooked and seasoned pork. The soup was quite flavourful and tasted like beef stew simmered for hours.<br><br>The staff were friendly and smiley, which is also a plus! I would have liked to try their brunch, but we got there a bit too late. :-( Perhaps next time!!",

Appropriate size portions.<br><br>Inventive dining experience and chance to sample many exceptional dishes.<br><br>Most memorable items were the Burrata Salad, Stinging Nettle Agnolotti (a stand-out dish similar to Handmade Ricotta Ravioli), Pappardelle with Lamb, and Pork Chop with Sausage and Peas.<br><br>Service was attentive...not too fast or slow on this Sunday evening.<br><br>Seating is tight (cozy?) with about dozen tables close together like a New York City restaurant. Would not suggest for a group larger than about six.<br><br>Dinner with taxes and wine was about $100 per person (not including tip)<br><br>Located in Kitsilano section on 4th at Alma. Dinner only.

"reviewcomment":"I was totally blown away by their food &amp; service last night! my S/O suggested this place as it was in the neighbourhood but I hadn&#39;t been there before. We decided on take out. So I called in our order, and the gentlemen who answered the phone was SO friendly and attentive (which is not the case sometimes at other restaurants when you call to place an order) and told me about 10 - 15 minutes. When I went to pick up the order I was greeted very politely by the staff, and told it would be just a moment and offered a drink while I waited.  Every interaction I had with a staff member was done politely, professional, and welcoming. The place was bustling for a Friday night... but everyone seemed to be on their A-game and happy to be there. <br>I got my food and took it home. <br><br>We ordered a prawn souvlaki and a chicken souvlaki. the food was carefully packaged and divided. They have a unique take-a-way tray that has individual portioned areas for the rice, vegetables, protein/potatoes. they had a separate container for the Greek salad, and another one for the tzakiki. Let me just say this... everything was awesome but the roasted potatoes blew me away. I have NEVER tasted roasted potatoes that were so good in my life. I don&#39;t know what your secret is but they were phenomenal (and I don&#39;t even usually like potatoes too much). Over all it was delicious. Portion sizes were fabulous (I have a little leftover for lunch today.. excited!), and the food was yummy! <br><br>Will definitely be back!!",

Lots of frames with paintings and the main chandelier with dripping wax that gives this place special character.<br><br>Our server was very friendly and remembered everyone&#39;s bill considering the large size of our group. We sat the the large table in the middle which made moving and mingling with all the guests that much easier.<br><br>The beer list is pretty good but of course could use some Belgian additions.

"reviewcomment":"I was totally blown away by their food &amp; service last night! my S/O suggested this place as it was in the neighbourhood but I hadn&#39;t been there before. We decided on take out. So I called in our order, and the gentlemen who answered the phone was SO friendly and attentive (which is not the case sometimes at other restaurants when you call to place an order) and told me about 10 - 15 minutes. When I went to pick up the order I was greeted very politely by the staff, and told it would be just a moment and offered a drink while I waited.  Every interaction I had with a staff member was done politely, professional, and welcoming. The place was bustling for a Friday night... but everyone seemed to be on their A-game and happy to be there. <br>I got my food and took it home. <br><br>We ordered a prawn souvlaki and a chicken souvlaki. the food was carefully packaged and divided. They have a unique take-a-way tray that has individual portioned areas for the rice, vegetables, protein/potatoes. they had a separate container for the Greek salad, and another one for the tzakiki. Let me just say this... everything was awesome but the roasted potatoes blew me away. I have NEVER tasted roasted potatoes that were so good in my life. I don&#39;t know what your secret is but they were phenomenal (and I don&#39;t even usually like potatoes too much). Over all it was delicious. Portion sizes were fabulous (I have a little leftover for lunch today.. excited!), and the food was yummy! <br><br>Will definitely be back!!",

"reviewcomment":"[Throwback Thursday]<br><br>There&#39;s something I find quite charming about this 70s style diner. The checkered tiles, seafoam blue banquettes and the Marilyn-style posters are a blast from the past - not that I&#39;m really old enough to remember any of that. All that&#39;s missing is a working juke box and waitresses on roller skates. <br><br>Their menu is very limited. In terms of food, it&#39;s really just a burger that you can customize - 4 different types of patties and all the usualy fixings with a few extra. I ended up with the ground turkey burger. The burger alone is $8 but you can have the platter with fries for $11. I didnt find it as flavorful (or oily) as a beef patty and a little cranberry sauce would&#39;ve done it wonders but it was still very tasty. The accompanying fries were fresh and tasted almost home made. Overall, it was good value for the price.     <br><br>The second half of their menu is made up of drinks - milkshakes, sodas, floats, etc. This is the real feature here. It was a steamy 24 degrees outside so a Coke float was a must-have. I haven&#39;t had one of these since I was 10 years old and the creamy fizziness tasted like heaven. It would&#39;ve been more nostalgic if it came in one of those old fashioned glass coke cups but we can&#39;t have it all. <br><br>The service here is excellent. The servers were really friendly and chatty. They kept coming by to see if we needed anything.<br><br>Overall, the ambience and decor are what I&#39;d come back for. It&#39;s a really cool place to hang out and grab a milkshake or float.",

Then things went bad. Really bad. The food was suddenly terrible. They realized, fired their cook, and tried again, but my next experience was a total let down since they missed the key ingredient (goat&#39;s cheese) in the scramble I ordered that was meant to have it.<br><br>So on a whim a few months ago we thought we&#39;d give it another shot - you know, for old time&#39;s sake. It was just like the good ol&#39; days. My scramble was perfect, the quirky servers were as quirky as ever, my spelt toast was delicious and I am happy. Thanks Central for raging against mediocrity and restoring yourselves to your former glory once more.<br><br>*hat tip*",

"reviewcomment":"I was totally blown away by their food &amp; service last night! my S/O suggested this place as it was in the neighbourhood but I hadn&#39;t been there before. We decided on take out. So I called in our order, and the gentlemen who answered the phone was SO friendly and attentive (which is not the case sometimes at other restaurants when you call to place an order) and told me about 10 - 15 minutes. When I went to pick up the order I was greeted very politely by the staff, and told it would be just a moment and offered a drink while I waited.  Every interaction I had with a staff member was done politely, professional, and welcoming. The place was bustling for a Friday night... but everyone seemed to be on their A-game and happy to be there. <br>I got my food and took it home. <br><br>We ordered a prawn souvlaki and a chicken souvlaki. the food was carefully packaged and divided. They have a unique take-a-way tray that has individual portioned areas for the rice, vegetables, protein/potatoes. they had a separate container for the Greek salad, and another one for the tzakiki. Let me just say this... everything was awesome but the roasted potatoes blew me away. I have NEVER tasted roasted potatoes that were so good in my life. I don&#39;t know what your secret is but they were phenomenal (and I don&#39;t even usually like potatoes too much). Over all it was delicious. Portion sizes were fabulous (I have a little leftover for lunch today.. excited!), and the food was yummy! <br><br>Will definitely be back!!",

"reviewcomment":"We wanted a quieter location to catch the second half of the Patriots vs Broncos game on Sunday as we wanted to grab a quick meal as well. The other sports bars were rowdy and crowded and I&#39;m sure the service there were going to be incredibly slow. <br><br>It is your average pub with several screens making it a decent place to catch a game on TV. Despite the location the place only had about four other people intently watching on when we arrived. <br><br>One doesn&#39;t go to the pub expecting excellent food so I&#39;ll leave that to what it is. It was fine and service was attentive, friendly and quick. I had a cider and he had a beer. <br><br>I found this place to be rather family friendly and for those who aren&#39;t interested in watching what&#39;s on the screen there are several tables near the window behind the wall dividing the place in half length wise. <br><br>Once our glasses were empty and our orders were consumed, we left in search of another bar/pub/restaurant to watch the Niners vs Seahawks game.

"reviewcomment":"I&#39;ve frequented this place many times, having worked in the area for a long time.<br><br>Most of the negative reviews here fall into one of two categories:<br>- expensive for diner food<br>- poor service<br><br>The food isn&#39;t dirt cheap, but it&#39;s within expectation. The portions are fairly generous, so I don&#39;t really see price as a problem. Maybe it depends on what you order, but everything I&#39;ve had was fine for the price, very filling and exactly what I ordered.<br><br>As for service, I&#39;ve been here many times and not had a problem. I mean, the servers aren&#39;t gushing and hovering over you the whole time you&#39;re eating, maybe that&#39;s the experience some people expect from &#34;good&#34; service, but I&#39;m eating and having a conversation, leave me alone and refill my empty cup/glass when I put it to the side. That&#39;s all I&#39;m really looking for, and they do that.<br><br>I&#39;ve decided that if I visit a restaurant once, and had a bad service experience, I&#39;m not going to give a low rating just because of that. I&#39;ll either review other aspects or come back again before reviewing -- and if I never come back, I simply won&#39;t review. The server will be punished anyway by getting a bad tip, no need to hold the entire restaurant accountable because one person was having a bad day. For all you know, that was his or her first day and s/he was fired afterwards. Having said all that, I have been here multiple times and find the service entirely acceptable.<br><br>--<br><br>Hipster Quotient (HQ): 140. Very high.",

"reviewcomment":"We first discovered ShuRaku Sake Bar and Bistro Vancouver during the Vancouver Winter Olympics 2010. ShuRaku Sake Bar and Bistro is located in heart of downtown Vancouver on Granville Street (off Robson Street). Granville Street is your shopping, dining and clubbing district. It is easily accessible via SkyTrain, just off from Pacific Centre Mall. I first discovered this trendy bistro during the Vancouver 2010 Winter Olympics. Outside there is a heated patio. Inside there is nicely decorated from liqueur bar, sushi bar, tables and booths that stretches deep into this izakaya. ShuRaku Sake Bar and Bistro Vancouver has a extensive sake selection and it also serves Sapporo beer...<br><br>Like most izakaya&#39;s ShuRaku Sake Bar and Bistro has a daily special menu and it is quite extensive...<br><br>Live Uni is served on a beautifully present ice platter with blue lights. The hero really is not the presentation but the freshness and the sweetness of the sea urchin! Served with extra seaweed for wrapping or scooping<br><br>Tako Waso is marinated baby octopus with wasabi leaf sauce. It is served chill and presented on a bed of miso paste for additional flavor. The taka waso is served on sliced cucumber blocks. The cucumber balances the rather strong pungent wasabi.<br><br>Eggplant Poppers: cubed eggplant, pork and chicken battered and deep fried with ponzu vinaigrette... I found this to be nothing special and had no zing.<br><br>Tuna Aburi: Aburi sushi 炙り寿司 or roasted sushi consists of nigiri sushi topped with fish. Fresh tuna slightly seared on the outside, fried garlic bites accompanied by ponzu vinaigrette... tangy and satisfying<br><br>Spicy Salmon Tartare: Wild sockeye salmon sashimi blended with avocado, served with pine nuts, green onion &amp; Shakura`s house special spicy sauce. A raw quail egg finishes on top. It is served with battered friend seaweed poppers for you to scoop the yummy goodness. The chill spicy acidity of the tartar mixed with the crunchy chips is delish!<br><br>Assorted fresh nigiri: Hamachi, Uni, Toro, Hotate and etc. Each piece has a fatty sashimi.<br><br>Now on to dessert<br><br>ShuRaku Sake Bar and Bistro Home made marble cheesecake &amp; sesame ice-cream: Absolutely brilliant! The cheesecake is light and velvety. The flavors do not overwhelm and always draws you back for another bite. The cheesecake flavor changes from time to time. The crispy wafer on top adds texture. Frozen grapes in a pretty container on the side. However, let me present the hero of this dessert - it is hands down their &#39;house special&#39; specially made sesame ice-cream. ShuRaku Sake Bar and Bistro Sesame ice cream is dark, bold, and has over 60% more sesame concentration than regular ones found in, say at your local supermarket!",

"reviewcomment":"I was totally blown away by their food &amp; service last night! my S/O suggested this place as it was in the neighbourhood but I hadn&#39;t been there before. We decided on take out. So I called in our order, and the gentlemen who answered the phone was SO friendly and attentive (which is not the case sometimes at other restaurants when you call to place an order) and told me about 10 - 15 minutes. When I went to pick up the order I was greeted very politely by the staff, and told it would be just a moment and offered a drink while I waited.  Every interaction I had with a staff member was done politely, professional, and welcoming. The place was bustling for a Friday night... but everyone seemed to be on their A-game and happy to be there. <br>I got my food and took it home. <br><br>We ordered a prawn souvlaki and a chicken souvlaki. the food was carefully packaged and divided. They have a unique take-a-way tray that has individual portioned areas for the rice, vegetables, protein/potatoes. they had a separate container for the Greek salad, and another one for the tzakiki. Let me just say this... everything was awesome but the roasted potatoes blew me away. I have NEVER tasted roasted potatoes that were so good in my life. I don&#39;t know what your secret is but they were phenomenal (and I don&#39;t even usually like potatoes too much). Over all it was delicious. Portion sizes were fabulous (I have a little leftover for lunch today.. excited!), and the food was yummy! <br><br>Will definitely be back!!",

"reviewcomment":"We had a very bipolar experience at C. Had the evening continued as it began, they would have gotten 1 or 2 stars. Had the evening begun as it ended, it would have gotten 5 stars.<br><br>We had a reservation for our anniversary dinner at 7:00. We arrived a touch late, maybe at 7:05. The server offered us water, and we requested the tasting menu. Only the former arrived promptly. He did not take our drink order until about 7:30, and our first drinks didn&#39;t arrive until about 7:45. When I asked for a &#34;riff on a Manhattan,&#34; he very awkwardly told us the bartender wasn&#39;t very good, and he wouldn&#39;t be able to do that. He was right, but he threw his bartender under the bus.<br><br>I make Manhattans all the time at home, and I know the ratio is 2:1 whiskey to sweet vermouth. This one was red and sweet; it was very heavy on the vermouth. I don&#39;t know how such a classy place ends up with a bartender who not only cannot make an interesting Manhattan, but cannot even make a satisfactory classic one. <br><br>I ordered the tasting menu, pointing out that I have a dairy allergy. I told him I was happy to have whatever modifications the chefs saw fit to make, but was a bit concerned when he didn&#39;t ask me at all what my preferences might be -- there were some extras that could be added, like foie gras and caviar, as well as the wine pairing. My husband did not order off the tasting menu; he ordered an appetizer and an entree.<br><br>Considering the poor quality of service we&#39;d already received, I was quite concerned that the food I was served would be safe for me to eat. My suspicions were not incorrect. <br><br>The first thing that was brought out was a veloute -- by a gentleman who seemed to be the head server. We pointed out that my husband hadn&#39;t ordered that, and perhaps it was mine, as I couldn&#39;t recall exactly what was on the tasting menu, but, oh wait, does that have cream in it? I cannot eat it.<br><br>At that point, I explained the issues we&#39;d already had with the slow service, and the gentleman who&#39;d brought out the veloute instantly took over our table. It was smooth sailing from there; he was clearly a seasoned professional. The food was amazing, the wine was great, the service was great, and I had no further concerns about whether the food was safe for me to eat. I could finally relax and enjoy our anniversary dinner.<br><br>He accidentally brought out my foie gras in the incorrect course order, but was very apologetic and comped it to us on our bill, even though I didn&#39;t even mind the mixup.<br><br>In the end I really enjoyed our meal, but if I went there again, I would be cautious about who served me. Throughout the evening, I watched as our initial server fumbled orders at other tables, while the server who took over for him breezed along. I would also avoid the cocktail menu.",

Always ready with a &#34;Ciao bella!&#34; and so patient in explaining what the different pizza toppings are. <br><br>FOOD - Delicious toppings and flatbread! My favourite so far is the pulled pork. If you&#39;ve got room, order the pizzas in the 3&#34; size so you can try different flavours in one meal. Next time, I&#39;ll have to go for the brunch pizza, which comes with an egg on top.<br><br>AMBIENCE - Unpretentious. Refreshing to see on main street where so many other places are going for the 1910 (?) hipsterfied vintage chic look.",

"reviewcomment":"Recently moved into the neighbourhood and popped in for dinner with a friend. I liked it a lot but there are things that may put you off. Food took forever, our server was lovely and offered me an entree to make up for it, but really my friend had finished her meal when I got mine so it was a bit awkward. <br><br>The seating is tight, which you may not notice but if you have captain obnoxious at the next table it can dull you experience. <br><br>The pizzas are made as you order which is awesome, but you can&#39;t add anything to them unless it&#39;s on a short list. Nothing from another pizza. <br><br>I&#39;ll eat here a fair bit seeing the care and love they put into sourcing ingredients and making thier own, but I&#39;ll have to be in the mood!",

The Japanese style breakfast was pretty good.  It comes with a plain omelette, a piece of salmon, rice, miso soup and I had it with the tofu. I liked everything except the tofu because it had no flavour. <br><br>My husbands sunny side up eggs were a little over cooked.

"reviewcomment":"I had been to Cork &amp; Fin several times over the past two years before dining there recently, but only for their 5:00-6:30pm buck-a-shuck sessions, or a random drink. I really wanted to have a full meal in order to see what the kitchen was capable of, and to see whether the food could stand up to the slick and comfortable ambiance of the space that I had enjoyed in the past while shooting oysters. Valentine&#39;s Day seemed to be the perfect excuse to test this Gastown brasserie. <br><br>I was impressed from the get-go as our table was ready right upon arrival and we were given a primo spot on the cozy second floor, overlooking the main dining area and oyster bar below. We started our meal with a glass of French bubbly, which whet our appetites for the first course of this Valentine&#39;s set menu. <br><br>The first dish was a crudo platter consisting of six Kusshis, tuna tartar, cured salmon, and scallop sashimi. All of the seafood was clean tasting, subtle, and elegantly presented. <br><br>The second dish was an unusual and harmonious octopus salad. This looked a bit intimidating at first glance because the slices of octopus were abnormally large when recalling salads of a similar ilk; however, this grilled cephalopod was tender, and married perfectly with the roasted tomatoes and greens upon which it rested. <br><br>For the third course, I had the egg yolk ravioli with a butter parmesan sauce and my girlfriend had the arctic char with fennel and blood orange salad. These two dishes were perfect counterpoints to one another: the pasta was rich and soft, while the char and salad were light and palate-cleansing. The portions were also bang on, as this protein-heavy menu meant that we couldn&#39;t have handled huge servings of pasta and fish.<br><br>The dessert echoed the yin-yang balance that existed between the pasta and char, and presented itself in the form of a flossy pavlova and a luscious pistachio chocolate mousse. On its own, the pavlova would have been too light. And by itself, the mousse would have been too heavy. But together, they were perfect.<br><br>This meal, and this 2014 Valentine&#39;s eve, could not have been more enjoyable or satisfying. We popped our heads into the kitchen as we were leaving to give our thanks to the chef, Cayley Milne, who is doing an amazing job at Cork &amp; Fin. We will definitely be back.",

"reviewcomment":"I was totally blown away by their food &amp; service last night! my S/O suggested this place as it was in the neighbourhood but I hadn&#39;t been there before. We decided on take out. So I called in our order, and the gentlemen who answered the phone was SO friendly and attentive (which is not the case sometimes at other restaurants when you call to place an order) and told me about 10 - 15 minutes. When I went to pick up the order I was greeted very politely by the staff, and told it would be just a moment and offered a drink while I waited.  Every interaction I had with a staff member was done politely, professional, and welcoming. The place was bustling for a Friday night... but everyone seemed to be on their A-game and happy to be there. <br>I got my food and took it home. <br><br>We ordered a prawn souvlaki and a chicken souvlaki. the food was carefully packaged and divided. They have a unique take-a-way tray that has individual portioned areas for the rice, vegetables, protein/potatoes. they had a separate container for the Greek salad, and another one for the tzakiki. Let me just say this... everything was awesome but the roasted potatoes blew me away. I have NEVER tasted roasted potatoes that were so good in my life. I don&#39;t know what your secret is but they were phenomenal (and I don&#39;t even usually like potatoes too much). Over all it was delicious. Portion sizes were fabulous (I have a little leftover for lunch today.. excited!), and the food was yummy! <br><br>Will definitely be back!!",

My bf and I ordered from there dinner menu:<br><br>Popcorn and cracklings - popcorn was really good, I wasn&#39;t a fan of the cracklings which is deep fried skin, but many people seem to like this.<br><br>Flat bread - this was my favourite, so much flavour, I definitely recommend getting this.<br><br>Duck confit with asparagus risotto  - this was on special, it was delicious soooo rich.<br><br>Beer on tap - decent local selection and served nice and cold!<br><br>If your going on a Saturday night and want to eat at a table and not the bar be sure to make reservations as they get pretty busy.",

My favourites include kashmiri chicken and the eggplant. While I usually don&#39;t go for butter chicken, it is also decent.

"reviewcomment":"Found this gem a while ago thanks to you fellow Yelpers. If you check in you get a 10% discount (I think you need to buy at least 6 macarons? Not sure). A few places with macarons have had off days but French Made Baking has been consistently heavenly. The meringues are nice and tall so they shatter the second they touch your mouth, melt a little, then have a slight chew as you reach the silky, luscious buttercream/ganache in the middle.<br><br>I can&#39;t wait to try their pastries, and they have a gorgeous tea selection in vintage-looking tins, no less. I think they have the nicest macarons in town and they are well-priced compared to other bakeries. Still a little pricier than getting a cookie but a worthwhile treat.",

"reviewcomment":"I had dinner at The Reef during Dine Out Vancouver. <br><br>The menu selection was pretty good, though we limited ourselves to the Dine Out menu. The overall taste of the dishes we had was about average for a Caribbean restaurant. My curry was OK, but I thought the cole slaw part of the meal was pretty gross. His jerk chicken was really good though. Another reviewer said it was really really spicy which we did not find to be the case at all. My curry was spicier, so maybe they are just not used to spice? Or maybe there was a different cook in the kitchen that night. We had the fried plantains and the mac and cheese balls to start and both were really good. The sauce that comes with the plantains was amazing though. We ordered extra, and I&#39;ve been trying to figure out the recipe for it ever since. <br><br>Probably the best part of our dinner were the drinks. The bar tender made pretty amazing mixed drinks, and even put something together for us that wasn&#39;t on the menu. <br><br>The wait staff seemed quite attentive, and my only complaint with the restaurant would be that the music was so loud we had to yell, so it wasn&#39;t the intimate evening we had planned.<br><br>I have a feeling I&#39;ll be visiting The Reef again in the near future.",

"reviewcomment":"I was totally blown away by their food &amp; service last night! my S/O suggested this place as it was in the neighbourhood but I hadn&#39;t been there before. We decided on take out. So I called in our order, and the gentlemen who answered the phone was SO friendly and attentive (which is not the case sometimes at other restaurants when you call to place an order) and told me about 10 - 15 minutes. When I went to pick up the order I was greeted very politely by the staff, and told it would be just a moment and offered a drink while I waited.  Every interaction I had with a staff member was done politely, professional, and welcoming. The place was bustling for a Friday night... but everyone seemed to be on their A-game and happy to be there. <br>I got my food and took it home. <br><br>We ordered a prawn souvlaki and a chicken souvlaki. the food was carefully packaged and divided. They have a unique take-a-way tray that has individual portioned areas for the rice, vegetables, protein/potatoes. they had a separate container for the Greek salad, and another one for the tzakiki. Let me just say this... everything was awesome but the roasted potatoes blew me away. I have NEVER tasted roasted potatoes that were so good in my life. I don&#39;t know what your secret is but they were phenomenal (and I don&#39;t even usually like potatoes too much). Over all it was delicious. Portion sizes were fabulous (I have a little leftover for lunch today.. excited!), and the food was yummy! <br><br>Will definitely be back!!",

"reviewcomment":"One of my new favourite restaurants... I could literally rave all day about this place. The ambiance is so inviting and welcoming, and the service is great. <br>On a Saturday night, the place is packed, so make sure you make a reservation. We started the night with a beet salad, a tomato salad and the goat cheese, arugula and goat cheese tart. The salads were good, but the tart was to DIE for. It was the perfect balance of crunch from the pastry, salt from the goat cheese, and bitterness from the arugula. Definitely a must have. For a main, I had the Red Snapper (on the changing menu). It was well seasoned with a beautiful lemon butter sauce. However what really took the cake was their Chocolate Mousse. I swear it was the best mousse I&#39;ve ever eaten. Not too sweet, not too bitter, and perfectly fluffy. <br>Safe to say La Cigale is one of the best restaurants in Vancouver; it takes you right back to France. Highly recommended!",

"reviewcomment":"I&#39;m not normally a fan of eggs Benedict but after looking at the photos from the Cafe Zen Yelp page, I decided to give bennys another shot!  Maybe the one I had initially tried at De Dutch was just a miss (which, it probably was).  I arrived at 9:40am, just in time for the morning special. The morning special came with 2 peices of buttered toast, 2 eggs (any style), bacon/sausage/or ham, and hash browns.  Refills with my coffee were free as well!  I was pleasantly surprised that the coffee was actually quite good, since coffee at most &#34;diner&#34; type places tend to be a disappointment.  Also, I liked how our server came back frequently to make sure our cups were topped up :)  5 stars for service in my opinion.  She was very pleasant and friendly!<br><br>I was fully impressed by my chorizo benny that came with a side of grilled tomato.  However, when my bill came, I noticed that a half order was $7.99 and a full order was $10.50... only a $3 difference which I thought was a little bit of a rip, so if I ever come back here I&#39;d order just the full order of bennys and nothing else.  I noticed that near-by customers were ordering mix-matched bennys.  This is great cuz I always love to have more of a variety to try!<br><br>Overall, it&#39;s a cute place and it since it got pretty busy I can tell it&#39;s a popular spot.  I&#39;m not sure if I would come all the way to Kerrisdale again from my neighborhood but in case I&#39;m in the area I wouldn&#39;t mind ordering the eggs Benedict again!",

"reviewcomment":"Came here with a few friends for happy hour one evening and I am hooked!  The portion sizes are generous and all the staff are very friendly and explain the menu brilliantly without badgering you.  Saki cocktails are also a great price and super tasty!  (Pinky has served us twice-she&#39;s awesome!)<br><br>Meat lovers combo for two is the go to happy hour deal! It is basically 6 (or 7, I can&#39;t remember) different cuts of meat each dressed differently, that you grill at your table plus a wide selection of other items, including chicken karrage, edamame and a delicious bibimbap.<br><br>The atmosphere in this place is very relaxed and casual without sacrificing taste and a great place to socialise as it&#39;s so interactive.  We have arrived at 5.40 with happy hour ending at 6, no reservations, and have never been disappointed.<br><br>A must visit!",

"reviewcomment":"I honestly cannot wait until spring when this food cart once again parks itself conveniently close to my work. I am a sucker for salmon, especially smoked salmon. But hot, fresh, local smoked salmon... I&#39;m going to develop a problem.<br><br>My coworker kept showing up at lunch time with these amazing looking and smelling hot smoked salmon sandwiches and salads that were making me hungry. I soon noticed more of them popping up throughout the office and knew I needed to figure out where they were coming from.<br><br>After the first salmon sandwich I was hooked and then soon after devastated when I was diagnosed with gluten intolerance so I could no longer eat salmon sandwich after salmon sandwich. However, the Kaboom Box of course had those amazing hot smoked salmon house salads which were equally as addictive. I chose to become hooked on those instead. The salmon is always so incredibly tender and fresh, you can really tell you&#39;re eating something high quality. It comes on organic greens with a house made balsamic vinaigrette, slivered almonds and dried cranberries. It sounds simple but I&#39;ve always been full after eating it and the flavors are all so complimentary it&#39;s delicious. Also, the price is a nice even $10.00 that I am able to pay for by card because I&#39;m the type of person that never for the life of me has cash on hand.<br><br>The Kaboom Box is by far one of my favorite food carts in downtown Vancouver and I would really recommend checking it out. I&#39;ve gone with many people who have tried other items on the menu and no one is ever disappointed!",

We decided on take out. So I called in our order, and the gentlemen who answered the phone was SO friendly and attentive (which is not the case sometimes at other restaurants when you call to place an order) and told me about 10 - 15 minutes. When I went to pick up the order I was greeted very politely by the staff, and told it would be just a moment and offered a drink while I waited.  Every interaction I had with a staff member was done politely, professional, and welcoming. The place was bustling for a Friday night... but everyone seemed to be on their A-game and happy to be there. <br>I got my food and took it home. <br><br>We ordered a prawn souvlaki and a chicken souvlaki. the food was carefully packaged and divided. They have a unique take-a-way tray that has individual portioned areas for the rice, vegetables, protein/potatoes. they had a separate container for the Greek salad, and another one for the tzakiki. Let me just say this... everything was awesome but the roasted potatoes blew me away. I have NEVER tasted roasted potatoes that were so good in my life. I don&#39;t know what your secret is but they were phenomenal (and I don&#39;t even usually like potatoes too much). Over all it was delicious. Portion sizes were fabulous (I have a little leftover for lunch today.. excited!), and the food was yummy! <br><br>Will definitely be back!!",

"reviewcomment":"4.5/5. -0.5 only because it is slightly expensive.<br><br>I came here last Saturday as a Date Night with my boyfriend. <br><br>We sat down on the benches outside of the restaurant where the hostess took our order. She rang our order through and our server, Rose, met us at the entrance. Rose guided us through the dark room to our seats, making us feel very safe and comfortable. It was completely dark. The tables were very small but we managed not to knock anything off of them. <br><br>We started with a salad. I thought the salad was delicious. It was simple, yes, but very refreshing. I had a lot of fun guessing the vegetables. <br><br>The main courses I thought were very delicious. I ordered the chicken stuffed with dates and goat cheese. MMMM! I simply loved the flavour combination. My boyfriend ordered the surprise which was way better than I had expected, ALMOST as better as my date and cheese stuffed chicken. My boyfriend enjoyed them much the same and thought both entrees were prepared very well. I recommend at least one person in your party to order the special. We had a lot of fun identifying the dish. Both entrees came with potatoes and vegetables. The vegetables were grilled to perfection, sweet from caramelization. <br><br>The dessert was the most disappointing for me. I am not going to give a negative star for this because I typically don&#39;t like &#34;desserts&#34; at restaurants; I would have preferred to buy myself a creamy greek yogurt from across the street at whole foods :). I believe I had a lemon meringue pie. It was how a lemon meringue pie should taste.<br><br>Overall, the experience was a 5/5! It was totally worth it. I felt like my sense of taste was truly heightened. The salad was nothing special, but delicious regardless. The entree was very well prepared, very delicious. The dessert was how it should be, slightly sweet and tart. Rose, our server, was simply amazing. I enjoyed her company completely. We were very impressed with the restaurant and both agreed that it was worth the price for the experience; however, I would only need this experience once. I would recommend this restaurant to my friends and family.",

Great because I was craving something light and I wanted fresh seafood, which Vancouver is known for.<br><br>The spinach goma-ae was blanched just right to retain the natural freshness of the spinach and yet the seasoning and sesame seeds were able to enhance those favors. And the pistachio added the right amount of nuttiness to the mix.<br><br>The super assorted sashimi set is worth getting. All the seafood is unbelievably fresh and I really liked the prawns... The flesh had a subtle hint of sweetness to it. And decently priced - $22?! Oh, hell yes!<br><br>They could take service up a notch though. Besides that, not really any complaints.

"reviewcomment":"Knowing about this place, driving by it every so often I never got the chance to step in here. It&#39;s taken so long and finally I decide to walk in here for a quick dinner. I came earlier in the day, and it was closed (don&#39;t come Sunday for lunch!!!) and I was determined this time to eat here! I didn&#39;t realize how many reviews this place had until I checked in.... my expectations were high after going through about 5 reviews while waiting for a seat. Sunday night, the place had a few seats, but it was packed.<br><br>The first thing I noticed was 4 guys slicing and dicing behind the sushi bar, they were busy at work. Walked in, and they did some Japanese langauge greeting, not like Guu, a little more subtle, while the 2 waitresses were working their tails off on all the tables. The place is not big, but it can get really busy in a hurry, not just with the people sitting in for a meal, but what really surprised me was the mass amount of takeout this place had waiting for the people who decided to call and pick their stuff. I didn&#39;t see small orders here, I saw mass orders, to feed whole family style bag-ups.... and people just kept on coming in, and out, a continuous pace.<br><br>As we were sitting I went through the menu with my mom, we decided on the crazy looking &#39;Awesome Roll&#39; that was featured on the outside of the building, an order of BC Roll, and Tofu Vegetable Teriyaki (wtf is this???). Due to the night, the service was a little slow, still,  no blame on the servers... it&#39;s just another busy night at this small Japanese restaurant with the odd location.<br><br>The first thing that came was the Tofu Vegetable Teriyaki, with a side serving of rice. I was actually quite impressed at this order, done on a hot pan just like chicken, salmon or beef teriyaki, this this was identical in nature, but instead of meat, served with Agedashi tofu, and a fair amount too. I am usually not a fan of the bean sprouts on this dish, and I will admit that I will allow this to go to waste, but there was something very fresh with the ingredients here that made my chopsticks keep coming back to eat all the bean sprouts, this dish is a winner if you need to get away from the meat, the mixed bean sprouts were crispy fresh, mixed with peppers to give a nice zing to the flavour, I would honestly order this again.<br><br>As we had two rolls coming, they were served together, and I we will start with the suble BC Roll, not as crispy as I expected on the salmon skin portion as some other premium places, but this thing was made with care, as I could see they use minimal rice to make these bite sized rolls, and then the crazy &#39;Awesome Roll&#39; covered in an avalanche of deep fried yam strings, you could barely see what was under all this crazy crispy stringy mess. I found rolls, with a good piece of cooked salmon on top of each, and again, these bites were real good, mixed with eating all the fried stuff, and it just works.<br><br>The prices are very reasonable for good quality food, not your typical trick you, Chinese people running the restaurant, Japanese food, from what I heard from the staff talking with each other, these people were Japanese. There are no Bento boxes on the menu, which I say is a good thing, just rolls, sashimi, maki, some noodles, rice, tempura, teriyaki, and appetizers there&#39;s quite a bit there for you to order, and I&#39;m sure you will find something you like.<br><br>Parking is a plenty around here, surprising though that they have their own parking stalls at the side of the building, but for the most part all the streets around here are free, and there are a ton of spots, as they are the only restaurant on the block. I always wondered how this place survives in this location, and now I know why... I can&#39;t wait to come back for another meal!",

"reviewcomment":"Right in downtown Vancouver, this Thai spot hits the spot! Not too far from the action, it is easy to find as you stroll around the shops on Robson St. <br><br>You will be led upstairs where, if you&#39;re lucky, you&#39;d be seated by the window-- perfect for people watching below and also for watching parking attempts by super cars with Ns.<br><br>Energy was lively for a Friday night, with a steady flow of people coming in and out, proving that quite a few people were also craving Thai. <br><br>The servers were friendly, prompt and helpful. Filled our water, didn&#39;t linger and served amazing food.<br><br>Ordered the rendang bed and pineapple rice. Rendang beef was good for two people, portions were a bit small. The meat was so tasty that you&#39;d savour each bite and feel thankful for them getting it right.<br><br>Pineapple rice was flavourful, no wonder it is a crowd favourite! Rice was served in a pineapple. They were able to accommodate my request to remove ham (food preferences); this didn&#39;t sacrifice the flavour. <br><br>Got the lovers bowl for the Bahia drink (like a piña colada) and it was a refreshing, cool drink that complemented the delicious entrees. <br><br>Overall, a solid restaurant choice in downtown Vancouver for a budget eater.  I would return and recommend to tourists and locals alike.",

"reviewcomment":"I was totally blown away by their food &amp; service last night! my S/O suggested this place as it was in the neighbourhood but I hadn&#39;t been there before. We decided on take out. So I called in our order, and the gentlemen who answered the phone was SO friendly and attentive (which is not the case sometimes at other restaurants when you call to place an order) and told me about 10 - 15 minutes. When I went to pick up the order I was greeted very politely by the staff, and told it would be just a moment and offered a drink while I waited.  Every interaction I had with a staff member was done politely, professional, and welcoming. The place was bustling for a Friday night... but everyone seemed to be on their A-game and happy to be there. <br>I got my food and took it home. <br><br>We ordered a prawn souvlaki and a chicken souvlaki. the food was carefully packaged and divided. They have a unique take-a-way tray that has individual portioned areas for the rice, vegetables, protein/potatoes. they had a separate container for the Greek salad, and another one for the tzakiki. Let me just say this... everything was awesome but the roasted potatoes blew me away. I have NEVER tasted roasted potatoes that were so good in my life. I don&#39;t know what your secret is but they were phenomenal (and I don&#39;t even usually like potatoes too much). Over all it was delicious. Portion sizes were fabulous (I have a little leftover for lunch today.. excited!), and the food was yummy! <br><br>Will definitely be back!!",

We enjoyed talking with other folks that were waiting as well.<br><br>Once we were sat my Husband and I both ordered our own pizzas (to share of course!) He got the marinara and added mushrooms and a few other toppings. He was a little taken back by the $3 per add on but I guess the point is to just go with one of their pizzas!  I got the Prosciutto e Rucola.  Holy hell that was sooooo good!<br><br>The service was great, the food was awesome and the ambiance was perfect for our date night.<br><br>We will definitely be coming back many, many times!",

It literally feels like you are in someone&#39;s backyard for lunch.<br><br>We started off with the gator for appetizer which is divine. The texture is nice, a bit chewier than shredded beef and the sauce is spicy yet not complementary to the texture of the meat.<br><br>I had the Chicken Po&#39; Boy and have to say that the chicken breast is cooked to perfection. This meal also comes with a side of fries and salad and is just enough to feel the tummy without that sick feeling after eating a large meal.<br><br>Needless to say I&#39;ll be back again to try more Cajun goodness!",

"reviewcomment":"Great selection on the lunch menu!<br><br>Whether you are craving black cod, udon, soba, donburi, or just sushi, this place has it all. Bento boxes...check. Curry pork cutlet...check. Yakitori...check. It has become my one stop shop for reliable Japanese favorites.<br><br>While reading reviews for Marukame Udon, I was hit with a craving for curry udon. It was one of those, how would you describe, Harold and Kumar Go To White Castle moments. Whether I had to ride a cheetah or be trapped in the ladies bathroom listening to a game of Battleshitz, my craving was going to be satisfied one way or another damn it!<br><br>Anyhow, I found out that Aki serves a variety of udon bowls. They have tempura, kitsune, curry and good ol&#39;, reliable nabeyaki.<br><br>My picture of the curry udon doesn&#39;t do it justice. I took the pic right after it was brought out and before I mixed it. I thought it was a bit watery looking and even asked the waitress if there was any meat in it. After stirring through it though, the bowl magically turned into a thing of beauty. Chunks of quality beef hiding below. Perfect medium consistency and not overly thick like Marukame. Medium spice level and serving temperature was just right. It was good alright, real good.<br><br>Now I&#39;m not going to give the restaurant 5 stars based on one or two dishes. I&#39;ve also had their donburi and that was good too. I&#39;ve read some good and bad reviews on their sushi but I&#39;ll judge for myself and re-assess. However, I have to say that this place is solid.<br><br>Very clean and spacious interior along with friendly, attentive service (they hit you up with a nice hot cup of green tea when you&#39;ve been seated) makes this restaurant a must try. Check out the menu on their website!",

We had plenty of food to take home with us, and it tasted just as great a few hours later. I felt like saying, &#34;hey man, I&#39;m going to review this for the Elite Yelp scene,&#34; but in my head I fast-forwarded to a response which I imagined to be along the same vibe that was already being dished out. Maybe he was having an off day, but he seemed kinda dazed and not really in the mood to deal with humans. <br><br>Clearly this place is a winning taste sensation, but I&#39;ll do take-out next time despite a decent interior and feeling.",

"reviewcomment":"I was totally blown away by their food &amp; service last night! my S/O suggested this place as it was in the neighbourhood but I hadn&#39;t been there before. We decided on take out. So I called in our order, and the gentlemen who answered the phone was SO friendly and attentive (which is not the case sometimes at other restaurants when you call to place an order) and told me about 10 - 15 minutes. When I went to pick up the order I was greeted very politely by the staff, and told it would be just a moment and offered a drink while I waited.  Every interaction I had with a staff member was done politely, professional, and welcoming. The place was bustling for a Friday night... but everyone seemed to be on their A-game and happy to be there. <br>I got my food and took it home. <br><br>We ordered a prawn souvlaki and a chicken souvlaki. the food was carefully packaged and divided. They have a unique take-a-way tray that has individual portioned areas for the rice, vegetables, protein/potatoes. they had a separate container for the Greek salad, and another one for the tzakiki. Let me just say this... everything was awesome but the roasted potatoes blew me away. I have NEVER tasted roasted potatoes that were so good in my life. I don&#39;t know what your secret is but they were phenomenal (and I don&#39;t even usually like potatoes too much). Over all it was delicious. Portion sizes were fabulous (I have a little leftover for lunch today.. excited!), and the food was yummy! <br><br>Will definitely be back!!",

"reviewcomment":"Greatest hits of Malaysian and Singaporean food. Fish in banana leaf, beef rendang, chicken satay, and roti canai were all very appealing, and came out quickly. The roti was sweeter than I&#39;ve had before, but the curry it came with was excellent, as was the peanut sauce that came with the chicken satay. Only disappointing dish was the gado gado cooked-veggie salad, although perhaps I&#39;m used to the Indonesian version of this dish.<br><br>Service was very patient with a group of 3 that had a hard time making decisions; no pressure to rush us out. We left happy and full!",

Oh, most definitely.<br><br>We mainly ordered sashimi and were quite impressed by the presentation and taste.  <br><br>Some takeaways:<br>- The scallops were really good. I had 4 pieces of the scallop nigiri and a scallop temaki (the cone).<br>- The takaki were ok. I never had it before so I didn&#39;t know what to expect. I tried both the salmon and beef takaki. If you&#39;re saving room in your stomach, but want to try the takaki, stick to the beef one. <br>- I didn&#39;t really like the items on the backsheet (i.e. beef tongue, chicken karaage). They were fresh, but didn&#39;t seem to be good quality meat.<br><br>I&#39;m giving this place 5 stars because where else can you get this quality/price/presentation???",

I had no idea it was so big inside. I went with the veggie pot pie which was delicious! It was smothered in gravy which is the best. It was full of potatoes, peas, corn, possibly other things that look like potatoes, and the odd bit of red pepper. It came with a big side salad which was okay, but I don&#39;t really care about salad so I didn&#39;t waste much time on it.<br><br>And the vegan carob chip cookies are AMAZING and the size of a freakin&#39; plate. The peanut butter chocolate chip cookies are just okay, and kinda dry.",

"reviewcomment":"I&#39;ve been to Toyama about 3 times so far, each time for some late night AYCE. I would say that there&#39;s good value for your money here if you&#39;re measuring the quality of the food. They don&#39;t skimp on their ingredients, their sushi and sashimi slices are a decent size. The one menu item that absolutely made me fall in love with Toyama, though, is their oyster motoyaki! YUM! I would highly recommend it to anyone!<br><br>I&#39;d say that on the average, Toyama has pretty good service, but that&#39;s actually also the only thing that kept me from giving them a full 5-star rating. I think that by now, they should more or less be able to anticipate what times their restaurant peaks and gets crazy busy, and they should have ready personnel to meet the demands of those times. Their service tends to slip into &#34;poor&#34; category when it gets busy and I&#39;ve seen more than just a few customers get huffy because they get neglected (i.e. orders don&#39;t get taken, orders take forever to come out of the kitchen, etc.)<br><br>But really, their food is more than enough reason for me to keep coming back!",

I thought that was pretty cool not only are they attentive to their customers but also to their employees. <br><br>Food:<br>1st night: had the Ain&#39;t no thang &amp; grilled Chaesar. The food is served on top of a Bloody Mary. It was delicious. <br>2nd night: the wife and I split a burger and each got a side Caesar salad. Can&#39;t complain there either I devoured it! <br>Drinks were well served. <br><br>Atmosphere: very happening. Loud.

"reviewcomment":"Came here last Saturday for a good friend&#39;s birthday dinner. There were 9 of us, and we all know how hard good service can come by for larger groups. <br><br>I had trouble deciding between two wines, and our server was able to make an educated recommendation, and provide a sample of each for me. I ordered the Caesar salad, and the mussels, which were served in a tarragon cream sauce that evening. Both were excellent, and exceeded my expectations. I was really impressed (and that&#39;s hard, since I&#39;m very picky when it comes to higher end dining!)<br><br>The server was attentive and quick; she even asked about our (hidden) cake discreetly, and recommended supplying sparklers instead of the candles we brought. When cake was served up, she had each slice served with an amazing raspberry coulis. <br><br>All in all, excellent food, excellent service, and the location/view was amazing.

Phenomenal.<br>an &#34;adult&#34; environment (I&#39;ve seen people bring kids in and the staff are always accommodating, but they&#39;re clearly not set up for children, which makes this place perfect if you want to have some mom and dad date time)<br>Short wait times<br>Consistency<br>(additional compliments could continue for forever)<br><br>I come here a few times a month with Mr. J when I finish work, which is the perfect time to go because lunch is over, the girls are relaxed, and we almost always get a booth.<br><br>Cons? I can&#39;t really think of any right now that would apply. All the women working there have better hair than I do? Can I knock an establishment for that? ;)<br><br>In any event, I highly recommend this place if you&#39;re downtown and want drinks, dinner, or both.",

"reviewcomment":"I was totally blown away by their food &amp; service last night! my S/O suggested this place as it was in the neighbourhood but I hadn&#39;t been there before. We decided on take out. So I called in our order, and the gentlemen who answered the phone was SO friendly and attentive (which is not the case sometimes at other restaurants when you call to place an order) and told me about 10 - 15 minutes. When I went to pick up the order I was greeted very politely by the staff, and told it would be just a moment and offered a drink while I waited.  Every interaction I had with a staff member was done politely, professional, and welcoming. The place was bustling for a Friday night... but everyone seemed to be on their A-game and happy to be there. <br>I got my food and took it home. <br><br>We ordered a prawn souvlaki and a chicken souvlaki. the food was carefully packaged and divided. They have a unique take-a-way tray that has individual portioned areas for the rice, vegetables, protein/potatoes. they had a separate container for the Greek salad, and another one for the tzakiki. Let me just say this... everything was awesome but the roasted potatoes blew me away. I have NEVER tasted roasted potatoes that were so good in my life. I don&#39;t know what your secret is but they were phenomenal (and I don&#39;t even usually like potatoes too much). Over all it was delicious. Portion sizes were fabulous (I have a little leftover for lunch today.. excited!), and the food was yummy! <br><br>Will definitely be back!!",

"reviewcomment":"Love the value of the entrees here.  Most kebab dishes are under $10.  I usually pay an extra $1 for salad and rice.  Food quality is great for the price.  <br><br>This time we ordered kashkeh bademjoon.  It is a deep fried eggplant spread. I could taste the mint but cannot make out the rest of the spices.  I found it went well with the pita.  It was quite interesting to try as I am not familiar with Persian food.<br><br>We got tahdeeg as a free appetizer.  Crispy rice served with bits of beef.  This version is better than the one we tried at AVA Restaurant.  There was more sauce to go with the rice hence it was less dry.  I know there are different versions but I like sauce :)!<br><br>The kebabs are moist and flavourful.  I think the quality of the meat is good for the price.  Salad was fresh.  Rice was alright.<br><br>The service was only okay.  It seems like asking for water always require staff to be asked multiple times.  This seems to be a trend with Persian restaurants I have visited.  Service is minimal.<br><br>I am giving 4 stars for the value and free appetizer.  Last time I was here we did not get the tahdeeg on the house.  Seems like the competition in the area is getting tough and this is the second restaurant we got this for free.  AVA Restaurant also served this as a free appetizer with along with some pita.",

"reviewcomment":"Trendy, dim lighting, sort of upscale-ish Japanese fusion spot.  Checked this place out for happy hour - excellent quality food for under $5 per platter.  I&#39;m a bit impressed as $5 happy hour appetizers in the Bay Area will only get you a plate of garlic fries.  The portions are smaller here, but you&#39;re getting quality food at an upscale place.  <br><br>We tried the hot wings, gyoza, ebi mayo (tempura prawns), dynamite roll, kinoka (rice in stone pot), and beef tataki.  Total we had about 8 platters to share between 5 people - we could have ordered more, but decided not to.  If your party is hungry or consists of big eaters, I would recommend ordering 2 or 3 plates per person.  <br><br>We also picked up a large sized cold sake ($27) - interestingly was served in a frozen bamboo jug.  More of novelty - a glass bottle would have made it easier to pour though. Once you&#39;re tipsy....I would imagine people would be spilling sake all over the table since you have no idea when the sake is coming out.  Where&#39;s the see through bamboo jug?  <br><br>Most of the appetizers were pretty good - hot wings, ebi mayo (prawns), kinoka (rice in stone pot), and beef tataki.  The gyoza and dynamite roll were decent as well, but didn&#39;t knock my socks off; however, I would still order these again.  <br><br>I&#39;d come back here again for happy hour.",

"reviewcomment":"I was recently introduced to this place and I must say it&#39;s one of the very few places lately that I can&#39;t wait to go back to. Nice atmosphere, airy and funky without trying too hard - so much that I can even overlook to &#39;communal table&#39; concept (that I personally loathe) - and a bonus - it&#39;s connected next door to a nice rosters cafe where you can actually take your food to eat at a normal table, or have coffee/cake after your meal. Brilliant idea!<br><br>The food is delish and relatively affordable, definitely way more than a lot of other hipstery places. It is thai-vietnamese fusion, well presented, tasty, free-range, local and it just tastes really fresh. You can have noodles, rice, quinoa. The portions are nice and generous. THere is a nice diversity of food for a veggie menu, you won&#39;t miss meat even if you&#39;re not vegetarian. Just so far I have nothing negative to say!",

The menu consisted of all my Korean favorites and were all fairly authentic in flavor. <br><br>A couple things: <br>My husband&#39;s dolsot wasn&#39;t hot enough to brown the rice as much as we&#39;d like. He likes the rice on the sides golden and crispy, almost scorched. But I guess this is a personal preference. <br><br>Our banchans were brought out after they served us our orders and by this time we had already started eating. I completely forgot about the banchans (perhaps they initially did too) as our dishes didn&#39;t really require it but it was noticeably late when it did arrive as we were probably in mid bite of our 3rd or 4th bite. <br><br>There seemed to be several Korean restaurants in the West End. Despite a few minor things I think this one is a pretty solid option to satisfy your Korean cravings.",

You&#39;ll have to expect that it&#39;s a little cozy and it&#39;ll be warm in there.<br><br>The food is absolutely heavenly! So yummy! We got in before last call at 830. The beef wrap is something similar to the Peking duck, what a pleasant surprise. The Tang tang noodles were just right and slightly spicy w a whole load of peanuts;) the man Tao (white buns) are do fluffy and fresh, they made it here! Definitely need to order the Shanghai buns that are w thin skin, delicious savory hot soup and excellently minced up porc, all handmade in front of you. I was most surprised w the salty soy soup which ill be coming back for more each time. The little wontons are the cutest.<br><br>Definitely our new hangout place!",

From the outside you would not expect how large it inside.<br><br>I&#39;ve held many get togethers with family and friends, birthdays, etc. here. It is the perfect place for groups (delicious flavourful tapas, pitchers of sangria, big tables, lively atmosphere). <br><br>La Bodega gets a 5 in my books for the delicious food &amp; fantastic ambience. <br><br>My favourite things to order are the patatas bravas (spicy potatoes), prawns in delicious butter galric sauce (make sure you order extra bread for dipping after!) and chorizo.

"reviewcomment":"I was totally blown away by their food &amp; service last night! my S/O suggested this place as it was in the neighbourhood but I hadn&#39;t been there before. We decided on take out. So I called in our order, and the gentlemen who answered the phone was SO friendly and attentive (which is not the case sometimes at other restaurants when you call to place an order) and told me about 10 - 15 minutes. When I went to pick up the order I was greeted very politely by the staff, and told it would be just a moment and offered a drink while I waited.  Every interaction I had with a staff member was done politely, professional, and welcoming. The place was bustling for a Friday night... but everyone seemed to be on their A-game and happy to be there. <br>I got my food and took it home. <br><br>We ordered a prawn souvlaki and a chicken souvlaki. the food was carefully packaged and divided. They have a unique take-a-way tray that has individual portioned areas for the rice, vegetables, protein/potatoes. they had a separate container for the Greek salad, and another one for the tzakiki. Let me just say this... everything was awesome but the roasted potatoes blew me away. I have NEVER tasted roasted potatoes that were so good in my life. I don&#39;t know what your secret is but they were phenomenal (and I don&#39;t even usually like potatoes too much). Over all it was delicious.

This restaurant has good food and is a cafeteria/bistro style restaurant. <br><br>Pros:<br>Large portions<br>Gluten Free<br>Lots of Extras<br>Reasonable Prices<br>Beautiful presentation<br><br>Cons:<br>Canned Shrimp (for salad wraps)<br>Spice grade is misleading and increased hotness just means more chili flakes, which are not a very flavorful spice<br><br>We ordered the Jungle Curry, Szechuan (spelled that right first try!) with Cashews, and lettuce wraps. I applaud their use of iceberg (which gets an unfairly negative rep in my humble opinion) for the wraps, because the leaves have a shape like little bowls and are very easy to load up. <br><br>I couldn&#39;t finish my noodles, but my companion finished his Jungle Curry, which he seemed to really, really enjoy.<br><br>I would absolutely go back to try different things. The staff don&#39;t interact with customers too frequently (apart from order taking and food delivery for eat-in customers) but everyone I spoke to was lovely and had clean fingernails, which I prize in food servers.<br><br>If you&#39;re ever by the main Vancouver Public Library you should take a walk down homer and give this place a try.",

"reviewcomment":"This eclectic French bistro located in a slightly iffy part of town is worth the trip! <br>Remember Michael (from Moustache Cafe), he&#39;s front-of-house here and is running this dining room with the precision of an operating theatre (I mean that in the best possible way.) Getting folks in and out of this busy and small restaurant can&#39;t be easy and watching Michael is like watching a slightly mystical ballet unfold. <br><br>My date and I both had the Table d&#39;hote. I believe it was $29 for 3 courses. We ate like royalty. Never have I  &#39;finished&#39; as much food as I did at Jules. We both had the steak and frites, and mine was served with Peppercorn sauce, which I loved!  Ate all of it! My salad was great and my date&#39;s soup was perfect. <br><br>And you needn&#39;t have the chocolate terrine for desert as listed. I had a desert called &#34;Oranges&#34; which led me to tip the plate of syrup into my mouth at the end of it. (I had no shame.) And I then proceeded to eat the rest of my date&#39;s desert, which I think was grilled pineapple. These were the best deserts I&#39;ve ever eaten. <br><br>We had a charming French waitress who was very good and there is also a knockout redhead behind the bar (gotta give a shout out to all redheads) who also brought plates out to diners, keeping things moving. <br><br>This is a dance I am happy to repeat.",

"reviewcomment":"The atmosphere and decor are charming. Very farm to table with the chalk boards, wooden tables, mason jars. Came here on Sunday afternoon.<br><br>Banana Bread - Their version of table bread. Sooooo gooooddddd. Has a sugary/caramelized muffin top. Sadly, for table of two, they gave once slice cut in half, but hey, it was free so can you really complain?  <br><br>Blackened Steelhead Trout - Ordered this on a whim and loved is. The fish was so soft and tender and juicy, seasoned delicately with salt and pepper. Loved the pairing with avocado salsa (isn&#39;t this just guacamole?), just wished there was a little more (but who doesn&#39;t want more avocado in every meal? Cous cous salad was good as well.<br><br>Braised Beef Short Rib Macaroni - This one was a little disappointing. The short rib was soft and juicy, but the mushroom sauce itself was a little lacking in flavor. <br><br>I would definitely recommend this charming farm to table restaurant!",

"reviewcomment":"Saigon Sour (apple juice, chamomile syrup, lime, gomme, ginger, lemongrass, thai basil, kaffir lime leaf, cilantro, red chili pepper, fresh lime, egg white, fresh apple) $5 4/5 - not overly sweet.  Too bad it was 1/2 filled with ice.  I picked this because a lot of their drinks have ginger in them.<br>Hawker Thai Chicken Wings (sweet &amp; spicy nahm jim glaze) $13 4.5/5 - It was about a pound.  Crispy skin with flavourful glaze.  The flavour reminds me of honey glazed BBQ.  Some pieces with chili on top can be a bit spicier.  Some people tried to compare them to Phnom Penh&#39;s but I think they are totally different things.<br>Cha Ca Hanoi (ling cod, market greens, turmeric chili coconut milk, dill, rice vermicelli, nuoc cham, fresh herbs, scallions) $15 3/5 - the rice vermicelli was too mushy.  Very strong taste of coconut milk but  a little bit too bland. The lingcod was not that fresh.<br>Indonesian Peanut Noodles (shiitake mushrooms, charred eggplant, spinach, bean sprouts, egg noodles, sambal ginger peanut sauce) 3.5/5 $14 - I didn&#39;t enjoy this as much as my friend did.  I found their noodles were a bit overcooked too.<br>Nasi Goreng (classic Indonesian stirfried rice, chicken, shrimp, tomatoes, sweet onions, peas, fried egg) $15 4/5 - very big portion and I took 1/2 of it home.  Very flavourful.  The rice was on the wet side.  Too bad they put too much salt on my fried egg. <br>Chai Chocolate Pot, milk chocolate, candy crumbs $8 3/5 - strong chai flavour.  A little thicker than I want. <br>Coconut Panna Cotta, pineapple salsa, shaved ice $7 3.5/5 - reminds me of the yellow split pea coconut pudding.<br><br>They only have benches but no chairs.  It might be a problem for some people.  We had to wait a bit for our mains to come after our wings.  The starch were a little too soft for me but flavours were good.  I would visit more often if it opens for lunch (at least on weekends).",

I should have brought them here instead. Needless to say, I was embarrassed because foods were different from what I described earlier. <br><br>Next time every single friend of mine will visit this Sushi House ONLY. <br><br>Only downside is the small layout/floor, you can&#39;t really get more than 4 very FIT friends inside there at one time, considering other patrons too.",

"reviewcomment":"New India is a very comfortable, and spacious restaurant, definitely more than enough room to take in scenery of a restaurant, and decorated very well. There is a vast outdoor patio right in front of awesome futuristic views to Downtown&amp; West End Vancouver skyline, and definitely a restaurant destination in overall presentation. <br><br>Food is quite innovative, and I went to lots of other Indian restaurants not offering a majority of those restaurants meals showing a high level of variety to Indian cuisine. Buffet shows unlimited options, and quite affordable to get an endless infinite amount of food in separate meal combinations of spicy, herbal, full of aroma, curry vegetables, fruity nutty sweet rice, and meat curry blends together in a meal. One of my favorite restaurants in Vancouver, and not too expensive.",

We decided on take out. So I called in our order, and the gentlemen who answered the phone was SO friendly and attentive (which is not the case sometimes at other restaurants when you call to place an order) and told me about 10 - 15 minutes. When I went to pick up the order I was greeted very politely by the staff, and told it would be just a moment and offered a drink while I waited.  Every interaction I had with a staff member was done politely, professional, and welcoming. The place was bustling for a Friday night... but everyone seemed to be on their A-game and happy to be there. <br>I got my food and took it home. <br><br>We ordered a prawn souvlaki and a chicken souvlaki. the food was carefully packaged and divided. They have a unique take-a-way tray that has individual portioned areas for the rice, vegetables, protein/potatoes. they had a separate container for the Greek salad, and another one for the tzakiki. Let me just say this... everything was awesome but the roasted potatoes blew me away. I have NEVER tasted roasted potatoes that were so good in my life. I don&#39;t know what your secret is but they were phenomenal (and I don&#39;t even usually like potatoes too much). Over all it was delicious. Portion sizes were fabulous (I have a little leftover for lunch today.. excited!), and the food was yummy! <br><br>Will definitely be back!!",

There are a lot of choices for sushi in this city, and the hall mark of any of them should be the quality and fresh-ness of the fish. Kaide hit&#39;s it spot on. Gloriously fresh, melt in your mouth cuts. Delicate, and flavourful. Personally I opted to go Omakase, and I&#39;d recommend it to anyone visiting Kaide. <br><br>Kaide also produces a classic set of rolls, along with some house and regional specialities. Kaide provides all of this is a simple, small, yet classy. atmosphere. Mix in friendly wait staff, and great chefs and you&#39;ve got the winning combination to be a five star sushi joint in Vancouver. <br><br>Of course the last hallmark of greatness is consistency, and time and time again Kaide has delivered it with much flare. It&#39;s probably better to get there during the week or earlier on Fridays, the size leads to crowd.",

"reviewcomment":"I had been meaning to try this place for a really long time but never got a chance until recently. Only a few tables were occupied, which is probably due to the restaurant&#39;s location.<br><br>We ordered spring rolls, green curry, massaman curry, and pad thai. I didn&#39;t like the spring rolls very much. We got a spicy level of 4 for everything and I thought it was pretty spicy. The massaman curry was my favourite. The pad thai was great as well, not gross and ketchup-y.<br><br>We were also given complimentary mango ice cream, which was a nice ending to the meal. We ended up taking most of the food home, so I got to enjoy excellent Thai food again the next day!<br><br>Can&#39;t wait to go back to try more dishes.",

"reviewcomment":"This is a place the average person hates. Hell, I hate a place like cactus club in most cities (LA, Miami, Dallas). It had that initial vibe of exuberant, power douche lounge bar.  But the vibe changed as we drank. Honestly, it became a fantastic place to drink for a few reasons.<br><br>An obvious reason is the beauty of the hostesses. Yes, I sound like an ass pointing that out but it&#39;s true. Deep down it&#39;s something a male traveler can admire, I hate to admit.  Also they were friendly so it&#39;s not all vanity. We were attended to as we needed something and with friendliness. <br><br>Another reason is the drinks are well made. I&#39;d never heard of a caesar cocktail in my life. I&#39;m from Texas. They don&#39;t exist. It&#39;s like an alternative to a Bloody Mary or the Canadian michelada. It had a skewer with pepper, mozzarella, olive, and some sort if amazing pickled onion. I thought it was great. That kiwi laden cocktail was awesome, too. <br><br>Lastly and simply, it&#39;s a stop in yaletown. You don&#39;t want to go to yaletown and not barhop and you don&#39;t initially want to be hammered and fist pumping. You want to start at a place you can chat with a group until tipsy enough to rage elsewhere. Here you can get that early buzz and then harbor it elsewhere. And specials are pretty good.",

"reviewcomment":"What a fantastic place! If you&#39;re looking for old school sort of regal or a nice fancy date night, this spot is great. I love that it&#39;s tucked away downtown inside the Wedgewood Hotel so it&#39;s not super busy, and they make you feel like a million bucks while you&#39;re in there.<br><br>I&#39;ve been here before for a few after work drinks, but recently I went there for a dine out dinner with a large group. The coordinator I worked with made sure we had everything we needed, she got us the private room that was a great space for us (seats 14 comfortably, but any more than that I think it might start being a bit squishy). The service was amazing, we were well taken care of, and even when I caused a bunch of confusion with the bill at the end of the night our server took care of it without issue and  all with an apology (even though I swear it wasn&#39;t his fault) - he was SO nice.<br><br>The food was delicious! Portions on the main were a bit small, but the set menu for dine out this year was fantastic and for $38 it was definitely well worth it. The starter (chicken liver pate) was amazing. The texture was very smooth, and the portion was very generous - they also gave us extra bread for our pate! The main (duck confit) was well textured though the skin on mine was a little hard in some places and really sticky in others. The lentils were cooked perfectly, and the sauce complimented well. My dessert (chocolate creme brulee) was very nice as well, though nothing amazing. I appreciate that the chocolate creme was very rich and that it wasn&#39;t very sweet. We also ordered some fries to share around the table, and they were really good. (almost up there with Blue Water!)<br><br>The other food options they had on their menu looked really good as well, so it was a difficult choice (the woodland mushroom soup and the salmon both looked really good!). Really a fantastic option for a nice dinner out with coworkers or for a date. Their cocktails are quite good as well, and the main lounge / dining area is certainly a good place to stop by for drinks after work! I highly recommend you consider it for your next (small) formal function!<br><br>Easily accessible by Burrard or Granville stations, or pretty much all transit since it&#39;s downtown.",

"reviewcomment":"I was totally blown away by their food &amp; service last night! my S/O suggested this place as it was in the neighbourhood but I hadn&#39;t been there before. We decided on take out. So I called in our order, and the gentlemen who answered the phone was SO friendly and attentive (which is not the case sometimes at other restaurants when you call to place an order) and told me about 10 - 15 minutes. When I went to pick up the order I was greeted very politely by the staff, and told it would be just a moment and offered a drink while I waited.  Every interaction I had with a staff member was done politely, professional, and welcoming. The place was bustling for a Friday night... but everyone seemed to be on their A-game and happy to be there. <br>I got my food and took it home. <br><br>We ordered a prawn souvlaki and a chicken souvlaki. the food was carefully packaged and divided. They have a unique take-a-way tray that has individual portioned areas for the rice, vegetables, protein/potatoes. they had a separate container for the Greek salad, and another one for the tzakiki. Let me just say this... everything was awesome but the roasted potatoes blew me away. I have NEVER tasted roasted potatoes that were so good in my life. I don&#39;t know what your secret is but they were phenomenal (and I don&#39;t even usually like potatoes too much). Over all it was delicious. Portion sizes were fabulous (I have a little leftover for lunch today.. excited!), and the food was yummy! <br><br>Will definitely be back!!",

"reviewcomment":"What can I say? I was having one of those days, &#34;Me WANT Pad Thai, NOW!&#34;<br><br>My boyfriend and I decided to try this place because of the good reviews and it being one of the only places open early afternoon on a Sunday.<br><br>As soon has we walked in we were greeted with a bow from our server/host. He was the most friendliest server in the world. He gave us our menus, and we contemplated on our drinks. Our server could tell that I was having a hard time deciding so he offered a taste sample of the plum juice. It was way to sweet for me so we decided to order the thai iced tea. The iced tea was SOOO delicious. I was very unenthused when my boyfriend ordered the ice tea because I know how sweet the ones in the grocery store are. These ones however, tasted like they were prepared from real tea, cooled, and only slightly sweetened. It looked like  a tad of coconut cream was added at the bottom of the glass, which added a nice kick!<br><br>We started our meal with an order of chicken/pork satays. The chicken satay was the best I have ever had, so juicy! The pork was good, but nothing special.<br><br>For the entrees, we  ordered the pad thai (of course), and the duck curry. The pad thai was fantastic, the best I have ever had in a restaurant; it satisfied my cravings completely. The combination of spicey, sweet, sour, and salty was bang on. The duck curry had huge chunk of lychee and pineapple. The sauce was not overly sweet. The flavour of the lychee and the pineapple complimented the duck and the red curry paste wonderfully!<br><br>We were too full for dessert by the end, but they all looked very delicious! A tad too expensive, however...<br><br>This place was awesome :&#39;) I am so happy I came here today. My tummy was happy all day long.",

"reviewcomment":"When you find yourself asking the question: how the hell do I feed 50 people for under $100? <br><br>This. This is how.<br><br>Enter event day, with mere hours before kick off, I, in an act of misguided multitasking and lunacy, decide to try and balance a food tray and a folding table, while opening my car door with my foot. Needless to say, I quickly and unceremoniously dumped my entire feed for 50 on the ground of my back alley. Neighbourhood crows: you are welcome.<br><br>*Enter panic mode here*<br><br>It&#39;s Monday. Both my go-to sushi joints are closed and i&#39;ve got t-minus 2 hours before the event. After a few quick stomps around my yard, I chug a coffee, grab my iPhone and hope to hell Yelp can save the day. 15 minutes later i&#39;m walking into Dream Sushi with a wing and a prayer: &#34;Do you do party platters?&#34;<br><br>They do. Thank lordy, they do.<br><br>They actually have an entire page dedicated to party platters... which I suppose isn&#39;t out of the norm for most sushi joints. What IS out of the norm? The platters run in the $25-40 range a piece and each have 40-50 pieces a pop. I gather you can do the math but whoa - cheap! Plus, unlike some places that require a ton of lead time, Dream needed 20 minutes max to whip up this party saving platterfest. 150 pieces of sushi ran me just under $90. Not bad, not bad at all.<br><br>What&#39;s more - the sushi was a hit (or at least, i&#39;m assuming it was, it was gone within minutes). So all in all, though I haven&#39;t been here for dinner or eaten more then one piece of this sushi - this place both gets a solid four stars and a firm spot on my go-to list for future events. TIp of the event hat to you Dream!",

I wish they made Pocky&#39;s that big, that would be a dream (I actually did have a dream in which I ate out of a large Pocky box. My dream dictionary could not tell me what this meant). This is an Asian Grocery store primarily Japanese. I love Japanese junk food. They have the largest selection of Pocky&#39;s in many different flavors. Some local and others imported like green tea flavor. I always go to the til with 5 - 7 boxes of Pocky&#39;s. I am sure that the guy at the til must think I am on glue with all these Pocky&#39;s. Sometimes there is a language barrier, however, every time I walk in the guy says, &#34;New flavor&#34; and I get excited. I buy a box before a concert so that I have something to snack on during the show.",

"reviewcomment":"I was totally blown away by their food &amp; service last night! my S/O suggested this place as it was in the neighbourhood but I hadn&#39;t been there before. We decided on take out. So I called in our order, and the gentlemen who answered the phone was SO friendly and attentive (which is not the case sometimes at other restaurants when you call to place an order) and told me about 10 - 15 minutes. When I went to pick up the order I was greeted very politely by the staff, and told it would be just a moment and offered a drink while I waited.  Every interaction I had with a staff member was done politely, professional, and welcoming. The place was bustling for a Friday night... but everyone seemed to be on their A-game and happy to be there. <br>I got my food and took it home. <br><br>We ordered a prawn souvlaki and a chicken souvlaki. the food was carefully packaged and divided. They have a unique take-a-way tray that has individual portioned areas for the rice, vegetables, protein/potatoes. they had a separate container for the Greek salad, and another one for the tzakiki. Let me just say this... everything was awesome but the roasted potatoes blew me away. I have NEVER tasted roasted potatoes that were so good in my life. I don&#39;t know what your secret is but they were phenomenal (and I don&#39;t even usually like potatoes too much). Over all it was delicious. Portion sizes were fabulous (I have a little leftover for lunch today.. excited!), and the food was yummy! <br><br>Will definitely be back!!",

"reviewcomment":"Came here after hearing great things about the restaurant! Although quite pricey, me and my two companions thoroughly enjoyed our dinner. <br><br>We started with oysyer shots and shrimp toast. The oyster shots were unique and very tasty. Probably one of the best oyster shots I&#39;ve had! The shrimp toast came with fresh shrimp but I didn&#39;t find it that special.<br><br>Then came the &#34;light&#34; dishes. We shared the octopus dish they had on special, the mushroom with snap peas purée and yuzu brown butter sauce, raw scallops with pomegranate and red curry oil, and chicken wings with Korean BBQ sauce. My favourite dish of the night was the raw scallops but the mushrooms were extremely delicious! Chicken wings came highly recommended but I wasn&#39;t wowed by it but it was still tasty. My least enjoyed was the special octopus dish. It was a bit dry and lacked flavour.<br><br>We then ordered a few savoury, &#34;heavier&#34; dishes. We had the foie gras rice bowl, the pork belly rice bowl, beef brisket with Gorgonzola and the half duck. All the dishes were SOOOOO good! The pork belly was good but nothing special! The foie gras rice bowl was different and had a very distinct taste. Definitely worth a try. The beef brisket with Gorgonzola was strong! This was warned by the waiter...but we decided to give it a try. If you don&#39;t like blue cheese or Gorgonzola, I don&#39;t think you&#39;d enjoy it. The half duck was an amazing deal! For $31 you literally get half a duck! The breast seemed like it was duck l&#39;orange and the rest was prepared confit style!!<br><br>We were too full to even try dessert but I did have their award winning PIMs cup! All in all, my new favourite restaurant to visit! I definitely give this restaurant two thumbs up! Just be prepared to drop some bills :)",

"reviewcomment":"We were walking around in Gastown on Saturday, trying to find a place for dinner.  We came upon Incendio, and were intrigued by the &#34;Italian soul food&#34; slogan on their sign.  We approached the front door, wanting to check out the menu.  The driver waiting outside told us the food is great, so we got a table.  I guess it was still early enough in the evening that we got a table right away.<br><br>The inside of the restaurant is nicely lit without being too bright or too dark.  And the surrounding is clean and orderly.  We were helped right away by our server.  We ordered the antipasto plate, a 12&#34; Gastown pizza, and the cioppino.  The antipasto plate was loaded with so much goodies.  And the Gastown pizza was fragrant and the gorgonzola cheese was just perfectly melted and gooey.  I really enjoyed the cioppino the most, as I love seafood.  The seafood was abundant, and the flavoring was on-point, not too salty and overwhelming.<br><br>We enjoyed the great service, ambience and food.  And we will definitely recommend this restaurant and come back for more treats.",

"reviewcomment":"On a rather cold Tuesday night a friend and I decided to go check out a cheap movie and were hungry so this place next next door to the theatre was the best option.<br><br>This neighbourhood as it is called downtown, which means lots of chains and some pricy french joints. <br><br>The decor is modern and the presence of a wood burning oven was a good sign as you walk in. The ambience is similar to a Boston Pizza, maybe because they use the same colour scheme. <br><br>Our server was very friendly and sat us upstairs on the balcony which gave us a good view of the bar. The service was very fast and good.<br><br>We started off with a ceasar salad, with ample amounts of fresh parmesan grated at the table. We shared one of the signature pizzas&#39;s, Sicilian, full of olives and vegetables and a good amount of meaty parts, pepperoni and something else not very memorable.<br><br>I gave this place four stars as the food is healthy, delicious and the service is very fast and pleasant.",

"reviewcomment":"I just finished having brunch here with my food group here on New Year&#39;s Day. I had read some of the negative reviews before coming here about the brunch buffet and was skeptical. I was proven wrong.  The only thing I can say is that those people who wrote bad reviews wouldn&#39;t know a good thing if it hit them in the head. This brunch buffet is the best. To the one reviewer who said eating here was like setting two $20 bills on fire, I have no idea where this lady usually eats..... maybe Buckingham Palace but the food, service and ambiance here were EXCEPTIONAL. Oru loves breakfast!<br><br>Buffet brunch consists of in house made meats such as bacon, ham two kinds of sausages,(oh my so good!) salmon done two ways. They will make eggs any way you like including bennies with salmon or crab. There are cocoanut pancakes, homemade chocolate waffles, brioche French toast, hash with chorizo, great pastries, a large selection of cheeses, bowls of Chantilly cream  and lots of fruit, homemade donuts brought to your table, yogurt parfaits, fish tacos, chile taquitos, (haven&#39;t had that for breakfast since travelling in México) lox and bagels...the list goes on. Service was exceptional refiling coffee and tea every minute, bringing fresh squeezed juice to the table. The manager personally walking around to make sure everyone had what they needed. <br><br>I think the previous reviewers who wrote that staff here were rude were making it up. There was even a make your own Ceasar bar and the first shot was on the house. One person at out table actually got enough free vodka to the equivalent to 4 shots. At $33 this buffet is a steal for the quality of food you get. They use the best ingredients i.e bottles of Noble maple syrup, bowls of Chantilly cream, Neufchatel cheese. I am always skeptical at buffets but this is the real deal which Is why I was so confused by the negative responses. Staff were friendly, accommodating and courteous. Its hard to find good service in Vancouver where the norm is the &#34;hipster I don&#39;t care that you in my establishment attitude&#34; prevails. Oru does not disappoint.",

"reviewcomment":"I was totally blown away by their food &amp; service last night! my S/O suggested this place as it was in the neighbourhood but I hadn&#39;t been there before. We decided on take out. So I called in our order, and the gentlemen who answered the phone was SO friendly and attentive (which is not the case sometimes at other restaurants when you call to place an order) and told me about 10 - 15 minutes. When I went to pick up the order I was greeted very politely by the staff, and told it would be just a moment and offered a drink while I waited.  Every interaction I had with a staff member was done politely, professional, and welcoming. The place was bustling for a Friday night... but everyone seemed to be on their A-game and happy to be there. <br>I got my food and took it home. <br><br>We ordered a prawn souvlaki and a chicken souvlaki. the food was carefully packaged and divided. They have a unique take-a-way tray that has individual portioned areas for the rice, vegetables, protein/potatoes. they had a separate container for the Greek salad, and another one for the tzakiki. Let me just say this... everything was awesome but the roasted potatoes blew me away. I have NEVER tasted roasted potatoes that were so good in my life. I don&#39;t know what your secret is but they were phenomenal (and I don&#39;t even usually like potatoes too much). Over all it was delicious. Portion sizes were fabulous (I have a little leftover for lunch today.. excited!), and the food was yummy! <br><br>Will definitely be back!!",

Unpretentious retro 50s diner look, with neon that works, very cool.<br>Really good roti, delicious, the best I&#39;ve ever had. Crispy and hot a treat. The spiced  dipping sauce is so very complex flavored. <br>Laksa is divinely seasoned, perfection . <br>Singapore noodle is good. Curry chicken is a generous portion. Every dish makes you feel like your in someplace exotic.<br>A great place to come back again and again",

Since we didn&#39;t have reservations and we were just a party of two, we had the treat of being seated in one of these booths.<br><br>Everything we ordered was super tasty: ebi mayo, duck breast, chicken, beef (sorry, I don&#39;t recall which one). Strangely though, the stand out dish were the yakioni, or grilled rice balls with butter shoyu. <br><br>As this was a snack excursion, I can&#39;t comment on many of the menu items but I feel assured that you can&#39;t go wrong no matter what is selected. I would definitely order the duck breast and rice balls again but I&#39;d also explore the grill and oden menu more fully.

"reviewcomment":"I was totally blown away by their food &amp; service last night! my S/O suggested this place as it was in the neighbourhood but I hadn&#39;t been there before. We decided on take out. So I called in our order, and the gentlemen who answered the phone was SO friendly and attentive (which is not the case sometimes at other restaurants when you call to place an order) and told me about 10 - 15 minutes. When I went to pick up the order I was greeted very politely by the staff, and told it would be just a moment and offered a drink while I waited.  Every interaction I had with a staff member was done politely, professional, and welcoming. The place was bustling for a Friday night... but everyone seemed to be on their A-game and happy to be there. <br>I got my food and took it home. <br><br>We ordered a prawn souvlaki and a chicken souvlaki. the food was carefully packaged and divided. They have a unique take-a-way tray that has individual portioned areas for the rice, vegetables, protein/potatoes. they had a separate container for the Greek salad, and another one for the tzakiki. Let me just say this... everything was awesome but the roasted potatoes blew me away. I have NEVER tasted roasted potatoes that were so good in my life. I don&#39;t know what your secret is but they were phenomenal (and I don&#39;t even usually like potatoes too much). Over all it was delicious. Portion sizes were fabulous (I have a little leftover for lunch today.. excited!), and the food was yummy! <br><br>Will definitely be back!!",

"reviewcomment":"I had no idea that there was a Romer&#39;s on this side of Vancouver. I&#39;ve been to the location in Kits a number of times and have always enjoyed my burgers so I was pretty excited to check out one that is closer to home. <br><br>I ordered the magic mushroom burger which was tasty. It wasn&#39;t full of mushroom goodness - they could have piled on more mushrooms - but I liked the addition of the herb garlic Boursin. We ordered a sharable plate of their fries with two dipping sauces: truffle aioli, which was fantastic and I&#39;d order it again, and a bacon mayo, which was a bit strange. It had weird chunks of stuff in it. It seemed like they were going after a baked potato flavour and it definitely paled in comparison to the truffle aioli. I had one of their $5 Caesars as well which was tasty. I&#39;m not a big Caesar fan, but I finished all of mine. <br><br>Service was good. Fairly prompt and there was no pressure to leave when we were done. On a nice day, I can see it being great to sit out on the patio and enjoy the sun and river view. I&#39;ll definitely be back - especially since it&#39;s so much closer to me compared to the other locations.",

Admittedly I&#39;m a fan of (meat-free) burritos and haven&#39;t experimented much outside of that - why mess with a good thing? The prawn burrito is my new preferred dish with the old faithful, bean burrito, a very close second. <br><br>Local, casual, friendly, tasty!

We stopped in late on a Friday night, and they very kindly served us (even though we arrived 5 minutes before the kitchen was closing. <br><br>I ordered the Ukranian Dinner and what I was served was a hearty helping of 2 Cabbage Rolls, 6 Assorted Perogies, Coleslaw, Beet Salad &amp; Sausage. I was a bit put of by the price ( a hefty $20) but it was worth it! I can&#39;t believe I even contemplated eating all that food by myself! The serving was massive, the food was rich and flavourful and most importantly - the service was warm and attentive! <br><br>I will definitely make my way back there for another meal in the near future - maybe I won&#39;t go quite so hungry (although left over cabbage rolls are always good!)",

We decided on take out. So I called in our order, and the gentlemen who answered the phone was SO friendly and attentive (which is not the case sometimes at other restaurants when you call to place an order) and told me about 10 - 15 minutes. When I went to pick up the order I was greeted very politely by the staff, and told it would be just a moment and offered a drink while I waited.  Every interaction I had with a staff member was done politely, professional, and welcoming. The place was bustling for a Friday night... but everyone seemed to be on their A-game and happy to be there. <br>I got my food and took it home. <br><br>We ordered a prawn souvlaki and a chicken souvlaki. the food was carefully packaged and divided. They have a unique take-a-way tray that has individual portioned areas for the rice, vegetables, protein/potatoes. they had a separate container for the Greek salad, and another one for the tzakiki. Let me just say this... everything was awesome but the roasted potatoes blew me away. I have NEVER tasted roasted potatoes that were so good in my life. I don&#39;t know what your secret is but they were phenomenal (and I don&#39;t even usually like potatoes too much). Over all it was delicious. Portion sizes were fabulous (I have a little leftover for lunch today.. excited!), and the food was yummy! <br><br>Will definitely be back!!",

"reviewcomment":"Came here for Dine Out Vancouver last Friday. <br><br>I personally chose the following:<br><br>1: Meen Puttu steamed Ling cod tossed with green chillies, turmeric, coconut and mustard seeds<br><br>This was very flavourful - I&#39;m not usually one to mix savoury and sweet so it was a nice confusion for my tastebuds! The cod is a little on the salty side but the coconut kind of offsets it. Pretty big sized serving<br><br>2: Manglore Chicken- full flavoured chicken curry with high notes of star anise, whole garlic and coriander tempered with curry leaves shallots and dried red chillies for a smoky finish.<br><br>This was delicious! Chicken was so tender, rice was moist and the little side dishes were good too. Huge serving size and so many wonderful flavours. I am not good at eating spicy food so I was hissing a little haha but it was so worth it! <br><br>3: Mango Ice Cream- Hand chumped, Indian style ice cream, flavoured with mangoes.<br><br>Super creamy and flavourful - sprinkled almond slices on top was a nice finish.<br><br>The restaurant is very clean and well decorated. I&#39;ve been to a few other indian places and I&#39;m pretty impressed by the cleanliness of Chutney Villa. Servers were very friendly and even though the restaurant was completely full (no empty tables) everything came out to our table in a timely manner.<br><br>Will definitely be going back for our next indian food craving!",

People around us ordered the Pho and from all the happy slurping noises, they sound very happy with their lunch.<br><br>We chose: as we are trying to cut down out carbs..<br><br>Iced Vietnamese coffee<br>Iced plum with Soda - tangy and sweet, very refreshing<br><br>Vietnamese Crepe - this thing is ginormous with lots of lettuce to make the wrap, tons of Thai Basil and mint, cucumber and pickled daikon and carrots and the biggest crepe filled with big prawns, meat and sprouts. This is listed in the appetizer and it&#39;s a meal size item.  <br>Everything is so fresh and tasty, I was half full already after making one wrap.<br><br>#42 pork skewers with shrimp wrapped sugar cane over light vermicelli sheets, also comes with tons of greens. <br><br>Very healthy to wrap everything inside the large lettuce leaf. <br><br>The servers are very friendly and nice and constantly come by to refill your water or tea glass.<br><br>We will definitely return again.",

"reviewcomment":"I was totally blown away by their food &amp; service last night! my S/O suggested this place as it was in the neighbourhood but I hadn&#39;t been there before. We decided on take out. So I called in our order, and the gentlemen who answered the phone was SO friendly and attentive (which is not the case sometimes at other restaurants when you call to place an order) and told me about 10 - 15 minutes. When I went to pick up the order I was greeted very politely by the staff, and told it would be just a moment and offered a drink while I waited.  Every interaction I had with a staff member was done politely, professional, and welcoming. The place was bustling for a Friday night... but everyone seemed to be on their A-game and happy to be there. <br>I got my food and took it home. <br><br>We ordered a prawn souvlaki and a chicken souvlaki. the food was carefully packaged and divided. They have a unique take-a-way tray that has individual portioned areas for the rice, vegetables, protein/potatoes. they had a separate container for the Greek salad, and another one for the tzakiki. Let me just say this... everything was awesome but the roasted potatoes blew me away. I have NEVER tasted roasted potatoes that were so good in my life. I don&#39;t know what your secret is but they were phenomenal (and I don&#39;t even usually like potatoes too much). Over all it was delicious. Portion sizes were fabulous (I have a little leftover for lunch today.. excited!), and the food was yummy! <br><br>Will definitely be back!!",

Any table in the restaurant has an amazing view of the beach.<br><br>Service was decent. It was not exceptional. But I have no big complaints. We shared the seafood platter to start. Crab cakes are delicious!  Strawberry specials all look enticing. We had the strawberry ice cream pie. It had a granola crust.",

"reviewcomment":"Alright guys, let&#39;s get one thing straight. This is not a premier Japanese food stable joint, and you shouldn&#39;t be expecting to have the best Japanese food ever. This restaurant is a commercialized/Americanized version of Japanese food, and in that regard, it is quite good. <br><br>The miso soup was decent, the Edamame was actually surprisingly good, and the main dish, the beef bowl, was pretty decent and filled me up quite well. I think I added a bit more soy sauce to the beef bowl to give it slightly a bit more flavour, as without it yes, it was slightly bland. <br><br>So why does it get 4 stars rather than 3, if it&#39;s not the most amazing Japanese food? Well first off, I was smart enough to realize that this my no means would be authentic Japanese food. The food was actually pretty cheap, and considering what I paid and how much I received, I&#39;m not going to cry buckets over having to add a bit of soy sauce in order to add a little flavour. Finally, I was actually quite happy with the service; the staff was attentive and very nice. <br><br>Basically, if you&#39;re going to eat at Gyudonya, know what you&#39;re getting yourself into. You&#39;re going in here when restaurants around you are closed, you spent too much money on your girlfriend and now are a broke ass, are tired of walking, or hey, don&#39;t actually mind cheap decent tasting Japanese food. At the end of the day, this place will fill you up, won&#39;t leave a bad taste in your mouth, and won&#39;t break the bank; sometimes, what more can you ask for?",

I was in love with each dish, and my friends and I had a hard time deciding which was our favourite.

"reviewcomment":"I was totally blown away by their food &amp; service last night! my S/O suggested this place as it was in the neighbourhood but I hadn&#39;t been there before. We decided on take out. So I called in our order, and the gentlemen who answered the phone was SO friendly and attentive (which is not the case sometimes at other restaurants when you call to place an order) and told me about 10 - 15 minutes. When I went to pick up the order I was greeted very politely by the staff, and told it would be just a moment and offered a drink while I waited.  Every interaction I had with a staff member was done politely, professional, and welcoming. The place was bustling for a Friday night... but everyone seemed to be on their A-game and happy to be there. <br>I got my food and took it home. <br><br>We ordered a prawn souvlaki and a chicken souvlaki. the food was carefully packaged and divided. They have a unique take-a-way tray that has individual portioned areas for the rice, vegetables, protein/potatoes. they had a separate container for the Greek salad, and another one for the tzakiki. Let me just say this... everything was awesome but the roasted potatoes blew me away. I have NEVER tasted roasted potatoes that were so good in my life. I don&#39;t know what your secret is but they were phenomenal (and I don&#39;t even usually like potatoes too much). Over all it was delicious. Portion sizes were fabulous (I have a little leftover for lunch today.. excited!), and the food was yummy! <br><br>Will definitely be back!!",

"reviewcomment":"Cannibal Cafe is my favourite go-to burger joint on Commercial Drive, hands down. I discovered this place almost two years ago by accident, and have been coming back ever since. I&#39;m a huge fan of their Big Blue, and the real blue cheese they use in their burger to give it the &#39;stink&#39; it so deserves, which makes it all the more tastier. While others say their burgers lack taste, I feel they are juicy and seasoned quite well. I&#39;ve never had any problems with their burgers or other food items.<br><br>The decor is a nice mix of wood, stainless steel, and...checkered tile flooring! Kind of a blend of a modern restaurant with a retro feel. They even have all these old posters of local events from years and years ago, which can keep you occupied just from reading them. Their staff is very attentive, and I always get asked if I need a top up of my bevy, ensuring my glass is never empty. Seldom do I find a place in this price range that offers this kind of attention, but these guys do.",

The definition of comfort food, in a quaint little restaurant, with generally good service, and massive portions. <br><br>No matter how much it makes me feel like a little kid, I can rarely pass up their Gooey Cheese Grillers and it pairs perfect with their delicious Sunset Corn and Chicken soup. <br><br>If you like soup and sandwiches, you should be going to Burgoo.",

And instead of all the chips being lazily stacked on top with all the toppings gooped in a pile (that your wasted friend may or may not eat all in one bite), these are layered beside each other so all the toppings melt down to every last delicious chip.

Limit one per table but by far the best value and tastes pretty good.  <br><br>Now to the dim sum, solid quality dim sum at a reasonable price.  If you come early, during the weekday, you receive 20% off your bill for dim sum items only.  The portions are bigger which is standard for most midrange priced restaurants.  You can tell the rice rolls and shrimp dumpling skin were well made just by looking at them.  Overall, good quality dim sum and the selection is great.  They have all the standard dim sum options plus additional dishes such as rice and noodles available.<br><br>This restaurant renovated awhile back but still has the newer feel.  Service was good.  Staff cleared plates regularly and refilled water by request promptly.",

"reviewcomment":"I was totally blown away by their food &amp; service last night! my S/O suggested this place as it was in the neighbourhood but I hadn&#39;t been there before. We decided on take out. So I called in our order, and the gentlemen who answered the phone was SO friendly and attentive (which is not the case sometimes at other restaurants when you call to place an order) and told me about 10 - 15 minutes. When I went to pick up the order I was greeted very politely by the staff, and told it would be just a moment and offered a drink while I waited.  Every interaction I had with a staff member was done politely, professional, and welcoming. The place was bustling for a Friday night... but everyone seemed to be on their A-game and happy to be there. <br>I got my food and took it home. <br><br>We ordered a prawn souvlaki and a chicken souvlaki. the food was carefully packaged and divided. They have a unique take-a-way tray that has individual portioned areas for the rice, vegetables, protein/potatoes. they had a separate container for the Greek salad, and another one for the tzakiki. Let me just say this... everything was awesome but the roasted potatoes blew me away. I have NEVER tasted roasted potatoes that were so good in my life. I don&#39;t know what your secret is but they were phenomenal (and I don&#39;t even usually like potatoes too much). Over all it was delicious. Portion sizes were fabulous (I have a little leftover for lunch today.. excited!), and the food was yummy! <br><br>Will definitely be back!!",

Don&#39;t get me wrong, the Porchetta sandwich is amazing, but the corned beef is a masterpiece. <br><br>I find the Porchetta option can be too greasy, especially with the salsa verde oil and the hunks of crackling thrown in. But the corned beef is just the right amount of lean but juicy, and the amazing Dijon and gherkin slaw on top cuts the perfect acidic/tart note. It&#39;s the perfect sandwich.<br><br>In any case, a bit spendy but worth the treat every once in a while. Their soups are also really good and solid. A neighbourhood favourite, for sure.",

"reviewcomment":"3 stars for the food and an extra star for their service!<br><br>Hubby and I walked in on Saturday night. I had a real hankering for spicy food and we were dying of hunger when we saw this place - so we went in!<br><br>It was seemingly quiet (6 30pm) but in actuality, the whole place was booked up! We got a table regardless and the hostess was so nice to offer of a couple of options and was very thoughtful. <br><br>Food: ordered the Chicken Curry ($15), lettuce wraps (~$9.50) and the spicy spinach (~$9.50).  The lettuce wraps were a starter and there were 4 - we ate them very quickly. The filling was plentiful for each and was a good amount to start with (if you are super hungry - otherwise, I think it might qualify as a meal for a small eater).<br><br>Chicken curry - pretty standard. Meat was plentiful, enough sauce for 2 big bowls of white rice. We ordered it extra spicy, but it came only at medium. Tasty sauce, but nothing outstanding. Lots of coconut cream or milk.<br><br>Spicy spinach - they saute spinach in a shrimp paste with little dried shrimps - again, ordered it extra spicy, but it came as medium, at best. It was good, but it really wasn&#39;t memorable - I&#39;d go with the spicy beans that we saw from another table that looked crispy and fantastic! <br><br>Overall, you can tell that the food is really fresh and everything was tasty. But we weren&#39;t blown away or anything (and we came in super hungry). I give this place a 4 star because their service is exceptional, the food came fast and it&#39;s neat place with a good vibe for all ages. The prices were reasonable and the portions were a bit larger than average.<br><br>We WISH we got the flatbread/naan because it looked AWESOME from the other table. <br><br>Also -  check out their facebook page because apparently they have specials on there (we learnt from the other table!)<br><br>We might return if we are in the area again, but we&#39;d definitely try different items. I&#39;d recommend this place for a date - it&#39;s pretty cozy and trendy on a Saturday night :)",

"reviewcomment":"This is a great place for Sunday brunch! I&#39;ve been here quite a few times and they&#39;ve just recently renovated to include some extra seating.<br><br>I&#39;ve tried pretty much all their Eggs Benedict variations and I haven&#39;t been disappointed yet (including traditional, Baja Benny, and seafood). They just recently added a braised lamb benny that I tried today and not only was the hollandaise excellent, the eggs were perfectly runny , and the lamb really shone though. Tender and well seasoned.<br><br>The only down side was that our server today was pretty unenthusiastic and a bit of a downer. That aside it&#39;s quality food for a decent price. Hello? Steak and eggs for $13? Amazing!",

Since I am not a huge drinker due to my lightweight tendencies, I really enjoyed how I could enjoy a glass without having too much or being too red. I got the Blanche De Chambly, which was a perfect light citrus beer that hit the spot.<br><br>I wasn&#39;t too hungry so I ordered the Boeuf Dip (Shaved Roast, Caramelized Onion Spread, Spicy Guinness Mustard, Au Jus), which was a good portion that&#39;s perfect for people who just want &#34;enough&#34; without looking like a stuffed squid. The beef was juicy and flavourful.<br><br>My boyfriend got the Big Prawns pizza, which could have been shared with another person (me), but given that I was hungry, he had a couple of slices to take home for lunch the next day. The pizza was very good, had a unique flavour and not too greasy, just right.<br><br>The server was available and helpful, and I couldn&#39;t have asked for more. <br><br>Love the music at this place. The vibe wasn&#39;t a typical pretentious Yaletown. Very chill and perfect for just hanging out with friends. <br><br>I would recommend this place to groups and even a casual date.",

"reviewcomment":"I was totally blown away by their food &amp; service last night! my S/O suggested this place as it was in the neighbourhood but I hadn&#39;t been there before. We decided on take out. So I called in our order, and the gentlemen who answered the phone was SO friendly and attentive (which is not the case sometimes at other restaurants when you call to place an order) and told me about 10 - 15 minutes. When I went to pick up the order I was greeted very politely by the staff, and told it would be just a moment and offered a drink while I waited.  Every interaction I had with a staff member was done politely, professional, and welcoming. The place was bustling for a Friday night... but everyone seemed to be on their A-game and happy to be there. <br>I got my food and took it home. <br><br>We ordered a prawn souvlaki and a chicken souvlaki. the food was carefully packaged and divided. They have a unique take-a-way tray that has individual portioned areas for the rice, vegetables, protein/potatoes. they had a separate container for the Greek salad, and another one for the tzakiki. Let me just say this... everything was awesome but the roasted potatoes blew me away. I have NEVER tasted roasted potatoes that were so good in my life. I don&#39;t know what your secret is but they were phenomenal (and I don&#39;t even usually like potatoes too much). Over all it was delicious. Portion sizes were fabulous (I have a little leftover for lunch today.. excited!), and the food was yummy! <br><br>Will definitely be back!!",

"reviewcomment":"I went here on the Valentine&#39;s Day weekend for a late lunch. We decided to go to the North Vancouver location to try it out since it was a closer driver from the house. Parking was pretty good. There was 1hr street parking around the restaurant which is nice. After reading some yelp reviews about how the service wasn&#39;t that good at this location, I decide to still give it a try. <br><br>I found the service to be good there was only a couple of things that could of been better about it. The staff was friendly, they brought us green tea. The waitress took our order right away and maybe in 5 minutes we had food! They were pretty quick. They don&#39;t seem to give you water unless you ask for it. My bf asked for water for the both of us but the waitress only brought one glass over. I&#39;m not sure if she heard him right or not but I had to ask again which is no biggie, just took a bit to flag her down. <br><br>I found the tables to be too small for all the food we ordered... we ordered 5 things and they were all ready at the same time, so the table was loaded with stuff and was difficult to organize... I would of liked just a couple of things at a time just to make things more comfortable. They cleared the table pretty quick though as soon as we were done of a dish, so that helped a bit. <br><br>One thing I didn&#39;t like though was when we were pretty much finished I was thinking of ordering some dessert but the waitress gave us our bill right away with out asking if we were all done or not. Not a huge deal but sucks for them that the miss out on another purchase.. I mean I didn&#39;t really need dessert anyways :P. Other than that I was pretty satisfied and it all lasted about 45mins, just in time for my parking to being up.<br><br>Food we had:<br><br>Spicy Chunky Tuna Sashimi -  very good probably the best I had.<br>Pan fried Pork dumplings (goza) - Very good, wanted more!<br>Sushi pizza (volcano) - This was good, not sure if I&#39;ll order it again though.<br>Sushi nachos - Loved this! Just wished the fish pieces were smaller and maybe made in to a bunch of little nachos so you get everything in one bite to get all flavors together.<br>Fungi roll - This was my favorite! Loved the tempura yam on top.<br><br>Food: 5/5<br>Service: 3/5 - Your getting there :)",

Ever. <br><br>Thats pretty much sums it up, their food is so good, their delivery is fast and their prices are really reasonable for the amount that you get. The only downside is if your going to pick it up, parking is kind of a nightmare (they are on one of the busiest parts of West 4th) but delivery is free! Friendly staff as well!",

"reviewcomment":"Food seemed homemade and the brunch choices were nice for 1pm on a Thursday.  The salmon on the West Coast Egg Benedict could have been more fresh, to me - as it was almost slimy.  The English muffin was a little rubbery, too.  He ordered the ham and cheese egg white omelet.  Ham was processed looking - and the feta lacking.  The white toast seemed more like garlic bread....  Beer choice was good and aided our enjoyment on dining for the first time in Vancouver.  <br><br>Just check-in to unlock an offer.  We got a free drink (alcoholic or non), which was the only reason this is 3 stars and not 2.  Service was meh.  Probably bike right by next time to a better restaurant for less.",

"reviewcomment":"Everytime I go to Vancouver, this is one of my must-go places!! You don&#39;t really get this kind of quality Japanese food for this price anywhere in LA. I wouldn&#39;t say it&#39;s the best quality, but it&#39;s so worth it. The tastes are great, the portions are big, and the prices are even better! Probably one of the best Korean owned sushi restaurants I had. <br><br>This is the 3rd time I&#39;ve been here and u just can&#39;t get enough of it! Love their red dragon roll. It has tempura shrimp, avocado, chopped scallops, masago, lettuce, wrapped in salmon and diff types of salmons roe on top. So good! Their boxes and combos are also good and great value. You get 10 pcs of huge ass sashimi, 5 nigiri, salad, rice with masago and seaweed, tempura! All those for $15..so cheap! Also tried the chopped scallop roll (all julienne strips of cucumber in the roll and real chopped scallops on top, not nasty bay scallop and California roll).<br><br>For salmon and tuna lovers, it&#39;s great if you order the special A which includes 2 pcs of nigiri, 6 pcs of sashimi, 4 California rolls, rice, soup and salad for $7.50. That&#39;s cheaper than ordering sashimi and nigiri alone. When I get a chance to starve myself next time, I want to order the chicken Katsu as well that is served on a skillet with veggies. <br><br>I noticed that they have a few more locations now, hopefully it&#39;ll still be good and prices doesn&#39;t tremendously high next time I visit there.",

"reviewcomment":"The view is amazing! I went for dinner and I could have sat there for hours staring at the city lights. The food was good, they have a typical menu, but a little on the pricey side. They give you bread before your meal comes and it is the softest most delicious bread I&#39;ve ever had at a restaurant. <br><br>It&#39;s very romantic and sophisticated. You don&#39;t have to dress super fancy, but not too casual either. <br><br>I would recommend not to take little kids. There was a big table next to us with a couple little kids and they were playing near the glass and would sit near the glass while the room spins around and came very close to hitting our table. Its not a place for kids to be running and playing around. The waiter had to stop the kids as the parents weren&#39;t watching them.<br><br>The strip around the restaurant where the tables are placed spins around the whole restaurant so you get a 360 degree view of the city. It spins a full circle every 60 min, so we stayed for a couple hours to take it all in.<br><br>I will definitely go back again and again and again.",

One of the most popular items on the menu is the Salty Peppery Chicken Nuggets with noodle in soup and it certainly hits the spot. The nuggets are indeed salty, but that&#39;s what the plain noodles in a clear broth are for. <br><br>Service is average for a place like this, they won&#39;t go out of their way to give good service, but they&#39;ll respond to your requests. They sometimes even clear your plates before you leave! <br><br>Cleanliness is again standard for a Chinese restaurant: looks clean at the front of the house, doesn&#39;t look so clean when you head to the restroom. <br><br>Parking fills up out front quite frequently so look on the street along Main or in the parking lot of the bank next door if it&#39;s after bank hours. <br><br>A nice special they have is a free appetizer if you order 4 beers.

"reviewcomment":"I was totally blown away by their food &amp; service last night! my S/O suggested this place as it was in the neighbourhood but I hadn&#39;t been there before. We decided on take out. So I called in our order, and the gentlemen who answered the phone was SO friendly and attentive (which is not the case sometimes at other restaurants when you call to place an order) and told me about 10 - 15 minutes. When I went to pick up the order I was greeted very politely by the staff, and told it would be just a moment and offered a drink while I waited.  Every interaction I had with a staff member was done politely, professional, and welcoming. The place was bustling for a Friday night... but everyone seemed to be on their A-game and happy to be there. <br>I got my food and took it home. <br><br>We ordered a prawn souvlaki and a chicken souvlaki. the food was carefully packaged and divided. They have a unique take-a-way tray that has individual portioned areas for the rice, vegetables, protein/potatoes. they had a separate container for the Greek salad, and another one for the tzakiki. Let me just say this... everything was awesome but the roasted potatoes blew me away. I have NEVER tasted roasted potatoes that were so good in my life. I don&#39;t know what your secret is but they were phenomenal (and I don&#39;t even usually like potatoes too much). Over all it was delicious. Portion sizes were fabulous (I have a little leftover for lunch today.. excited!), and the food was yummy! <br><br>Will definitely be back!!",

"reviewcomment":"Urban fare reminds me of a super market I would see in a film or TV show and wonder why it didn&#39;t exist in my neighbourhood. This location is a stone&#39;s throw away from my workplace, and that will have to do.<br><br>I like to come here every so often and stock up on items I need for work: avocados, greens, tuna, and little packets of almond butter. I didn&#39;t even know they sold individual packets of almond butter until I bought them here.<br><br>Pros: <br>- Excellent location<br>- Organic produce/packaged goods<br>- excellent quality of fresh ingredients.<br>- they sell my fave granola<br>- good business hours<br>- friendly, chipper, staff<br><br>Cons:<br>- Can be very expensive (9$ for a can of wild tuna?!)<br>- layout is a little confusing as there are small <br>- limited stock due to small location<br>- sometimes hard to find a mobile staff member<br>- limited space, so it is a little cramped.<br><br>I love their buffet style take away food as well. They make some pretty awesome roast/rotisserie chicken and their steamed veggies are always firm and vibrant. I would highly recommend this location if you&#39;re in the area and don&#39;t know what to do for lunch.",

"reviewcomment":"This was my first visit to Honjin and overall, I&#39;m impressed. I ordered their lunch special bento box with chicken teriyaki, and subbed their dynamite roll for the maki roll. The price was reasonable for a lunch box (although higher than some), and the wait was a little excessive, but they were busy, and I didn&#39;t call ahead to order my takeout so that was okay too. <br><br>The best part of the meal was by far the teriyaki. The sauce is incredible - sweet and thickened with honey or molasses with the perfect amount of ginger and garlic. Probably the best teriyaki I&#39;ve ever had. I wouldn&#39;t say it&#39;s necessarily traditional, but I am definitely a fan. Everything else was solid, but not great. <br><br>I would definitely go back and just order the teriyaki, and skip the rest of the box.",

"reviewcomment":"Comfort food. No, it&#39;s nothing spectacular, but they serve up very good burgers with all you can eat fries (even tho by the time I&#39;m done with the burger, I never even finish the first round of fries). There&#39;s a decent sized beer menu and full bar cocktail menu, if memory serves.<br><br>Every time I&#39;ve been here, the service has been great. Staff are super friendly, even at the busiest times. Speaking of busy, it can get really noisy inside. <br><br>One thing I experienced that I thought was weird is that sometimes, that handheld credit card machine displays in french and there&#39;s no way to change it. Sorry. I don&#39;t speak/read french. Oddly enough, when I switched to a different card, the display was in English. Quirky.<br><br>I do kinda hate that it&#39;s upstairs, only because when it&#39;s raining (as if often does in Vancouver) I always feel like I&#39;m going to slip on the stairs. And, yeah, the elevator smells bad. Thankfully, it&#39;s a quick ride.",

"reviewcomment":"I was totally blown away by their food &amp; service last night! my S/O suggested this place as it was in the neighbourhood but I hadn&#39;t been there before. We decided on take out. So I called in our order, and the gentlemen who answered the phone was SO friendly and attentive (which is not the case sometimes at other restaurants when you call to place an order) and told me about 10 - 15 minutes. When I went to pick up the order I was greeted very politely by the staff, and told it would be just a moment and offered a drink while I waited.  Every interaction I had with a staff member was done politely, professional, and welcoming. The place was bustling for a Friday night... but everyone seemed to be on their A-game and happy to be there. <br>I got my food and took it home. <br><br>We ordered a prawn souvlaki and a chicken souvlaki. the food was carefully packaged and divided. They have a unique take-a-way tray that has individual portioned areas for the rice, vegetables, protein/potatoes. they had a separate container for the Greek salad, and another one for the tzakiki. Let me just say this... everything was awesome but the roasted potatoes blew me away. I have NEVER tasted roasted potatoes that were so good in my life. I don&#39;t know what your secret is but they were phenomenal (and I don&#39;t even usually like potatoes too much). Over all it was delicious. Portion sizes were fabulous (I have a little leftover for lunch today.. excited!), and the food was yummy! <br><br>Will definitely be back!!",

Super fresh.<br>I also tried the spicy salmon roll, which was inventive and probably the best spicy salmon roll that I&#39;ve had.<br>I also loved the miso soup.<br><br>The tea tasted a bit more earthy than I prefer. <br><br>Service was great. Only complaint is that the rolls were a little small for the price.",

"reviewcomment":"Just as I entered the shop I was greeted from behind the high pizza counter. Greetings at a cheap pizza joint? <br>Looking through the glass box was more than half a dozen types of pizza waiting to dazzle your taste buds. From traditional Pineapple to unheard of Spicy Mushroom. Some choices looked like they were &#34;sitting&#34; but surely, once heated... <br>I chose the Spinach and Spicy Mushroom. Following through with their great service, I surely did not need to ask them to heat up the pizza. After it was heated however I was asked if I wanted feta cheese on my Spinach and Parmesan on both!!? Hell yah, and tips this place deserves. I asked for tap water and received it in seconds.   <br>The Spinach Feta was perfect, almost as if the spinach was olive oil sprinkle roasted kale chips. The cheese, just thick enough and their crust low sodium to the point that I could taste the toppings. The Spicy Mushroom was only mildly hot IMHO. For reference Tim Horton&#39;s Jalapeno and Cheese Bagel packs 3X the heat which I personally think is the threshold for most Vancouverites. Anyway, the slice was completely covered with mushrooms and evenly scattered with Jalapeno bits which added a good juicy texture to differentiate the mushrooms. A couple bites and I quickly got bored of the slice, which I think may be because it lacked cheese or significant amount of sauce. No fret, as there are many choices left to explore.<br><br>It&#39;s written on the window, homemade crust, sauce and toppings. If not for the casual decors and low pricing I would of thought this was a sit in family restaurant.    <br>Good service and cheap pizza doesn&#39;t usually go together but now other shops have tall shoes to fill! This is likely going to be my favourite pizza shop in Vancouver!",

"reviewcomment":"I was totally blown away by their food &amp; service last night! my S/O suggested this place as it was in the neighbourhood but I hadn&#39;t been there before. We decided on take out. So I called in our order, and the gentlemen who answered the phone was SO friendly and attentive (which is not the case sometimes at other restaurants when you call to place an order) and told me about 10 - 15 minutes. When I went to pick up the order I was greeted very politely by the staff, and told it would be just a moment and offered a drink while I waited.  Every interaction I had with a staff member was done politely, professional, and welcoming. The place was bustling for a Friday night... but everyone seemed to be on their A-game and happy to be there. <br>I got my food and took it home. <br><br>We ordered a prawn souvlaki and a chicken souvlaki. the food was carefully packaged and divided. They have a unique take-a-way tray that has individual portioned areas for the rice, vegetables, protein/potatoes. they had a separate container for the Greek salad, and another one for the tzakiki. Let me just say this... everything was awesome but the roasted potatoes blew me away. I have NEVER tasted roasted potatoes that were so good in my life. I don&#39;t know what your secret is but they were phenomenal (and I don&#39;t even usually like potatoes too much). Over all it was delicious. Portion sizes were fabulous (I have a little leftover for lunch today.. excited!), and the food was yummy! <br><br>Will definitely be back!!",

"reviewcomment":"I took my dad here on a Thursday night through a SocialShopper voucher and boy where we in for a full French dining experience.. All the servers had a French accent which really added to the authenticity of the restaurant and really made you feel like you were in Nice or something. Next, they had $32 three course dinner which was pretty much a deal within a deal lol. For appetizer, we got the blackened endives...omg.. the cheese.. delishhhhh, then for main courses, my dad got the Duck Confit and I got that french stew.. both were delicious, although I&#39;m not a big fan of Duck in general. And for dessert, a freshly fired up Creme Brûlée which was a huge portion.. no need to get one each.. one for both is maybe even too big. All the while, the service was stellar with topping up water, timing of delivering of different courses, and politeness",

Bartender was busy but managed to look after our table and a larger group near us in addition to the his bar duties.  Will definitely return.",

Our server was prompt and helpful, not only with menu options but suggestions about local activities. Despite no formal kids menu, she let us know a few options that could come in a kids sized portion. All of the food was delicious: the fried chicken, Californication sandwich, salmon flatbread, and the fruit/veggie tray app. I found the cole slaw a little blah and they didn&#39;t have many gluten free choices, but that didn&#39;t damage the overall experience.

"reviewcomment":"I was totally blown away by their food &amp; service last night! my S/O suggested this place as it was in the neighbourhood but I hadn&#39;t been there before. We decided on take out. So I called in our order, and the gentlemen who answered the phone was SO friendly and attentive (which is not the case sometimes at other restaurants when you call to place an order) and told me about 10 - 15 minutes. When I went to pick up the order I was greeted very politely by the staff, and told it would be just a moment and offered a drink while I waited.  Every interaction I had with a staff member was done politely, professional, and welcoming. The place was bustling for a Friday night... but everyone seemed to be on their A-game and happy to be there. <br>I got my food and took it home. <br><br>We ordered a prawn souvlaki and a chicken souvlaki. the food was carefully packaged and divided. They have a unique take-a-way tray that has individual portioned areas for the rice, vegetables, protein/potatoes. they had a separate container for the Greek salad, and another one for the tzakiki. Let me just say this... everything was awesome but the roasted potatoes blew me away. I have NEVER tasted roasted potatoes that were so good in my life. I don&#39;t know what your secret is but they were phenomenal (and I don&#39;t even usually like potatoes too much). Over all it was delicious. Portion sizes were fabulous (I have a little leftover for lunch today.. excited!), and the food was yummy! <br><br>Will definitely be back!!",

You absolutely must order this- a meal at Ho Yuen Kee is not complete without this signature dish! You&#39;ll see it on every table and for good reason. The lobster is perfectly cooked and the sauce and rice are oh-so-tasty. The flavors are truly spot on. <br><br>In addition, we had some sautéed Chinese greens which were of excellent quality produce, a melt-in-your-mouth black cod with tofu, crispy chicken with shrimp chips (didn&#39;t try) and a vermicelli with dried shrimp and melon bowl which was one of the best dishes of it&#39;s kind I&#39;ve had. I also tried the steam milk-ginger custard and almond custard for dessert. Both were good (though they couldn&#39;t outshine the main course dishes).<br><br>Check out Ho Yuen Kee- you won&#39;t regret that lobster and rice!",

"reviewcomment":"Dinner with the boyfriend again :) The menu is pretty simple, and we couldnt pick between what to order, so we decided to try out the tasting menu, which seemed to contain all the dishes we wanted anyway. $55 for the tasting menu and $90 with wine pairing. We decided to go for the wine paring for both of us.<br><br>We started out with a glass of champagne and an amuse bouche of salmon ice (?) cream. Wow. Definitely a very good start! They also served us breadsticks and a basket of bread with butter topped with a brown butter powder. <br><br>1) Salmon tataki with pickled vegetables, sorrel, watermelon radish - The salmon was nicely cooked and it still had the gleaming glaze when it was served. The salmon was sweet and slightly seared outside while tender inside. Mm.<br><br>2) Pan seared foie gras with yuzu marmalade, membrillo, apple, brioche - The ingredients were plated in a way which separated all of them, which felt a little weird at first. The most wow thing on this plate wasnt so much the foie gras (oh it was still good though!), but the foie powder/ butter thing which had a powdery texture but melts like butter. We asked the waiter how it was made, and apparently it went through some very complicated process of boiling, freezing and then getting it back to room temperature for the powdery texture D: !! <br><br>3) Smoked black cod with olives, tomato, capers, almond - The highlight of the dish was definitely the pairing of the cod with the tomatoes at the bottom and the olive puree. The tomato was sweet, which neutralised the slightly acidic taste of the olive puree. Both added a bang to the fresh cod which was perfectly seared. So good I can eat more!<br><br>4) Prime beef tenderloin with braised root vegetable fricassee, red beet root jus - This dish was okay. The beef was supposed to be medium rare, but more to medium by California standards. It wasnt too dry, but still tender inside. The red beet sauce was okay, but not wow. The root vegetables though, were a nice touch.<br><br>5) Cheese cake - We read about the cheese cake on Yelp reviews, and asked to swap one of the dessert in our tasting menu to a cheesecake. It was a good choice because the cheese cake is excellent! It was slightly thicker and creamier, but very very good :)<br><br>6) Torn spice cake with crème fraîche ice cream &amp; pumpkin marmalade - This was supposed to be their regular desert on the tasting menu, but unfortunately the spice cake and pumpkin marmalade didnt work for me :( What a pity though, I wish the meal ended more with a bang.<br><br>We had at least 5 glasses of wine (including the champagne) by the end of dinner and were honestly feeling quite tipsy midway. The pairing was good, but a little too much. Probably would not do the pairing if we were to come back again. For $55 without the pairing, I&#39;d say the price is pretty fair. However, if I compared this to our dinner at Le Crocodile, it definitely paled much in comparison. For $90 with the pairing... I&#39;d probably go for Le Crocodile instead.",

"reviewcomment":"A+ for ambience and location. The food is a rung above what you expect from most Vancouver sports pubs. Could stand to have a better selection of beers but what they&#39;ve got is decent compared to most in a 6 block radius.  <br><br>The smell of their wood-fired oven hits you upon entering the doors. The pizza is solid with a good napoli-style crust (nowhere near Nicli but better than Parlour), the pizza sauce is bland so order one of the more flavourful toppings as a simple margherita will leave you hungry and uninspired. <br><br>Thinking the worst of most Yaletown pubs I&#39;ve neglected this place for years. It has a great pub vibe despite its proximity to Granville and ample screens in every section make it great for a Canucks game.",

"reviewcomment":"As a one-time Montrealer I feel I know bagels - and to my mind, Siegels consistently delivery the best bagels in town.  They put the bagel-shaped bread offered by places like Tim Hortons and Starbucks to shame.<br><br>I&#39;ve been a more frequent visitor to the Granville Island location, but have lately been finding that by the time I roll up late on a Saturday morning, they&#39;re already out of my favourite bagels - which is how I found this Kits location.  A big bonus: open 24 hours! So if you&#39;re in the neighbourhood post-party, it&#39;s a great place to have a snack before toddling home to bed (plus bagels soak up alcohol good - just sayin&#39;).<br><br>There are many varieties of bagel on offer but hands down the best is the Rosemary Rock Salt.  Just amazing.  With dill cream cheese, with light cream cheese - even plain.  Just great.  The WORST bagel in my opinion is the Banana Walnut.  Mushy and flavourless.  I&#39;ve tried some of the stuff bagels and would recommend sharing them - they are huge and too rich to be eaten by yourself (or, you could try, in which case I say, good luck to you sir).<br><br>Not the best customer service but it&#39;s a bagel shop - what were you expecting?!  What is available is cheap baked goods, 24 hours a day.  And that&#39;s enough in my books.",

"reviewcomment":"I was totally blown away by their food &amp; service last night! my S/O suggested this place as it was in the neighbourhood but I hadn&#39;t been there before. We decided on take out. So I called in our order, and the gentlemen who answered the phone was SO friendly and attentive (which is not the case sometimes at other restaurants when you call to place an order) and told me about 10 - 15 minutes. When I went to pick up the order I was greeted very politely by the staff, and told it would be just a moment and offered a drink while I waited.  Every interaction I had with a staff member was done politely, professional, and welcoming. The place was bustling for a Friday night... but everyone seemed to be on their A-game and happy to be there. <br>I got my food and took it home. <br><br>We ordered a prawn souvlaki and a chicken souvlaki. the food was carefully packaged and divided. They have a unique take-a-way tray that has individual portioned areas for the rice, vegetables, protein/potatoes. they had a separate container for the Greek salad, and another one for the tzakiki. Let me just say this... everything was awesome but the roasted potatoes blew me away. I have NEVER tasted roasted potatoes that were so good in my life. I don&#39;t know what your secret is but they were phenomenal (and I don&#39;t even usually like potatoes too much). Over all it was delicious. Portion sizes were fabulous (I have a little leftover for lunch today.. excited!), and the food was yummy! <br><br>Will definitely be back!!",

Agadashi tofu, gomae, deep-fried calamari, a seared salted fish, sashimi, miso, two vegetables that I&#39;d never had before, rice, and pork belly. $17 or so.<br>It was heaven. That is all.",

"reviewcomment":"This place has been around forever. The curries on the restaurant side were kind of watery  and bland the many time I ate them. But hey are healthy and many and they cater to vegetarians and people with dietary restrictions. My favorite items are definitely the chickpea and rice, and spinach and feta samosas. The samosa&#39;s and the fabulous tamarind and or mint chutneys can be had on the health food store side as well. For a quick walk about snack grab a couple of them. There is the park right next door, which is all family friendly and cleaned up. Commercial drive has become gentrified. Or you can reheat them in the oven. I crave these and wish I could find somewhere to get them in the USA.  These were a College staple the years I lived on the drive . When I went back a couple years ago they were just as fabulous as ever. Unlike the sad state of Deserts Falafel.<br>The cookies are darn tasty too the Kamut dipped in chocolate is earthy and wonderful as well as the coconut dipped in chocolate.  They also have candied ginger dipped in chocolate super tasty and spicy.  The restaurant side has a juice bar as well.",

"reviewcomment":"Romer&#39;s is a neat little burger joint in YaleTown. With a solid set of beers and wine on tap, it&#39;s got a good little ambiance. The food is interesting enough. Pretty much an ideal place for the business lunch. If I was going to serve up one major criticism, it&#39;s on the burgers. I prefer mine a little less dry, with a little less bun. When it&#39;s not overly juicy, having a lot of bun just makes the dry-ness feel forward. <br><br>Flavour wise however, a pretty tasty burger, and a few good brews. Not bad if you&#39;re looking for a burger fix in YaleTown.",

Especially Nishin and mekjiki toro so delicious! <br><br>Nigiri - Hamachi Toro, Ika, Tuna O-Toro, it&#39;s not too fatty but mouthful.<br><br>Wagyu beef roll - high quality grade of wagyu and strong taste of beef, yummy.<br><br>Lobster roll - It&#39;s good, nothing special.<br><br>Spicy chopped scallop cone - never had that spicy scallop cone.  I loved the crispy and spicy! <br><br>Mirugai nigiri - Very fresh geoduck sushi, thumbs up!<br><br>Dragon roll - Beautiful presentation and lovely eel roll I never had.<br><br>Black sesame ice cream and banana tempura with ice cream - Just saved room for dessert.  Strong black sesame flavor and huge portion of banana tempura.  I died for it.....<br><br>I definitely will be back!",

"reviewcomment":"Temaki is a 30 second walk from where I live and I am so happy about it. The sushi is excellent quality. Better than many of the other places in the area and its not any more expensive. The restaurant is really clean - we don&#39;t often eat in the restaurant but when we do the staff is gracious and polite. <br><br>We get take-out once a week from Temaki and its just so good. They never forget anything with your order (always get the extras in the bag - napkins, soy sauce, etc, etc) and they never mess up the order. Its our favorite and we take visitors here and they love it. I am by no means knowledgeable about sushi - so, when I take out-of-towners to Temaki it looks like I know what I am talking about because they are always impressed. Temaki - Its going to be a long, happy relationship for us!",

"reviewcomment":"I was totally blown away by their food &amp; service last night! my S/O suggested this place as it was in the neighbourhood but I hadn&#39;t been there before. We decided on take out. So I called in our order, and the gentlemen who answered the phone was SO friendly and attentive (which is not the case sometimes at other restaurants when you call to place an order) and told me about 10 - 15 minutes. When I went to pick up the order I was greeted very politely by the staff, and told it would be just a moment and offered a drink while I waited.  Every interaction I had with a staff member was done politely, professional, and welcoming. The place was bustling for a Friday night... but everyone seemed to be on their A-game and happy to be there. <br>I got my food and took it home. <br><br>We ordered a prawn souvlaki and a chicken souvlaki. the food was carefully packaged and divided. They have a unique take-a-way tray that has individual portioned areas for the rice, vegetables, protein/potatoes. they had a separate container for the Greek salad, and another one for the tzakiki. Let me just say this... everything was awesome but the roasted potatoes blew me away. I have NEVER tasted roasted potatoes that were so good in my life. I don&#39;t know what your secret is but they were phenomenal (and I don&#39;t even usually like potatoes too much). Over all it was delicious. Portion sizes were fabulous (I have a little leftover for lunch today.. excited!), and the food was yummy! <br><br>Will definitely be back!!",

It&#39;s pretty good as well, but then you don&#39;t get broccoli.)<br><br>They make tofu salad rolls, vegetarian spring rolls, and will serve you all sorts of alcohol.

"reviewcomment":"What a neat restaurant. It is definitely worth a visit.<br><br>This is a restaurant I had never heard of or even knew about until my husband&#39;s family decided to go there for dinner. It is a huge place, with more than 20 tables in their main area, and two extremely large private rooms for parties. It looks like they are used often too, because I went on a monday and one of the rooms was being used for a large birthday party. <br><br>The environment is clean and inviting, even if it does not reflect the culture or the type of food that is served there. Their main fair is Filipino food. <br><br>The dishes that we ordered were excellent. My husband did look on yelp and saw several reviews recommending certain dishes including Kare-Kare, crispy pata, lumpiang shanghai and more.<br><br>Personally, I liked the kare-kare. I wish the peanut sauce was thicker and richer, as it had the consistency of water. Compared to the other savory and delicious dishes I had that night, the flavours of this dish were eclipsed and forgotten. <br><br>The crispy pata was like nothing I have ever had. The pork meat was so tender, and the skin so crispy, that I will be dreaming of eating more for the next several months.<br><br>All in all, there are really good dishes, and some pretty mediocre ones. I would recommend looking at the reviews and order what is recommended. We deviated with a few dishes that ended up not being as good, such as the lumpiang shanghai. <br><br>The service is average at best. They consistently forgot to bring refills of drinks, and did the bare minimum. <br><br>If you are like me and tend to gravitate to what is familiar when eating out, I do recommend taking a trip out to Max&#39;s and trying something different. Just don&#39;t expect the amazing service.",

"reviewcomment":"Holy. Who knew that vegetarian food (and even vegan and gluten free food) could be this good? These guys sure know what they are doing. <br><br>The boyfriend, his dad, and I came here for a Sunday meal, and left having had a feast. His dad is vegetarian and is visiting Vancouver, so this seemed like a must try for him. We came in with a reservation, and Steve sat us at the bar while our table cleaned up. He mixed us up two top notch drinks (the Bullfight for me and the Vancouver for the boy). Enough of that though - on to the important part.<br><br>After glancing through the menu, we decided that the degustation was the way to go. It&#39;s 5-7 courses that they prepare based on any strong preferences or aversions. The whole table has to do it and it&#39;s $29 a person, and WELL WORTH EVERY PENNY. Everything was amazing, creative, new and exciting. We had sunflower risotto that was not only vegan and gluten free, but amazing and completely unlike anything else I&#39;ve eaten. I won&#39;t dive into every dish, but everything was spot on. They could charge double for that menu and I&#39;d still think it was worth it.<br><br>Just when you think you&#39;re done, they bring out dessert. We had two main desserts: chocolate 5 (!!) ways and rice pudding with lychee sorbet. Yes and yes. I&#39;ll take a troth of both please. They also give you little truffles and turkish delight to finish up.<br><br>I&#39;ll just say it: this was one of the best meals I&#39;ve had in Vancouver, and I even love gluten and meat more than the next person, but didn&#39;t miss it one bit during this meal. Can&#39;t wait to see what this guy puts together with a summer menu.",

"reviewcomment":"[Post-Party Poutine]<br><br>After an evening at the Roxy, I needed food to fill the giant alcohol-filled pit that was my stomach. I stumbled into Smoke&#39;s Poutinerie purely out of convenience than a tactical Yelp-certified mission. Short story: The poutine is just mediocre. <br><br>My bacon cheeseburger poutine came in a cardboard to-go container and was the size of a softball. The cheese curds were pretty solid and waxy but the bacon, gravy, and cheez whiz drizzle were hot and tasty. The underlying fries were crispy and fresh. Considering the fact I was partially drunk and completely starving, this meal didn&#39;t taste as good as I expected. The beer goggles were definitely on (for food that is) and I wasn&#39;t overly impressed.<br><br>The cafe itself is decently sized with seating for 30. They had some kind of retro theme throughout the place though I didn&#39;t (or couldn&#39;t) really pay attention to it. Given that it was a Thursday evening, there were a fair number of people - mostly post partiers with the occasional sketchy dude loitering about. <br><br>Value-wise, it&#39;s decent enough at $8. By no means was it a filling meal but it stopped the stomach grumblings - at least until I could get to a Denny&#39;s or Timmy&#39;s. If you&#39;re partying along Granville, you can&#39;t go wrong with this place but in all other scenarios, there&#39;s other places you could go.",

"reviewcomment":"I was totally blown away by their food &amp; service last night! my S/O suggested this place as it was in the neighbourhood but I hadn&#39;t been there before. We decided on take out. So I called in our order, and the gentlemen who answered the phone was SO friendly and attentive (which is not the case sometimes at other restaurants when you call to place an order) and told me about 10 - 15 minutes. When I went to pick up the order I was greeted very politely by the staff, and told it would be just a moment and offered a drink while I waited.  Every interaction I had with a staff member was done politely, professional, and welcoming. The place was bustling for a Friday night... but everyone seemed to be on their A-game and happy to be there. <br>I got my food and took it home. <br><br>We ordered a prawn souvlaki and a chicken souvlaki. the food was carefully packaged and divided. They have a unique take-a-way tray that has individual portioned areas for the rice, vegetables, protein/potatoes. they had a separate container for the Greek salad, and another one for the tzakiki. Let me just say this... everything was awesome but the roasted potatoes blew me away. I have NEVER tasted roasted potatoes that were so good in my life. I don&#39;t know what your secret is but they were phenomenal (and I don&#39;t even usually like potatoes too much). Over all it was delicious. Portion sizes were fabulous (I have a little leftover for lunch today.. excited!), and the food was yummy! <br><br>Will definitely be back!!",

"reviewcomment":"There aren&#39;t very many decent Chinese lunch spots downtown, but this is one of the few good ones. This place gets incredibly busy at noon, but there&#39;s a high turnover as most people pop in for a quick lunch and go. <br><br>Since I work close by, I&#39;ve come here many times for lunch. The service is prompt and friendly, particularly for a Chinese restaurant.  Most of the menu is pretty good, but the best options at lunch time are the combos, which include a main dish (rice or noodles), soup, a couple of small side dishes, and a small dessert, for less than $10. There are usually 6-7 different combos, which change weekly. They even post the combos on their Facebook page, so you can decide what you want to eat before you go. <br><br>This is one of my lunchtime faves, and it won&#39;t be dropping off my rotation anytime soon.",

"reviewcomment":"My most recent visit to Harambe will go down as my most enjoyable Ethiopian experience to date. And that&#39;s saying something considering I have yet to have a bad experience while shoving wot and injera into my mouth with my bare hands no matter where I go. <br><br>The restaurant space is really colourful and warm and the food, well, it&#39;s absolutely delicious. My friend and I split the veggie combo for two and it was more than enough food for us. My favourite dish is always the tekil gomen, which didn&#39;t disappoint, but the shero wot and spinach were close behind. Wasn&#39;t entirely sure what to do with the undressed patch of spring mix in the centre of the plate, but it looked pretty. <br><br>As many other reviewers have noted, the food takes a while to come out so grab a small bite to eat beforehand if you&#39;re really, really famished. Service is friendly but pretty laid-back - they won&#39;t hover over you asking if you want your water refilled or if you&#39;re ready for your bill, so be prepared to speak up.<br><br>Couple of tips if you&#39;re new to Ethiopian food:<br><br>- Stick with the veggie dishes. The meat dishes aren&#39;t &#34;bad&#34;, but they never seem to taste as good as the veggie stuff. Plus, you&#39;ll walk away with less damage to your wallet. <br>- Don&#39;t go with someone you don&#39;t like very much, or someone you don&#39;t know very well. Hell, those rules apply for pretty much ANY dining situation, but when you have to entertain yourselves while waiting a long time for food, and then you both dive hands-first into the same plate, it&#39;s best if you go with folks you like.<br>- Take-out Ethiopian isn&#39;t as much fun, and it&#39;s definitely not the best way to go if you or someone you&#39;re with is eating it for the first time. <br>- Invite me.

I only paid just under $14 and had a second meal to take home (I gave the to-go pkg to a homeless person who was over the moon). <br><br>The yam roll didn&#39;t take fresh-more dried out than anything-and was made with crushed up deep fried coating amongst the tasty yam.

"reviewcomment":"My smoked meat, smoked salmon, kosher pickle and latke heaven. For real..so yum.<br><br>My parents grew up in Montreal so i grew up with Montreal smoked meat, flown in from Montreal as a staple in our fridge. This place does smoked meat and does it well.  Flown in from Montreal, it&#39;s the real deal.  get it on a bagel, on rye with hot Dijon and slaw and a kosher pickle, or as an eggs Benny and it&#39;s the absolute man.  <br><br>I usually opt for the lox bagel and cream cheese with capers and onion. The cream cheese is so fresh with fresh dill folded straight in. <br><br>The latkes however? They&#39;re basically mini McDonald&#39;s hash browns with a side of apple sauce and sour cream.  I make latkes every month and I would never call these&#34;latkes&#34;.  That said, I still order them as my guilty pleasure. I mean really, who doesn&#39;t like mcdonalds hash browns? <br><br>The service is always terrible - for real, I&#39;ve never had a good experience with service here, but it IS a sports bar so I suppose that&#39;s to be expected. Today our server flirted with the bro at the bar, filling sugar containers for a solid 15 min, and ignored us while we were literally the only table in the restaurant. Then she forgot to ring in my side latkes so by the time I got them I was done my meal. All good, stuff happens, but I do enjoy having a full cup of coffee and a glass of water with my meal, too.  On many occasions I&#39;ve actually had to walk up and request service. Kinda weird but whatever.<br><br>the food is where it&#39;s at - you can also get smoked meat sliced to order from the deli to go, then you can stop by siegels, get some epic bagels or some fresh rye and make your own situation happen at home.",

"reviewcomment":"Just moved into the building and the move was rough. We&#39;ve eaten here three times in three days. Still hasn&#39;t gotten old. <br>The spicy tuna tempura roll is amazing, and the red eye dynamite is delicious. I don&#39;t think you can go wrong with anything you order, I&#39;ve seen quite a few people order the sashimi and it looks incredible; huge, fresh chunks of yummy fish meat. I&#39;m pretty sure you could make a meal out of one order, but I still have to try it for myself. Tonight we had the dinner roll bento for $12. Plenty of food and it was all very tasty and...fresh! <br>Only complaint is that the tea cups are too small and they aren&#39;t always topped up. But tonight our server knew what we wanted to order before we even said anything to her (it wasn&#39;t even the same order as the last two days) and she had a to go box as soon as I told my boyfriend I&#39;d need one. I think she has sonic hearing or probably is just really awesome. <br>It&#39;s really dangerous to live so close, but really convenient too. Glad this place lives up to its name! Clean, fresh, delicious, decent prices. Heavenly.",

"reviewcomment":"I was totally blown away by their food &amp; service last night! my S/O suggested this place as it was in the neighbourhood but I hadn&#39;t been there before. We decided on take out. So I called in our order, and the gentlemen who answered the phone was SO friendly and attentive (which is not the case sometimes at other restaurants when you call to place an order) and told me about 10 - 15 minutes. When I went to pick up the order I was greeted very politely by the staff, and told it would be just a moment and offered a drink while I waited.  Every interaction I had with a staff member was done politely, professional, and welcoming. The place was bustling for a Friday night... but everyone seemed to be on their A-game and happy to be there. <br>I got my food and took it home. <br><br>We ordered a prawn souvlaki and a chicken souvlaki. the food was carefully packaged and divided. They have a unique take-a-way tray that has individual portioned areas for the rice, vegetables, protein/potatoes. they had a separate container for the Greek salad, and another one for the tzakiki. Let me just say this... everything was awesome but the roasted potatoes blew me away. I have NEVER tasted roasted potatoes that were so good in my life. I don&#39;t know what your secret is but they were phenomenal (and I don&#39;t even usually like potatoes too much). Over all it was delicious. Portion sizes were fabulous (I have a little leftover for lunch today.. excited!), and the food was yummy! <br><br>Will definitely be back!!",

"reviewcomment":"For the record, I didn&#39;t have dinner here. I came for dessert, drinks, AND THE VIEW.<br><br>The view is 5 stars and is very comparable to the revolving restaurant (SkyCity) on top of the Space Needle in Seattle. However, the food and dessert were average.<br><br>The Piquant Chicken Wings are cooked well but are DRENCHED in whatever sauce you choose (I believe there&#39;s 3 or 4 different ones to choose from). Not something I would re-order.<br><br>The Mint Chocolate Terrine is actually above par. I liked the texture to the terrine, and we added a scoop of Vanilla ice cream for good measure. It definitely compliments the dessert perfectly, and I actually recommend getting it with that scoop of ice cream.<br><br>I mean, good dessert, okay appetizer with an AMAZING view. I&#39;d honestly come back just for the view while grabbing an appetizer and a dessert again. But for an expensive dinner? Probably not.",

"reviewcomment":"I was totally blown away by their food &amp; service last night! my S/O suggested this place as it was in the neighbourhood but I hadn&#39;t been there before. We decided on take out. So I called in our order, and the gentlemen who answered the phone was SO friendly and attentive (which is not the case sometimes at other restaurants when you call to place an order) and told me about 10 - 15 minutes. When I went to pick up the order I was greeted very politely by the staff, and told it would be just a moment and offered a drink while I waited.  Every interaction I had with a staff member was done politely, professional, and welcoming. The place was bustling for a Friday night... but everyone seemed to be on their A-game and happy to be there. <br>I got my food and took it home. <br><br>We ordered a prawn souvlaki and a chicken souvlaki. the food was carefully packaged and divided. They have a unique take-a-way tray that has individual portioned areas for the rice, vegetables, protein/potatoes. they had a separate container for the Greek salad, and another one for the tzakiki. Let me just say this... everything was awesome but the roasted potatoes blew me away. I have NEVER tasted roasted potatoes that were so good in my life. I don&#39;t know what your secret is but they were phenomenal (and I don&#39;t even usually like potatoes too much). Over all it was delicious. Portion sizes were fabulous (I have a little leftover for lunch today.. excited!), and the food was yummy! <br><br>Will definitely be back!!",

Also, the late night special on &#39;all-you-can-eat&#39; is pretty good (was $11 a person when I was there).<br><br>As for people who complaining about quality and service - go to the $40/per person minimum places in downtown.

"reviewcomment":"This was my first visit back here for dim sum in several years.  Parking is atrocious for a small size restaurant, but this place is huge!   We had to park two blocks away, which allowed us to walk off some of the meal afterwards!!!<br><br>Appearance is nice and clean with good lighting inside.  Decent size LCD TVs strategically located for the traveling couch potatoes.  I give it 4/5.<br><br>Food quality is above average but not outstanding.  Dumplings are good size and quite tasty.  Abundant selection brought around on the push carts.  I particularly enjoyed their deep fried tofu which is better than most places.  I rate food quality 4/5.<br><br>Service is very good, at least it was today.  Push carts come by frequently unlike some other places where you have to send out search parties looking for them!  The servers were friendly and quite helpful to call over other carts when we were looking for a certain dish.  Our tea pot and hot water pot was quickly refilled and any empty dim sum containers were quickly removed from our table.  Overall I was impressed with them.   I rate them 5/5.<br><br>Price-wise they are reasonable, which is code for you better not come here if your main concern is budget.  But they are certainly not close to being the most expensive dim sum restaurant around.  I would give them 3/5 for price.<br><br>Overall I rate them a very solid four.  Will definitely come back again, even with the parking issue.",

"reviewcomment":"Talk about your old school neighborhood butchery, this has got it going! From the big sign on the side of the aging 2 story building, right down to the meat counters inside filled with butchered meats, cheeses, and practically all things deli.<br><br>I had a wine pairing opportunity around the corner from here, and while the wine tasting experience was great, the cheese and charcuterie it was paired with was just over the top. Besides wanting to purchase their wines, I also inquired about buying the salami and cheese; but our winekeep said they don&#39;t sell them, but brings it in from the butcher around the corner, and hence there I was standing in an old school butcher shop.<br><br> Picked up a Smoked Guinness Cheddar, and a spiced Truffle Salami. <br><br>A mildly smoked cheddar with swirls of dark Guinness, looking something like a fudge revel ice cream. A Chardonnay pairing must.<br><br> The salami was like a salty, sweet, fatty, meaty taste of heaven with a spicy kick that made my mouth do saliva cartwheels...... tru-dat!!!! Along with my Meritage... knocked it out of the park.<br><br>Wine, hard breads, olive oil, with balsamic vinegar, makes life good.... add nice cheeses, add tasty charcuterie and life becomes a ball!",

"reviewcomment":"I am posting another review on The Dime.<br><br>This is to all posters who have made a comment concerning the menu choices.   <br>First of all....   It is a small menu --yes--...but to have such a place with $4.95 choices...what did you expect?????   It is a small, quaint place that offers 15 meal choices for $4.95. More choices make more overhead which means raising menu prices.     If you want more choices for your dinner...then go another place....  Heck...go across the street to Marcellos where you can spend $30 for your ONE of your choices.  (then again....read Marcello&#39;s reviews before you go...you can save that $30 and may feel that The Dime is not that bad after all.)   <br>To make the comment that there is not enough vegetarian or vegan dishes....?...???..?..?...  As a vegetarian of 18 years... I was VERY surprised that I actually had a CHOICE on the menu. Out of the 15 items offered, I had the choice of 5 dinners and 4 salads.   WOW.   9 out of 15 items that a vegetarian can order!!!!.  How much more do you want from a meat eating society &amp; pub???  And all for $4.95 each.       That is such a rare occurrence.   So to complain that a place that offers a $4.95 menu with 9/15 items vegetarian......and  does not offer enough veggie dishes...uummm  I think you are in the wrong place.   And as for VEGAN dishes...well...then you really need to go to a vegetarian/vegan restaurant.  Next thing you&#39;ll complain about is that there are no gluten-free items....  sheesshhhh when does it end???<br><br>To The Dime....   keep it up....  !!!",

"reviewcomment":"This is probably the best place to get Pho&#39; in Vancouver. The soup tastes just right as if they really took time to make the soup rather than just dump some powdered mix like some other places do. They&#39;ve got a large selection of rice dishes and other soups from other regions. Their beef soup (T21) is also a popular &amp; great choice, and so are the vermicelli and rice dishes. Their spring rolls and salad rolls are made well &amp; are great appetizers before or during the big meal lol. But the one thing that I&#39;ve tried which tasted really strange and too processed for me was the shrimp on sugarcane other than that this place is a must visit! The servers are nice and the prices are not at all bad. Oh and their shakes are great. I like the Avocado shake and the free tea they serve is actually really good! <br>The people who run the place are Vietnamese and they seem to know what they&#39;re doing :) <br>FYI: More parking at back and they&#39;ve got free wifi!",

"reviewcomment":"[Monday night specials]<br><br>What happens when you need a last minute reservation for a belated Mother&#39;s day dinner? Well it could be a heck of a lot worse than Q4. This was the second time I&#39;ve been to this place since the reincarnation of Quattro on 4th. The restaurant exudes a chic upscale feel without being overly pretentious. The lighting and decor make the place appropriate whether its Mothers day or Valentines day. <br><br>We were fortunate enough to habe stumbled upon this place on their monday specials. They had a special menu with 8 different pasta dishes for $12. There was also some soup and salad appies for $5 apiece. To make it even sweeter, house wines and Peronis were also $5. If that isn&#39;t value, I dont know what is.<br><br>I ended up having the Penne Con Rucola but swapped the penne for linguine. I like long noodles. The beef tenderloin and mouthwateringly delicious and the tomato/arugula sauce complimented it well. It wasn&#39;t the best pasta I&#39;ve had but it was still very good. The portion size was maybe equivalent to a bit more than a big mac. I ended up having a house salad which was delicious which was covered in veggie chips (more like shavings) and drizzled with some sort of vinaigrette. The starter bread was also warm and soft - I think it was foccacia. Our server was quite friendly and was quick to fill drinks and bring our dishes around.    <br><br>I thoroughly enjoyed my meal at Q4 as did Mom (which is actually most important). Their pasta specials run Mondays and Tuesdays and for the price and quality, I&#39;m amazed it wasn&#39;t more packed. I&#39;d definitely be back for their specials but at regular price, there are better options. Unless it&#39;s a last minute belated Father&#39;s day dinner. Just kidding.",

"reviewcomment":"I was totally blown away by their food &amp; service last night! my S/O suggested this place as it was in the neighbourhood but I hadn&#39;t been there before. We decided on take out. So I called in our order, and the gentlemen who answered the phone was SO friendly and attentive (which is not the case sometimes at other restaurants when you call to place an order) and told me about 10 - 15 minutes. When I went to pick up the order I was greeted very politely by the staff, and told it would be just a moment and offered a drink while I waited.  Every interaction I had with a staff member was done politely, professional, and welcoming. The place was bustling for a Friday night... but everyone seemed to be on their A-game and happy to be there. <br>I got my food and took it home. <br><br>We ordered a prawn souvlaki and a chicken souvlaki. the food was carefully packaged and divided. They have a unique take-a-way tray that has individual portioned areas for the rice, vegetables, protein/potatoes. they had a separate container for the Greek salad, and another one for the tzakiki. Let me just say this... everything was awesome but the roasted potatoes blew me away. I have NEVER tasted roasted potatoes that were so good in my life. I don&#39;t know what your secret is but they were phenomenal (and I don&#39;t even usually like potatoes too much). Over all it was delicious. Portion sizes were fabulous (I have a little leftover for lunch today.. excited!), and the food was yummy! <br><br>Will definitely be back!!",

We ordered a variety of sashimi, rolls and a bottle of warm sake. To say the fish was fresh is the understatement of the year.

No problem!   It is the perfect place to have a moving away party or birthday party, and all of your friends can drop in and stay for as long as they want.  We&#39;ve also hosted a few pub nights for our union members, and they are *great* about accommodating that.<br><br>- Usually, there are some open tables since it&#39;s a big place, so you never feel worried about hanging without continuing to order lots of drinks.<br><br>-They don&#39;t have any annoying, top 40, shit music blaring.  This is an environment that fosters good conversation with friends.  When they do have &#34;loud music&#34; it is on their live music nights; superb musicians play here!<br><br>-The food I&#39;ve had there is always consistently good.  It&#39;s hearty pub fare; comfort food.  It won&#39;t blow your mind, but they do a good job.   Their side salads have always been very nice though, and more intricate than what you&#39;d expect.",

My friends and I were visiting from Colorado and main drunken munchy here in Colorado is Pho. I don&#39;t think we deviated much from that. Sometimes, I would go grab a burrito, sometimes, I would get some middle eastern food but it was rare, until I came here with my friends on a short visit. HOLY MOLY, we literally stopped by Donair King every night, given these nights usually involved heavy drinking! They hands down had the best gyros I&#39;ve ever had, but that could be the drunk munchies talking. The lamb was phenomenal and the pita was just perfectly krispy in a way I never had it before! I can&#39;t find that anywhere in Colorado and it&#39;s so sad! Regardless, I would definitely try to relive this experience again on my next visit to Vancouver. We shall see how that pans out!

"reviewcomment":"Best Malaysian place I have tried in Vancouver so far. Hands down. <br><br>Born and raised in Singapore, I moved to Vancouver just over ten years ago. Everyone asks me what I miss most about home, and my answer is always the same. The food. I mean, yes, I guess, family too, but...omg the food. Now, Singapore and Malaysia will always be rivals in every sense of the word, but take us out of our home countries, thousands of miles away from our hawker centres, and trust me, all differences are immediately set aside. Our politicians should take note. I spent many years as a teen arguing with Malaysian counterparts over the subtle differences in cuisine, and who has the better food (or football team), but I would not spend a single minute arguing about that here. Good Malaysian food in Vancouver? HELLS YES. <br><br>Anyways! I digress. I heard about this place recently through rave reviews from some new friends, and decided to check it out. We ordered the Penang assam laksa, Malaysian specialty vegetables, nasi lemak with beef rendang, and kuih dadar. I knew this place was for real when we ordered the Penang assam laksa and the waiter asked if we&#39;ve had it before. <br><br>The Penang laska was delicious! The broth tasted like it had been made with a million delicious oily fish, and it tasted just like Southeast Asia, which, by the way, is the best kind of Asia. I was super stoked! The vegetables were also so tasty! A mix of green beans, eggplant, and okra, stir fried with shallots and birds eye chillies, and topped with salty dried shrimp. The nasi lemak was served with fried ikan bilis (!!!) and a home made sambal that made me immediately home sick. The beef rendang was tender and tasty as well. <br><br>They have good-sized portions here, so we got some of the food to go, and also ordered kuih dadar for dessert. The crepe was soft and tasty, although the shredded coconut was a little on the dry side. But that was saved with the generous serving of gula melaka the kuih came with. <br><br>Service was quick, and the waiter was also real friendly and lovely. Great place! Can&#39;t wait to go back and try everything else!!!",

"reviewcomment":"This place has awesome pizza, the best within walking distance. It is a combination of new york and Neapolitan style. Its a bit pricey but my go to place for when i want to treat myself! highly recommended, super cool staff great music and awesome general atmosphere. they always give my three year old a ball of pizza dough to play with while we are waiting and don&#39;t mind her dancing in the middle of the restaurant either. a word of caution, don&#39;t order extra to take home and eat the next day as with any similar thin style pizza it gets gross in the fridge and worse if you try to reheat it. <br><br>I was suffering with gross pizza place comparable to domino&#39;s and pizza hut in the neighbourhood for a long time and thrilled to have not only better but excellent pizza, and the pannacotta is OMG delicious so DONT ARGUE. <br><br>If you have a large group it might be hard to get a table if its busy",

Walking down the Drive and I&#39;m like, &#34;Ooh, there&#39;s some fancy street art!&#34; Only did I ever consider the painted bricks to house a restaurant inside. So my girlfriend and I decided to have a &#34;date night&#34; here last May Long weekend.<br><br>All the dishes are plenty big for the price and the tandoori chicken was fantastic, if it was on the bone. Otherwise the boneless bits were on the dry side. The naan was merely OK, not a glutenous and chewy as I expected. <br><br>Check out the daily drink specials. We had a bottle of wine for $22.50 instead of $30 on a Monday. <br><br>Service was friendly and prompt. No complaints whatsoever.<br><br>This is my recommendation for Indian food on the Drive. They also do free neighborhood deliveries!<br><br>It&#39;s interesting to see the varied reviews here. Do yourself a favor and try it out for yourself!",

"reviewcomment":"A perfect place to sober up after any Yelp party. Hands in the air for Korean Fried Chicken yo&#39;ll!<br><br>We started out as 4 people, sharing a Zabu Soy Original (whole chicken) and 6 drumsticks of Zabu Hot Sticks. Two more people came, so we ordered a beef short rib BBQ style on hot grill plate.<br><br>Zabu Hot sticks came first. They were spicy but still within reason. I find the &#34;spiciness&#34; over powered the taste of other seasonings but the crunch was there, with a light coating of sticky  spicy dressing. The Zabu Soy Original came next. I was impressed by how evenly all the cut up pieces were. Somebody back there knows how to butcher these birds right. Though I have to say as a whole chicken, it felt the portion was rather small. Crispy skin, sticky soy sweet sauce lightly coated the skin, tender, juicy meat and not oily what so ever. Short ribs were ok. Could have used more time in the marinade. <br><br>This is first place that didn&#39;t serve up kimchi as a side. We got a dish of pickled daikon and chiffonade of green and red cabbage.<br><br>Solid KFC in Vancouver, but still, New York one kicks ass.",

"reviewcomment":"I was totally blown away by their food &amp; service last night! my S/O suggested this place as it was in the neighbourhood but I hadn&#39;t been there before. We decided on take out. So I called in our order, and the gentlemen who answered the phone was SO friendly and attentive (which is not the case sometimes at other restaurants when you call to place an order) and told me about 10 - 15 minutes. When I went to pick up the order I was greeted very politely by the staff, and told it would be just a moment and offered a drink while I waited.  Every interaction I had with a staff member was done politely, professional, and welcoming. The place was bustling for a Friday night... but everyone seemed to be on their A-game and happy to be there. <br>I got my food and took it home. <br><br>We ordered a prawn souvlaki and a chicken souvlaki. the food was carefully packaged and divided. They have a unique take-a-way tray that has individual portioned areas for the rice, vegetables, protein/potatoes. they had a separate container for the Greek salad, and another one for the tzakiki. Let me just say this... everything was awesome but the roasted potatoes blew me away. I have NEVER tasted roasted potatoes that were so good in my life. I don&#39;t know what your secret is but they were phenomenal (and I don&#39;t even usually like potatoes too much). Over all it was delicious. Portion sizes were fabulous (I have a little leftover for lunch today.. excited!), and the food was yummy! <br><br>Will definitely be back!!",

"reviewcomment":"Humble little Bambo has survived an onslaught of trendy coffee shops invading Gastown: Revolver, Bean Around the World, JJ Bean,  Trees, and now Timbertrain. It defies the norm- tacky maximalist decor, an overwhelming menu with way too many items, and sometimes very slow. Why has it lasted so long? Charm. The persian family that own it are some of the nicest people on the planet. I was expecting Yelpers to stomp all over them, what with most people&#39;s sense of entitlement (ie the washroom is 5 minutes away). I&#39;ve been going to Bambo for 6 years and Jeff and Azar make me feel like I am their son.  LONG LIVE BAMBO!",

The location is beautiful, its different than all the other places in Gastown, but I like different! And what can i say about the food... It was amazing! I got to start with the greens salad and I had the chicken burger (with salad, fries and homemade ketchup).  Everything was super tasty and fresh. All in one I really enjoyed my lunch! I wanna try soon the dinner menu!",

But! The owner, texted my cell to apologize and offered to make us the meal on the house next time!<br><br>Just enjoyed nearly $40 worth of delicious complimentary food...  Honest service and good food .

We decided on take out. So I called in our order, and the gentlemen who answered the phone was SO friendly and attentive (which is not the case sometimes at other restaurants when you call to place an order) and told me about 10 - 15 minutes. When I went to pick up the order I was greeted very politely by the staff, and told it would be just a moment and offered a drink while I waited.  Every interaction I had with a staff member was done politely, professional, and welcoming. The place was bustling for a Friday night... but everyone seemed to be on their A-game and happy to be there. <br>I got my food and took it home. <br><br>We ordered a prawn souvlaki and a chicken souvlaki. the food was carefully packaged and divided. They have a unique take-a-way tray that has individual portioned areas for the rice, vegetables, protein/potatoes. they had a separate container for the Greek salad, and another one for the tzakiki. Let me just say this... everything was awesome but the roasted potatoes blew me away. I have NEVER tasted roasted potatoes that were so good in my life. I don&#39;t know what your secret is but they were phenomenal (and I don&#39;t even usually like potatoes too much). Over all it was delicious. Portion sizes were fabulous (I have a little leftover for lunch today.. excited!), and the food was yummy! <br><br>Will definitely be back!!",

"reviewcomment":"I&#39;ve been here twice - the first time for a party and then I went here for DineOut the other night and everything I ate was amazing! <br><br>If you&#39;re a meat eater - I have to imagine that Clough Club has one of the best value Dine Out menus in Vancouver.  I had butternut squash soup, a MASSIVE lamb shank and the chocolate mousse dessert thing and all three were to die for and only $18!  <br><br>I also liked the atmosphere... it was nice and intimate and I loved the music selection.  If you are someone who doesn&#39;t like dim lights or music - this may not be the place - I know I could not take my mother here or she&#39;d feel like Helen Keller.  The tunes being played were 90&#39;s rap along the vein of Tribe Called Quest and I loved that - but again not for everyone.  <br><br>The cocktails and wine were excellent though the cocktails are pricey - I had the Apiary which was a delicious dressed-up cocktail similar to a classic bourbon sour but switched to wine after 1 as I didn&#39;t see the value in the price.  <br><br>My only real complaint about Clough Club is that if you are a vegetarian, I do not think you would have the same fantastic eating experience that I did.  My girlfriend ordered the Dine Out menu veg style which was the goat cheese and oven dried tomato tartlet - the Grilled Tomato Risotto Courgette and she had the Vanilla cheesecake -  The tartlet she thought was ok but the risotto was incredibly unexciting for a main - pretty much just a pile of rice with tomatoes on top - which looked pretty lame across the table from my lamb shank.  The cheese cake was great though :) <br><br>To give their vegetarian items a shot we also ordered the smoked jalapeno cheese dip which was amazing - I thought the manchego was a bit strong but we polished it off so that was good.<br><br>Our server was spectacular, quick and friendly - which was also the case the last time I went and for that reason alone it&#39;s a place I&#39;ll keep trying out.",

"reviewcomment":"You know those moments when you sit back in your seat and try to comprehend the amount of food you just ate? Yep, thats how I felt after my meal at Kyo. <br><br>I went with a huge group of people, half of whom I did not know, and they had enough seating for all of us in the same area. Bonus. <br><br>The All You Can Eat costs about $24.00 a person but, the variety and quality of food is worth the cost. And, that moment when you sit back and try to comprehend what you just ate, you&#39;ve probably eaten more than $24.00 of food. <br><br>This kind of meal is perfect for a large group, the more people, the more food options, and it gives you the opportunity to chat while you cook the meat and munch on sushi rolls. <br><br>A huge bonus- if you order sake- they will ask you if you want it cold or hot. Always a nice option, but we know hot is the only way. <br><br>The service was okay, it was a busy night but we did wait a while for drinks and found that we received some things we did not order. Make sure to check your order form when it comes back to you. Anything you don&#39;t eat, they charge on top of the base price. <br><br>Lastly, beware that large groups have auto gratuity on the bills. Most of the group did not know and tipped on top of it.  Those servers made a lot from us that night. <br><br>Live and learn I guess. I&#39;ll be going back regardless.",

"reviewcomment":"Ladies and gents we have a winner! After several several... several... 3-star and 4-star selections, I finally landed on a solid 5-star. And I owe it all to Kwoky and Christian. <br><br>We came here for a lunch with the lovely couple, after noticing that the restaurant had top reviews. We arrived around 1:30, but the place was surprisingly still full of diners and we had to wait outside for another 5 minutes. We didn&#39;t mind, since it was a beautiful day outside and we enjoyed the sunshine (staying inside was hard, since the smell of pho was mouth-watering). <br><br>When we got our seats, the servers were sooooo nice. They always came over with a smile, they didn&#39;t try to rush us when we weren&#39;t ready with our order yet, and kept refilling our teapot at a decent pace long after we were done eating and were just chatting.<br><br>The Pho Ga is amazing. the crispy chicken is devine (I love the crunchy skin), and the soup base is clear (tsing) and still flavourful. But it&#39;s not just about the chicken pho people, their regular selections are just as awesome. Husband ordered his regular beef brisket rice noodle stew (he&#39;s just not as adventurous), and was thoroughly impressed with the large bowl that came to our table. It was certainly bigger than what we&#39;d find anywhere, and there was so much of everything (noodles, vegetables, brisket) that you can&#39;t help but let your jaw drop to the floor.<br><br>Despit the distance from our home in downtown, we already declared the second we walked out of the restaurant that if we&#39;re to go for pho, this is the place! <br><br>Right by the 19 or 25 bus stop, and a short walk to either the 20 or 22 buses. You really have no excuse to not go. Cash only! :)",

It was my first brunch there, even though I&#39;ve had dinner here a few times, and I can guarantee it will not be the last. <br><br>We all ordered the parmesan soufflé, based on a recent recommendation from another friend. It&#39;s not on the brunch menu, but the chef was very accommodating and said that we could still order it. We also each chose a couple of sides to go with our soufflés: fingerling potatoes and house made sausage for me and toast, oatmeal, eggs and bacon for my friends. Everything was stellar. The soufflés were amazingly light and flavorful and we devoured every bite. <br><br>Both the service and the food showed exceptional attention to detail. For example, I ordered a cup of tea with milk, and the milk was served warm so as not to cool down the tea. Nice touch! My friends ordered a cocktail each and both really enjoyed them.

"reviewcomment":"I was totally blown away by their food &amp; service last night! my S/O suggested this place as it was in the neighbourhood but I hadn&#39;t been there before. We decided on take out. So I called in our order, and the gentlemen who answered the phone was SO friendly and attentive (which is not the case sometimes at other restaurants when you call to place an order) and told me about 10 - 15 minutes. When I went to pick up the order I was greeted very politely by the staff, and told it would be just a moment and offered a drink while I waited.  Every interaction I had with a staff member was done politely, professional, and welcoming. The place was bustling for a Friday night... but everyone seemed to be on their A-game and happy to be there. <br>I got my food and took it home. <br><br>We ordered a prawn souvlaki and a chicken souvlaki. the food was carefully packaged and divided. They have a unique take-a-way tray that has individual portioned areas for the rice, vegetables, protein/potatoes. they had a separate container for the Greek salad, and another one for the tzakiki. Let me just say this... everything was awesome but the roasted potatoes blew me away. I have NEVER tasted roasted potatoes that were so good in my life. I don&#39;t know what your secret is but they were phenomenal (and I don&#39;t even usually like potatoes too much). Over all it was delicious. Portion sizes were fabulous (I have a little leftover for lunch today.. excited!), and the food was yummy! <br><br>Will definitely be back!!",

"reviewcomment":"So delicious! It&#39;s a cute little spot right in the heart of kits. Nothing fancy, just a great place to grab a healthy quick lunch or dinner. I usually get the ananda, it&#39;s so yummy. Lots of brown rice, with plenty of greens topped with their tasty tofu steaks and a side of tahini sauce. Absolutely divine. If I&#39;m craving something heartier I&#39;ll order the swami-g. Momma the delicious home made curry sauce is to die for. <br><br>Their smoothies are great too. Try the chai chiller. It&#39;s one big liquid smile. :)<br><br>Hands down my fave vegetarian spot.",

"reviewcomment":"I live four blocks from Harvest Deli and have now eaten ten sandwiches from this tiny Kitsilano deli. In fact, I am eating a BAM right now, and honestly think it may be the best sandwich I have ever had: grilled and buttered sourdough, generous amounts of crispy bacon, ripe avocado, caramelised onions, arugula, melted aged cheddar, and russian dressing. It is super super awesome. I just turned to my girlfriend to ask her to contribute to this review, but her BAM disappeared after the first sentence. Amazingly good.<br><br>Each sandwich is made to order and the ingredients are very very fresh, and thoughtfully composed. The owner also makes two soups fresh every day, and service is prompt and polite. I lived in the UK for several years, and there are sandwich shops in every neighbourhood. Whether it is due to VanCity&#39;s fear of carbs, or due to our city&#39;s eclectic tastes and wide variety of ethnic options, Vancouver has surprisingly few delis and sandwich shops. When done right, a sandwich is the perfect food, and HD has restored my passion for these simple yet satisfying snacks.<br><br>I have a few minor criticisms. Their multigrain bun is fairly dense and detracts from the delicious fillings within. Also, the business has been working on its branding and signage for about a year, and this gives the shop a &#34;temporary&#34; and slightly unprofessional feel. There are over two dozen sandwich options, but the menu is a bit confusing and wordy. Once you know how to navigate through it, everything is fine and scrumptious...but I was intimidated by it the first time I explored it. Nitpicking aside, I am a HUGE fan and a bi-weekly supporter of Harvest Deli. Mmmmmmm.<br><br>PS - A good tactic to tackle HD&#39;s massive menu: bring a buddy, order two sandwiches, and then split them. BAM!",

I&#39;ve seen some complaints about the service time, but to be honest, I have had just as long waits at McDonalds. Anyway, the staff were polite, the place was super clean. Didnt really look over the menu because I knew I wanted just a regular burger.<br><br>The Burger: <br>It was big, bigger than I expected. A soft, fluffy, whole grain bun, soft patty, with fresh lettuce, tomato, onion and a pickle. Ketchup and mustard! Definitely one of the best veg burgers I&#39;ve had.<br><br>Critique: I like interesting and different veggie burgers, this was as close as it comes to a regular meat burger. There are other options though. Would be nice to have sprouts and shredded beet, etc. <br><br>Price: I believe it was $6.50 ish. Not including anything else, so its more pricey than fast food but I&#39;d say it was worth the money. Filled me up.",

While it can get really busy and the wait times can be long (45 minutes is something I&#39;ve heard multiple times), they are very courteous and tell you when it will be available and will phone you if you wish. <br><br>As for the food, my go-to baguette must be the schnitzel! The combination of flavours are to-die-for. Very crispy baguette, it&#39;s probably my favourite part! The housemade soups that aren&#39;t loaded with cream are also quite delicious. I love dipping my sandwiches in them.<br>I also frequently get their breakfast, with poached eggs, slices of tomatoes, and their potato hash. I love getting this, as it fills me up without feeling all heavy and bloated. Great starter to the day.<br><br>Overall, I love coming to Chez Meme.

"reviewcomment":"Can i give this place 10 stars?  I would if I could.  <br><br>Simba&#39;s grill is definitely deserving of 5 stars.  It&#39;s obvious that the owner/chef really values building positive relationships with his customers as he is always seen greeting customers as they walk in, ensuring that they will be taken care of.  He helps the servers out by taking orders and memorizing them (doesn&#39;t even carry around a pen and paper), and makes helpful suggestions and recommendations to first timers.  During our visit we saw that many of the people who came in seemed to be regulars, as they spoke in casual/familiar language with the staff/chef and would exchange handshakes and even hugs.  I loved the friendly / welcoming / warm vibe!  Even tables next to use were not shy to start up conversation with us, which was very refreshing!<br><br>On to the food:  These guys DO NOT cheap out on flavour!  Every bite is jam packed with savoury / sweet / spicy and you can even customize the types of flavours you want since they provide you with a variety of sauces and condiments to add to your dishes.  They even explain to you what each one is, and which dish is best to be paired with which sauce.  We tried the beef skewers on rice as well as the chicken coconut curry. I can&#39;t even begin to explain how satisfied I was!<br><br>The chai tea they give you is served in a tall clear glass.  I drink chai tea all the time and I was happy that the tea was not &#34;over&#34; spiced as some chai teas that I&#39;ve tried in the past (eg: East is East).  The Mango lasi was OUT OF THIS WORLD -- not to sweet but still tasted like a dessert in a glass.  It&#39;s very rich and very filling so I suggest maybe sharing it with a friend!  <br><br>At the end of our meal we were too full to order dessert, but the chef sent a complimentary slice of his famous mango cheesecake!  I was so happy I almost cried!  It was a perfect end to the night.  The cheesecake was extremely rich and the mango purée sauce was delicious.  I was so happy about my overall experience that I could not leave the restaurant without thanking the servers and the owner personally and felt the need to shake his hand and assure him that we would be back again.",

The fake meats will probably distract and annoy you more than anything, and if you are already familiar with Chinese food, these pretend-meat veggie versions will taste like a watered-down mediocre version.<br>Omnivores dragged there by herbivorous friends should stick to straight vegetarian choices -- or simply not look too closely at the &#34;meat&#34;.",

"reviewcomment":"Overall 2 thumbs up from me and my buddy!  We been here a few times and the sushi is always good and fresh!  Not too busy either considering it&#39;s a Friday night!  <br><br>We sat in the heated plastic enclosed patio and pretended it was a warm Summer night!  We ate, lamented over the sad path our beloved Vancouver Canucks were traveling down, and he tried to convince me not to invest in real estate in the States.  <br><br>I digress... The food was excellent... My minor complaint is that the toro was a bit tougher than I like. It&#39;s supposed to melt in your mouth, this toro did not!  Still I&#39;m not a nit picker so I still give this place a big thumbs up!  <br><br>The service was efficient and friendly.  We ordered too much food!  In the end we waddled home slowly.  Enjoying the cool breeze of a rainless Vancouver night!  The End...   Haha",

"reviewcomment":"Best restaurant I&#39;ve ever been to. My boyfriend and I ate here the other day and the service was on point, never did we feel smothered by the staff but they were always there right when we needed a plate cleared etc. I also have a food allergy and never has a restaurant been so accommodating and careful about my anaphylaxis as Five Sails.<br><br>Not only was the service great, but the food was cooked perfectly. Seafood is hard to cook perfectly, especially shellfish and scallops. I ordered the catch which was a sampler of a scallop, half a lobster tail, a crab claw and a hefty chunk of halibut in a coconut sauce with assorted veggies. And as compliments from the chef an ahi tuna tartar and carrot soup which was honestly the highlight of the food of the evening. <br><br>And for dessert we had the lux lemon mille feuille which was honestly the best ending to the perfect night of food. <br><br>I definitely recommend Five Sails and will be coming back!",

"reviewcomment":"I was totally blown away by their food &amp; service last night! my S/O suggested this place as it was in the neighbourhood but I hadn&#39;t been there before. We decided on take out. So I called in our order, and the gentlemen who answered the phone was SO friendly and attentive (which is not the case sometimes at other restaurants when you call to place an order) and told me about 10 - 15 minutes. When I went to pick up the order I was greeted very politely by the staff, and told it would be just a moment and offered a drink while I waited.  Every interaction I had with a staff member was done politely, professional, and welcoming. The place was bustling for a Friday night... but everyone seemed to be on their A-game and happy to be there. <br>I got my food and took it home. <br><br>We ordered a prawn souvlaki and a chicken souvlaki. the food was carefully packaged and divided. They have a unique take-a-way tray that has individual portioned areas for the rice, vegetables, protein/potatoes. they had a separate container for the Greek salad, and another one for the tzakiki. Let me just say this... everything was awesome but the roasted potatoes blew me away. I have NEVER tasted roasted potatoes that were so good in my life. I don&#39;t know what your secret is but they were phenomenal (and I don&#39;t even usually like potatoes too much). Over all it was delicious. Portion sizes were fabulous (I have a little leftover for lunch today.. excited!), and the food was yummy! <br><br>Will definitely be back!!",

There is also an abundant amount of vegetables in the wrap so YEY! :p <br><br>And the restaurant is open very late so this is an absolute plus! One of the female employees who works during the afternoon always puts more into the wrap! too bad she does not work at night... :(",

"reviewcomment":"A friend and I went out to for Japanese food on a Wednesday night. We ended up at Hime Japanese Restaurant.  I counted 2 other Japanese restaurants on the same block as Hime, and there is a gaggle sprinkled all over the area.  Man talk about competition!  <br><br>2 thumbs up for Hime!  We started with the Cold Organic Tofu.  It was a good appetizer to get the taste buds going. Than we shared some rolls the Sunny Roll and the Paradise Roll.  Both very good. The Sunny roll was a bit spicy, but not to the point where one had to run for water!  <br><br>I had the Unagi Donburi.  Again very good!  Lots of eel and the sauce was nicely spread on the eel and rice. I would order it again.  Food wise no complaints!  <br><br>The restaurant is pretty small.  It could maybe accommodate 30 people max.  We came on a Wednesday night and it was 90 percent full. I&#39;m sure the line up would be out the door on a Friday night.  <br><br>The service was excellent. As soon as I sat down I was immediately given a hot tea.  The waitress was cute and not overtly ingratiating.  As I said before 2 thumbs up!  Be back soon!",

We ordered for pick up on a really busy day (seriously crazy busy!) but they had our order ready on time.<br>Crispy chow main with chicken and veg, beef with snow peas, sweet and sour pork (sigh) eggroll (another sigh) and deep fried wontons. The food was really good! Portions were nice and everything was super fresh and tasty.<br>Now for the icing on the cake: They messed up the deep fried wontons and gave us deep fried wonton chips instead.

As I mentioned, the food was too spicy for me-I should&#39;ve ordered bland to mild. However, the chef made so many accommodations for me, bringing me yogurt, cilantro, offering to re-do the dish for me. To quote him, &#34;No, no, it&#39;s no problem. You are my customer, and it is my job to make you happy.&#34; I really can&#39;t recall the last time I had this high quality level of service. <br><br>Atmosphere: 10/10. I was there just before the dinner rush, so it was generally nice and quiet. It was a perfect place to have a nice dinner :)<br><br>I would definitely go back to Cafe Kathmandu, for their food, service, and atmosphere. The only downside is that it doesn&#39;t open until 4:30/5PM, so you won&#39;t be able to go to lunch there. <br><br>Highly recommended!",

We decided on take out. So I called in our order, and the gentlemen who answered the phone was SO friendly and attentive (which is not the case sometimes at other restaurants when you call to place an order) and told me about 10 - 15 minutes. When I went to pick up the order I was greeted very politely by the staff, and told it would be just a moment and offered a drink while I waited.  Every interaction I had with a staff member was done politely, professional, and welcoming. The place was bustling for a Friday night... but everyone seemed to be on their A-game and happy to be there. <br>I got my food and took it home. <br><br>We ordered a prawn souvlaki and a chicken souvlaki. the food was carefully packaged and divided. They have a unique take-a-way tray that has individual portioned areas for the rice, vegetables, protein/potatoes. they had a separate container for the Greek salad, and another one for the tzakiki. Let me just say this... everything was awesome but the roasted potatoes blew me away. I have NEVER tasted roasted potatoes that were so good in my life. I don&#39;t know what your secret is but they were phenomenal (and I don&#39;t even usually like potatoes too much). Over all it was delicious. Portion sizes were fabulous (I have a little leftover for lunch today.. excited!), and the food was yummy! <br><br>Will definitely be back!!",

Ideally, it&#39;d be a combination of Cadeaux Bakery and Swiss Bakery). <br><br>Swiss Bakery has it all in a bakery: loaves of fresh bread that you can buy whole, sliced or get in the form of one of their delicious sounding sandwiches (I mean, brie and pear? COME ON!). They&#39;ve got cookies and pastries for days, frissants (yeah, yeah, I&#39;ll get to it), and even spicy rolls/pretzels and other interesting things. That&#39;s the type of bakery I want to own - a one stop spot for everything. You need a breakfast or lunch, maybe a coffee, and you&#39;d like a loaf of bread for dinner that evening? We&#39;ve got you covered! I loved that about this place. <br><br>It&#39;s busy. It&#39;s comfortable. It&#39;s approachable. It&#39;s reasonably priced. A loaf of bread for $4? Yes. A Frissant for $4? Makes sense to me - those things are labor intensive! And mighty tasty I might add. I ordered one of the vanilla bean ones and boy was that delicious. So delicious I think the calories might not have counted, you know, because. <br><br>I&#39;ll def. be back, but in the mean time, I&#39;ll be wishing that I had a Swiss Bakery of my own.",

She pushes the button, and with Chinese efficiency our waitress showed up not 2 seconds later!  <br><br>I ordered the spicy beef brisket with tendon on fried noodles!  With a side order of chicken wings and a Diet Coke.  Everything was awesome! The noodle dish had a kick and that was perfect for me!  The 6 of us talked about current events and gossiped for an hour and a half!  Lots and smiles and laughter...

Vancouver and their out-dated liquor laws make it hard enough to make it, let alone if you want to have video games and booze in the same place, but they&#39;re pulling it off with grace.<br><br>The owner and the staff are all super excellent, friendly, helpful and passionate about the place and that kind of thing goes a long way for a positive dining/drinking out experience.<br><br>For a bar they have a pretty extensive and unique food menu, and some really tasty and clever mix-drinks.<br><br>I see reviews and have heard people say that they think the execution isn&#39;t strong enough, and that since it&#39;s a &#39;theme bar&#39; there should be more focus on video games, but this isn&#39;t Chuck E. Cheese. It&#39;s a lounge, and they keep a nice running theme without being cheesy. <br><br>And before you assume I am writing this from the point of view of a non-gamer, think again.

"reviewcomment":"I was totally blown away by their food &amp; service last night! my S/O suggested this place as it was in the neighbourhood but I hadn&#39;t been there before. We decided on take out. So I called in our order, and the gentlemen who answered the phone was SO friendly and attentive (which is not the case sometimes at other restaurants when you call to place an order) and told me about 10 - 15 minutes. When I went to pick up the order I was greeted very politely by the staff, and told it would be just a moment and offered a drink while I waited.  Every interaction I had with a staff member was done politely, professional, and welcoming. The place was bustling for a Friday night... but everyone seemed to be on their A-game and happy to be there. <br>I got my food and took it home. <br><br>We ordered a prawn souvlaki and a chicken souvlaki. the food was carefully packaged and divided. They have a unique take-a-way tray that has individual portioned areas for the rice, vegetables, protein/potatoes. they had a separate container for the Greek salad, and another one for the tzakiki. Let me just say this... everything was awesome but the roasted potatoes blew me away. I have NEVER tasted roasted potatoes that were so good in my life. I don&#39;t know what your secret is but they were phenomenal (and I don&#39;t even usually like potatoes too much). Over all it was delicious. Portion sizes were fabulous (I have a little leftover for lunch today.. excited!), and the food was yummy! <br><br>Will definitely be back!!",

The cashier ladies were really friendly and quick, making small-talk as we paid. <br><br>Our bbq chicken and pineapple medium pizza was ready in 15 minutes. The toppings were evenly spread, the crust was thin and crisp. <br><br>All in all, a really cheap and cheerful experience!",

"reviewcomment":"During lunchtime, this place can be a zoo. Avoid it at these times if at all possible.<br><br>Their sushi is what one might expect of decent, cheap sushi. But the price is quite fair, especially for the downtown location, so I&#39;m giving this 4 stars instead of 3.<br><br>Staff are mostly Korean, not that this is a problem, but thought I&#39;d point it out because it seems to matter to some people.<br><br>Order at the counter, put on number on your table and someone will bring you your food. Self serve water and tea, bus your own tables when you&#39;re done.<br><br>In addition to sushi, they also serve noodles (udon and ramen), as well as some donburi (rice bowls). They also offer a few Korean dishes, like bibimbap and japchae, that sort of thing.<br><br>Certainly not a place to go out of your way for, but worth considering if you&#39;re in the area and are looking for a cheap quick bite.",

The only problem is this place is kind of out of the way!<br><br>I had the large Hainanese Chicken and shared some Roti.  The chicken dish is always awesome!  Thick meaty pieces of<br>chicken and chicken flavored rice with a hint of ginger. There is a dipping sauce that goes well with the chicken. It has a sour chili taste a bit spicy but not unbearably hot by any means. To me the sauce makes the dish. The only problem is when you order a large size they don&#39;t give you enough sauce!  <br><br>The roti is excellent! Flaky with a buttery flavor it&#39;s like eating a pastry.  The roti is served piping hot!  That&#39;s the only way to eat this dish!  <br><br>The only thing that stops me from giving this place 5 stars... the below average service!  Yeah I know this is a classical Asian restaurant and service is of secondary importance, but anytime I have to ask twice for something I&#39;ll going to bitch about the service!",

We decided on take out. So I called in our order, and the gentlemen who answered the phone was SO friendly and attentive (which is not the case sometimes at other restaurants when you call to place an order) and told me about 10 - 15 minutes. When I went to pick up the order I was greeted very politely by the staff, and told it would be just a moment and offered a drink while I waited.  Every interaction I had with a staff member was done politely, professional, and welcoming. The place was bustling for a Friday night... but everyone seemed to be on their A-game and happy to be there. <br>I got my food and took it home. <br><br>We ordered a prawn souvlaki and a chicken souvlaki. the food was carefully packaged and divided. They have a unique take-a-way tray that has individual portioned areas for the rice, vegetables, protein/potatoes. they had a separate container for the Greek salad, and another one for the tzakiki. Let me just say this... everything was awesome but the roasted potatoes blew me away. I have NEVER tasted roasted potatoes that were so good in my life. I don&#39;t know what your secret is but they were phenomenal (and I don&#39;t even usually like potatoes too much). Over all it was delicious. Portion sizes were fabulous (I have a little leftover for lunch today.. excited!), and the food was yummy! <br><br>Will definitely be back!!",

We both ordered the AYCE fish and chips (11.99), which came with unlimited pop as well! I didn&#39;t have high hopes at first due to the cheap price, but I was totally blown away. The batter was very crispy, not too oily, and FRESHLY MADE. I expected it to be re fried fish since it was 4pm, but both fish and chips were fresh, not too oily/crispy; just perfect. <br><br>Service was honestly better than the food. That is quite something to say, considering the F&amp;C is definitely one of the best I&#39;ve had in this city. I totally forgot our waiter&#39;s name, but he checked back on us every so often (wasn&#39;t badgering/lacking), genuinely seemed happy and cheerful, and told my friend that bottomless pop was free, when I ordered a Pepsi. <br><br>DEFINITELY WILL COME BACK, AND EVERYONE SHOULD TOO. <br><br>P.S. when you get a refill on food, you can ask for just fish, just fish, or both :)",

"reviewcomment":"I loved this place!  Went with my regular group for brunch and I was super impressed with just about everything.  The only improvement I could suggest (and the reason for only 4 stars instead of 5) is that their portions are really small.  C&#39;mon, Bistro Pastis, would it really break the bank to throw on a few more potatoes?  I left feeling hungry still, but I solved that dilemma by heading over to Beaucoup Bakery for some treats afterwards.  :)<br><br>The good parts about Bistro Pastis is no. 1, the coffee.  Probably the best coffee I&#39;ve had with brunch in ages.  I had three cups!!  Soo good.<br><br>My poached eggs were cooked perfectly soft.  I did order an extra egg, though, because one isn&#39;t enough for brunch!  The rest of my meal was delicious - I had the Duck Confit with Potato hashbrown (only one - so disappointing) but the flavours made up for the small portion.<br><br>I would definitely go back as I want to try their eggs benedict!",

When we went in at the peak of Saturday evening it was busy, however, not packed in comparison to the other places on the Drive. My best friend and I were seated within 5 minutes. The place has some ambiance, not much, however, you can dress up nicely if you want. Prices are very reasonable. My best friend and I shared a medium Pizza between us for $15 and split the bill. The Pizza is a very thin crust but leaves you satisfied. <br><br>The host who sat us was a good sport as we were playing around with him.",

The servers are always ready to help, but I&#39;m never ready to order. Deciding on a SINGLE piece of pastry, cookie or cake here is a ridiculous thing. I&#39;ve not walked out of here empty-handed and I doubt you will either.<br><br>If you haven&#39;t tried their Red Velvet cake, do it! Their Apple Strudel is one of our favourite weekend snacks. The Tiramisu was good. The pies! Oh, the pies! I&#39;m a big fan of pie and these are good pies. I hear the cookies are to die for but, I have yet to try them. <br><br>Recently, I had a iced coffee with my strudel. I&#39;m no coffee connoisseur so, I can&#39;t comment on the coffee. I didn&#39;t mind it. <br><br>I see the sandwiches and other deli delights, which all look really good. I plan to have a little lunch there someday.

It has an incredible depth of flavours, where the cooks take their time to simmer their broth for hours until it reaches perfection to serve, unlike the other pho joints in the neighbourhood that take shortcuts by inducing tons of MSG into their broth (I&#39;m looking at you, bao chau and le petit saigon). I&#39;d rate it as one of the best in Van (Song Huong&#39;s pho is slightly better.) <br><br>$7 for a large bowl and cash only. Their inhouse chili oil is pretty kickass too. Be sure to try their spring roll and spicy house roll. Tons of parking at the front and side streets.

However, the restaurant is comfortable and tastefully appointed, the service friendly and attentive and the food for the most part is quite good.<br><br>We started with the vegetable Pakora which was the only miss of the evening. They were kind of doughy and lacking in vegetables. We would never consider ordering them again. <br><br>For mains we ordered the Chicken Tikka Masala and Spinach Chicken with a side of basmati rice and naan. Our credit goes to the kitchen as we ordered one dish spiced Canadian medium and one dish spiced Indian medium and their hand for the spicing was spot on. Although their naan was not the best,  it did the trick for sopping up the sauces.<br><br>I don&#39;t go out for this style of Indian cooking that often because I find the food quite heavy, but if I was in the mood for it I wouldn&#39;t hesitate to return to Akbar&#39;s.",

"reviewcomment":"I was totally blown away by their food &amp; service last night! my S/O suggested this place as it was in the neighbourhood but I hadn&#39;t been there before. We decided on take out. So I called in our order, and the gentlemen who answered the phone was SO friendly and attentive (which is not the case sometimes at other restaurants when you call to place an order) and told me about 10 - 15 minutes. When I went to pick up the order I was greeted very politely by the staff, and told it would be just a moment and offered a drink while I waited.  Every interaction I had with a staff member was done politely, professional, and welcoming. The place was bustling for a Friday night... but everyone seemed to be on their A-game and happy to be there. <br>I got my food and took it home. <br><br>We ordered a prawn souvlaki and a chicken souvlaki. the food was carefully packaged and divided. They have a unique take-a-way tray that has individual portioned areas for the rice, vegetables, protein/potatoes. they had a separate container for the Greek salad, and another one for the tzakiki. Let me just say this... everything was awesome but the roasted potatoes blew me away. I have NEVER tasted roasted potatoes that were so good in my life. I don&#39;t know what your secret is but they were phenomenal (and I don&#39;t even usually like potatoes too much). Over all it was delicious. Portion sizes were fabulous (I have a little leftover for lunch today.. excited!), and the food was yummy! <br><br>Will definitely be back!!",

"reviewcomment":"Dinner Buddy and I visited this place last night to use my Groupon. Not sure where the complaints about the service being terrible are coming from as our server was very nice and accomodating. We sat down at a small table meant for two and when we ended up ordering a lot of food (as DB is wont to do) she suggested we move to one of the booths so that we would have more space. <br><br>I had the Miso Soup, which was very forgettable. Didn&#39;t taste like Miso at all, and I&#39;ve had instant Miso Soup that was more flavourful. We also shared the Assorted Sashimi plate, Beef Sashimi, Oishii and Bayview Rolls, and some Nigiri Sushi. Everything was served fresh so no complaints there. I&#39;ve had better Beef Sashimi, but it wasn&#39;t necessarily bad. Just a tad too lemony for my taste. The sushi rolls took a bit of time to prepare and we had a bit of a lull in the middle of our meal which DB spent making faces and silly noises so that was at least amusing. I thought the rolls were small for the price we were paying and I definitely suggest sticking with the regular rolls if dining here without a voucher. Also, they made the Nigiri with wasabi between the fish and the rice so DB ended up eating it all! I honestly don&#39;t know what the standard is--half the time when I get Nigiri it is made without.<br><br>Overall, the experience wasn&#39;t the greatest, nor was the food. But I wouldn&#39;t call it bad. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll be back here again without a voucher as we still ended up paying $35 (our bill came to around $60) and we didn&#39;t even feel stuffed after our meal. DB and I both had room for waffles of our own! While this is not the worst place I&#39;ve been to there are just too many other places where this kind of money will be better spent.",

"reviewcomment":"I was totally blown away by their food &amp; service last night! my S/O suggested this place as it was in the neighbourhood but I hadn&#39;t been there before. We decided on take out. So I called in our order, and the gentlemen who answered the phone was SO friendly and attentive (which is not the case sometimes at other restaurants when you call to place an order) and told me about 10 - 15 minutes. When I went to pick up the order I was greeted very politely by the staff, and told it would be just a moment and offered a drink while I waited.  Every interaction I had with a staff member was done politely, professional, and welcoming. The place was bustling for a Friday night... but everyone seemed to be on their A-game and happy to be there. <br>I got my food and took it home. <br><br>We ordered a prawn souvlaki and a chicken souvlaki. the food was carefully packaged and divided. They have a unique take-a-way tray that has individual portioned areas for the rice, vegetables, protein/potatoes. they had a separate container for the Greek salad, and another one for the tzakiki. Let me just say this... everything was awesome but the roasted potatoes blew me away. I have NEVER tasted roasted potatoes that were so good in my life. I don&#39;t know what your secret is but they were phenomenal (and I don&#39;t even usually like potatoes too much). Over all it was delicious. Portion sizes were fabulous (I have a little leftover for lunch today.. excited!), and the food was yummy! <br><br>Will definitely be back!!",

"reviewcomment":"A fun night out here - great hip hop music, but only beers &amp; well drinks (no cocktails!).<br><br>Saturday night about 10pm: there was a line outside but it wasn&#39;t too crazy. A few people in our group were on the guest list so we got priority entry. $10 cover, cash only, and there&#39;s an ATM inside with a $2 charge to withdraw cash. Coat check is right up front too.<br><br>There&#39;s an upstairs area on the sides surrounding the downstairs. A long high table in the middle, sit down tables along one side and the bar at the other. Everything is made of large pieces of natural wood - made me think of a barn. A really stylish, happening bar. There are stringed lights hanging across the two upstairs balconies - really cute.<br><br>The two floors connect in the back onto a dance floor in the middle. The music was AWESOME. It was like 90s hip hop rehash night. We heard everything from Beyonce to Snoop Dogg to Dr. Dre to N Sync to Backstreet Boys to Jackson 5. Later it got into some Top 40s stuff, and the DJ definitely reused a few songs throughout the night (but they were all ones that we liked!). <br><br>Downstairs from the dance floor are the restrooms - individual stalls, a single line for both boys and girls. They got pretty messed up by the end of the night... at least one wasn&#39;t flushing, and my bf unfortunately got one where part of the bowl was chipped off and water got everywhere when he flushed.<br><br>My bf thought the vibe of the place was totally weird considering the disparity between the hip-hop music and the rustic decor. Oh well, I had fun!",

Everything including the Lassi yoghurt drink was amazing. <br><br>They serve African and Indian food. Nash is originally from Uganda so the food experience is authentic. Many of the guests are local to either Vancouver, Africa or India so you know that The Jambo Grill is awesome",

"reviewcomment":"I&#39;ve been coming to this location of Earls for as long as I can remember (at least 15+ years).  It had changed over the years to keep up with the times, but the important things haven&#39;t changed: quality, consistency, and service.<br><br>The service is exactly what one would expect from a &#34;casual fine dining&#34; restaurant - I don&#39;t expect perfection, all I want is a little courtesy and a server with the ability to read their tables. Despite the fact that a lot of the servers here are quite young and not always super experienced, they are friendly, polite, and eager to please.  <br><br>The food - the menu is expansive, varied and consistent.  There is literally something for everyone.  The tried and true menu items remain permanent fixtures, as they should, and feature menus showcase not only the lovely ingredients that we have in season, but provide a few new options to a frequent guest like me if I feel like trying something new.  The food quality is always of a very high level - they source their ingredients carefully and everything is always deliciously fresh. <br><br>The thing I can always rely on at Earls is I know exactly what I&#39;m going to get. Be it this location, the original Tin Palace, or the swanky Yaletown location, I know that my &#34;insert menu item here&#34; will always be what I expect. That is a huge reason why I eat here - I will never be disappointed at what they put down in front of me.  Consistency is key, and Earls does it perfectly.",

The portion is also quite large so you don&#39;t have to worry about leaving hungry.<br><br>I have seen people complaining about the service, but what they(and i have to admit I) didn&#39;t know was they have a button on the table that you push to ask the server to come over and take your order, fill up your water, etc.<br><br>They also offer many types of bubble tea which will have you coming back for more.<br><br>Overall it&#39;s a great place to eat and I would recommend it to anyone.",

"reviewcomment":"Again, last evening, the staff and kitchen of The French Table Bistro proved they are the best in town. From the warm, yet dignified, greeting of owner/manager Hervé, to the tender ministrations of waiters Gilles and Phiippe (who is also fine artist in his other life), the service was impeccable. The atmosphere is warm and comfortable, and the food is delicious and exactly right. It is French, in the most glorious sense of the word. Some of the reviews on this site must have been from people who do not know great French cooking when they encounter it. C&#39;est dommage.<br>      Meanwhile, those of us who do know continue to spread the word to others of like mind. My husband&#39;s duck terrine was the finest we&#39;ve had since moving to the west coast 17 years ago. My lobster feuillettée was exquisite, and our main courses -- we both ordered the wild duck -- was cooked and sauced perfectly. We shared creme caramel and poached pears for dessert as we could not choose between them. Yum. Bubbles to start, a fine Burgundy from the family vineyard and &#34;French Table&#34; cafe to close. What a great way to celebrate my birthday!<br>     Merci à tous et à bientot, Carol &amp; Peter",

"reviewcomment":"&#34;Dear Armand,  Thank you so much for your hospitality.  My wife and I had a lovely time at your place and your food was so amazing and delicious.&#34;  <br><br>That&#39;s what it feels like to eat at Lily Mae&#39;s, or at least what we felt last night. I came across Lily Mae&#39;s by accident, when I was making an early reservation on Open Table and quite frankly, it&#39;s something that should not stay a secret for too long.<br><br>From the moment you walk in, it is almost like you are having dinner at a friend&#39;s house instead of a restaurant.  The decor, the atmosphere, it is not a stuffy restaurant and a far cry from the cookie-cutter chains that populate much of Vancouver.<br><br>The food is even better than home-cooked.  The macaroni and cheese with duck confit was just rich enough and as an appetizer is the perfect size to be shared with one other person.   The duck confit makes it just slightly richer without taking over the cheesy-goodness.<br><br>The market steak was cooked perfectly and had a very lovely peppercorn aioli and complimented the steak quite nicely.  Handcut fries and a salad make a nice accoutrements to the main course.  <br><br>The icing on the cake was the cake: an apple pecan bacon cake.  Apple. Pecan. BACON!   This dessert was the perfect topper for the meal.  One one hand, I&#39;m very grateful I shared it with my wife because it was so good it clearly could not be good for me.  <br><br>The decor is lovely. It looks like a nice dining room.  It gives the meal that extra kick of character.  One of the highlights of eating here, at least for us was Armand, the proprietor.  He&#39;s so friendly and warm, it makes it seem like you have actually gone to a friend&#39;s house to eat.  If I ever had to host a private dinner party, I would definitely consider trying to book out Lily Mae&#39;s and until then I&#39;ll just have to come again with friends.  The brunch menu looks utterly fantastic.",

"reviewcomment":"I was totally blown away by their food &amp; service last night! my S/O suggested this place as it was in the neighbourhood but I hadn&#39;t been there before. We decided on take out. So I called in our order, and the gentlemen who answered the phone was SO friendly and attentive (which is not the case sometimes at other restaurants when you call to place an order) and told me about 10 - 15 minutes. When I went to pick up the order I was greeted very politely by the staff, and told it would be just a moment and offered a drink while I waited.  Every interaction I had with a staff member was done politely, professional, and welcoming. The place was bustling for a Friday night... but everyone seemed to be on their A-game and happy to be there. <br>I got my food and took it home. <br><br>We ordered a prawn souvlaki and a chicken souvlaki. the food was carefully packaged and divided. They have a unique take-a-way tray that has individual portioned areas for the rice, vegetables, protein/potatoes. they had a separate container for the Greek salad, and another one for the tzakiki. Let me just say this... everything was awesome but the roasted potatoes blew me away. I have NEVER tasted roasted potatoes that were so good in my life. I don&#39;t know what your secret is but they were phenomenal (and I don&#39;t even usually like potatoes too much). Over all it was delicious. Portion sizes were fabulous (I have a little leftover for lunch today.. excited!), and the food was yummy! <br><br>Will definitely be back!!",

"reviewcomment":"An eggle and a cinnamon bun? Don&#39;t mind if I do!<br><br>This is one of the best places in Vancouver to stop for a snake that turns into a meal. Many reviewers compare these bagels to some where else in the country/world. Why? Who cares if I&#39;ve had better bagels in NYC, if I&#39;m in BC chances are NYC isn&#39;t my next stop.<br><br>We make due with what we got, and Solly&#39;s makes me feel good. Jewish style deli&#39;s are hard to find in the PNW so take your bagel snobbery back east. You&#39;re too stiff anyway.<br><br>In all seriousness Solley&#39;s is great food and any excuse I have to drive across the boarder I stop by here each trip. I suggest you do the same. If anyone knows a better cinnamon bun (without icing, im a purist after all) between Seattle and Van shoot me a note and I will make the trip.<br><br>Protip: If you are from south of the border like me get a Nexus. This way they are less likely to search your car and find 2 dozen cinnamon buns in the trunk. To be on the safe side have a few extra buns close at hand to slide your way through customs.",

"reviewcomment":"I came here with a group of my class mates after school one day. We arrived at around 2pm so it wasn&#39;t quite happy hour time yet (3-6pm) which selected appies are priced at 50% off. <br><br>Amongst the 7 of us we ordered 4 pints of beer, Budweiser Crown, and 3 other ones which I don&#39;t remember, Nachos ($16) and fish &amp; chips. Oh and we each got a shot of Tequila. The beer glasses were chilled and very clean. The service was fast and attentive. I have to give our waitress credits because she was honestly amazingly attentive. We were behaving like a bunch of loud high schoolers and were getting increasing roudy as the intake of beer increased. She kept her cool and smiles and treated us with respect as if we were sober mature adults. Service is a solid 5.<br><br>The food wasn&#39;t bad either. I can&#39;t comment on fish &amp; chips because I didn&#39;t have any. We got a Nachos and it was GIGANTIC! The corn tortilla was fresh, crispy, and not at all oily/greasy. The cheese was evenly layered and not just bunched up at the top. We added additional chicken and the chicken cubes were good as well, not dry at all.<br><br>I found out of one of us had his birthday that day. I asked our waitress if we could get a complementary dessert with a candle or a complementary appetizer. She said the house gives out a complementary shot instead. We said that&#39;d be lovely. She gave a grapefruit looking liquid with a good mix of god knows what. Again she was just so nice and kind. <br><br>Solid 4 stars.",

"reviewcomment":"One of my choices if someone calls for dim sum, as they are not too far from where I live, and the quality is consistent every time I come back. This place has some great food, in taste and now in portion size which gives it value. I came just yesterday with my mom and some of her friends, a big table of 10, which always means mass ordering to feed the group. This place does things by sheet ordering, tick the box, but the number inside the dish that you want and it shall be steamed, pan fried, deep fried to order. I noticed their sheet was bigger, no longer was it a small sheet, but almost the size of letterhead paper, and accompanied by a clipboard so you can check off your order in the air, instead of right on the table.<br><br>There is a huge letterhead sized advertisement on the table showing their specials, one was the the hot pot beef they had for the night, and the other side had a braised, pan fried salmon dish for dim sum for $4.95. Since we had so many people on the table, we ordered this dish as well. We came in a 2, almost the end of dim sum service, so the place wasn&#39;t that busy, but what is good about made to order places is that they will always have food for you, unlike places that push around carts of food hoping to get rid of the leftovers. From pan fried soy sauce rice wraps, haw gow, sui mai, deep fried tofu, mini sticky rice wrap with meat, spring rolls, beef balls, BBQ pork buns, they just all kept on coming with no rest for the weary. The people working here either didn&#39;t want this group of people hungry, or wanted to feed us quick so we would have the decency to finish our meal and get out in time so they can have their mid-break before the dinner rush. I don&#39;t see the latter as a problem, as we were hungry, and it&#39;s good to get food fast, piping hot, and fresh as I&#39;m not one to liking to wasting time at a restaurant, especially at lunch when I have the whole day ahead of me.<br><br>They charge 50 cents per head for a tea fee here during dim sum, that&#39;s about the average, but don&#39;t go out of your way finding those restaurants that have &#39;free tea&#39; during dim sum, this place should not be avoided as it is one of the better places in the city. I was here a few months ago and compared to yesterday, the sizes of things have changed....... they got bigger. We had one friend who just arrived from Hong Kong, and was amazed at the sheer volume of the &#39;har gow&#39; that hit the table. If you have ever been to dim sum, then you know the size of a tea cup at these places, the har gow was that size, and there were 4 in the bamboo steamer. The beef meat balls were the size of my fist, and they had 3 of them, the stuff here was what you would see from a budget dim sum joint trying to trick people to coming here because of value, but not due to quality. This place was still the same place as I remembered, yet the sizes increased, rare thing to happen, usually it means the end of restaurant (well in my book) when they go bigger, but this place will survive with the good food I have known.<br><br>The place has a good sized private parking lot, but around the area there is a ton of parking here, all free, so don&#39;t be worried. The place is not that big, if your coming in a bigger group, it would be advised for you to phone first and get a reservation so that your not left waiting long (and then writing a negative review cause your dumb butt just walked in here expecting stuff!). They have dim sum, dinner, and late night, and it sounds like they have the other meals covered well in quality as well.",

"reviewcomment":"Adorable, or most adorable?<br><br>Answering that question is the dilemma you have after checking this place out. <br><br>My cousin and I chanced upon La Petite Cuillère on our day trip up to Vancouver -- we had been attempting to get macarons from French Made Baking down the block but were too late -- on our way back we wandered into this tea shop and were not disappointed!<br><br>From our server (who is awkward in the most adorable way, like, I wish she and I could be besties sort of way, because we&#39;d be adorable and awkward and everyone else would be overwhelmed by how cute we are and we&#39;d take purikura photos where our hands form hearts and... wait, I&#39;m starting to sound like a creep. But she really was awesome!) to the tea to the food -- everything was perfect.<br><br>I classed up the place while donning my extra-fancy <a href='/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Ftwitch.tv&amp;s=a1fad6e3cd30ae5b9b6f7d0aa6d871a597b43c68d58b4c02034e4f92115799cb' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>twitch.tv</a> sweatshirt, but never felt as though I was being looked down upon for my fashion transgressions.<br><br>We opted for high tea. They gave us an assortment of delicious little morsels (including the only non-sushi application of tuna I have ever *enjoyed*) and I paired it with their coconut rooibos chai. Absolutely decadent, but not so heavy that I felt ill -- the perfect meal to end our trip to Canada.<br><br>They also had macarons -- I brought some back to the states with me and partook the next day -- they were all so tasty! Basically what I&#39;m saying is, everything was amazing and I can&#39;t wait &#39;til my next trip to BC so I can visit La Petite Cuillère again!",

"reviewcomment":"10 stars! <br><br>I really enjoy this little sake shop, I&#39;m so glad they promote sake in Canada! Their Osake Fraser Valley Junmai is 100% BC sake -rice is grown and harvested there. It&#39;s a light sake and I particularly like this one (just my personal taste).<br><br>The owner and the wife are very nice people. It is HERE that introduced me to the art of sake. The lady greeted my boyfriend and I happily and talked about the sake we were able to sample (3 for $5!!). She was so friendly and very approachable. She even encouraged we try a different sample from each other, and of course I&#39;d steal my boyfriend&#39;s glass for a sip, so we actually sampled 6! <br><br>These made great souvenirs. When I returned to Ontario (Mississauga) I immediately placed my order online to have them shipped to my wonderful boss and colleagues as gifts. All bottles can be purchased on their website (unless they run out). <br><br>Sparkling sake was recommended SO OFTEN by people we talked to in Vancouver. I wanted to write this review AFTER I&#39;ve opened and tried my new (3 bottles of) Sparkling Sake. <br><br>Sake is my new wine. I even brought a sake bottle to a BYOW(ine) Yelp event and it was loved by everyone.<br><br>Thank you so much, Masa Shiroki, for bringing your passion to Canada! <br><br>The ONTARIO Sake Company offers a tour of their modern-looking facility (but it&#39;s not a good tour). Unlike the Ontario&#39;s, customers of Artisan Sake Maker can only visit the store front -with one small table inside and some outdoor seating. <br><br>I do prefer the Artisan&#39;s sake over Ontario&#39;s.<br><br>Unfortunately:<br>- It took one month for my order to be processed. The online shop is actually just an email system -lots of back and forth email conversations (ex. if a sake was out of stock, changing my list, payment...) They take about 1-2 days to respond to your email.<br>- The shipping package was not done properly for mine. The bottles were rolling around, the postman actually asked me to open the box in front of him -just to make sure everything is okay. LUCKILY everything was okay!<br><br>THE SAKE:<br>The Sparkling Sake is very delicious and very light. And SO good when cold! Osake Fraser Valley Junmai is honestly my favourite (the NOT-nigori version), it&#39;s a little sweet, light, and refreshing?<br><br>The shipping to Ontario for 7 bottles was just $23!",

"reviewcomment":"I was totally blown away by their food &amp; service last night! my S/O suggested this place as it was in the neighbourhood but I hadn&#39;t been there before. We decided on take out. So I called in our order, and the gentlemen who answered the phone was SO friendly and attentive (which is not the case sometimes at other restaurants when you call to place an order) and told me about 10 - 15 minutes. When I went to pick up the order I was greeted very politely by the staff, and told it would be just a moment and offered a drink while I waited.  Every interaction I had with a staff member was done politely, professional, and welcoming. The place was bustling for a Friday night... but everyone seemed to be on their A-game and happy to be there. <br>I got my food and took it home. <br><br>We ordered a prawn souvlaki and a chicken souvlaki. the food was carefully packaged and divided. They have a unique take-a-way tray that has individual portioned areas for the rice, vegetables, protein/potatoes. they had a separate container for the Greek salad, and another one for the tzakiki. Let me just say this... everything was awesome but the roasted potatoes blew me away. I have NEVER tasted roasted potatoes that were so good in my life. I don&#39;t know what your secret is but they were phenomenal (and I don&#39;t even usually like potatoes too much). Over all it was delicious. Portion sizes were fabulous (I have a little leftover for lunch today.. excited!), and the food was yummy! <br><br>Will definitely be back!!",

The butter chicken was moist and juicy. The charring naan was a nice contrast to the butter chicken.

"reviewcomment":"Went to Jolly&#39;s on a Monday night with a Groupon voucher just before it expired.  The place was packed with patrons probably using their coupons as well.  I live more in Arbutus area so I was pleased to see there was another East Indian restaurant in the hood.<br><br>Waitresses were great despite being run off their feet.  Food was good and moderately priced.  Not the best East Indian in town but not the worst.  The Lamb biriyani was tender and moist and the Malabari Chicken was tasty.   The salad which accompanied the main courses were more western in taste  and presentation but was appreciated and balanced the spiciness of the the main dishes. The rice cup which accompanied the Malabari Chicken was smaller then normal and cold.  <br><br>Ambience was nice and cosy.  However, the tables in the middle of the restaurant were very close together.  They do not take reservations and hopefully this will change once the Groupon coupons expire.",

There are 3 flavours: BBQ, Cajun, and Honey Dijon... I heard the BBQ is the most popular so I tried it, and I liked it a lot, especially at the reasonable price  of $5. <br><br>Only minus one star is though the bartender is very nice and friendly, the manager (lead waiter? boss? owner?) is not exactly too friendly,then again, I was only in there for a $5 appetizer, so I guess there&#39;s not much  incentive. <br><br>Regardless, I liked the bartender, the ribs, so I will give this place one more try next time.

"reviewcomment":"I was totally blown away by their food &amp; service last night! my S/O suggested this place as it was in the neighbourhood but I hadn&#39;t been there before. We decided on take out. So I called in our order, and the gentlemen who answered the phone was SO friendly and attentive (which is not the case sometimes at other restaurants when you call to place an order) and told me about 10 - 15 minutes. When I went to pick up the order I was greeted very politely by the staff, and told it would be just a moment and offered a drink while I waited.  Every interaction I had with a staff member was done politely, professional, and welcoming. The place was bustling for a Friday night... but everyone seemed to be on their A-game and happy to be there. <br>I got my food and took it home. <br><br>We ordered a prawn souvlaki and a chicken souvlaki. the food was carefully packaged and divided. They have a unique take-a-way tray that has individual portioned areas for the rice, vegetables, protein/potatoes. they had a separate container for the Greek salad, and another one for the tzakiki. Let me just say this... everything was awesome but the roasted potatoes blew me away. I have NEVER tasted roasted potatoes that were so good in my life. I don&#39;t know what your secret is but they were phenomenal (and I don&#39;t even usually like potatoes too much). Over all it was delicious. Portion sizes were fabulous (I have a little leftover for lunch today.. excited!), and the food was yummy! <br><br>Will definitely be back!!",

"reviewcomment":"We went in as a party of six during our short visit in Vancouver. One of our friends was craving Nandos since she hadn&#39;t had it since her trip to Australia. The rest of us didn&#39;t know what to expect.<br><br>They definitely lived up to their claim of fresh, grilled chicken. We ordered the variety platter (10 wings, 2 sides, garlic bread, 2 skewers, 1/2 chicken) with an additional order of 8 wings, in medium and lemon &amp; herb flavors. Our order came pretty quickly. The chicken was nice and juicy, though a bit too charred for my liking. They have sauces at each table. The garlic peri was delicious with the chicken and the free peri fries we received for checking in on yelp Nonetheless, it was still good. This is a place I wish California had!<br><br>TLDR; Peri-peri chicken is their specialty. Must order their chicken and try their sauces!",

I&#39;ve never had a bad experience, the service is always what you expect from cactus club - beautiful young ladies in short skirts that are incredibly polite (sometimes on overkill, but that&#39;s hardly something to fault them for).<br><br>I love that they have a good combination of pub-style food (burgers, fries, greasy things) and healthy options. Their Raincoast Greens is my favourite salad, that parmesan crusted chicken is delicious. I love that I can walk in there at any time of day and get a good meal, and that the person I&#39;m eating with can have something completely different (usually they get a burger, and I get the healthy stuff) and equally delicious. The portions are good sizes, I&#39;ve never left hungry - in fact, I can&#39;t comment on their desserts because I&#39;m always too full from the meal.<br><br>Definitely a solid (if slightly predictable) choice.",

"reviewcomment":"I was totally blown away by their food &amp; service last night! my S/O suggested this place as it was in the neighbourhood but I hadn&#39;t been there before. We decided on take out. So I called in our order, and the gentlemen who answered the phone was SO friendly and attentive (which is not the case sometimes at other restaurants when you call to place an order) and told me about 10 - 15 minutes. When I went to pick up the order I was greeted very politely by the staff, and told it would be just a moment and offered a drink while I waited.  Every interaction I had with a staff member was done politely, professional, and welcoming. The place was bustling for a Friday night... but everyone seemed to be on their A-game and happy to be there. <br>I got my food and took it home. <br><br>We ordered a prawn souvlaki and a chicken souvlaki. the food was carefully packaged and divided. They have a unique take-a-way tray that has individual portioned areas for the rice, vegetables, protein/potatoes. they had a separate container for the Greek salad, and another one for the tzakiki. Let me just say this... everything was awesome but the roasted potatoes blew me away. I have NEVER tasted roasted potatoes that were so good in my life. I don&#39;t know what your secret is but they were phenomenal (and I don&#39;t even usually like potatoes too much). Over all it was delicious. Portion sizes were fabulous (I have a little leftover for lunch today.. excited!), and the food was yummy! <br><br>Will definitely be back!!",

I even briefly worked here in high school and can *still* eat the food! <br><br>I love the pad thai (although the prawns have gotten smaller and smaller over the years); the swimming rama with tofu has a mild spice to it that isn&#39;t too hot for my pathetic taste buds; the spring rolls come with the perfect amount of dipping sauce; try the spinach or broccoli in garlic sauce and get half broccoli and half spinach; the chicken with cashews is great with a side of rice. <br><br>The service is quick, the food is good, and the portions &amp; prices are right. <br><br>Now I&#39;m hungry for Thai.",

"reviewcomment":"After finishing off at the Richmond Driving Range 2 friends and I decided to grab some dinner on a Saturday night.  It was about 8 pm so a bit late.  We ended up at Applause Japanese Restaurant.  I use to live in this area and I&#39;ve ordered take out from this place before.  I rarely had to occasion to dine in.  <br><br>Overall, the restaurant is ok la...  It has a homey feel to it, because of the causal surroundings and the home made curtains enclosing the booths.  <br><br>I ordered their seaweed salad, chicken karaage, and I shared the assorted sashimi platter.  All the dishes were delish!  I especially liked the assorted sashimi dish.  This dish included exquisite pieces of choice raw seafood...  wild salmon, tuna, clam sashimi, octopus... and a couple of fish that I&#39;m not sure what they are.  Anyways, it was all good!  <br><br>Ok tell me if you think this is strange.  After the bill was settled the waitress picked up our payment from the tray and we told her to keep the change and thanked her.  About a minute later she came back and said we over paid!  We gave her about $80 on a $70 bill!  We were a bit puzzled but in the end my friend took $3 back (and we all shared a lottery ticket with it)!  Wow!  Maybe she was expecting all chinese people are bad tippers!  Haha",

We decided on take out. So I called in our order, and the gentlemen who answered the phone was SO friendly and attentive (which is not the case sometimes at other restaurants when you call to place an order) and told me about 10 - 15 minutes. When I went to pick up the order I was greeted very politely by the staff, and told it would be just a moment and offered a drink while I waited.  Every interaction I had with a staff member was done politely, professional, and welcoming. The place was bustling for a Friday night... but everyone seemed to be on their A-game and happy to be there. <br>I got my food and took it home. <br><br>We ordered a prawn souvlaki and a chicken souvlaki. the food was carefully packaged and divided. They have a unique take-a-way tray that has individual portioned areas for the rice, vegetables, protein/potatoes. they had a separate container for the Greek salad, and another one for the tzakiki. Let me just say this... everything was awesome but the roasted potatoes blew me away. I have NEVER tasted roasted potatoes that were so good in my life. I don&#39;t know what your secret is but they were phenomenal (and I don&#39;t even usually like potatoes too much). Over all it was delicious. Portion sizes were fabulous (I have a little leftover for lunch today.. excited!), and the food was yummy! <br><br>Will definitely be back!!",

Sometimes you will wait 25 minutes for your sushi, and the people that just arrived 5 minutes ago get theirs before you. <br><br>That said, I HAVE been here so many times because A) it&#39;s so cheap and B) it&#39;s very close to my house. When I want two California rolls, there is always QQ. When I want Japanese food that is not white-washed and actually has some life and flavor in it, I do not go to QQ.<br><br>2.5 if I could. The deep-fryer in the kitchen is visibly gross. So proceed with caution there.",

I came in to order take-away, but I ended up buying some of the delicious items in the cold case as well (baked polenta to die for).  Fish and chips - perfect.  Crispy, not particularly greasy (fish and chips should be a little bit greasy, lets be honest), perfectly cooked fish with a lovely crisp batter, fries were also crispy on the outside and tender, potato-y on the inside.  The fish tacos were composed of a similarly battered fish, with a lovely coleslaw that had the perfect acidity to complement the fish.<br><br>Not a place to eat in, but then they don&#39;t advertise to be. Great for take-away, and it all stayed fresh and crisp on my 10 minute drive home. They also have an impressive selection of fresh, sustainable seafood to take home and cook yourself.",

The host and servers were all friendly, and gave prompt attention. I had the Pasta Carbonara, and my friend had the canneloni. We both enjoyed our meals immensely. If I had any minor complaint, it was that my dish might have had a tidge more olive oil than it should have.

"reviewcomment":"I was totally blown away by their food &amp; service last night! my S/O suggested this place as it was in the neighbourhood but I hadn&#39;t been there before. We decided on take out. So I called in our order, and the gentlemen who answered the phone was SO friendly and attentive (which is not the case sometimes at other restaurants when you call to place an order) and told me about 10 - 15 minutes. When I went to pick up the order I was greeted very politely by the staff, and told it would be just a moment and offered a drink while I waited.  Every interaction I had with a staff member was done politely, professional, and welcoming. The place was bustling for a Friday night... but everyone seemed to be on their A-game and happy to be there. <br>I got my food and took it home. <br><br>We ordered a prawn souvlaki and a chicken souvlaki. the food was carefully packaged and divided. They have a unique take-a-way tray that has individual portioned areas for the rice, vegetables, protein/potatoes. they had a separate container for the Greek salad, and another one for the tzakiki. Let me just say this... everything was awesome but the roasted potatoes blew me away. I have NEVER tasted roasted potatoes that were so good in my life. I don&#39;t know what your secret is but they were phenomenal (and I don&#39;t even usually like potatoes too much). Over all it was delicious. Portion sizes were fabulous (I have a little leftover for lunch today.. excited!), and the food was yummy! <br><br>Will definitely be back!!",

They forgot my phone order and asked I wait another 10 mins.  It turnout to be 20 as the kitchen forgot my now walk in order.  Adding the telephone time, that 45 mins for three items.  No apology and they even kept the change, assuming like they get a tip as usual.  Two, there are alway new waitresses that are lost even in any language.  Three, when it gets busy like half full, they front staff go bananas.  Lack of training.  Four, the prices have gone up.   On the plus side, the food is always good and consistent.",

"reviewcomment":"Definitely one of the best Vietnamese restaurants in Vancouver. Been a customer for over 10 years, with long breaks in-between, but nonetheless, if you&#39;re craving for a great bowl of Pho. It can definitely be found here. Everything from the rice noodles to broth and condiments is cooked to near perfection. It&#39;s one of the best. Did I mention that a large bowl is only $6.50? That&#39;s unheard of in 2014. That&#39;s the price you&#39;d pay for a small bowl at other Vietnamese restaurants. Their Bun Bo Hue is also a very solid choice, definitely one of the better BBH in the city. Cafe Xue Hue and Thai Hang still reigns better though. There&#39;s parking in the back and lots of street parking on the side. The decor reminds me of a Hawaiian/Latino restaurant due to the use of vibrant colors. Nonetheless, the restaurant serves very solid, legit, authentic, rustic Vietnamese food with great value. Some restaurants don&#39;t even serve Pork blood and Pig Knuckles in their BBH, but not this restaurant. Their Beef 7 Ways for 2 people is also a very popular dish, but I haven&#39;t gotten around to trying it yet though. Oh yeah, they also don&#39;t charge tax.<br><br>One star is subtracted for cleanliness, but I&#39;m just being picky. It&#39;s comparable to most Vietnamese restaurants.",

"reviewcomment":"Generally I find ordering takeout a disappointing experience.  I always have high hopes for delicious food fast when ordering, but get bland, lukewarm, unattractive food upon arrival, usually well past the estimated delivery time. I am happy to report that Thailicious is an exception.  <br><br>At 6pm on a Friday night I placed an order for (1) Spring rolls, (2) spicy crab fried rice, (3) spicy basil noodles, and (4) red chicken curry.  Less than 45 minutes later I had piping hot food delivered at my doorstep with a smile.      As others have noted, the spring rolls are excellent -- crunchy with a lot of filling.  The crab fried rice and basil noodles (which I requested to be &#34;hot&#34; on the spice scale), were pleasently spicy and I would have no hesitation ordering again.  The red chicken curry was a little lacking in substance (could have used some more chicken and veggies), but the flavour was spot on.   <br><br>Prices were a little higher than some of the other delivery spots but the quality was better and, overall, the portion sizes were generous --- 2 of us managed to squeeze 2 dinners and 2 lunches out of this order, which came in at $43 after tax and tip (though we used a coupon for $8 off with <a href='/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Forderit.ca&amp;s=6358078f83a4592e35de54b6cb1fe9cee1ed9216edbdca71a224211cd90d7b54' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>orderit.ca</a>).  This is definitely the best delivery experience I&#39;ve had in Vancouver and I will be ordering again soon!",

We decided on take out. So I called in our order, and the gentlemen who answered the phone was SO friendly and attentive (which is not the case sometimes at other restaurants when you call to place an order) and told me about 10 - 15 minutes. When I went to pick up the order I was greeted very politely by the staff, and told it would be just a moment and offered a drink while I waited.  Every interaction I had with a staff member was done politely, professional, and welcoming. The place was bustling for a Friday night... but everyone seemed to be on their A-game and happy to be there. <br>I got my food and took it home. <br><br>We ordered a prawn souvlaki and a chicken souvlaki. the food was carefully packaged and divided. They have a unique take-a-way tray that has individual portioned areas for the rice, vegetables, protein/potatoes. they had a separate container for the Greek salad, and another one for the tzakiki. Let me just say this... everything was awesome but the roasted potatoes blew me away. I have NEVER tasted roasted potatoes that were so good in my life. I don&#39;t know what your secret is but they were phenomenal (and I don&#39;t even usually like potatoes too much). Over all it was delicious. Portion sizes were fabulous (I have a little leftover for lunch today.. excited!), and the food was yummy! <br><br>Will definitely be back!!",

The wait for your food is slow but it usually is when you&#39;re waiting for fresh, quality food. They have specials for 10.98 for all pasta and daily drink specials which are nice.

They would do better without all the cheesy outdated construction paper drawings on the wall.... if they updated their decor. <br>I like their dishes, they are classy.<br>Would add a star if they used real chopsticks instead of disposable too!",

"reviewcomment":"I was totally blown away by their food &amp; service last night! my S/O suggested this place as it was in the neighbourhood but I hadn&#39;t been there before. We decided on take out. So I called in our order, and the gentlemen who answered the phone was SO friendly and attentive (which is not the case sometimes at other restaurants when you call to place an order) and told me about 10 - 15 minutes. When I went to pick up the order I was greeted very politely by the staff, and told it would be just a moment and offered a drink while I waited.  Every interaction I had with a staff member was done politely, professional, and welcoming. The place was bustling for a Friday night... but everyone seemed to be on their A-game and happy to be there. <br>I got my food and took it home. <br><br>We ordered a prawn souvlaki and a chicken souvlaki. the food was carefully packaged and divided. They have a unique take-a-way tray that has individual portioned areas for the rice, vegetables, protein/potatoes. they had a separate container for the Greek salad, and another one for the tzakiki. Let me just say this... everything was awesome but the roasted potatoes blew me away. I have NEVER tasted roasted potatoes that were so good in my life. I don&#39;t know what your secret is but they were phenomenal (and I don&#39;t even usually like potatoes too much). Over all it was delicious. Portion sizes were fabulous (I have a little leftover for lunch today.. excited!), and the food was yummy! <br><br>Will definitely be back!!",

"reviewcomment":"I came here a while back and didn&#39;t really remember what I had ordered or how the experience was, so that means it wasn&#39;t a bad one. Since I was nearby yesterday I decided to give it a try again since my parents like this place. <br><br>I ordered lunch take out- as I often like eating at a park on a sunny day or at home in front of the tv etc. $13 got me literally 1kg of food and drinks. So I thought the quality probably would be lacking, which I would still accept since this place is usually busy so the food would at least be half decent. <br>When I got home, opened up the big bag- my ice cold Horlicks drink, hot soup, sauce in a cup and the large heavy foam box packed with my rib eye steak, salmon fillet, large serving of rice, small serving of boiled veges and medium serving of fries! Everything nicely packed individually, properly prepared and tasted great! Oh there was also a slice of garlic bread individually bagged as well, amazingly enough still crispy after the short drive. <br>Where in town can you get all this food with a medium rare rib eye steak?  <br>For now this will be my main goto joint for good quality food and double sized meals. <br><br>Oh and service was good, attentive waiter and food was prep&#39;d in 10mins. <br>Look at their lunch combo deal for what I&#39;d ordered, there&#39;s about 12main items to choose from (you get to pick 2 (or more)), plus soup and drink of your choice with the bread.  1kg of great food!",

To each their own!

"reviewcomment":"We came in for the Buck a Shuck Sundays.<br><br>The restaurant opens at 5pm and we were the first of 2 tables.<br><br>We started off with 1 dozen of oysters to see which kind we like, they have Read Island - creamy small oysters and Saw Mill Bay - slightly larger and  saltier.<br><br>We decided we like the Read Island oysters better so we ordered another dozen.<br><br>The first dozen came pretty fast, and the second dozen took a bit longer even though there are only 2 tables in the whole restaurant.<br><br>We order a Deschutes Ale to compliment our oysters, it was very refreshing and light with no after taste.<br><br>Next, we decided to try their Sirloin Slices off their Tapas Menu, Thyme and Peppercorn with Boar Bacon and Tiger Blue Cream, cooked perfectly medium rare, nicely season but not overwhelming, and who doesn&#39;t like bacon. Personally, I am not crazy about the Blue Cream but my DH likes it.<br><br>My DH wants to drop 1 star as the manager and the bartender were busy training staff and were not as attentive as we were the only table. There were 3 wait staff, the bartender, and Nick, the manager on the floor.  He feels that regardless if you are training staff, paying attention to the patrons should be on the top of the list. We overheard the other table asking for the bill twice.<br><br>Anyhow, this is a nice restaurant that is worth another visit.  Thursday is $5 mussels special, they have three different ways of cooking it.",

"reviewcomment":"I was totally blown away by their food &amp; service last night! my S/O suggested this place as it was in the neighbourhood but I hadn&#39;t been there before. We decided on take out. So I called in our order, and the gentlemen who answered the phone was SO friendly and attentive (which is not the case sometimes at other restaurants when you call to place an order) and told me about 10 - 15 minutes. When I went to pick up the order I was greeted very politely by the staff, and told it would be just a moment and offered a drink while I waited.  Every interaction I had with a staff member was done politely, professional, and welcoming. The place was bustling for a Friday night... but everyone seemed to be on their A-game and happy to be there. <br>I got my food and took it home. <br><br>We ordered a prawn souvlaki and a chicken souvlaki. the food was carefully packaged and divided. They have a unique take-a-way tray that has individual portioned areas for the rice, vegetables, protein/potatoes. they had a separate container for the Greek salad, and another one for the tzakiki. Let me just say this... everything was awesome but the roasted potatoes blew me away. I have NEVER tasted roasted potatoes that were so good in my life. I don&#39;t know what your secret is but they were phenomenal (and I don&#39;t even usually like potatoes too much). Over all it was delicious. Portion sizes were fabulous (I have a little leftover for lunch today.. excited!), and the food was yummy! <br><br>Will definitely be back!!",

The Tom Yum soup base was delish: fragrant, spicy and tart.<br><br>Food: Fresh ingredients:  the oysters are included in the AYCE menu and it&#39;s a must have for oyster lovers.  My eyes were bugging out because they were SO plump and unbelievable fresh.  The shrimp (with heads still intact) were also plump and succulent.  The basa filets were also good.  Dumplings were a nice small size, perfect for faster cooking and tasty.  Fish and meatballs were a bit on the chewy side, so not my faves.  The meats were tender tasty as well, but I&#39;m more of a seafood person.<br><br>Ambiance:  Well lighted, new and modern decor and comfortable chairs. <br><br>Service: Efficient and timely. Tea and hot pot fluids were refilled at regular intervals and empty plates, dirty bowls, and plates were taken away and replaced promptly.  Near the end of our 2 hour mark, they came around with the mango pudding (yum!) for dessert.  They take cash or debit only.<br><br>Value: Good! Lots of variety, good quality fresh seafood. Lots of tasty broths to select from. $27 inclusive of tax and tip.<br><br>Will be back soon for more loving from the Fatty Cow!",

"reviewcomment":"This place is like Chinese pastries (both sweet and savory) on steroids. They have a wide selection of baked and steamed Chinese goodness. Some are better than others. Others were a miss, but it boils down to personal preference. <br><br>We ordered curried beef bun, barbeque pork bun, spicy pork bun, chicken bun, and a Chinese sausage roll. Myself...I really enjoyed the flavor of the curried beef and the spicy pork. The chicken bun was on the bland side. Their barbeque pork was nothing too spectacular where I must come back for more. A little sad as that is the signature/staple of Chinese bakeries.<br><br>The reason I gave this place five stars was more for the size of the buns and their price. Growing in Chinatowns in Southern California, Northern California, and Seattle, you get more bang for your buck. The fact there is a system to order and not complete mayhem is pretty amazing. You get a number and wait for your number to be called so you can place an order. No waiting in line. No cutting. <br><br>In terms of service for getting things to go, efficient. They won&#39;t kiss your butt to please you. They want you in and out. Dining experience...not sure as we learned that there is two different prices for the buns. You get it to go - no sales tax. You sit down - you pay sales tax. Not sure how that works but whatever...<br><br>Will definitely be making my way back here the next time I am in Vancouver for the curried beef buns and the spicy pork.",

They even suggested their famous cold tea without needing our prompting. <br><br>I was surprised (after hearing many late night post-bar stories that took place here) at how - well - nice this place was! Tall ceilings, a chandelier (a bit tacky, but still rather fancy), aquariums with live fish/lobster.

Good flavors, but the beef wasn&#39;t the best cut, each piece rather thin and too stringy/soft. <br><br>* Pork fried rice - 2 stars<br>pic: <a href='http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tsui-hang-village-restaurant-vancouver?select=s5Vv36oiVU4TvWC5eT4cig#RKXFYLCFkzhcoK1yLhgvMQ'>yelp.com/biz_photos/tsui…</a><br>Rather dry, and the pork was even drier and more flavorless. I guess you need a filler carb somehow. <br><br>* Sweet &amp; sour pork - 4 stars<br>pic: <a href='http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tsui-hang-village-restaurant-vancouver?select=s5Vv36oiVU4TvWC5eT4cig#mTSnzNm8SdA2OdxIBhl7vA'>yelp.com/biz_photos/tsui…</a><br>Very thick, crunchy, sticky, sweet pork. I&#39;m not usually a fan of sweet &amp; sour dishes but actually rather enjoyed it. <br><br>* Fried bean cake w/ salt &amp; pepper - 3.5 stars<br>pic: <a href='http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tsui-hang-village-restaurant-vancouver?select=s5Vv36oiVU4TvWC5eT4cig#sfQN0WrxwJg-f1PTflpJDw'>yelp.com/biz_photos/tsui…</a><br>Amazing texture, crispy even fried layer all around each piece. Soft &amp; silky tofu on the inside. But the flavor was very lacking, could&#39;ve used a good sauce.",

"reviewcomment":"I was totally blown away by their food &amp; service last night! my S/O suggested this place as it was in the neighbourhood but I hadn&#39;t been there before. We decided on take out. So I called in our order, and the gentlemen who answered the phone was SO friendly and attentive (which is not the case sometimes at other restaurants when you call to place an order) and told me about 10 - 15 minutes. When I went to pick up the order I was greeted very politely by the staff, and told it would be just a moment and offered a drink while I waited.  Every interaction I had with a staff member was done politely, professional, and welcoming. The place was bustling for a Friday night... but everyone seemed to be on their A-game and happy to be there. <br>I got my food and took it home. <br><br>We ordered a prawn souvlaki and a chicken souvlaki. the food was carefully packaged and divided. They have a unique take-a-way tray that has individual portioned areas for the rice, vegetables, protein/potatoes. they had a separate container for the Greek salad, and another one for the tzakiki. Let me just say this... everything was awesome but the roasted potatoes blew me away. I have NEVER tasted roasted potatoes that were so good in my life. I don&#39;t know what your secret is but they were phenomenal (and I don&#39;t even usually like potatoes too much). Over all it was delicious. Portion sizes were fabulous (I have a little leftover for lunch today.. excited!), and the food was yummy! <br><br>Will definitely be back!!",

We also had the best Yellow curry I&#39;ve ever tasted over coconut rice, and rolled the dice on a chocolate pudding/avocado dessert that was awesome.  How much did it set us back to fill 2 people? $31! Totally well worth it.<br><br>Like most Indonesian restaurants, the service was perfect - friendly and attentive when you need someone, never appearing when you don&#39;t.  I really got a good vibe from the people working here. My only worry about this place is that it doesn&#39;t seat many people so they may deter large groups but I don&#39;t care so ling as they can fit me and my girlfriend.  <br><br>100% worth checking out if you like places like the Banana Leaf.",

"reviewcomment":"For those of you who share my negative experiences at Kirin at City Square Mall (review here: <a href='http://www.yelp.ca/biz/kirin-seafood-restaurant-vancouver?hrid=sws7LIG4gKNhjwseVWOZfg'>yelp.ca/biz/kirin-seafoo…</a>), I offer this great alternative for dim sum and upscale Chinese dining a few blocks away.<br><br>We&#39;ve been to Dynasty several times in the past year for dim sum and family dinners, and for the most part, the service and food have been at a consistently high standard. The one exception being our last visit a few weeks ago, when we had made reservations weeks in advance and still were made to wait over half an hour to be seated. However, like I said, it was the exception, so although frustrating, I will gloss over it for the moment.<br><br>Everything on their dim sum menu is good quality. I really like the shrimp &amp; chive dumplings and the deep-fried taro root croquette (not sure what the actual English name is for this dish, but that is the most accurate description I could think of). Personally, I can&#39;t eat a whole meal of dumplings, and I need order some non-dim sum items to balance out the greasy meat dishes. For that, I recommend the clam &amp; white pepper congee... they actually use fresh clams, and the peppery seafood broth is a really nice contrast to the other dishes.<br><br>It&#39;s semi-hidden inside a high-rise building, and if it wasn&#39;t for a small sandwich board outside on the sidewalk, you could walk right by without even knowing it was there. If you&#39;re driving, head around to the back alley - they have a parking lot there. Don&#39;t buy a ticket; you simply have to register your license plate with the host.",

"reviewcomment":"[A taste of Paris]<br><br>Needed a light dinner before hitting the town on a Saturday night and walked past this chic little French bistro. It wasn&#39;t busy like many of the surrounding restaurants so we stopped in. The first thing I noticed was the décor - chairs, banquettes, and napkins were fire truck red on a background of white walls and tables. Very French. The atmosphere was abuzz with the chatter of a younger crowd (I hate the quiet super-formal places). <br><br>Food-wise, I started with a delicious French onion soup. The cheese was velvety soft and the soup wasn&#39;t too salty (relatively speaking). Next up was the beef tartare. The meat was very fresh and the raw quail egg only added to the flavor. SO GOOD!  This was probably my favorite dish of the evening. Size-wise, the total volume of meat was equivalent to a small apple so I needed a bit more. I decided to order a filler - the spinach and mushroom ravioli. I have no idea why I&#39;d order pasta in a French restaurant but this turned out to be an excellent choice. The pasta was well cooked an extremely delicious. I finished the food off with a bottle of Kronenbourg Blanc (one of my faves). <br><br>Value-wise, prices are on the higher side but for the quality, I could justify making a repeat visit. The duck confit and the foie gras looked really good.<br><br>**3.5 Stars**",

The sushi is always fresh, the lunch specials are extremely reasonable (I can get a meal + snack out of the sushi lunch, or 2 meals out of a bento box) and waitresses are friendly and attentive. <br><br>They have a number of special or favourite rolls that are a fun change and all their traditional sushi is great quality.<br><br>I will definitely continue to frequent this place.",

But let me say this: I have treated the menu as if it were Noah&#39;s Arc, that is to say, I&#39;ve ordered everything on the menu twice. It&#39;s awesome. <br><br>This is a cafe which caters to vegan/raw food diets, so you know that one friend you have is who is on a cleanse/gluten free/dairy free diet? I have somewhere for you to take them now where the food is good, and there&#39;s lots to choose from.<br><br>I must warn you it takes a minute. Because the food is raw, often that means making things from scratch since you can only do so much prep. Keep in mind the key to creating wonderful raw dishes is that the food will mimic other textures and to create these textures it takes a minute. So if you know that, then you won&#39;t make bitchy-resting face while waiting for your order. It&#39;s not that they take long; fast food has just ruined people for waiting for quality. The wait is worth it. Trust.<br><br>The must-try is the kale caesar salad and the Zuhgetti is a favourite. Be sure to give the mermaid smoothie a go, too. And then pick up some nice produce and take it home with you for later. You&#39;ll be happy you fed your body with good food.",

I would agree with other reviewers who say to grab a piece of whatever is coming out of the oven if you are able. I ate a fresh-out-of-the-oven slice of plain cheese pizza last Friday and it was sooo good. The crust is nice and thin and there is barely any grease to be seen...if there is a spot of grease, it would only be from a topping like cheese or pepperoni. If you eat in, be sure to use some of the garlic ranch sauce for your crust.<br><br>I also find the service really friendly! <br><br>While I have not tried the whole pizzas, I can tell you that the next time my friends want to order pizza downtown for takeout or delivery, this will be my recommendation. I&#39;d love to try some of the more gourmet combinations.",

"reviewcomment":"I was totally blown away by their food &amp; service last night! my S/O suggested this place as it was in the neighbourhood but I hadn&#39;t been there before. We decided on take out. So I called in our order, and the gentlemen who answered the phone was SO friendly and attentive (which is not the case sometimes at other restaurants when you call to place an order) and told me about 10 - 15 minutes. When I went to pick up the order I was greeted very politely by the staff, and told it would be just a moment and offered a drink while I waited.  Every interaction I had with a staff member was done politely, professional, and welcoming. The place was bustling for a Friday night... but everyone seemed to be on their A-game and happy to be there. <br>I got my food and took it home. <br><br>We ordered a prawn souvlaki and a chicken souvlaki. the food was carefully packaged and divided. They have a unique take-a-way tray that has individual portioned areas for the rice, vegetables, protein/potatoes. they had a separate container for the Greek salad, and another one for the tzakiki. Let me just say this... everything was awesome but the roasted potatoes blew me away. I have NEVER tasted roasted potatoes that were so good in my life. I don&#39;t know what your secret is but they were phenomenal (and I don&#39;t even usually like potatoes too much). Over all it was delicious. Portion sizes were fabulous (I have a little leftover for lunch today.. excited!), and the food was yummy! <br><br>Will definitely be back!!",

"reviewcomment":"I have been going to the North Vancouver location with my family for a long long time. However with Cazba opening up a downtown Vancouver location, it&#39;s just more convenient for me to go here now. <br><br>Compared to it&#39;s North Van counterpart, this Cazba actually has quite a nice and hip interior, and it has a great patio! The food is identical to NV&#39;s Cazba, and every time we go here (which is A LOT) the food is consistent and satisfying. <br><br>I usually get the Vaziri, which includes the joojeh and koobideh kebab skewers, rice, some peppers, and a grilled tomato. I find the food to be very tasty and the portions are huge; when I go out with a big group we always have to take the food home. Finally the price is really great, considering the portions. The Vaziri, which is about $11 can feed 1 and probably even 2 people! <br><br>*For the people complaining about the rice being too bland, they actually have another type, which costs a couple bucks more but is much more flavourful. I forget the name, but I&#39;m sure if you ask your server they will know. <br><br>The service on the other hand is a bit of a hit and miss; I think North Van&#39;s usually has better service. I&#39;ve been to Cazba and had really great service, but they can also be slightly rude and inattentive. Maybe do take out if you&#39;re one of those that can be put off easily by anything less than 5 star service. <br><br>So I would have given this Cazba a 5, but I&#39;ve docked them a star, because they really need to work on making their customer service consistent. <br><br>Overall good, cheap, and satisfying Persian food!",

The fries and bacon are served crisp, and the eggs in any style you want. It&#39;s not fancy. It&#39;s down-home, simple cooking that&#39;s filling and inexpensive. I&#39;ve had everything from the Gyros to the Burgers but I keep on coming back for that simple bacon and egg breakfast, with coffee and a glass of water. Under ten dollars, unlimited coffee and water service, with meaty bacon and perfectly cooked eggs? To me, this is the perfect start to an indulgent Saturday morning. One that I fully intend to have again. <br><br>Additionally, unlike some of the other all-day-breakfast places in towns, I&#39;ve never gotten sick from the food here. It&#39;s usually awesome. However, every once and awhile, on the super busy days I have received some less than excellent food. I understand that not every day is a perfect day. And you know, I forgive Helens, I really do. It&#39;s a rarity that I do not leave full and happy, ready to tackle a day full of adventure. Or maybe a nap on the couch.",

"reviewcomment":"I was totally blown away by their food &amp; service last night! my S/O suggested this place as it was in the neighbourhood but I hadn&#39;t been there before. We decided on take out. So I called in our order, and the gentlemen who answered the phone was SO friendly and attentive (which is not the case sometimes at other restaurants when you call to place an order) and told me about 10 - 15 minutes. When I went to pick up the order I was greeted very politely by the staff, and told it would be just a moment and offered a drink while I waited.  Every interaction I had with a staff member was done politely, professional, and welcoming. The place was bustling for a Friday night... but everyone seemed to be on their A-game and happy to be there. <br>I got my food and took it home. <br><br>We ordered a prawn souvlaki and a chicken souvlaki. the food was carefully packaged and divided. They have a unique take-a-way tray that has individual portioned areas for the rice, vegetables, protein/potatoes. they had a separate container for the Greek salad, and another one for the tzakiki. Let me just say this... everything was awesome but the roasted potatoes blew me away. I have NEVER tasted roasted potatoes that were so good in my life. I don&#39;t know what your secret is but they were phenomenal (and I don&#39;t even usually like potatoes too much). Over all it was delicious. Portion sizes were fabulous (I have a little leftover for lunch today.. excited!), and the food was yummy! <br><br>Will definitely be back!!",

Topped off with a chocolate mousse.  <br><br>I can&#39;t wait to get back to the shore and take the pleasure of eating here again. <br>A few other things-<br>Prices are very reasonable and definitely try some local BC wines and beers.",

"reviewcomment":"O.M.G. <br><br>As Edible Flours pops up in my places I have been and yelp is prompting me to review I remember why I love Vancouver so much. Why Vancouver is trying to steal my heart that Hawaii holds so dear. Vancouver has so many vegan friendly options and on both my trips this summer to Vancouver I made sure to try as many of them as I could. <br><br>Edible Flours I tried on my second trip to Vancouver. Lucky for me it was within a mile of where I was staying. So I used my handy dandy yelp - mapped the directions, checked the hours and off I went. I walked around the block, because I truly stink at finding locations even with a map. It is embarrassing, I know. My husband gives me a hard time each and every time I have to navigate (But yet he still lets me navigate.... Geez). This time though, I didn&#39;t have him with me to correct my poor navigation skills. Hence why I walked around the block. Ooops. <br><br>When I finally found It I was so excited. I love dessert and even better this was dessert that followed how I eat! <br><br>Cue disappointment music. <br><br>They were closed. They were gone for vacation. I might have considered crying. This was my ONLY day I was going to be done with training (The real reason I was in Vancouver the second time was training for work!) while they were still open. And I just walked a mile for no reason and I had to make the trek back to the condo empty handed. <br><br>Fail. <br><br>Fast forward a couple days. <br><br>I finished my work training almost 2 full days early so what did that leave time for??? Edible Flours! I walked my butt off from training to Edible Flours the day I got done early (2.5 miles from where I was training to amazing eats)... And I did it because I remembered the sign on the door saying they would be open and back from vacation! YAY!<br><br>I am SO glad I did. Service was very friendly. I ordered multiple items - some I ate right then in the café others I took with me to chow down on when I got back to the condo. <br><br>Everything I had was amazing. I would go back again and take one of everything. My pocket book wishes I was kidding. Next time I&#39;m in Vancouver I guarantee I will be back.",

"reviewcomment":"I was totally blown away by their food &amp; service last night! my S/O suggested this place as it was in the neighbourhood but I hadn&#39;t been there before. We decided on take out. So I called in our order, and the gentlemen who answered the phone was SO friendly and attentive (which is not the case sometimes at other restaurants when you call to place an order) and told me about 10 - 15 minutes. When I went to pick up the order I was greeted very politely by the staff, and told it would be just a moment and offered a drink while I waited.  Every interaction I had with a staff member was done politely, professional, and welcoming. The place was bustling for a Friday night... but everyone seemed to be on their A-game and happy to be there. <br>I got my food and took it home. <br><br>We ordered a prawn souvlaki and a chicken souvlaki. the food was carefully packaged and divided. They have a unique take-a-way tray that has individual portioned areas for the rice, vegetables, protein/potatoes. they had a separate container for the Greek salad, and another one for the tzakiki. Let me just say this... everything was awesome but the roasted potatoes blew me away. I have NEVER tasted roasted potatoes that were so good in my life. I don&#39;t know what your secret is but they were phenomenal (and I don&#39;t even usually like potatoes too much). Over all it was delicious. Portion sizes were fabulous (I have a little leftover for lunch today.. excited!), and the food was yummy! <br><br>Will definitely be back!!",

Although renovated, it could use another modern facelift, but no amount of renovation will change the low ceilings.<br><br>I can only comment on dim sum since I have not been for dinner, and I have to say that it is quite worthy of a visit, simply for its value. The bill came to ~$80 for 7 people, and we gorged ourselves on shrimp dumplings, veggie dumplings, pea shoots, noodles, turnip cake, scallop and shrimp dumplings, pork dumpling, mango pudding, and their sesame ball dessert (highly recommended btw). We had leftovers to take away and although I would avoid the pork / football dumpling next time, I would definitely revisit!",

We did a mini-poutine crawl and this place really hit all points of foodie bliss. The morsels of goodness were like little angels that spread their wings and flew me to heaven in the quick 5 minutes we inhaled this dish. The gravy is flavorful and satisfying, french fry texture was on point and the &#34;squinky noise&#34; of the cheese curds were legit.<br><br>Sure, the staff isn&#39;t great and it looks like a fast food stop for pizza but don&#39;t bypass and make a quick pit stop.<br><br>In all seriousness, this place is on my TO DO list once I&#39;m back in B.C. and if you live local to spot, well god bless your little hearts.... seriously.... you&#39;d probably have to pry me away from this place.",

"reviewcomment":"I was totally blown away by their food &amp; service last night! my S/O suggested this place as it was in the neighbourhood but I hadn&#39;t been there before. We decided on take out. So I called in our order, and the gentlemen who answered the phone was SO friendly and attentive (which is not the case sometimes at other restaurants when you call to place an order) and told me about 10 - 15 minutes. When I went to pick up the order I was greeted very politely by the staff, and told it would be just a moment and offered a drink while I waited.  Every interaction I had with a staff member was done politely, professional, and welcoming. The place was bustling for a Friday night... but everyone seemed to be on their A-game and happy to be there. <br>I got my food and took it home. <br><br>We ordered a prawn souvlaki and a chicken souvlaki. the food was carefully packaged and divided. They have a unique take-a-way tray that has individual portioned areas for the rice, vegetables, protein/potatoes. they had a separate container for the Greek salad, and another one for the tzakiki. Let me just say this... everything was awesome but the roasted potatoes blew me away. I have NEVER tasted roasted potatoes that were so good in my life. I don&#39;t know what your secret is but they were phenomenal (and I don&#39;t even usually like potatoes too much). Over all it was delicious. Portion sizes were fabulous (I have a little leftover for lunch today.. excited!), and the food was yummy! <br><br>Will definitely be back!!",

I&#39;m no vegetarian, but if I had to eat that everyday for the rest of my life, I&#39;d be a happy lady. The Ramen w/Pork Shoulder was good too, but the Ramen w/Squash will have a special place in my heart now.<br><br>I&#39;m actually currently salivating just thinking about it. <br><br>So why am I not giving them 5 stars?<br><br>I came in one Friday afternoon for lunch craving for that delicious Ramen w/Squash bowl but was told they ran out of ramen!! I was so heartbroken. I stood there sad and confused and finally decided to try the Rice Noodle w/hazelnut, smoked chili and greens. It was not that good. I was expecting it to be soupy, but it was more saucy. And I found the sauce a bit too salty for my liking.<br><br>And I still can&#39;t get over waiting 15-20 minutes for a bowl of ramen especially during a quick work lunch break. But I&#39;ve learned to peek inside first and see if people have already gotten their noodle bowls or if they&#39;re still waiting. If they&#39;re mostly still waiting for their food I might be tempted to eat elsewhere. Maybe.",

"reviewcomment":"I was totally blown away by their food &amp; service last night! my S/O suggested this place as it was in the neighbourhood but I hadn&#39;t been there before. We decided on take out. So I called in our order, and the gentlemen who answered the phone was SO friendly and attentive (which is not the case sometimes at other restaurants when you call to place an order) and told me about 10 - 15 minutes. When I went to pick up the order I was greeted very politely by the staff, and told it would be just a moment and offered a drink while I waited.  Every interaction I had with a staff member was done politely, professional, and welcoming. The place was bustling for a Friday night... but everyone seemed to be on their A-game and happy to be there. <br>I got my food and took it home. <br><br>We ordered a prawn souvlaki and a chicken souvlaki. the food was carefully packaged and divided. They have a unique take-a-way tray that has individual portioned areas for the rice, vegetables, protein/potatoes. they had a separate container for the Greek salad, and another one for the tzakiki. Let me just say this... everything was awesome but the roasted potatoes blew me away. I have NEVER tasted roasted potatoes that were so good in my life. I don&#39;t know what your secret is but they were phenomenal (and I don&#39;t even usually like potatoes too much). Over all it was delicious. Portion sizes were fabulous (I have a little leftover for lunch today.. excited!), and the food was yummy! <br><br>Will definitely be back!!",

"reviewcomment":"Wow! Totally amazing sushi and service. Everything was incredibly fresh. We tried the Unagi Don, appetizer tempura, miso soup, BC Roll, avocado roll, crispy roll, and negitoro roll.<br><br>Firstly, the presentation was beautiful and came with a side green salad. Here are a few things that I noted:<br><br>-The avocado in the avocado roll was cut up into more pieces and more thinly than I am used to but tasted good.<br>-The BC roll felt more like a California roll with added salmon skin. The salmon skin was nice because it wasn&#39;t just skin, it had a thin strip to salmon too!<br>-The negitoro roll was amazing. They use extremely fresh tuna instead of less than fresh, mushed up tuna.<br>-crispy roll: very filling and the crispy part was yummy yet light. <br>-the tempura was perfect with a very light tempura batter and a perfectly cooked sweet potato, broccoli, and shrimp. Not too greasy!<br><br>The space is clean, spacious, and bright. It&#39;s not extremely big but they have a nice space where they can accommodate 6 people, or pull together tables for bigger groups.m",

We&#39;ve been there twice in the 4 days we&#39;ve been here.  Some comments on specific items:<br>Chicken Satay has perfect flavour and tenderness.<br>Veggie spring rolls were loved by all.  Crisp, not too greasy, great flavour.<br>Pad Thai was absolutely perfect the first time, a bit too much sauce the second visit.<br>Ginger Chicken (Gai Pad Khing) was exceptional.  Perfect flavour.<br>Yellow curry was also great: good heat, great flavour, lots of meat.<br><br>We will be going again, and again, and again...",

The beef tenderloin with arugula salad is tender, juicy, and perfectly cooked. The pastas are mouth watering they are not your average buttery mess they are delicately made with the love and care that you would expect from a home cooked italian meal. Service was very good during our visit with the waiters always being on top of things. This is my favourite Italian restaurant in Van City and it should wear these 5 stars i am giving it with pride because it deserves them.<br><br>Tips: Ask for the Fettuccine Buongustaio al oleo instead of the cream based sauce, Any pizza is extremely good, and try the Filet Mignon with arugula salad.",

There was also ice cream at the end. <br><br>The chefs didn&#39;t give much of a performance, but I had lots to talk about with my friend and didn&#39;t mind the lack of a show. Our chef did often acknowledge us with a polite smile when she served us our food, and the servers came often to fill up our waters.<br><br>My friend and I both have small appetites, so we were pretty satisfied with the portion. I did enjoy the noise level being low for us to talk and the seats being not too cramp, even though it was bar style around the cooking grill table. I did notice this was a Chinese run restaurant when I overheard the servers taking down reservations on the phone as I was leaving. I would skip the mint at the door because that was awful tasting.",

"reviewcomment":"Kibo is hip and visually appealing from the moment you step in the door. Arriving at 5:30 we beat the crowd and enjoyed a relaxed dining experience. Our server was helpful and friendly, even when she knew we were using a Groupon. We shared a Tranquility cocktail that was delicious and refreshing - especially for $6. There seem to be a lot of sushi options in Vancouver so there&#39;s a lot of competition for business. But we enjoyed Kibo and were glad Groupon led us there.",

"reviewcomment":"There&#39;s been a noticeable shift in this café in the last 6 months, and I&#39;m pretty sure it has something to do with a change in cook or change of owner, I&#39;m not sure.  But yes, noticeable difference!<br><br>Every time I go in now the staff seem to me happy, smiling heaps and more engaged in their jobs.  This morning the girl at the till actually asked me how my new year was going, and I could tell she was genuine.  LOVE THAT. <br><br>Again, I love the diversity here.  There are staff from the Philippines (makes me homesick), New Zealand (makes me more homesick), and a couple accents I can&#39;t place.  <br><br>Lately they&#39;ve been rocking this Beet and Apple salad that has become my weakness.  I eat as much of it as I can as often as I can.  Perfect balance of acidity and freshness, and I adore it.  If you&#39;re in for breakfast, I&#39;d suggest trying their massive muffins.  The morning glory are a little bit out of this world.   I just ate a whole one and am beyond full.  <br><br>I haven&#39;t tried their coffee again in the last while, so can&#39;t really comment on that.  I do know that they switched to JJ Bean coffee, so that&#39;s a plus.  Gotta love us some JJ Bean!<br><br>I would love to see some gluten free and vegetarian/vegan options coming out here, as I would definitely dine here more often if they some",

This is as old school as it gets and within this context it remains my favourite in Vancouver.<br><br>A tad bready but that&#39;s old school. No skimping on the toppings. Cheese, and lots of it, a good homemade sauce, always piping hot when delivered and always delivered in good time. But if you want the true experience go for dine-in. Classic 70&#39;s look to the building, super friendly servers, and an authentic old school vibe. <br><br>If you want the Neapolitan experience, and I often do, head for Via Tevere.

Dharma Kitchen wears its philosophy like a tree wears its leaves; and I respect that.<br><br>I might agree that the options are somewhat limited -- all meals tend to circulate around a common set of ingredients, and readily divide into salad/rice bowl/tempeh burger triad of vegan categories. The style of cooking is a cross between Japanese macrobiotics and contemporary raw-food outlooks. I would have liked somewhat more Chinese/Japanese options in terms of ingredients and cooking styles--I think that would be my one suggestion if I were asked -- dishes with more spice.<br><br>Still, I come here regularly and always leave happy, satisfied, and well-treated. The servers learned my name and take care in using it.<br><br>And, if you read my reviews, you know what I am going to say next. Yep! I&#39;m a transsexual woman and I can say that I am treated with delightful courtesy here (always correct pronouns, non-judgment, etc), and you must understand how much I value.  Unlike the transphobes at Chai Gallery, DK practices what it preaches (health+respect).",

"reviewcomment":"I was totally blown away by their food &amp; service last night! my S/O suggested this place as it was in the neighbourhood but I hadn&#39;t been there before. We decided on take out. So I called in our order, and the gentlemen who answered the phone was SO friendly and attentive (which is not the case sometimes at other restaurants when you call to place an order) and told me about 10 - 15 minutes. When I went to pick up the order I was greeted very politely by the staff, and told it would be just a moment and offered a drink while I waited.  Every interaction I had with a staff member was done politely, professional, and welcoming. The place was bustling for a Friday night... but everyone seemed to be on their A-game and happy to be there. <br>I got my food and took it home. <br><br>We ordered a prawn souvlaki and a chicken souvlaki. the food was carefully packaged and divided. They have a unique take-a-way tray that has individual portioned areas for the rice, vegetables, protein/potatoes. they had a separate container for the Greek salad, and another one for the tzakiki. Let me just say this... everything was awesome but the roasted potatoes blew me away. I have NEVER tasted roasted potatoes that were so good in my life. I don&#39;t know what your secret is but they were phenomenal (and I don&#39;t even usually like potatoes too much). Over all it was delicious. Portion sizes were fabulous (I have a little leftover for lunch today.. excited!), and the food was yummy! <br><br>Will definitely be back!!",

Ladies if you get the complementary passes or put yourself on guest list you are free to get in. The music was good, top 40, house, rnb, trance... All of it. A little squishy cuz it&#39;s downstairs but I&#39;m sure if you hit up the upper level it&#39;s more airy. No one was really dancing at some point (a lot I bachelorette parties) and I&#39;m 5&#39;11 when i put heels on and everyone in the club minus like 2 guys were shorter than me.

I think the guy serving us was running the bar and entire floor and patio, it wasn&#39;t super busy but he really killed it. Our drinks were made with obvious care and his service was genuine. After years in the service industry it becomes so obvious when someone is good at their job and also when they&#39;re not. This guy was a solid (I&#39;m the worst at forgetting names sorry) and made our hungover-hair of the dog dining experience that much more enjoyable. <br><br>I like the place even more now that I realize the meaning behind the name  &#34;Arrive Jekyll.

"reviewcomment":"I was totally blown away by their food &amp; service last night! my S/O suggested this place as it was in the neighbourhood but I hadn&#39;t been there before. We decided on take out. So I called in our order, and the gentlemen who answered the phone was SO friendly and attentive (which is not the case sometimes at other restaurants when you call to place an order) and told me about 10 - 15 minutes. When I went to pick up the order I was greeted very politely by the staff, and told it would be just a moment and offered a drink while I waited.  Every interaction I had with a staff member was done politely, professional, and welcoming. The place was bustling for a Friday night... but everyone seemed to be on their A-game and happy to be there. <br>I got my food and took it home. <br><br>We ordered a prawn souvlaki and a chicken souvlaki. the food was carefully packaged and divided. They have a unique take-a-way tray that has individual portioned areas for the rice, vegetables, protein/potatoes. they had a separate container for the Greek salad, and another one for the tzakiki. Let me just say this... everything was awesome but the roasted potatoes blew me away. I have NEVER tasted roasted potatoes that were so good in my life. I don&#39;t know what your secret is but they were phenomenal (and I don&#39;t even usually like potatoes too much). Over all it was delicious. Portion sizes were fabulous (I have a little leftover for lunch today.. excited!), and the food was yummy! <br><br>Will definitely be back!!",

Reasons are obvious: from the street, &#34;I hope it&#39;s beef, but you&#39;re delicious&#34; tacos in the darkest parts of Mexico City to the delicious, &#34;I hate the weather but it&#39;s worth it&#34; tacos in Hermosillo. I&#39;ve been all through the country in a personal mission to find the best tacos.<br><br>I will not say this place comes close to the best tacos in Mexico. But of all the places I&#39;ve been outside of my home country (including the US), this is food-wise the best. Hands down. That&#39;s it.<br><br>The 4 stars are because each and every single time, the service does not meet expectations. Be it that they don&#39;t answer the phone when trying to order delivery (and yes, I tried and kept trying for like an hour), or they answer in bad mood, or the guy who&#39;s taking orders in-place has a grumpier face than my grandma (and now THAT&#39;S something)...<br><br>So yes, be prepared for a religious-like taco experience that could be beyond perfect if they only worked in their customer service.<br><br>PS - The beans are free.

"reviewcomment":"Finally my best friend took me to Stong&#39;s, the grocery store he used to work at growing up. This was a huge step in our friendship to share a bit of his past with me. We came here in the middle of going to the St.George&#39;s fair &#39;cause we needed some cash back for the fair. I found some British candy for mom for Mother&#39;s Day which was a huge score for me. It&#39;s more of a mom and pop grocery store with character. Organized isles and easy to navigate. They carry the usual suspects of items and some specialty items that I&#39;ve only seen on The Drive. Prices are naturally higher given the type of store, however, still reasonable in comparison to other box chain stores. They carry Butter Baked Goods. I love real marshmallows and although Butter Baked is only a few blocks from my best friends place, they no longer carry Marshmallows there. I now know that I can buy them here.",

"reviewcomment":"I was totally blown away by their food &amp; service last night! my S/O suggested this place as it was in the neighbourhood but I hadn&#39;t been there before. We decided on take out. So I called in our order, and the gentlemen who answered the phone was SO friendly and attentive (which is not the case sometimes at other restaurants when you call to place an order) and told me about 10 - 15 minutes. When I went to pick up the order I was greeted very politely by the staff, and told it would be just a moment and offered a drink while I waited.  Every interaction I had with a staff member was done politely, professional, and welcoming. The place was bustling for a Friday night... but everyone seemed to be on their A-game and happy to be there. <br>I got my food and took it home. <br><br>We ordered a prawn souvlaki and a chicken souvlaki. the food was carefully packaged and divided. They have a unique take-a-way tray that has individual portioned areas for the rice, vegetables, protein/potatoes. they had a separate container for the Greek salad, and another one for the tzakiki. Let me just say this... everything was awesome but the roasted potatoes blew me away. I have NEVER tasted roasted potatoes that were so good in my life. I don&#39;t know what your secret is but they were phenomenal (and I don&#39;t even usually like potatoes too much). Over all it was delicious. Portion sizes were fabulous (I have a little leftover for lunch today.. excited!), and the food was yummy! <br><br>Will definitely be back!!",

Only a few seats with no ambiance but at least spotlessly clean. <br><br>I ordered a seafood ramen and chicken satay for a grand total of 18.50 and the food was not what I imagined - their portions were snack size (as someone else mentioned) I was definitely not half way full so I had to get something else to eat afterwards.  Their ingredients are fresh, presentation is good, and the ratio of ingredients is right, but like what another reviewer said, it&#39;s bland, but no penalty taken as it is supposed to be healthy.  Fortunately in my case I like bland food as well. <br><br>I feel I could&#39;ve easily prepared the ramen and satays at home for a more economical price as it was nothing special.  <br><br>Will come back if portions are larger. Here in Vancouver you can get a good bowl of noodles 3 times the quantity for just 8 dollars.",

"reviewcomment":"La Buca has been our our list of places to try for years, finally made a reservation after seeing yet another VanMag award.<br><br>Fantastic food, the clam risotto was by far the best I&#39;ve ever had, excellent wine suggestions, the Negroni with blood orange was sublime. The prawns were cooked to perfection, even the cappuccinos were lovely.<br><br>If I have to find fault, yes the room is a bit cold when people come and go, with the room as small as it is it&#39;s understandable however.<br><br>Addressing  what some other reviewers faulted: personally I was not bothered by the unremarkable cutlery, though I understand how that could ruin an evening. Also, the comments about switcheroo horsemeat and not having a proper bar are both untrue.",

"reviewcomment":"I was totally blown away by their food &amp; service last night! my S/O suggested this place as it was in the neighbourhood but I hadn&#39;t been there before. We decided on take out. So I called in our order, and the gentlemen who answered the phone was SO friendly and attentive (which is not the case sometimes at other restaurants when you call to place an order) and told me about 10 - 15 minutes. When I went to pick up the order I was greeted very politely by the staff, and told it would be just a moment and offered a drink while I waited.  Every interaction I had with a staff member was done politely, professional, and welcoming. The place was bustling for a Friday night... but everyone seemed to be on their A-game and happy to be there. <br>I got my food and took it home. <br><br>We ordered a prawn souvlaki and a chicken souvlaki. the food was carefully packaged and divided. They have a unique take-a-way tray that has individual portioned areas for the rice, vegetables, protein/potatoes. they had a separate container for the Greek salad, and another one for the tzakiki. Let me just say this... everything was awesome but the roasted potatoes blew me away. I have NEVER tasted roasted potatoes that were so good in my life. I don&#39;t know what your secret is but they were phenomenal (and I don&#39;t even usually like potatoes too much). Over all it was delicious. Portion sizes were fabulous (I have a little leftover for lunch today.. excited!), and the food was yummy! <br><br>Will definitely be back!!",

"reviewcomment":"I ventured out to Chinatown with the family for a dinner at Garden Villa Seafood. The parentals have been talking about this place for a while because of it&#39;s snake soup.  Apparently it&#39;s one of the best in town.  We ordered the &#34;set dinner&#34; for the six of us for $100, after tax but before gratuity.<br><br>The large bowl of snake soup came first and there was enough for at least ten bowls. This is really one of the best winter foods since snake is known, in Chinese medicine, to have heating properties.  I think it did work since it seemed like they had turned on the air conditioning at the restaurant, but I felt quite warm post-soup.  I don&#39;t think there was that much snake inside the soup actually, but I did enjoy the mix of citrus peel, ham, black fungus, and lime leaves on top.<br><br>These looked weird.  The fried dumplings (I guess) filled with chive and shrimp seemed quite yellow -- I guess it was the from the golden-ness of it being fried.  The wrap was quite, and I thought the shrimp lacked the &#34;bounce&#34; and crunch that it needed.<br><br>The fried chicken was not bad, with a decently fried exterior.  However, I found many pieces to be quite salty since it appeared that they sprinkled a generous amount of salt over it.  Not sure why they also gave us a plate of salt separately.<br><br>The lamb in clay pot was pretty good, but not as good as that of Taste Good Wonton House.  The lamb here was not as soft and tender (albeit already quite good) and there was a bit less lamb.  The sauce wasn&#39;t as rich, but still nevertheless good.<br><br>The vegetable dishes, including the stir fried prawn with vegetables and Buddha&#39;s Delight (&#34;luo han zhai&#34;) were quite oily and greasy.  I was not impressed by these, but at least there was black fungus in the latter.<br><br>The stir fried glutinous rice was not bad, but I was already quite full from the two or three bowls of soup (right) and lamb.  I found it weird that it had scrambled egg inside, but apparently this is the way it&#39;s down on the streets of Hong Kong.<br><br>The meal overall was alright. The restaurant itself seemed quite aged and was not fancy.  While the snake soup was good, the vegetable dishes were really oily.  I feel like most people go to Garden Villa only for the snake soup.",

The chef also makes a delicious mushroom based dish for those of you who crave an alternative to the usual vegetarian offerings at Ethiopian restaurants. Service can be a little slower than at other Ethiopian restaurants, but the payoff is that this food is FRESH!",

"reviewcomment":"I had an excellent brunch here last week with my gf who has been raving about the food for months.  The vibe inside is very laidback with hunting cabin-ish decor.  Cozy but more incandescent lighting would help it feel warm &amp; fuzzy.<br><br>I tried the Pinocchio skillet - organic spicy chorizo, sundried tomato, peppers, red onion, smoked gouda and basil.<br><br>What&#39;s also missing from this list is that it comes with 2 eggs (any style) and potato cubes and a balsamic vinaigrette salad!!  I got my eggs scrambled. <br><br>The portion size was perfect and the flavors were incredible!  By far, the best quality breakfast I&#39;ve had in Vancouver for only $15!   My only gripes which I will correct next time is that the skillet was unnecessarily greasy and I think one of my veg substitutions was missed.  That&#39;s okay.  I would definitely recommend asking that the skillet be cooked up without oil, as the chorizo gives off fat and there is probably ample residual grease on the grill.  Common restaurant problem.  Otherwise, it was amazing!<br><br>I will definitely return for this skillet and I want to try things from the dinner menu - perhaps on St Patty&#39;s!!",

"reviewcomment":"I was totally blown away by their food &amp; service last night! my S/O suggested this place as it was in the neighbourhood but I hadn&#39;t been there before. We decided on take out. So I called in our order, and the gentlemen who answered the phone was SO friendly and attentive (which is not the case sometimes at other restaurants when you call to place an order) and told me about 10 - 15 minutes. When I went to pick up the order I was greeted very politely by the staff, and told it would be just a moment and offered a drink while I waited.  Every interaction I had with a staff member was done politely, professional, and welcoming. The place was bustling for a Friday night... but everyone seemed to be on their A-game and happy to be there. <br>I got my food and took it home. <br><br>We ordered a prawn souvlaki and a chicken souvlaki. the food was carefully packaged and divided. They have a unique take-a-way tray that has individual portioned areas for the rice, vegetables, protein/potatoes. they had a separate container for the Greek salad, and another one for the tzakiki. Let me just say this... everything was awesome but the roasted potatoes blew me away. I have NEVER tasted roasted potatoes that were so good in my life. I don&#39;t know what your secret is but they were phenomenal (and I don&#39;t even usually like potatoes too much). Over all it was delicious. Portion sizes were fabulous (I have a little leftover for lunch today.. excited!), and the food was yummy! <br><br>Will definitely be back!!",

"reviewcomment":"Came here with a few friends to grab drinks and snacks in December &#39;13. With $10 triple Long Islands and a location close to UBC, you know it&#39;s going to be a hit with the student clientele-which is exactly the category that we fell under. Our waitress was prompt and attentive. It was a Monday evening and the place was fairly empty, so she was able to seat us right away and made us feel at ease. The Long Islands are large (think enormous beer mugs) and delicious, but definitely do not have thrice the alcohol content as one Long Island. That&#39;s probably a good thing. Oh, and the nachos: those are phenomenal. Liberally stacked with cheese, meat and guacamole, and accompanied by salsa and sour cream, this is a snack-well, to be entirely honest, it turned into a meal for us-worth breaking your diet for. Fortunately, Coppertank is located right on a bus line, so you&#39;re good to go even if you have a couple of drinks too many. I had a good evening out on my visit, but I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;d come back once I stop being a student.",

"reviewcomment":"Cheap Sapporo pitchers and very middle of the road sushi -- I&#39;m down.<br><br>Dropped in on a whim with a friend who was visiting from out of town. We weren&#39;t super hungry, and were mostly just looking for a place to post up and chat over some drinks and a bit of food to accompany it. Nikkyu totally fit the bill. It was quiet when we arrived, and service was brisk and efficient. They didn&#39;t seem to mind that we hung out for a while, and readily split the bill for us at the end. <br><br>They have a pretty comprehensive range of options in terms of food, all of it offered up in that particularly haphazard cheap Vancouver sushi place way, with like three different menus and weird rules that apply differently depending on what time of day it is and DIY specials posters plastered all over the walls. Cleanliness seemed a bit suspect, as there were some huge flies buzzing around, but the yam roll was perfectly acceptable and the beer was cold, and sometimes that&#39;s all you need. Plus, outdoor seating options are always welcome in the warmer months.",

"reviewcomment":"A friend phoned me up to go food shopping at T n T. He took me out for lunch at Fatburger cuz he had a Groupon for the restaurant. <br><br>Overall, it&#39;s ok...  The hamburger meat was juicy the only thing is that the patty seemed a bit small.  It&#39;s like the old Burger King commercial where the little old lady looks down at her hamburger and the bun is huge and the meat patty is small and she says that famous line...&#34;Where&#39;s the beef?&#34;  That what I felt like saying!  Lots of bun and veggies but light on the meat patty!  <br><br>Ok what do you guys think of this?  I&#39;m finished chomping on my burger (or more like I didn&#39;t want to eat all the bun that was left) I wiped my mouth with my napkin and I threw the napkin into the burger basket and I get ready to eat a bit more of my fries.  The store manager who was walking around grabs my tray and dumps everything in the garbage and says thank you!  My friend breaks out laughing and he says you deserve that throwing your napkin means you&#39;re finished your meal!  I said the store manager should have asked me before grabbing my tray!  I still had half the fries left!  Ah as my friend says to me she&#39;s doing you a favor!  You don&#39;t need to eat those extra fries!  Yeah thanks a lot buddy!!!  <br><br>The food is probably 3.5 stars but I&#39;m going to take away .5 of a star cuz I was not allowed to finish my fries!",

The food is your standard pub fare (we were there for appy happy hour so I can&#39;t tell you very much about the entrées.)<br><br>The staff were very friendly and accomodating. I think whoever booked our small party of 30 proboably underestimated how many people would actually be there because we were spilling out of the area they had reserved for us all over the restaurant. The servers would come in, look confused, and then the panic would set in. How were they to find Jayne when she had since moved three different chairs? I directed traffic as best as I could, and eventually the servers, bless them, just started shouting people&#39;s names. I don&#39;t blame them.<br><br>Hot food, cold drinks, interesting conversation in a low ceilinged 80&#39;s style vancouver hide-away restaurant. I liked it. I will def be back.",

"reviewcomment":"Salmon n&#39; Bannock (1128 W. Broadway) is a cozy 30-seat restaurant, offering an upscale twist on Aboriginal food.  Having been in service for four years, I was surprised that Salmon n&#39; Bannock hadn&#39;t shown up on my radar of restaurants to try. Fortunately my friend suggested we check out their $28 3-Course Menu for Dine Out Vancouver 2014, and I enthusiastically agreed because I was looking for a menu option which offered something out of the ordinary, and I certainly consider dishes made with Bison and Elk as something unusual.<br><br>Our meal started off with the Stewed Bison Tart appetizer.  The pastry crust was so incredibly light and flakey and a comforting start like a mini pot pie.<br><br>Next up was the Elk Winter Pie with a red wine reduction, served in a double baked potato jacket.  The insides of the potato had been mashed with garlic (like at The Keg, when you order the delicious garlic mash as your side) then scooped back into the potato skin and back in the oven again for this perfectly baked, slightly browned texture.  The taste is comparable to Shepherd&#39;s Pie, but with a much more creative twist in presentation. A crispy web of cheese topped the dish.<br><br>Bison and Elk just tasted like beef to me.  Especially when covered with a flavourful sauce, I don&#39;t have the culinary sensitivity to distinguish between different types of meat.  Co-owner Inez Cook explained to us that the way the meat is prepared reduced the &#34;gaminess&#34; of what you may expect wild game like Bison and Elk to taste like.  According to Inez, if an animal is stressed prior to being slaughtered, adrenaline flows into their blood, which gives it a less desirable &#34;gamey&#34; taste and a tougher texture.<br><br>Meanwhile, my friend ordered the Bannock Crusted Smoked Sockeye which game with crispy smashed potato, purple slaw, and a sea asparagus tartar sauce.  In order to truly appreciate the flavour of the salmon, try a bite without the tartar sauce.<br><br>Both meals came with bannock and butter, which is an Aboriginal-style scone.<br><br>During our meal, we had the pleasure of meeting Shawna Davis, the newly hired Executive Chef at Salmon n&#39; Bannock.  Talented yet humble, Shawna attributes her first cooking lessons to her Grandmother, years and years before she stepped foot into culinary school.  As this year&#39;s Dine Out Vancouver menu is one of her first official creations, we were impressed by her creativity and mix of flavours and ability to give an upscale and modern twist to something as traditional as salmon and bannock.<br><br>For dessert, we had Chef Shawna&#39;s Jiits Saskatoon Berry Cake, topped with whipped cream and a dollop of berry compote, which was nice because it wasn&#39;t overly sweet.<br><br>I would definitely recommend Salmon n&#39; Bannock for this year&#39;s Dine Out Vancouver Festival.  Beyond that, this would be a great place to bring out of town visitors for a traditional Westcoast Aboriginal meal, yet somewhere which wouldn&#39;t be out of anyone&#39;s comfort zone.",

"reviewcomment":"I was totally blown away by their food &amp; service last night! my S/O suggested this place as it was in the neighbourhood but I hadn&#39;t been there before. We decided on take out. So I called in our order, and the gentlemen who answered the phone was SO friendly and attentive (which is not the case sometimes at other restaurants when you call to place an order) and told me about 10 - 15 minutes. When I went to pick up the order I was greeted very politely by the staff, and told it would be just a moment and offered a drink while I waited.  Every interaction I had with a staff member was done politely, professional, and welcoming. The place was bustling for a Friday night... but everyone seemed to be on their A-game and happy to be there. <br>I got my food and took it home. <br><br>We ordered a prawn souvlaki and a chicken souvlaki. the food was carefully packaged and divided. They have a unique take-a-way tray that has individual portioned areas for the rice, vegetables, protein/potatoes. they had a separate container for the Greek salad, and another one for the tzakiki. Let me just say this... everything was awesome but the roasted potatoes blew me away. I have NEVER tasted roasted potatoes that were so good in my life. I don&#39;t know what your secret is but they were phenomenal (and I don&#39;t even usually like potatoes too much). Over all it was delicious. Portion sizes were fabulous (I have a little leftover for lunch today.. excited!), and the food was yummy! <br><br>Will definitely be back!!",

"reviewcomment":"*Elderly Chinese parents approved*<br><br>After my last debacle here:<br><br><a href='http://www.yelp.ca/biz/deer-garden-signatures-vancouver#hrid:5KXkeuJ_TSwBwDj2CbKaDQ'>yelp.ca/biz/deer-garden-…</a><br><br>I was pretty hesitant for a repeat occurrence at a Northern Chinese styled restaurant with Ederly Chinese Dad who happens to be a Canto-cuisine-o-philic person and as weird as it may be, he dislikes almost everything non-Canto.  Tough person to please.  However, I persevered and it paid off.<br><br>The ace in my pocket was the beef rolls. He likes beef and Hoisin sauce.  Another bonus, they speak Canto and Mando.  That put him right into his comfort zone<br><br>I ventured out of my creature of habit tendencies with this visit.  I ordered a bunch of stuff that I would normally not order at a Northern Chinese joint along with some familiar faces.<br><br>Seafood tofu soup:  This was pretty much a Canto dish<br>Mu-Shu Stir-fried Noodles<br>Beef Rolls<br>Tan-tan Noodles<br>Cilantro Lamb<br>Stir fried Sichuan A-Choy<br>Stir fried Chinese Rice Cakes<br>Threaded Bun Roll - I asked for deep fried and it comes with sweetened condensed milk for dipping.  My daughter licked this one clean.<br><br>Standouts?<br>Mu-shu stir fried noodles:  blade sheared fresh noodles with a gentle, light, clean tasting sauce.  I enjoyed this one very much.<br><br>Cilantro stir fried lamb:  Thinly shaved lamb stir fried with cilantro bean paste and chili flakes.  Not gamey with a hint of heat.<br><br>Sichuan A-Choy:  This is also known as Taiwanese lettuce or sword lettuce.  (thank you Google)  Never had this before and I quite liked it.  Similar texture and taste to romaine lettuce.  I&#39;d order this again.<br><br>All in all, a successful evening with Elderly Chinese parents.  No complaints at all.  They liked the food overall more so than at Deer Garden, even though it was pricier.   Peaceful gets their stamp of approval.  **Sarcastic**  Wow!<br><br>Service was well above average for a Chinese joint, which are infamously known for crappy service.  Very friendly and accommodating.",

"reviewcomment":"Believe the hype - Uncle Fatih&#39;s Pizza is that good.  After hearing about it repeatedly we gave their delivery a try and it was definitely worth it.  We may never go back to those big brands again!<br><br>You can order online right from their website, which is very modern, straight-forward, and easy to use.  No frustrating errors or archaic systems, just a great website with pictures of each pizza and descriptons of what&#39;s on them - and of course the option to build your own.  What&#39;s more - if you build your own, the quoted price includes 5 toppings.  That&#39;s 2-3 toppings more than the competitors usually offer!  I didn&#39;t check to see if sauce and cheese count as toppings, however.  For payment, it allows you to use all major payment methods, even Paypal.  The Abbott Street location was the closest to us and their closing time was shown as 2 am, which is pretty good, although for late-night deliveries you have to call in orders.<br><br>We ordered some classic standards for the first try, opting to save the specialties for next time.  They had no pre-made deluxe, so I decided to add some pepperoni to a vegetarian pizza.  The meat-lovers and veggie-lovers arrived in about half an hour, still hot and fresh and smelling delicious.  The delivery guy was very kind and polite and even made a point to thank me specifically for the tip, which was nice.  He was really touting the pizza, telling me I was going to love it, and it&#39;s not just because he works there, it really is that good.  But of course he would say that, right?<br><br>Well, he wasn&#39;t just saying that.  It was great!  At first glance it looks like one of your el-cheapo Granville Street specials, however once you bite in you realize it&#39;s a lot better than those others.  The crust was nice and hot and crispy on the outside, chewy on the inside just the way I like it.  Sometimes I get a certain craving for the practically deep-fried crusts of the Hut, but Uncle Fatih&#39;s is about as perfect as a regular non-thin, non-deep-dish crust can get.  Bonus, they use sesame seeds on the outside.  The toppings were perfectly fresh and high-quality, chopped finer than I&#39;m used to but that&#39;s no drawback.  The sauce was generous, so there&#39;s no need to ask for extra.<br><br>Speaking of sauces, they have an assortment of dipping ones like most pizza places.  We opted for hot sauce and ranch.  The ranch was standard, the hot was HOT.  Maybe a little too hot.  But there are a bunch of options so we&#39;ll try something else next time.<br><br>Sadly, they forgot the pepperoni I wanted added to my veggie pizza.  Or we forgot it, I&#39;m not sure.  We originally started ordering extra larges but decided to downsize to large, and I have a feeling it reset the add-ons when we did that.  Or they forgot it, who knows.<br><br>Price-wise, it was definitely competitive.  They had a promo for two larges, and were definitely large, and with the extra sauces it came to about $43 after tax and a generous tip.  To me, two large pizzas under $40 is a pretty sweet deal.  Sometimes the big names have some crazy cheap promos or of course there&#39;s always Granville Street, but I can definitely live with that price for two hot, fresh, quality pizzas delivered to my door.  We will most definitely be ordering from Uncle Fatih&#39;s again!",

"reviewcomment":"My husband and I ate there a few evenings ago (June 4, 2014), and maybe the management has changed since all the negative reviews I&#39;ve been reading, but it was well above average, I&#39;d say. Despite the fact that the place was very busy at the time and the waitress, by her own admission, was new and inexperienced at that place, she patiently took our rather complicated allergy instructions and checked with the chefs or whoever. No extra charge. Only minus was that my husband ordered brown rice for his (mayonnaise, garlic, and sesame-free) Vancouver and Hawaii roles, which was forgotten. The extra charge for brown rice was waived with no problem, though. And the tuna sashimi on my tuna don was lovely and a generous portion, so we both shared our orders, and enjoyed the free hot tea. A sustaining and tasty meal for only around $22 for the two of us. I&#39;ll definitely be back.",

"reviewcomment":"I was totally blown away by their food &amp; service last night! my S/O suggested this place as it was in the neighbourhood but I hadn&#39;t been there before. We decided on take out. So I called in our order, and the gentlemen who answered the phone was SO friendly and attentive (which is not the case sometimes at other restaurants when you call to place an order) and told me about 10 - 15 minutes. When I went to pick up the order I was greeted very politely by the staff, and told it would be just a moment and offered a drink while I waited.  Every interaction I had with a staff member was done politely, professional, and welcoming. The place was bustling for a Friday night... but everyone seemed to be on their A-game and happy to be there. <br>I got my food and took it home. <br><br>We ordered a prawn souvlaki and a chicken souvlaki. the food was carefully packaged and divided. They have a unique take-a-way tray that has individual portioned areas for the rice, vegetables, protein/potatoes. they had a separate container for the Greek salad, and another one for the tzakiki. Let me just say this... everything was awesome but the roasted potatoes blew me away. I have NEVER tasted roasted potatoes that were so good in my life. I don&#39;t know what your secret is but they were phenomenal (and I don&#39;t even usually like potatoes too much). Over all it was delicious. Portion sizes were fabulous (I have a little leftover for lunch today.. excited!), and the food was yummy! <br><br>Will definitely be back!!",

"reviewcomment":"Good greasy spoon diner.  Excellent value - decent food, big portions at a good price.  Smoked salmon omelette was very filling but that was because it not only had salmon but lots of mushrooms and peppers as well.  Though I liked the veg I think it took away from the signature ingredient being the salmon.  Daily special of pancakes, eggs and hashbrowns were excellent.  Nice crispy outer edge to the two thick pancakes and nice French fried hashbrowns.  The eggs benny with hashbrowns was also good but would have liked a bit more hollandaisse sauce.<br><br>Glad that they institute a policy of placing your order at the counter before finding your seating.  This helps to regulate the flow.  Found it more organized to find an appropriate seating arrangement in a relatively small and very busy establishment.<br><br>Would definitely return cause love the feel (very basic but it works), the food and the coffee was ok as well.  But still don&#39;t know if they have washrooms ;)",

"reviewcomment":"Yes...be as it may I didn&#39;t want to have to be in a long lineup trying to get a table for mother&#39;s day dinner.  I also didn&#39;t want to have to sit at a table for a number of hours to wait for my food to come out due to the mass hysteria of people eating out at all the local restaurants really.  So where did I go?  Grabbed take-out from this wonderful place my sister always told me about and it did not disappoint.<br><br>  For just the 3 of us we ordered a side order of Uni Sushi (one of my mom&#39;s favourite) and the notoriously good (cause I loved everything in it...none of that..oh there is a certain item in that tray that I don&#39;t like or eat etc) Fujiyama tray.<br><br>  Since we ordered it the day before we had the 10% off deal.  Service was great from when I placed the order over phone to showing up and paying in person. (compliments to the cashier staff there)<br><br>  All of us found all items great and fresh.  Only minor downside though was that we were all quite thirsty afterwards...we can only assume there was some sort of msg in the soy sauce (not in packet form) that was provided? (Since we used very little soy sauce I can&#39;t fathom what else it could&#39;ve been except the warm weather?)<br><br>  Price point wise, quality food and great service will definitely help me make a decision easier next time I need take-out.  Move over Samurai Pizza Cats...here comes Samurai Sushi!

This is where you go when you are hungry and pay $5.95 for a perfectly good tasting 18 piece lunch special that will not take 2 hours to get to your table.<br><br>As I often say in many of my reviews, I am sure they had their &#39;not-so-bright&#39; moments.

"reviewcomment":"I was totally blown away by their food &amp; service last night! my S/O suggested this place as it was in the neighbourhood but I hadn&#39;t been there before. We decided on take out. So I called in our order, and the gentlemen who answered the phone was SO friendly and attentive (which is not the case sometimes at other restaurants when you call to place an order) and told me about 10 - 15 minutes. When I went to pick up the order I was greeted very politely by the staff, and told it would be just a moment and offered a drink while I waited.  Every interaction I had with a staff member was done politely, professional, and welcoming. The place was bustling for a Friday night... but everyone seemed to be on their A-game and happy to be there. <br>I got my food and took it home. <br><br>We ordered a prawn souvlaki and a chicken souvlaki. the food was carefully packaged and divided. They have a unique take-a-way tray that has individual portioned areas for the rice, vegetables, protein/potatoes. they had a separate container for the Greek salad, and another one for the tzakiki. Let me just say this... everything was awesome but the roasted potatoes blew me away. I have NEVER tasted roasted potatoes that were so good in my life. I don&#39;t know what your secret is but they were phenomenal (and I don&#39;t even usually like potatoes too much). Over all it was delicious. Portion sizes were fabulous (I have a little leftover for lunch today.. excited!), and the food was yummy! <br><br>Will definitely be back!!",

I found out you can get eggs poached hard and I was in. <br><br>So a friend said this place makes awesome eggs benny and after a hard night we had to go refuel. I was ready to try this oh-so-popular breakfast for my first time.<br><br>The meal didn&#39;t look huge but I couldn&#39;t finish it - and I was raised to finish my plate - the pan fried potatoes were soo good!<br><br>He got some massive breakfast and it came with the most darling toast. Swirls of Rye and Multigrain mmm ...<br><br>The place is pretty small and closes early at 4- i think - everyday. <br><br>So be ready to get squishy and drink out of plastic cups. And leave a happy, full, camper.<br><br>A nap just down the road at the beach may be in order after this fulfilling meal ;) so bring a blankie",

"reviewcomment":"I still remember the small old Safeway that used to sit at this location with the two big parking lots, gone is that old small supermarket that was showing it&#39;s age, and you have this big thing sitting on the corner of Robson and Denman. I like the layout of this store, as it is located in downtown, one might think it would be tough to come to this location, not so with the free parking on the main level, it&#39;s not underground and you go up some long escalators to get to this grocery store.<br><br>When you enter you see the floral department, quite a good selection, considering this is a Safeway. Their produce side is sectioned off quite nicely, as with most of the newer Safeways the floor is this dark wood like finish and it&#39;s nicely seperated also with a small organic area (for the food concious). The cooked (prepared) food area is pretty plentiful, whether you have to buy a cooked chicken to take home (or to a party/gathering) or wanting to buy something for yourself to eat, they have it right here, and some seating too. The isles are pretty wide, as two carts can pass at ease with people walking through and you won&#39;t feel cramped. Your normal Safeway with a big butcher department, bakery, seafood, pharmacy, it&#39;s got everything you need in a store like this, and lots of selection.<br><br>From your self serve kiosks, to your people manned ones, this store was built to handle a load of people, unfortunately I never see a load of people shopping here. I have seen people bring their change to have the sorting machine sort their pennies, and quarters, people come in to rent from the Redbox. When you finish shopping, the one thing they always seem to ask, and they will do, is if you need a hand with your groceries to your car, I have never used this service, but I have seen people who have, it&#39;s always nice to know there is this service.<br><br>I think this is a great location, as not everyday you can afford to shop at Whole Paycheque (Foods) and you need options. And whether your in a people dealing mood, or not, you can self checkout and get out of here.",

"reviewcomment":"I was totally blown away by their food &amp; service last night! my S/O suggested this place as it was in the neighbourhood but I hadn&#39;t been there before. We decided on take out. So I called in our order, and the gentlemen who answered the phone was SO friendly and attentive (which is not the case sometimes at other restaurants when you call to place an order) and told me about 10 - 15 minutes. When I went to pick up the order I was greeted very politely by the staff, and told it would be just a moment and offered a drink while I waited.  Every interaction I had with a staff member was done politely, professional, and welcoming. The place was bustling for a Friday night... but everyone seemed to be on their A-game and happy to be there. <br>I got my food and took it home. <br><br>We ordered a prawn souvlaki and a chicken souvlaki. the food was carefully packaged and divided. They have a unique take-a-way tray that has individual portioned areas for the rice, vegetables, protein/potatoes. they had a separate container for the Greek salad, and another one for the tzakiki. Let me just say this... everything was awesome but the roasted potatoes blew me away. I have NEVER tasted roasted potatoes that were so good in my life. I don&#39;t know what your secret is but they were phenomenal (and I don&#39;t even usually like potatoes too much). Over all it was delicious. Portion sizes were fabulous (I have a little leftover for lunch today.. excited!), and the food was yummy! <br><br>Will definitely be back!!",

"reviewcomment":"[Award for Value]<br><br>If you want a cheap hearty meal, look no further. Golden Oscar&#39;s is a budget-friendly no-frills Hong Kong style cafe providing decent food at a great price. <br><br>The food quality here is pretty decent as far as HK cafes go. My current fave is the Chicken and mushroom chow mein. The portions are huge (I suggest sharing unless you just ran a marathon), nice and crispy on the outside, saucy on the inside, and topped with Bok choy. (Most items here are pretty greasy or MSG-laden) At a mere $9.50 with a drink and soup, that&#39;s tough to beat. This dish is part of an extensive list of set meals which are similarly priced including a drink and soup. My other favorite here is the chicken or beef curries. During happy hour (before 5pm and after 9pm), a snack sized (regular sized for most people) menu comes available with prices ranging from $5-7 with a drink.<br><br> What&#39;s odd about this place is the decor. There&#39;s random movie posters from decades past strewn about the dining room - Casablanca, My fair lady, Braveheart. I mean, who wouldn&#39;t want a young (relevant) Mel Gibson staring at them while they down their fried rice? At least they got it right - all of the movie posters had won an oscar at one point or another. <br><br>The service here is typical of a HK cafe. &#34;Efficient&#34; is the word I&#39;d use to describe it. The servers speak enough english to get by and are friendly enough.<br><br>So if you&#39;re in the neighborhood looking for a casual meal at a great price, you may want to consider Oscar&#39;s. I tend to drop by after a good workout or a day of sports - I take the leftovers for breakfast. Keep in mind it&#39;s cash only.",

We decided on take out. So I called in our order, and the gentlemen who answered the phone was SO friendly and attentive (which is not the case sometimes at other restaurants when you call to place an order) and told me about 10 - 15 minutes. When I went to pick up the order I was greeted very politely by the staff, and told it would be just a moment and offered a drink while I waited.  Every interaction I had with a staff member was done politely, professional, and welcoming. The place was bustling for a Friday night... but everyone seemed to be on their A-game and happy to be there. <br>I got my food and took it home. <br><br>We ordered a prawn souvlaki and a chicken souvlaki. the food was carefully packaged and divided. They have a unique take-a-way tray that has individual portioned areas for the rice, vegetables, protein/potatoes. they had a separate container for the Greek salad, and another one for the tzakiki. Let me just say this... everything was awesome but the roasted potatoes blew me away. I have NEVER tasted roasted potatoes that were so good in my life. I don&#39;t know what your secret is but they were phenomenal (and I don&#39;t even usually like potatoes too much). Over all it was delicious. Portion sizes were fabulous (I have a little leftover for lunch today.. excited!), and the food was yummy! <br><br>Will definitely be back!!",

I was a bit hesitant after reading Joshua&#39;s review, but it was recommended a few time by friends so we stopped by for lunch as a group of 7.<br><br>They seemed a bit flustered when we arrived since we were so many people, but they got through us at a surprisingly decent speed. I ordered the Vancouver Roll (real crab meat and avocado, salmon and tobiko on top) and the volcano roll (tuna and crab meat, deep fried with spicy sauce on top). <br><br>Other items that were ordered was the New Mexico Roll (jalapeno peppers mixed into a sushi roll), black cod cheeks, awesome roll, lunch specials, cheese gyozas, chicken karaage. The food was all good but people said the New Mexico Roll wasn&#39;t as spicy as they were hoping for (even though the sign said super spicy, and the server said super spicy). I thoroughly enjoyed my two rolls, and the prices were decent as well.<br><br>A good option to stop by for a lunch if you&#39;re around :) You can get here by taking the 14 or 16, or walking a bit form the 135.

"reviewcomment":"Great location in the heart of the Olympic Village and right by False Creek, it can get pretty chaotic on the weekends, but I always enjoy the people watching.<br><br>This was only my second time here, but I had to write a review because their customer service was so on point. I had ordered a portobello mushroom and goat cheese salad and my friend had ordered a margherita pizza. The pizza arrived first, which made us wonder why my salad was taking so long. But we soon realized that they had made a mistake and thought that I had ordered a portobello mushroom pizza instead of the salad. When the server came over with the mushroom pizza, I told her that I had actually ordered the salad. She apologized immediately, asked me for my order number and said she would be right back.<br><br>The way she went about correcting their mistake is what blew me out of the water. When the server returned, she had brought over a brownie and said it was on the house. And since the salad was a few dollars less than the pizza, she also gave me the exact difference back in change. She apologized again and left me sitting there in awe. Honestly, she could have just thrown the brownie at me and I would have devoured that thing with a grin on my face. What change? Who the F cares! That was awesome, and she did it all without batting an eye.<br><br>Oh yeah, the salad was quite tasty too.",

"reviewcomment":"My husband and I went for lunch today.  We were both starving and the food definitely did the trick.  I ordered the Mediterranean sandwich with the soup of the day which was Spanish lentil.  The soup was great! The sandwich was a little too saucy but still tasty. My husband had the salmon omelette and thought it was really good. <br><br>We were a little confused by the service. We were immediately seated and our order was promptly taken. My husbands food came out a bit before mine. His came from the kitchen and mine seemed to come from the bar area. We didn&#39;t see much of the waitress after our food came and it took a while for her to bring our check. We found the price to be reasonable for lunch in the Vancouver area.  <br><br>Overall, it was a good experience. I can&#39;t say that it would be our first choice if we lived in town but would definitely be a good backup.",

"reviewcomment":"Not too bad at all.  They have a lunch deal for $9.99 with 3 items, salad and miso soup. We ordered 3 orders and ended up with chopped scallop roll, house roll, salmon sushi, wild salmon maki, goma ae, beef ribs and beef teriyaki udon. <br>Good sized portions especially the so called mini size udon.  I have enough leftovers for dinner too.  Sushi was fresh and tasty.<br><br>Only one girl working up front so if you are in a rush i&#39;d call in to order takeout. Although sushi never really takes long to eat.",

"reviewcomment":"I purchased a groupon so we could try this place out...I had heard the food was quite good...and had wanted to try it.  When we got there...I handed them my groupon so they knew we had it...We had a look over the menu and were ready to order when the host came over and said that they were sorry...they couldn&#39;t accept this groupon...I looked at the paper and I had accidentally handed them a recipe for an Italian dish that I had printed out! We all had a good laugh...as the host said the cook didn&#39;t know how to make ravioli! LOL<br><br>Once we got that all figured out we ordered our food! The Delhi&#39;s Aloo Tikki was probably my favourite dish...super flavourful...fantastic presentation...not too spicy... delicious!<br><br>We also had the Chicken Tikka &amp; the Butter Chicken...both were excellent! The Naan was good too...we ordered both the Garlic &amp; the Cilantro/Onion...light, buttery, and crispy in all the right places!<br><br>As the host was taking away the leftovers to be boxed up for our lunch the next day he said &#34;Now wasn&#39;t that better than pasta?!&#34;  We had a fun time with good food...we will definitely be going back!",

"reviewcomment":"On a drizzling Saturday morning I was determined to ride my bike through UBC.  The weather was a bit iffy, but I told myself not to whimp out cuz of a bit of rain.  I rode up to the Kerrisdale Community Center and had lunch with a friend who was working there.  We ended up at Baan Wasana Thai Restaurant.  <br><br>This place is in the heart of the ritzy Kerrisdale commercial district.  I think its a family restaurant.  When I was there, I would deduce that the mom and her two pretty daughters were serving the customers and the dad&#39;s in the back cooking?  Well I could be wrong, but its a romantic notion none the less!  <br><br>Ok down to the nuts and bolts...  Food was delish!  We shared the Fish Cakes and I had a Pad Thai!  Both were very good!  I love the fish cake sauce!  Also, considering the area, $10 for a Pad Thai in Kerrisdale is a bargain!  The Pad Thai was a good size too!  <br><br>Overall, a great place to come for lunch!  Super friendly service!  Our tea cups, and water cups were always full, and I like the fact the the girls and the mom came by several times to ask if we were enjoying our meals.  I can&#39;t help but think they really care (even though I know they really don&#39;t care!  Haha).  <br><br>Ok I would come again!  And for those that care... (I&#39;m sure there must be a few out there that may care....) I made it down to UBC!  The weather was cloudy but the rain held off!",
