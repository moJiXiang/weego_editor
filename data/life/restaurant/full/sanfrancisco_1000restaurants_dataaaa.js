"reviewcomment":"Now, I love me some farmer&#39;s market shopping, but I seriously get out of control. For instance, at Alemany, I somehow would waste half the day shopping and end up with 5 bags of mushrooms and tons of veggies that I&#39;d ultimately forget about in the fridge and have to throw out. It had gotten to the point where my husband would roll his eyes and think about calling the producers of &#34;Intervention&#34; every time he saw me froth at the mouth at the mere mention of a market. <br><br>CSAs, and particularly Marquita Farms ended up being a saviour for both of us.<br><br>The veggies themselves are insanely fresh, often of heirloom varieties, and are sometimes things I have never even heard of (I am pretty well versed in these things, too) After picking up our box of veggies from our neighborhood pickup every week, we usually find ourselves marvelling at how gorgeous it all looks when we lay it out on the counter. I think the most wonderful thing about this particular CSA however is that it challenges my cooking skills time and time again. I&#39;ve learned so many new dishes to accommodate some of the more unusual offerings and it&#39;s been a huge contributing factor to my epicurean growth. <br><br>We&#39;ve been subscribers for years, but last year, took a chance on paying for the whole year in advance and receiving the discount that knocks off 15% of the regular cost. For about $750ish dollars, you get a giant box of organic, farm fresh produce on a weekly basis from March-November. Throughout the year, they have bulk offerings that you can pay extra for as well. Um, hello pimiento de padrons by the pound and giant flats of fresh San Marzano tomatoes. <br><br>In all seriousness, I think everyone owes it to themselves to at least do a trial for Marquita farms. There are pickup points all over the city so just head to the website to find your closest one. Not only will it make you a healthier, thriftier, and ultimately better chef...it might also save your marriage.",

"reviewcomment":"Very happy to have discovered Chefler!!!! I love this business idea and hope Chefler grows with great success while still maintaing its excellent food quality and great customer service. <br><br>I love the competitive pricing Chefler offers, $7-$10 per meal delivered depending how many meals a week you order, way cheaper than munchery. You can&#39;t beat that. Also I like that they include estimated nutrition facts, that&#39;s awesome, munchery doesn&#39;t have that yet. They post the menu for the week online so you can select which days you want delivered and there are 3 meal options for each weekday. You must order one day prior to delivery by noon, which is fine because it helps you plan and also ensures they purchase the right amount of fresh ingredients needed. <br><br>Give this place a chance, you won&#39;t regret it. I of course had some very minor hiccups as any place can (one delivery not on time) but they always resolved their mistakes and have excellent customer service. One other minor thing to know as a heads up in case you have an allergy or some sort is they don&#39;t follow the menu exactly, but very similar -- for ex a dish might say it has broccoli and instead you get carrots or asparagus. Doesn&#39;t bother me at all but just in case you&#39;re picky or have dietary restrictions. <br><br>So far my fave dishes have been the pulled pork and apple tomatillo chicken! But really almost every dish has been great so far. This place is going to do great if they keep up their excellent customer service, quality tasty meals and excellent affordable pricing!!

"reviewcomment":"The Fizzary is a really fun store for kids, soda connoisseurs, or anyone who&#39;s trying to track down a long-lost beverage of their youth. It&#39;s not huge, but you&#39;ll be amazed at the sheer variety and selection of flavors and regional brands they carry.<br><br>The storefront has a great painted sign, and inside it&#39;s all hardwood floors, pressed tin ceilings, and old-tymey wooden display shelves showing off their sodas. The stock is arranged by flavor, which can be helpful as far as some of the more obscure sodas that don&#39;t have descriptions on the label. They also have a very cool super-fast drink chiller, shaped like a big barrel, that will make any bottle on the shelf deliciously cold in just a few minutes!<br><br>Pricing is straightforward -- $2/bottle, or $6 for a mix-n-match 4-pack, or $16 for a 12-pack mix-n-match. It&#39;s easy to get carried away by all the choices, especially if you&#39;re a visitor who can&#39;t carry glass bottles back home in your carry-on, so be ready to drink a LOT of soda, is all I&#39;m saying. Oh, and they also carry salt-water taffy sold by weight, and you get a free piece of candy with each bottle purchased.<br><br>Oh, and they have a nice selection of super-strong ginger beers, so if you&#39;re looking for fancy mixers for craft cocktails, this would be a good place to start!",

Â Attended one outside and I was surprised it wasn&#39;t that crowded. Â Got to sample the finished goods too! Â I just love how it can be a great hangout not only with hubby but also with friends. Â <br>Parking can get expensive. Â There&#39;s a parking garage I believe in Howard or Folsom st. that offers a great deal for 4 hours or so.",

Haight Street Market is small, but somehow they have everything you need. The product choices are excellent, giving you plenty of options but not overwhelming you. You don&#39;t have to spend an extra ten minutes comparing boxes of cereal because your choice was made easier by limiting your options.<br><br>Everyone working at this place is helpful and friendly. You can get in and out of there quickly and you can also find some real gems* that you will just have to bring home. The fish, meats, cheeses and prepared foods all looked extremely fresh. You can do your regular food shopping here, you can grab coffee and a bagel, some prepared salads, pretty much anything, so there is no reason to support a chain when you can come here and feel better about yourself for doing so.<br>__________________<br>*Gems in any natural or organic food store means things you wouldn&#39;t normally get, but the combination of their packaging and ingredients &#34;force&#34; you to spend $10 on jelly or something similar.

My old gym was a waste of money and nobody really lifted, other than their bodies up and down the rock walls...&#34;mission cliffs&#34; cough cough. But I won&#39;t hate, it&#39;s more of a climbing scene than a gym, I get it, even if half of the hipsters that go there just to hangout like a scene in &#34;Mallrats&#34;...they don&#39;t do anything..they don&#39;t climb..they just sit there. <br>Back to the topic at hand. I stumbled upon this little nook of what I can only consider to be heaven, If I believed in that kind of stuff. While on my quest for the new gym. I walk in and am Greeted by Todd. Great smile and quirky energy, not to mention the witty banter he displays. Definitely brings a positive vibe to the store. He then proceeds to tell me of their products and prices and how they stand behind their customer service and their products.<br>The prices...smack my ass and call me lucy, are legit!! Which is great b/c those psycho pricey, pushy, upsellers at GNC were really annoying, much like tendonitis or a pulled hamstring. <br>Sir..would you like another blah blah for just $$ more.

"reviewcomment":"Now, I love me some farmer&#39;s market shopping, but I seriously get out of control. For instance, at Alemany, I somehow would waste half the day shopping and end up with 5 bags of mushrooms and tons of veggies that I&#39;d ultimately forget about in the fridge and have to throw out. It had gotten to the point where my husband would roll his eyes and think about calling the producers of &#34;Intervention&#34; every time he saw me froth at the mouth at the mere mention of a market. <br><br>CSAs, and particularly Marquita Farms ended up being a saviour for both of us.<br><br>The veggies themselves are insanely fresh, often of heirloom varieties, and are sometimes things I have never even heard of (I am pretty well versed in these things, too) After picking up our box of veggies from our neighborhood pickup every week, we usually find ourselves marvelling at how gorgeous it all looks when we lay it out on the counter. I think the most wonderful thing about this particular CSA however is that it challenges my cooking skills time and time again. I&#39;ve learned so many new dishes to accommodate some of the more unusual offerings and it&#39;s been a huge contributing factor to my epicurean growth. <br><br>We&#39;ve been subscribers for years, but last year, took a chance on paying for the whole year in advance and receiving the discount that knocks off 15% of the regular cost. For about $750ish dollars, you get a giant box of organic, farm fresh produce on a weekly basis from March-November. Throughout the year, they have bulk offerings that you can pay extra for as well. Um, hello pimiento de padrons by the pound and giant flats of fresh San Marzano tomatoes. <br><br>In all seriousness, I think everyone owes it to themselves to at least do a trial for Marquita farms. There are pickup points all over the city so just head to the website to find your closest one. Not only will it make you a healthier, thriftier, and ultimately better chef...it might also save your marriage.",

The boy may have offended him a little as we discussed Oakland, and Bittersweet, and the fact that the owner&#39;s friend, who started Bittersweet, went to Hawaii to start up a new chocolate venture - growing beans to bars - and the teen said &#34;oh - Lonohana?&#34; And I said &#34;oh - you liked their bar, right?&#34; and the teen said &#34;no - I didn&#39;t like it.&#34; Way to go dude.

Finally one of my coaches told me to go get him a sandwich and finally try it myself... let me tell you, I drove up to this place and thought that this was a joke... and then I got out of the car, the smell emanating from this little 2 aisle corner store was intoxicating!! As soon as you walk in you realize that this place is the real deal! All the sports memorabilia and history in this place is epic and that is before I even got a sandwich. They are a very close knit group of people that come here regularly and it is the last of a dieing breed of neighborhood joints where just about everyone knows everyone.<br><br>I ordered a supreme roast beef and swiss on sourdough. Holy crap this sandwich was huge! Definitely worth whatever price they wanted to put on it. <br>The sandwich was magical!<br>It was a sandwich that was made using high quality ingredients and no corners are cut here which is why this place is so popular and succesful!<br><br>IF YOU HAVE NEVER BEEN HERE....

Grab a spoon... or a grain if it&#39;s Ghost Pepper Sea Salt), they have an incredible selection, and the owners are super friendly! I love that all containers come in different sizes depending on your needs, and the prices are really reasonable for the quality. We&#39;ve come here for staples as well as blends, looking for specific salts as well as chatting them up to seek recommendations and we&#39;ve yet to be disappointed. <br><br>You can tell that there&#39;s a passion for food and flavours when you come in here, which is why I love it so much. I have a feeling that our rack will end up having exclusively SpiceAce jars..",

"reviewcomment":"As neighborhood markets in Dogpatch go, well, your options pretty much begin and end with Reno&#39;s. It&#39;s a good thing this store is pretty awesome. They&#39;ve definitely made the transition to cater to the changing demographics in the neighborhood with a good selection of quality adult beverages, organic foods and household supplies. They recently expanded their hours to be open to midnight most nights and installed a fancy new flat screen tv which is usually streaming either sports or news. <br><br>You definitely pay the premium for small scale convenience, but if you live here you&#39;ll find yourself becoming a regular. <br><br>Ok, so they get a bonus star for always stocking my coconut water brand. I&#39;m pretty confident I singlehandedly purchase all of it myself.",

"reviewcomment":"Stop here every time I visit from LA. My family loves their preserved meats. I picked up some lap cheong, gon cheong (duck liver sausage) and lap ngap (duck legs). They have two kinds for the latter - one is the less salt version. I don&#39;t eat pork anymore but when I did, their lap cheong was probably my favorite way to eat pork! I tried a duck leg upon coming home -- it is soooo good. Just steam it and serve with steamed rice and plain veggies like bok choy. Heavenly. <br><br>Sausages are sold by the pound. I can&#39;t remember how much but I got a total of 13 pairs for $23 (26 sausages). They are larger than the packaged sausages you buy at the grocery store. The duck legs are $4.50 each. People were lining up for the pork belly but I don&#39;t know how to pick out the right ones. <br><br>I don&#39;t know when I&#39;ll be back again. I feel like I didn&#39;t buy enough this time.

"reviewcomment":"Why would you go to Whole Foods when Haight Street Market is so close? Did you want to choose from 22 varieties of unsweetened almond milk instead of 10? Yeah, me neither. Haight Street Market is small, but somehow they have everything you need. The product choices are excellent, giving you plenty of options but not overwhelming you. You don&#39;t have to spend an extra ten minutes comparing boxes of cereal because your choice was made easier by limiting your options.<br><br>Everyone working at this place is helpful and friendly. You can get in and out of there quickly and you can also find some real gems* that you will just have to bring home. The fish, meats, cheeses and prepared foods all looked extremely fresh. You can do your regular food shopping here, you can grab coffee and a bagel, some prepared salads, pretty much anything, so there is no reason to support a chain when you can come here and feel better about yourself for doing so.<br>__________________<br>*Gems in any natural or organic food store means things you wouldn&#39;t normally get, but the combination of their packaging and ingredients &#34;force&#34; you to spend $10 on jelly or something similar. How can one pass up plum/lavender jelly? I know, you can&#39;t, it&#39;s near the cheeses.",

"reviewcomment":"The Fizzary is a really fun store for kids, soda connoisseurs, or anyone who&#39;s trying to track down a long-lost beverage of their youth. It&#39;s not huge, but you&#39;ll be amazed at the sheer variety and selection of flavors and regional brands they carry.<br><br>The storefront has a great painted sign, and inside it&#39;s all hardwood floors, pressed tin ceilings, and old-tymey wooden display shelves showing off their sodas. The stock is arranged by flavor, which can be helpful as far as some of the more obscure sodas that don&#39;t have descriptions on the label. They also have a very cool super-fast drink chiller, shaped like a big barrel, that will make any bottle on the shelf deliciously cold in just a few minutes!<br><br>Pricing is straightforward -- $2/bottle, or $6 for a mix-n-match 4-pack, or $16 for a 12-pack mix-n-match. It&#39;s easy to get carried away by all the choices, especially if you&#39;re a visitor who can&#39;t carry glass bottles back home in your carry-on, so be ready to drink a LOT of soda, is all I&#39;m saying. Oh, and they also carry salt-water taffy sold by weight, and you get a free piece of candy with each bottle purchased.<br><br>Oh, and they have a nice selection of super-strong ginger beers, so if you&#39;re looking for fancy mixers for craft cocktails, this would be a good place to start!",

"reviewcomment":"I had my wedding here last weekend and it was a dream come true! Patty helped me from start to finish, from showing us around the winery, to the rehearsal, and eventually coordinating the day. She was so helpful, kind, patient, and fun to work with! When we first visited the winery, my fiance and I fell in love with the breathtaking views and beautiful pavilion area. We knew we wanted our wedding here and signed the contract that day! We chose a day in February because of the discounted winter rate and prayed for a sunny day-which we got! The wind was still icy cold but it was gorgeous and sunny.<br><br>On the wedding day, we arrived and the girls went directly to the bridal suite. It was a perfect and cute little room where we got ready. There was a balcony outside which we would&#39;ve used more if it was warmer. The guys had their own room too upstairs. We had two hours to freshen up, relax, and take photos.<br><br>When I walked out to the ceremony with my mom by my side, it was more beautiful than I ever imagined! The wooden pavilion overlooks the vineyard and bay area, and since it was sunny and clear, we had a great view--though I was just staring at my now husband. After the cocktail hour and so many photos, we went to the reception. Surrounded by glass windows, family, and friends, we ate while watching the sun set. It was perfect. We were rushed at the end because we were going over time, but Patty was so gracious and patient with us, and throughout the whole day I was put to ease because I knew she was helping coordinate. If you&#39;re looking for a gorgeous venue for your wedding and love the rustic and naturey feel--look no further. It was the best day ever! :)",

"reviewcomment":"After seeing masses of locals hopping in line, I decided to throw my hat in as well. Â Turning to yelp, I learned that the piece de resistance here is the egg custard tart. Â Despite being only 8 or so people back in line (a very long line developed behind me), it still took 20-30 minutes to get my coveted tart. Â People in front of me ordered by the dozen, and the ladies behind the counter were pulling them out of the oven as fast as possible but not keeping up with the demand. Â The tarts are $1.80 each, which is a steal for how filling they are. Â The flaky, crispy crust is delicious. Â Where the custard started to set up and cool around the edges, I thought it was good. Â Eggy, but slightly sweet. Â For me, the hot jiggly center wasn&#39;t ideal, but I&#39;m happy I tried it and got the GG Bakery experience. Â <br><br>I also ordered COCONUT MACAROONS, which can only be ordered in half dozen amounts. Â While I didn&#39;t think I needed that many, I was later SOOOO glad I got them. Â By far the best coconut macaroon I&#39;ve ever eaten. Â It was carmelized and buttery and crunchy on the outside with a nice, sweet, soft, coconut bite in the middle. Â I left the bakery to bike around the City for the day, and I was so thankful to have these gems in my bag to stave off starvation.",

"reviewcomment":"A solid Italian deli in the heart of North Beach, Molinari&#39;s has been around since the 1800&#39;s and it&#39;s even more famous than Lucca&#39;s. It certainly looks the part with their walls stacked ceiling high with Italian goodies. The sandwich ingredients are top notch. Just try their sun-dried tomatoes! I think it&#39;s the buttery olive oil they use that give it such amazing flavor.<br><br>Remember to get a ticket number and pick out a roll. I recommend the South Beach special or anything with those tomatoes.",

I never even know they made Tequila ice cream but def was feeling the taste and light hints on my palate. <br><br>Next time I host a party I think I&#39;ll reach out to this business. My friend said they cater to most flavors/ideas so I think this will be a nice treat for my guests, you know, something uniquely delicious. <br><br>I even heard I can scoop some flavors up at Whole Foods so I&#39;ll be looking for that if I get an itch prior..<br><br>All around very very tasty.",

"reviewcomment":"Very happy to have discovered Chefler!!!! I love this business idea and hope Chefler grows with great success while still maintaing its excellent food quality and great customer service. <br><br>I love the competitive pricing Chefler offers, $7-$10 per meal delivered depending how many meals a week you order, way cheaper than munchery. You can&#39;t beat that. Also I like that they include estimated nutrition facts, that&#39;s awesome, munchery doesn&#39;t have that yet. They post the menu for the week online so you can select which days you want delivered and there are 3 meal options for each weekday. You must order one day prior to delivery by noon, which is fine because it helps you plan and also ensures they purchase the right amount of fresh ingredients needed. <br><br>Give this place a chance, you won&#39;t regret it. I of course had some very minor hiccups as any place can (one delivery not on time) but they always resolved their mistakes and have excellent customer service. One other minor thing to know as a heads up in case you have an allergy or some sort is they don&#39;t follow the menu exactly, but very similar -- for ex a dish might say it has broccoli and instead you get carrots or asparagus. Doesn&#39;t bother me at all but just in case you&#39;re picky or have dietary restrictions. <br><br>So far my fave dishes have been the pulled pork and apple tomatillo chicken! But really almost every dish has been great so far. This place is going to do great if they keep up their excellent customer service, quality tasty meals and excellent affordable pricing!!

"reviewcomment":"If you&#39;re reading this review there are probably some things you&#39;re looking for in a coffee shop, and rather than write 65,792 words about how much I love this place, here is what you want to know: <br><br>In one sentence:<br>It&#39;s rad. Come here. <br><br>Is it quiet?<br>Yes. Very. It&#39;s very zen like. People talk in soft whispers, and there&#39;s classical music playing. <br><br>Is it comfy?<br>Yes. Very. They have bench seating against the wall, and a bunch of cozy chairs and tables.<br><br>Wifi?<br>Yes. Free? Yes. Good? Yes.<br>(do you know how many coffee shops (&#34;Bean There Cafe&#34;) have so many people and such crappy wifi? This place is rock solid. I&#39;ve never had a problem. <br><br>Is it good for large groups?<br>No. Definitely not. It&#39;s pretty small and cozy, would be hard to fit a bunch of people here.<br><br>How&#39;s the coffee?<br>It&#39;s decent. I&#39;m not a coffee snob, and I&#39;ll drink anything, so if you are a coffee snob, you probably won&#39;t like it here. It&#39;s not a squirt of sugar free vanilla, light, skinny, foam, no foam, kinda place. It&#39;s coffee.<br><br>How&#39;s the food?<br>I&#39;m a fan of the bagel sandwiches, and the Paninis.<br><br>Is this a good place to meet hot dudes?<br>Um...no. <br><br>Is this a good place to be seen, like, you know?<br>Um...no. That&#39;s the mission. <br><br>What&#39;s the vibe?<br>Awesome. If you&#39;re looking to catch up with all your best friends, then negative-orama. This isn&#39;t the place, go to 4 Barrel or Coffee Bean or Blue Bottle. Those places are way hip, and you&#39;re sure to meet a hot dude there. <br><br>The vibe is quiet. It&#39;s peaceful. It&#39;s &#34;getting away from it all.&#34; It actually kind of reminds me of Hawaii, sorta, if you kinda squint and look at it from the side. It&#39;s just mellow. <br><br>Summation:<br><br>I love this place. I&#39;ve been looking for a little spot to get work done, and this is perfect. <br>It&#39;s quite. The food&#39;s decent, the coffee is perfect. And Art, the owner (?), he&#39;s a doll. He&#39;s one of those people that just makes your day a little bit brighter, just because he&#39;s in the room.",

Texas style, which means you won&#39;t find any beans or tomatoes here, just a boatload of peppers (some whole, some ground) and spices. This place is a godsend. A pound of ground anchos or NM peppers is $4 each, which is far less than you&#39;ll even see it in most hispanic markets. Not to mention I can also buy cumin by the pound for a similar price. The only real downside is the fairly limited hours they&#39;re open. <br><br>I doubt they have the absolute freshest spices, and while the selection is big it isn&#39;t exotic like rainbow. But then the whole point is you aren&#39;t paying rainbow prices. Also should you ever reach a low enough point in your life to buy a pound of easy mac powdered cheese sauce... you know where to do",

All the cakes in their glass display looked mouthwateringly delightful. Every single one of those cakes were something I&#39;d like to have taken home.

"reviewcomment":"These juices are the creme de la creme of juices! Â I make green juice daily myself, but was looking for some juices to have on hand after surgery, when my mobility was going to be impaired. Â I emailed them to see what they recommended, and got a quick response from Michelle. Â She was quick to steer me toward Brain Power, the most nutrient dense juice, along with a handful of their other green juices. Â I ordered the Brain Power, Green Machine, Zeus Juice, Liver Lover &amp; Orange Crush. Â <br><br>These juices caught my attention because they are stored in glass bottles, and 100% organic. Â In the past I have tried Blue Print Cleanse, Suja and Pressed Juicery. Â I can&#39;t believe the difference between these and Living Greens. Â They are really not in the same category, Living Greens is rich, velvety lusciousness. Â Some of the others I have tasted like toilet water, seriously, my last cleanse with Pressed I ended early and couldn&#39;t finish the drinks. Â I don&#39;t have the juices with fruit, except for apple, so some of their sweeter ones may be okay, but blak!<br><br>I live in the East Bay, so delivery would have cost me $45. plus toll fees.

"reviewcomment":"Wow! Oh man. So good!<br><br>OK, let me back up. When I was a little kid, I used to buy these little Bama pecan pies at the local U Tote &#39;Em (old school version of 7-11 in Texas). They were really delicious despite the fact that the jumbo pecans looked like cockroaches. Today at the San Mateo Farmers&#39; Market, I had some time to kill while I waited for a sandwich order to get made, so I strolled around. Lo and behold, I came across a small booth with two of the friendliest guys ever and an assortment of large and small pies. Immediately, my eyes were drawn to the small pecan pies which had that nostalgic Bama look. SOLD!<br><br>Now I&#39;m sitting here finishing up a BBQ sandwich and following it up with one of the most delicious little pecan pies I&#39;ve ever had! So good that it will eradicate the Bama nostalgia. The crust is flaky and buttery with a tiny bit of crunch. The pecans and the filling are a tiny bit savory and a tiny bit sweet, but not too much of either. A perfect balance! I kind of wish I had a scoop of vanilla ice cream to put on it, but it&#39;s great anyway!<br><br>I can&#39;t wait until next weekend to come back and try some of the other flavors!",

"reviewcomment":"j&#39;aime le fromage<br><br>and le fromage, it j&#39;aimes me.<br><br>Once upon a time, several moons ago, a friend and I walked from Calvi to near Porto-Vecchio on the GR 20, a backcountry footpath across the lovely island of Corsica. Â The 180 km walk took us 10 days, mostly in the high country, usually far from anything that would resemble civilization. Â And when it took on some civilized shape it sure wasn&#39;t a shape that I was accustomed to. Â For those 10 days in the morning I would have hot chocolate and bread with butter and jam, not the repast that makes for me the strongest desire to climb a mountain but that&#39;s all we had so that&#39;s what we ate. Â But for morning snacks and lunch and afternoon snacks we had ...<br><br>wait for it ...<br><br>Cheese.<br><br>Cheese and local meats thatI Â sometimes simply could not eat sorry but the cheese. Â Mon dieu. Â We would buy the small paper-wrapped wheels or round loafs or whatever they were called at stone outbuildings part of rural farms that sold for the spare mad money the fresh goat cheese to the hikers. Â A little wheel would last me about three days unrefrigerated and I had to eat it or replace it as for after the third day it would smell worse than I did. Â 10 days walking eating cheese and green apples and the baguette sticking out of my backpack like a strange fat yummy antenna.<br><br>I thought of this Friday past as I tasted the memory at the Valentine&#39;s Day Luscious and Lovely Cheese and Wine Class. Â Cheese lesson number 2, the Valencay, wasn&#39;t from Corsica but it brought me back all the same. Â It wasn&#39;t the specialist aspect, no, she was to my right. Â But it was pretty special all the same.<br><br>Cheese School rocks. Â That&#39;s all I can say. Â I am only a baby when it comes to tastes and pairings but I know what I like. Â And here, I liked the setting, the teacher, the plating and choices, the abundant bubbles flowing, the fellow students. Â The entire Ã©cole experience was simply perfect.<br><br>We went for the special occasion and the offerings, to be sure, but I daresay any educational adventure here would turn the day special, irrespective all the rest. Â Check it out, my friends. Â Bet you my bottom baguette you won&#39;t be disappointed.",

"reviewcomment":"One of my Meetup groups recently switched our meeting location to Leland Tea Co. I&#39;m so pleased with this place. It has a serene and upbeat atmosphere, great service, and an amazing assortment of teas (I&#39;m not a big tea connoisseur but to me, it&#39;s a pretty varied selection). I&#39;ve enjoyed the tea I&#39;ve tried there so much that I&#39;ve bought some large containers to brew at home. (I like &#34;Kisses&#34; and &#34;Blue Eyes&#34; the best so far) but I intend on trying many more of the tea varieties. The guy who works the counter when I&#39;ve been there is knowledgeable about the teas and also is super patient, even with a tea novice like me. <br>The (food) menu is not super extensive, but there is more than 1 veggie option (something that is important to me) if you want to get a &#39;tea lunch&#39;. Â Everything I&#39;ve eaten there has been yummy, with the exception of 1 mini-cupcake, which tasted stale and flavorless. Â <br>The only drawback (IMO) is the location of the place, not my favorite area of the city. I&#39;d still recommend it if you&#39;re around that area, enjoy tea, and would like a kick-back place to read, relax, or get together with friends.",

"reviewcomment":"Ambiance: Very quaint and cute. Street parking is relatively limited so thank goodness someone was backing out when we arrived! Once you enter the store, you&#39;ll notice that on the left there is an array of delicious, mouth-watering American candy like strawberry tape, watermelon gummies, chocolate, gum drops, gummy bears and soooo much more. On the right, you&#39;ll notice an array of Chinese sweets like dried fruits, dried ginger, candied citrus peels, and more~! There are a few tables (maybe 2 or 3) and a bathroom in the back that you&#39;ll need a key to access. <br><br>Service: Service is so quick and definitely VERY friendly! :) I didn&#39;t know that it was cash only and I only had my card on me. Instead of giving me a hard time, the lil ol&#39; cashier lady just smiled at me and said something along the lines of: &#39;Ok no worries. I&#39;ll be right here. I&#39;ll keep your candy on the side.&#39; Such a sweet sweet lady. :) So I ran back to the car and thank god i dug a 20 dolla bill. <br><br>Food: - Almond milk w/ boba: BY FAR the BEST almond milk with boba I&#39;ve ever had. It&#39;s literally just almond milk + boba. way better than almond milk tea w/ boba. I went to this place on New Year&#39;s and I&#39;m still dreaming about this drink. <br>- Mini gummy bears: Favorite candy in the world. So rare to find. this store just earned major points for having it in stock. WOOO!<br>- Raspberry/Blackberry gummies: First time trying these here. Meh these are okay. Haven&#39;t gotten use to the outer shell part. It&#39;s like I&#39;m biting into a thin, sweet plastic before I get to the gummy middle. <br>- Strawberry tape: Yummmmmmmm. Reminds me of the movies~ <br>- Rock candy lollipops: Didn&#39;t try these because i don&#39;t like rock candy but the bf loved them. :P<br><br>Price: We spent about $16 for 2 drinks and 4 bags of candyyyyyy. Awesome sweet splurge to start the New Year&#39;s off right. ;)<br><br>Tip: - Almond milk with boba!<br>- CANDYYYYYY!!!!! is a must<br><br>Conclusion: Ohhhhhh hellll yes I&#39;m going to be back here when I&#39;m in the city. If only traffic getting here wasn&#39;t so crazy and if only this awesome boba shop was located closer, I would be here every day! BEST BOBA STORE I&#39;VE EVER BEEN TO IN MY LIFE!",

I&#39;ve never understood the appeal of $5 pastries from Tartine, but this, THIS, I get. I&#39;m not a dessert person, but I LOVE this little pastry. The original was already super yummy. I just tried the chocolate Kouign Amann = YUUUUM. Savig the ginger-pear Kouign Amann for my evening snack tonight! <br><br>MMMM, a must-try and well worth the 15 times you will circle the block looking for parking only to illegally park at a red zone down the street while one person sprints to buy pastries and the other anxiously waits to move their car.",

"reviewcomment":"I had my wedding here last weekend and it was a dream come true! Patty helped me from start to finish, from showing us around the winery, to the rehearsal, and eventually coordinating the day. She was so helpful, kind, patient, and fun to work with! When we first visited the winery, my fiance and I fell in love with the breathtaking views and beautiful pavilion area. We knew we wanted our wedding here and signed the contract that day! We chose a day in February because of the discounted winter rate and prayed for a sunny day-which we got! The wind was still icy cold but it was gorgeous and sunny.<br><br>On the wedding day, we arrived and the girls went directly to the bridal suite. It was a perfect and cute little room where we got ready. There was a balcony outside which we would&#39;ve used more if it was warmer. The guys had their own room too upstairs. We had two hours to freshen up, relax, and take photos.<br><br>When I walked out to the ceremony with my mom by my side, it was more beautiful than I ever imagined! The wooden pavilion overlooks the vineyard and bay area, and since it was sunny and clear, we had a great view--though I was just staring at my now husband. After the cocktail hour and so many photos, we went to the reception. Surrounded by glass windows, family, and friends, we ate while watching the sun set. It was perfect. We were rushed at the end because we were going over time, but Patty was so gracious and patient with us, and throughout the whole day I was put to ease because I knew she was helping coordinate. If you&#39;re looking for a gorgeous venue for your wedding and love the rustic and naturey feel--look no further. It was the best day ever! :)",

"reviewcomment":"So I should have written a review for this place a long time ago as we visited it last November. Â <br>I was so excited to go here seeing as I&#39;m from England. Â I was longing for good scones as for some reason the American scones are always so dry. Â Also reading all the reviews and looking at the pictures was making my mouth water.<br><br>I kind of knew what to expect from reviews and pictures on Yelp, but actually stepping into this bakery and seeing all the goodies was another thing. Â I was like a kid in a candy shop. Â So many choices and wonderful flavors to choose from that I couldn&#39;t decide what to get. Â I wanted one of everything. Â Luckily there were a few samples on the counter which helped make my decision easier (but not much). Â They had samples of their mince pies which are to die for and an Irish bread called Soda bread which was different (but good) that I&#39;d never tried before. Â I really miss really good mice pies. Â <br><br>OK so this is what I ended up getting:-<br>-4 Mince pies<br>-One plum pudding which I saved for Christmas so my family could try. Â It&#39;s like a cross between Christmas pudding and fruit cake. Â Moist, flavorful, and oh so good. Â Next time I go I&#39;ll buy several of these as they do keep forever. Â <br>-3 different pasties which me, my son, and husband ate for lunch. Â Absolutely delicious<br>-A couple of scones. Â I was in heaven eating them. Â I didn&#39;t have any clotted cream so I ended up eating them with butter and jam. <br>-One loaf of their soda bread<br>-Several shortbread cookies for my son<br><br>I definitely want to go back and try their other baked goods and also their shepherd pie looked so delicious. Â Just a shame that it&#39;s in SF and I live in the South Bay.",

"reviewcomment":"Great hidden treasure in SF. My boyfriend is a big fan of their beers so we decided to check this place out since it&#39;s relatively close by my neighborhood. Speakeasy is borderline ghetto Third street, but it&#39;s a great place to go if you&#39;re looking for great beer in a spacious bar with sexy 1920s prohibition vibe. They have the bar with two mini rooms if you have a large group to go with. They also allow you to wander to the back where all the magic happens. This place has become my favorite place to go because it&#39;s honestly really difficult to get great beer in SF for cheap. <br><br>Pros:<br>Plenty of parking<br>Large selection of their beers available on tap<br>Sexy am-BeyoncÃ© <br>$3 Happy hour (1-6pm<br><br>Cons:<br>Not open for late night",

All the quiches have a lot of the filling (bacon, veggies, cheese, etc), instead of being mostly egg), which I appreciate. <br><br>Every bread is good.<br><br>This is a place where you can grab a meal or individual baked goods to take home, both sweet and savory. <br><br>But it IS a bakery, if you come in at the very end of the day you might get something that&#39;s a little more dry or has absorbed flavors from something else it sat next to all day in the case -- that&#39;s just how bakeries work.",

"reviewcomment":"We just used Drink for our 100 person wedding at the Log Cabin in the Presidio and they could not have done a better job. From the beginning Melissa was great about answering our questions and replying to our emails in an extremely timely fashion. <br><br>As far as the drinks go--they were amazing. We went with 3 signature cocktails and I would describe them here if only I could remember the details. Since I can&#39;t, I&#39;m sure I won&#39;t do them justice so I&#39;ll just say that they were amazing and that everyone loved them. They all tasted wonderful and looked great too--one of the drinks came with a flower and they lasted all night. They stocked top shelf liquor and poured all we wanted. One of my friends, after forgetting the name of the signature cocktail featuring bourbon asked for &#34;one of those bourbon drinks&#34; and received an entire glass of Maker&#39;s Mark. Needless to say, he loved our wedding. <br><br>The bar they set up looked beautiful and they never ran out of anything. Â Anything we asked for they gave us and were as sweet as could be while serving us. Â I really can&#39;t say enough about the staff at Drink. <br><br>We were slightly concerned because we only had an hour after the end of the event to be out of the venue but the had everything packed up and out on time. They worked very well with our caterers and overall we couldn&#39;t be happier that we booked them. I would highly recommend Drink to anyone seeking interesting drinks and great service.",

"reviewcomment":"I haven&#39;t tried their frozen custard yet, but I met the mastermind behind this genius concoction @ the Yelp in the Hundred Event earlier today. His name is Jason and he&#39;s a cool dude. I only talked to him for a few minutes but his outgoing personality was mesmerizing. I could tell that he is passionate about the food that he puts out. Very knowledgable, too. He, himself, deserves 5 stars already.<br><br>His current project, Sugar &amp; Spun, is his own take on cotton candy. You know something is as good as it looks if it gets written in the newspaper. Read it here: <a href='/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Finsidescoopsf.sfgate.com%2Fblog%2F2013%2F08%2F08%2Fsugar-spun-brings-a-new-kind-of-cotton-candy-to-san-francisco-with-some-help-from-shrek%2F&amp;s=a8391c696fd6bbb5606b16b441e92660183e5fc4f5d710c604360d28e6d66919' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>insidescoopsf.sfgate.comâ¦</a><br><br>At the Yelp event, I tried the four barrel latte and chocolate banana cotton flavor. Although both flavors were unique, I liked the four barrel latte more. Coffee anything will always win my heart over. But don&#39;t fret if you&#39;re not a coffee lover because they offer other flavors such as spiced mango, strawberry and cream, and cheesecake. Who would&#39;ve thought that cotton candy can portray such flavors and still be tasty? It lightweight reminds me of cupcakes, except it won&#39;t create a crumbly mess. Give it a try!",

Finally one of my coaches told me to go get him a sandwich and finally try it myself... let me tell you, I drove up to this place and thought that this was a joke... and then I got out of the car, the smell emanating from this little 2 aisle corner store was intoxicating!! As soon as you walk in you realize that this place is the real deal! All the sports memorabilia and history in this place is epic and that is before I even got a sandwich. They are a very close knit group of people that come here regularly and it is the last of a dieing breed of neighborhood joints where just about everyone knows everyone.<br><br>I ordered a supreme roast beef and swiss on sourdough. Holy crap this sandwich was huge! Definitely worth whatever price they wanted to put on it. <br>The sandwich was magical!<br>It was a sandwich that was made using high quality ingredients and no corners are cut here which is why this place is so popular and succesful!<br><br>IF YOU HAVE NEVER BEEN HERE....

"reviewcomment":"If you&#39;re reading this review there are probably some things you&#39;re looking for in a coffee shop, and rather than write 65,792 words about how much I love this place, here is what you want to know: <br><br>In one sentence:<br>It&#39;s rad. Come here. <br><br>Is it quiet?<br>Yes. Very. It&#39;s very zen like. People talk in soft whispers, and there&#39;s classical music playing. <br><br>Is it comfy?<br>Yes. Very. They have bench seating against the wall, and a bunch of cozy chairs and tables.<br><br>Wifi?<br>Yes. Free? Yes. Good? Yes.<br>(do you know how many coffee shops (&#34;Bean There Cafe&#34;) have so many people and such crappy wifi? This place is rock solid. I&#39;ve never had a problem. <br><br>Is it good for large groups?<br>No. Definitely not. It&#39;s pretty small and cozy, would be hard to fit a bunch of people here.<br><br>How&#39;s the coffee?<br>It&#39;s decent. I&#39;m not a coffee snob, and I&#39;ll drink anything, so if you are a coffee snob, you probably won&#39;t like it here. It&#39;s not a squirt of sugar free vanilla, light, skinny, foam, no foam, kinda place. It&#39;s coffee.<br><br>How&#39;s the food?<br>I&#39;m a fan of the bagel sandwiches, and the Paninis.<br><br>Is this a good place to meet hot dudes?<br>Um...no. <br><br>Is this a good place to be seen, like, you know?<br>Um...no. That&#39;s the mission. <br><br>What&#39;s the vibe?<br>Awesome. If you&#39;re looking to catch up with all your best friends, then negative-orama. This isn&#39;t the place, go to 4 Barrel or Coffee Bean or Blue Bottle. Those places are way hip, and you&#39;re sure to meet a hot dude there. <br><br>The vibe is quiet. It&#39;s peaceful. It&#39;s &#34;getting away from it all.&#34; It actually kind of reminds me of Hawaii, sorta, if you kinda squint and look at it from the side. It&#39;s just mellow. <br><br>Summation:<br><br>I love this place. I&#39;ve been looking for a little spot to get work done, and this is perfect. <br>It&#39;s quite. The food&#39;s decent, the coffee is perfect. And Art, the owner (?), he&#39;s a doll. He&#39;s one of those people that just makes your day a little bit brighter, just because he&#39;s in the room.",

We called Basa and asked for a pound of salmon, tuna, and hamachi. They were really accommodating for the last minute order and even sliced all the fish for us. The three pounds of fish came out to $98- on the pricier side and parts of the fish were still frozen but one shouldn&#39;t go cheap with raw fish. The fish were all tasty and I would depend on Basa&#39;s fish again. <br>The staff was really friendly and they were generous about giving sides like wasabi and ginger. Even chopsticks.<br>This place not only sells fish by the pound but also meals like sandwiches, fish and chips, and rice bowls. There is a small sit-down area in the back and I think if I were in the area, I would want to eat here.",

"reviewcomment":"Absolute gem of a little shop! It&#39;s usually crowded, so upon entering, you take a number, and then decide what to get while you&#39;re waiting to be called. The line moves quickly, and the guys who work there are always nice (unlike the 24th St. Cheese Shop). No one tries to rush you, and based on your needs, they are very good at recommending different cheeses and giving you a sample to try. If you tell them you want a particular cheese to serve that night, they don&#39;t try to sell you a cheese that&#39;s not even close to being ripe. (Are you listening, 24th St. Cheese Shop?!)<br><br>In addition to great cheeses and cured meats, they have literally everything you need to make a fantastic Italian dinner. Their homemade sauces, pastas, and pizza dough are all fantastic. Even if you&#39;re running in for just one thing, you&#39;d be short-changing yourself if you didn&#39;t take a good look around for future reference because it&#39;s amazing what they are able to pack into this small yet well organized and tidy space. <br><br>If I had to make a tiny suggestion, I would say PLEASE consider opening on Sundays! People need to eat and entertain every day, not just Monday through Saturday. <br><br>Lucca Ravioli Company, don&#39;t go changin&#39;! We love you just the way you are!

"reviewcomment":"Stephanie made a beautiful and original cake for our wedding. She was lovely to work with beforehand too, with both great ideas and listening skills. We went through several iterations of ideas before Stephanie came up with the idea of using dehydrated and naturally-dyed lotus root to decorate our four tiered cake, invoking a little bit of my Asian Indian heritage in exactly the right manner.<br>We wanted bright colors and everything to look both edible and interesting, and she accomplished both, without compromising on the actual yumminess.<br>The two flavors we picked were delicate, fragrant, moist, and both light and decadent. One was based on raspberry and the other orange chiffon and toasted almond. She also made wonderful cookies to go with it.<br>Everyone universally loved the cake. The groom has always sworn to dislike cake, and he even loved it.",

Sure I could wash and dry my own clothes... but a mark up for fluff and fold is totally worth it when you&#39;re busy and would rather focus on other areas of your life. <br><br>In this instance (purchasing meats) I&#39;m pretty aware that I could hit Safeway and get a pound of mystery feed lot beef for a lot less than what I&#39;m paying at 4505 Meats... but in that whole &#34;making my life easier&#34; sentiment I just shared, Ryan Farr and team put my mind at ease knowing my proteins come from humanely raised animals fed their natural diets without hard to pronounce compounds being injected into their veins on a daily basis. It&#39;s sad that access to real food is such a niche business, but if you have any respect for what you put in your body, you should view higher prices on heritage meats as a sort of insurance policy on preventing future metabolic issues that will inevitably appear if you keep eating the same crap most of America calls &#34;food.&#34;<br><br>Everything I&#39;ve ever consumed from 4505 Meats has been incredible. From bacon to ground beef to their addictive chicharrones (they&#39;re seriously crack - meat crack), it&#39;s part of what makes living in SF (or in my case, returning home occasionally) so great. <br><br>You should know where your food comes from, but it&#39;s not always easy to find that information. Easy being the theme of this review, 4505 Meats takes all the guesswork out of eating well. Shop here and you&#39;re assured a wholesome experience each and every time.",

It was a tall order to make cake delicious enough for such a happy and important occasion, but Pinkie&#39;s exceeded expectations. <br><br>The chocolate ganache with sea salt was the crowd favorite. My sister-in-law, who is not a &#34;cake person,&#34; pronounced it &#34;the best cake [she has] ever eaten.&#34; People came back for seconds, even thirds. This cake is rich, super chocolate-y, and the flakes of salt on top are so, so good.<br><br>Our other flavor was the lemon chiffon with coconut flakes. I adored this, and those who either tried both or resisted the chocolate, loved it, too. The frosting is incredible, the cake crumb is moist, and the lemon curd filling is tart and lovely. <br><br>I would definitely order from Pinkie&#39;s again and highly recommend.

Here, there be CornÃ¨d Dogs.<br><br>Enough of this. Batter Up serves made-to-order corn dogs from a walk-up window on Geneva ave. They have a variety of sausage options (and some tofu ones for your vegetarian friends) which you can mix and match on a stick. Two meats end-to-end is a double play, three meats is a triple. And you can even sneak one of three kinds of cheese into the mix. Each dog is freshly battered and made on the spot, and it takes about 8 minutes.<br><br>The day I visited, I ordered the Lemon Chicken and Cajun dogs as a double play. Both are solid, really flavorful sausages, and I really enjoyed the spicy cajun. You can get your standard mustard and ketchup for dipping, but there are a few other surprise sauces if you &#34;are cool.&#34; So act cool, brah.<br><br>If the seemingly endless combination of dogs &#39;n&#39; cheese isn&#39;t enough, they also have deep fried dessert. Oreos, candy bars, Twinkies and even Reese&#39;s peanut butter cups. You will surely hate yourself if you manage to finish, so be careful.<br><br>If you want to hasten your demise, there is also a customer loyalty program for those so inclined. I declined the card (because I want to see my kids graduate), but I will for sure return.<br><br>Obligatory Title Pun: A HOME RUN. <br><br>Menu Readability: A hand-scrawled dealie in their window, with dog-related diagrams.<br><br>Need to mention: You can even order online. This is a crazy town, y&#39;all.<br><br>What this place teaches me about myself: That I would do anything for corn dogs, including setting foot in the Excelsior district. Two BART stops y&#39;all.",

"reviewcomment":"I come here for 2 things -- the egg tarts and the baked char siu bao. Â Both are excellent and one of the best around when fresh out of the oven, and even if they&#39;ve been sitting around its still pretty damn good. Â They appear to bake all day long. Â Better than Golden Gate Bakery imo. Â <br><br>I sometimes will also get one of those huge almond cookies, which is super flaky and a little too buttery, but pretty solid.<br><br>Plus the lady is always friendly (I speak Cantonese to her), and there is never a wait. Â Easy in, easy out, I&#39;m never in the place for more than 5 minutes. Â <br><br>For someone visiting this place for the first time, it might be a bit loud and intimidating if you go there in the afternoon...just ignore all those old Chinese men playing checkers and talking loudly...it&#39;s their hangout I suppose.",

From the food, to the service, to all the details they take care of in between, they&#39;ve got you covered. <br><br>Their food is absolutely delicious. They pride themselves on making restaurant quality food for large groups and it shows! You don&#39;t get your typical &#39;catered affair&#39; fare (pun intended). It&#39;s gourmet and they take care to make each plate have the presentation they display to you during your tastings. They worked with us to get our favorite appetizer and entree choices for our wedding and everyone commented on how delicious it was. <br><br>The staff is incredible too! They worked to make us feel special with each and every interaction. They work to help you get what you want so your wedding day is everything you&#39;d ever dreamed of. They know how to manage a party and you can put all your trust in their hands and then just enjoy your day. <br><br>They can also help you coordinate linen, lighting, and other rentals so you can work through less vendors. Which is always huge when planning a wedding. <br><br>I highly recommend working with GGC!",

They&#39;ve definitely made the transition to cater to the changing demographics in the neighborhood with a good selection of quality adult beverages, organic foods and household supplies. They recently expanded their hours to be open to midnight most nights and installed a fancy new flat screen tv which is usually streaming either sports or news. <br><br>You definitely pay the premium for small scale convenience, but if you live here you&#39;ll find yourself becoming a regular. <br><br>Ok, so they get a bonus star for always stocking my coconut water brand.

"reviewcomment":"TL:DR; Love Spice Hound, Love Tammy<br><br>GETTING LUCKY<br>We happened to visit when Tammy, the owner, was manning the store. She was great to meet. She spent a lot of time with us, telling us about her spices, where they come from, how they&#39;re different from spices in the grocery store, and also some unique things about her salts. She didn&#39;t push her knowledge on us, we asked for it, and she was happy to share.<br><br>The customer service she showed was beyond what I expected, and I found it very helpful<br><br>WHEELS ARE TURNING<br>One of the cool things about talking with Tammy was getting her insight into how certain spices would play together in a recipe I am working on. When I told her about what I was doing, I could tell she was actually thinking about how the flavors would mesh, and she was able to give me recommendations.<br><br>QUALITY<br>Look, friends, I know we can all just go to the grocery store and buy some spices. And some of the spices are even displayed in fancier packaging, so they&#39;re probably better than the McCormicks. ..... but what do we really know when we buy spices from Safeway?<br><br>The cool thing about Spice hound is you can ask Tammy or her staff about when the spices were brought in, crushed, whatever. They actually know! And they can give you an idea of how long they will last, how to store them, etc. <br><br>On top of that, Spice Hound cares about its product. You can see it when Tammy talks about her spices. <br><br>VALUE<br>Remember those spices on sale at Safeway. Typically for the &#34;craft&#34; or fancy-looking bottle of spice,the ones that look like they must be better than the spices in the plastic bottles, those will cost you $6-$10 per bottle. <br><br>Meanwhile, you can get a comparable amount of spice from Spice Hound, and you will know a whole lot more about the product... for... wait for it... the same price or cheaper! It&#39;s true that Spice Hound has some more expensive spices, but what I bought (taco seasoning, cayenne pepper, black pepper, white pepper, several others), the price was comparable to Safeway, if not better.<br><br>PLEASE COME AGAIN-ABILITY<br>By now, you&#39;re probably thinking I drank the Kool-Aid on Spice Hound. You&#39;re likely right.<br><br>I would come here again, making the trip to Bernal Heights, whenever I need new spices. Forget being lazy and going to Safeway. It&#39;s not worth it.<br><br>You can also order online or catch Spice Hound at a couple farmers&#39; markets.",

"reviewcomment":"Two words: Dirty Dozen. We happen to like things that start with &#34;dirty,&#34; but besides that, its a genius way to get to try new wine every month. A mixed case of wine, pre-screened by the best in the business, for $119 including tax! It comes with a print out of their description of each wine and what it would go well with--we consult this little bible every night and are almost never let down. <br><br>I&#39;m not just using them for their Dirty Dozen, however--I often go in to ask what I should bring home to go with bacon-wrapped scallops or thai chicken or rosemary salmon or whatever crazy concoction I am all excited about making for dinner that night or to bring to a party and they always hook me up with something just right. <br><br>We are lucky enough to live mere blocks away from this wine temple, but my aunt and uncle even drive from Oakland for the deals and selection here! <br><br>Thanks for keeping San Francisco Dirty, Wine House!",

"reviewcomment":"Dear yelpers,<br><br>As I was having my tires fixed, I had 2 hours to spare with the goal to have some food with hopefully some kind of WIFI to entertain myself. Â  Well right around the corner of the car place I saw a little cafe whose identity was more confused than hybrid. Â <br><br>After stumpling in this icecream, sandwich, gyro, sit around establishment, I regonized one of the sandwich makers who used to make me be the best sandwiches in Noe Valley. Â I said hi and he regonized me right away and remembered what I used to order, he then recommended a new sandwich the Try Trick Me for only $7.75. Â  I was not tricked, the meat was succalent, and marinated with some spice just right. Â The bread was fresh and toasty. Â The pickle was just a skinny pickle one step away from being a shy cucumber dipped in pickle juice. Â  However the 3rd bite I just realized that I can not do my work I was meant to do as I had to have the second half before I even started anything incorporating keyboards and finger licking juicy dressing exploding out of the sandwich. Â  <br><br>As all true sandwich shops they had a wide variety of soft beverages with the must of the true sugar cane colas hecho en Mexico. Â That combination was a suberbe. <br><br>The sandwich did not leave me any room for Ice Cream but did leave me some extra money I could spend wisely. Â <br><br>The only downfall is that you can see that it is just opened a year ago, and wires are very in sight. Â This could be easily modified and the owner was mentioning that he did all the work himself and he was planning to get some cool art work on the walls and apply for a wine license. Â That could beat my Mexiican Cola and would even be better.<br><br>The WIFI was amazingly fast and for Free! Â Please don&#39;t tell too many people as that could change with the beanies and beardies of SF downloading the latest mythbusters episodes :)",

The variety pack is perfect for those who want to try what they have to offer without purchasing a big bottle (I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll be back for more!). In addition, they have great customer service. Stan helped me this evening 30mins prior to closing and was very patient and kind. He also poured out more of the dipping oil for me to taste since they were running low. I told him it wasn&#39;t necessary since they would be closing and I didn&#39;t want to waste it, but he insisted. He even got me to try the hot chili oil, I definitely recommend it! <br><br>Stan&#39;s customer service convinced me to buy more as he got me to try different flavors. He wasn&#39;t pushy at all, just very helpful and informative. I will be coming back for more and maybe even for Christmas gifts. Thanks!!!!",

"reviewcomment":"One of my favorite places to shop of all time, I have started eating more healthy since I&#39;ve started to come here. <br><br>BULK FOOD. The bulk food section is amazing; this is really where you can get amazing value. Do you know how much you&#39;re spending in the supermarket when you buy spices in a new bottle eat time, and how much you can save when you buy cayenne or coriander out of bulk jars?<br><br>GET INSPIRED. I love the experience of bringing my own jars and have opened my mind up to cooking more, new recipes and new foods to try. The first time you come, I&#39;d recommend giving yourself an hour - it&#39;s a lot of fun to walk through the bulk foods aisle and see flours you never knew existed, be reminded of nuts that you had once heard were good for you, and realize that you forever more avoid store-bought peanut butter with their self-serve peanut butter section. Whoa!<br><br>PRODUCE. Produce items sometimes vary a bit in quality but.. hey, it&#39;s organic and if you&#39;ve never had a bad experience ever at any Safeway, I&#39;d be surprised.<br><br>CHEESE REGISTRY?! Great cheese selection. Did you know that they have a cheese registry? That&#39;s right - you can sign up and put your name on a list so that each time you come in, they&#39;ll refer to the list and let you know what cheeses you&#39;ve bought in the past in case you&#39;re trying to remember the name of that cheese you had a few months back.<br><br>SAMPLES. Cheese samples are always available and frequent food demonstrations (you can check online for the calendar of when tastings are happening).<br><br>Do note that this place is vegetarian, so if you&#39;re like me, you will have to go elsewhere for beef bouillon cubes or meat.<br><br>I try to go here weekly since I really can&#39;t see why I would go anywhere else to get the majority of my groceries. Love Rainbow!",

"reviewcomment":"Stop here every time I visit from LA. My family loves their preserved meats. I picked up some lap cheong, gon cheong (duck liver sausage) and lap ngap (duck legs). They have two kinds for the latter - one is the less salt version. I don&#39;t eat pork anymore but when I did, their lap cheong was probably my favorite way to eat pork! I tried a duck leg upon coming home -- it is soooo good. Just steam it and serve with steamed rice and plain veggies like bok choy. Heavenly. <br><br>Sausages are sold by the pound. I can&#39;t remember how much but I got a total of 13 pairs for $23 (26 sausages). They are larger than the packaged sausages you buy at the grocery store. The duck legs are $4.50 each. People were lining up for the pork belly but I don&#39;t know how to pick out the right ones. <br><br>I don&#39;t know when I&#39;ll be back again. I feel like I didn&#39;t buy enough this time.

"reviewcomment":"My friends and I had a sushi making party this past weekend. We originally went to a different vendor for the fish but had to return it all because they were no bueno. We called Basa and asked for a pound of salmon, tuna, and hamachi. They were really accommodating for the last minute order and even sliced all the fish for us. The three pounds of fish came out to $98- on the pricier side and parts of the fish were still frozen but one shouldn&#39;t go cheap with raw fish. The fish were all tasty and I would depend on Basa&#39;s fish again. <br>The staff was really friendly and they were generous about giving sides like wasabi and ginger. Even chopsticks.<br>This place not only sells fish by the pound but also meals like sandwiches, fish and chips, and rice bowls. There is a small sit-down area in the back and I think if I were in the area, I would want to eat here.",

"reviewcomment":"Sour Flour offers bread making workshops in the Mission District of San Francisco. I had a great experience here. I recently took their Starter Workshop. For this course, you learn the basic techniques to creating and maintaining wild yeast. The classes are small and hands on. The instructor Cat was great and engaging. It was cool that each person got to mix their own dough and in the end, we got to bake and eat our own flat breads. Also, you get to take home your own starter so you can start making bread at home. If you are interested in taking a class here, you should sign up early because their starter workshops fill up quick. I had to book mine about a month and a half in advance. Once you have taken a basics class, they do offer other workshops such as a bagel workshop and pizza workshop.<br><br>On a side note, Sour Flour teaches workshops in the kitchen located inside the La Victoria Bakery. It is not an exact school.",

"reviewcomment":"This place offers some of the best tea I&#39;ve ever had. Teas here range from $5 to around $13 for a 50g (1.8oz.) bag. For an extra two dollars, you can have your tea put in a tea tin. The bags are not resealable, so if you&#39;d like to keep your tea a little more fresh, you can just buy the tin. It costs around $4 to get a tin elsewhere if you decide you want one later. If you don&#39;t want loose leaf, they also offer 10 tea bag packs. Â You can also sample their tea of day. <br><br>My favorite thing about this place apart from the tea itself, is that the tea samples are left out for you to explore on your own. I like that I can run down the aisle and sniff all the teas I want at my own pace without feeling like I&#39;m tying up a sales associate and without feeling the pressure to buy anything. The employees themselves are helpful without being pushy. <br><br>A $30 purchase will give you a subscription to their product magazine and more importantly a free tea sample every month for a year! To add to the perks of shopping here, if you&#39;d like some of their tea but feel apprehensive about the price, you can get a 30% discount off of any tea that&#39;s within 3 months of the sell by date. Just check the date printed on the back of the package. A new bag should last you about 6 months, but with a little leg work you can find the discounted ones in there. Â I believe there is another significant discount when the tea is even closer to expiring, but I unfortunately can&#39;t remember it. <br><br>If it&#39;s your first time here and don&#39;t know what to get, the momo oolong supergrade appears to be really popular. However, my favorite one so far is sakurambo vert. Will definitely be back to try some other teas in the future.",

This woman can also rock vegan treats. Seriously - moist and tasty vegan cake. As a vegetarian, I haven&#39;t tried anything with her candied bacon, and I am pretty sure I am missing out big time.<br><br>You can find her at Bay Area Derby Girls bouts.

I grew up running the streets of SF and Chinatown and this is a place where my parents would shop for their restaurants. On my most recent visit the place has not changed except I think packed with even more cooking gadgets (and tourists). So a word of caution if you venture inside, don&#39;t wear a backpack. The aisles are tight that you run the risk of &#34;you break it you buy it&#34;. This is a serious place for those seeking knowledgeable wok cookery guidance.<br><br>On my recent visit, I found handmade wooden moon cake molds so I had to buy the last 3 (each were a different pattern).",

They are expensive but the quality is always good. I haven&#39;t tried the deli yet but it always looks really good! <br><br>They also carry this chocolate that&#39;s from SF that is soooo delicious. It doesn&#39;t have a brand name but it has ginger and pistachio flavors. Also very expensive though.",

Â They carry so many varieties of excellent whiskeys, scotch, etc. - you could spend so much time just browsing the various selections they have. Â  My husband loves bourbon, so I stopped in one afternoon to pick up a nice bottle for a little surprise for him after work. Â I ended up leaving with two different bottles of bourbon, as I couldn&#39;t decide on just one! Â The workers there are helpful as well, and can help you narrow down your choices; so don&#39;t feel overwhelmed and just walk out!<br><br>Definitely worth the stop in. Â Will definitely be back.",

You are a damn fool to buy your spices anywhere but here, and why anyone would want to buy produce at the Safeway down the street instead of this place is beyond me considering its proximity to far superior and well priced veggies at this market. <br><br>Secondly, the insane variety of what you can get from such a small store will surprise you. Stacks upon stacks of excellent products of the Mediterranean and Middle Eastern persuasion. Let me tell you, I may be Asian, but I love me some Persian food. This place hooks it up with Sangak, Barberries for Zereshk Polo (naturally), and plenty of Sadaf products that I would otherwise be deprived of in this city. <br><br>Lastly, I&#39;ve been going here for the past 7 years and I really love the staff here. I used to be intimidated by the ladies behind the counter, but they are totally rad once you get to know them, and the other guys that work there are extremely friendly and helpful.

EVER. <br><br>I love how the crepe itself comes out CRISPY, warm, and sweet. Theres a wide selection of toppings and ice cream you can put inside your crepe, BUT THEIR WHIPPED CREAM IS FREAKING ON POINT AND TO DIE FOR. They also have premade combinations of crepes, and the green tea ice cream/red bean paste is on the top of my list. I alternate between that one and a vanilla ice creme/nutella/banana + whipped cream crepe!<br><br>This place is also a cute little Japanese markets that sells things like green tea Kitkats and Pocky all the way to Gatsy hair products and Shiseido face masks.

The wine selections are fantastic, the food options pair perfectly with the wine and the ambiance has the feel of a well appointed lounge. There are a lot of options to imbibe around the Union Square area, but you are looking for a place that prides itself on having the best of everything an oenophile would want - this is the spot to go. <br><br>In addition to all the great wine and food, they have standout service that sets them apart from the cookie cutter hospitality service you get from the average establishment. The ENO team is passionate and knowledgeable, truly going above and beyond to ensure you have an enjoyable experience. This very mantra was put to the test last night as we hosted a full buyout event for 200 people. The quality of the food and drink along with the stellar service did not waver despite the number of people being served. The staff was always friendly and professional and all of our guests were extremely pleased with the food and wine spread. <br><br>I wholeheartedly recommend ENO for a casual glass of wine to unwind or as a venue for your next special bash. When it comes to serving a small table to a large party, they maintain a standard of excellence that reflects the pride they have in their establishment.",

I&#39;ve tried Ike&#39;s and loved it, but this beats it by a million because not only does it taste better but the because of it&#39;s price, it&#39;s location to my house, and it&#39;s nonexistent line.....it wins!",

"reviewcomment":"Yelp is my confessional. Â Overall, I&#39;m always open to new things and willing to try anything that my pocketbook can handle. Â And, because it&#39;s sort of rare when the bf wants to do something, I will always tag along to whatever he wants to do. Â I guess it&#39;s sort of a tradeoff for those times when he comes into bookstores or girly stores that I want to go into. Â So, I will sometimes be apprehensive on where we go when he chooses...<br><br>That said, I did want to come to this boutique, but I was a bit concerned about the prices. Â This is a place that my cheap-ass would not normally go into. Â I felt a little intimidated walking through the front doors to this place, and we waited a short time before being serviced and shown to our table. Â Everything is really nice. Â Like, really nice. Â So nice that I don&#39;t know what I was doing there this morning when we visited....<br><br>Once we were seated, we were handed our menus. Â The waiter came by, we ordered a few things, and waited. Â The bf ordered the iced cappuccino with a very strong (rank 8) espresso, Â which he liked and thought it was made very well. Â I got the iced latte, which was AMAZING. Â It had the shot of espresso (rank 4), 2 scoops of ice cream, whipped cream on top, and cinnamon on top of that. Â It wasn&#39;t too sweet, and it complemented very well with the espresso.<br><br>For a meal, the bf had the pulled pork sliders. Â It was cooked correctly, had fresh bread, and the meat was just perfect. Â A little fatty and a little pricey for what he got, but he thoroughly enjoyed it. Â <br><br>We also ordered the creme brulee for dessert. Â Not sure what may have happened, but we were waiting a bit longer than what was probably normal. Â The waiter apologized for the wait and provided two macaroons to try while we were waiting. Â One was mint, which wasn&#39;t bad, and the other was a chocolate, which was very good. Â We eventually had the creme brulee brought to us, with ice cream on the side. Â The actual custard part of the creme brulee had espresso in it (of course), as well as raspberries. Â Overall, the creme brulee was good, but not the best we&#39;ve ever had.<br><br>This is a place that I would not go every day, but it is a place I would love to go to when I need a good sugar rush and have the funds to splurge a little. Â The prices are a little high, but you are paying for being in their very nice cafe, and the quality of their foods/work/service. Â The service here was top-notch, and we had no problems whatsoever. Â Will likely come back whenever we visit SF again.",

Even with the plethora of tantalizing restaurants in the neighborhood, Wooly Pig kept me coming back for more. I ate nearly every sandwich on the menu, enjoyed every panna cotta, sipped tea and lemonade, and supped all the soups I could. Each dish and drink is unabashed in its flavor - the ingredients really shine. On top of this, owner Lieng and his staff are just about the nicest people you&#39;ll meet.<br><br>My favorites:<br>+ Bahn Mi - I actually prefer this over the Wooly Pig<br>+ Cream of Shiitake Mushroom soup - I want this in heaven<br>+ Curry Udon Soup - Comforting, like a favorite sweater; note: there was one soup that I thought was a little salty - can&#39;t remember any more if it was this one<br>+ Thai Tea Panna Cotta - Oh so good<br>+ Honey ginger tea - Not for the faint of hearts, as this is super gingery; but if ginger is your thing, definitely get this<br><br>Also delicious:<br>Briny Egg, Mozzarella Pesto, Wooly Pig, Croque Monsieur, Vegi, Almond Panna Cotta, Corn Chowder<br><br>Not as into:<br>~ Kahlua Pulled Pork special - too saucy for me, ended up taking a drop home on my pants...<br><br>Wooly Pig, please come to the South Bay or Peninsula!",

The place is a little small with outdoor tables on the side walk with street parking only. Decor was inviting, although you felt like you were in Tin Man&#39;s house. The food was great!!! Even if the place was a dump and staff were rude, food alone deserves the 5 stars. <br><br>I had the Jake&#39;s Meal ( a 2 step meal choice) with Step 1: Choose your protein and Step 2: Choose your sauce, accompanied with Royal Rice Pilaf, Siracha House Slaw, and Chef&#39;s Salad with Citrus dressing. <br><br>I chose the Flashy Fried Chicken and Sweet &#39;n&#39; Tangy BBQ Sauce with a side of Mac &#39;n&#39; Cheese Sticks.<br><br>Food tasted fresh, energetic, portion appropriate, and healthy. I would come to Jake&#39;s Place for the Mac &#39;n&#39; cheese sticks alone. Thinking of the deep fried mac &#39;n&#39; cheese stick goodness makes me crave it. Price is what you would expect to pay for fresh ingredients.<br><br>Staff were very friendly. They were playing music I enjoyed so I walked over to their Jambox speaker and turned it up. I apologized for touching their belongings, but I was glad I did it since they accepted my poor boundaries and encouraged me to dance and enjoy the music with them as they handed me my food.<br><br>So to sum it up:<br>Pros:<br>Staff were very friendly<br>Food was tasty, fresh, clean, and good looking.<br><br>Cons: <br>Place is a little small and not good for groups.<br><br>Recommendations:<br>Order for pick up and get the mac &#39;n&#39; cheese sticks.",

Now it&#39;s sort of an addiction :-) I initially tried the Masala chai which I found a bit strong for my taste but sampled the Rose and was blown away that I actually loved it. It has a floral flavor but it&#39;s so good and doesn&#39;t need any seasoning. It&#39;s truly delish.<br><br>I like the ppl that work at the truck always so nice. The prices still compare to a Peets or Starbucks bc I think they know they can make their dime yay way but it&#39;s still valued over a designer coffee place any day!<br><br>I&#39;m super impressed by the simplicity of it and I think great things of my new addiction :-)",

When I saw the &#34;People love us on Yelp&#34; sticker today in All States I KNEW it was time for an update.<br><br>I am a weekly regular customer now. I try to make it a point to visit All States every week on the day I am in San Francisco. I have got my Mom hooked too. We can always find great deals here on produce and other goodies and always love to visit Mo and his brothers who help run the store. We love these guys. They honestly treat you like family. Â Their kindness alone will make you want to come back and shop. <br><br>Seasonal fruits and veggies are coming in fast. All States has some really awesome promotional sale prices on fresh produce. They are constantly restocking and sometimes you can even pick right out of the box they picked up that morning during produce haul. I have got some GORGEOUS asparagus right out of the box, super fresh and on awesome sale (.99 cents - 1.99lb &#34;a bunch&#34; depending on sale - any figure in that range is a super good value). Today we scored some gorgeous plump and ripe seasonal figs and berries as well as other great produce finds. I am happy to see my Mom buy so many fresh fruits and veggies there when we go. Today she made herself a nice little picnic with some of her All State scores: fresh figs, cheese, cashews and personal sized avocados and Mo hooked her up with utensils and an area to wash some of her fruit she planned to go eat. He is so sweet. <br><br>This family really takes pride in keeping up their business, keeping well stocked and keeping their customers happy. This family and store is truly a gift to San Francisco.",

"reviewcomment":"AMAZING. I&#39;ve been here on several occasions for small impromptu social gatherings with a couple of girlfriends and loved it. The wine selections are fantastic, the food options pair perfectly with the wine and the ambiance has the feel of a well appointed lounge. There are a lot of options to imbibe around the Union Square area, but you are looking for a place that prides itself on having the best of everything an oenophile would want - this is the spot to go. <br><br>In addition to all the great wine and food, they have standout service that sets them apart from the cookie cutter hospitality service you get from the average establishment. The ENO team is passionate and knowledgeable, truly going above and beyond to ensure you have an enjoyable experience. This very mantra was put to the test last night as we hosted a full buyout event for 200 people. The quality of the food and drink along with the stellar service did not waver despite the number of people being served. The staff was always friendly and professional and all of our guests were extremely pleased with the food and wine spread. <br><br>I wholeheartedly recommend ENO for a casual glass of wine to unwind or as a venue for your next special bash. When it comes to serving a small table to a large party, they maintain a standard of excellence that reflects the pride they have in their establishment.",

Â You place an order online, and they have it out to you (even the Outer Sunset) within an hour. Â The wine is from boutique wineries and offered at a discount. Â If you don&#39;t like the wine, they&#39;ll send you another.<br><br>Of course, I haven&#39;t had that problem...<br><br>They&#39;re constantly running specials, such as $10 off a regular order (2 bottles that range from $20-30 altogether). Â Occasionally, there are some far-more-expensive bottles, but those emails are regretfully deleted, lest I think my bank account is more highfalutin&#39; than it really is.<br><br>It&#39;s a great option for parties, frantic gift-giving, after-hours work happy hours, or anyone who dislikes the outside world.

Organic, local, free range, grass fed, etc...it&#39;s awesome!<br><br>Got fresh kale, happy boy farm carrots, local organic apples, pears, and their own free range chicken sausage and pork sausage. Husband who is a foodie snob loved the sausage and produce. Also got a loaf of fresh organic whole wheat baguette - this is pretty hard to find.<br><br>Their produce is up there with the Ferry Building, Monterey Market and Berkeley Bowl quality.<br><br>If I lived around here, I would probably come here almost every week for groceries.

"reviewcomment":"I&#39;m not a coffee snob, I am a Gold Card toting Starbucks visiting kind of guy. Â Every now and again, I spice it up with some CBTL. Â But this place completely blew my mind. Â I&#39;ve only had it twice, being a So Cal resident and native, but it&#39;s really ruined the chain coffee shops for me. Â In fact, now I can understand why the hipsters here are always going on and on about these small, independent coffee spots, because Blue Bottle has definitely converted me. Â <br><br>Both times I&#39;ve been there, I&#39;ve gotten the New Orleans Iced Coffee. Â The first time last year, I may or may not have partaken in the local medication of SF, but all I added was milk and it simply blew me away. Â I usually need sweetener in my coffee, but milk was all I needed here. Â It was sweet enough with just milk, and it had subtle notes of dark chocolate at the end. Â When I got my usual iced coffee the next time at Starbucks, I almost couldn&#39;t drink it. Â <br><br>I went again for the second time about 2 weeks ago to try it again, and got the New Orleans IC and streusel: Â Just as good. One of the baristas mentioned that there was going to be a store opening up in Culver City or some other hipster area in So Cal, and I&#39;m eagerly anticipating that.",

"reviewcomment":"What an incredible neighborhood restaurant! Going in to this dinner I knew the food was going to be good, but I didn&#39;t expect it to be exceptional. Baker and Banker is hands down one of the best meals I&#39;ve had in San Francisco! <br><br>Appetizer: House smoked trout &amp; hamachi crudo. The house smoked trout is a MUST order!!! I wasn&#39;t too crazy about the hamachi, there was something very tangy in the sauce that kind of threw me off...<br><br>Entree: Paella Risotto. I know right? A Paella made with risotto?! That was my first reaction and I&#39;m glad I went with my instinct and ordered it. It was absolutely exceptional! The flavors were bold and the quantity was just the right amount. <br><br>Desserts: I was a little disappointed that they didn&#39;t have the banana bread pudding that everyone was ranting and raving about here on yelp. I think they change up their menu quite often. Anyway, we ordered the banana, chocolate and peanut butter crisp with toffee crunch ice cream. OMG!!!! Heaven. In. My. Mouth. It was absolutely delish!!!!!!<br><br>We also got the coconut cream pie, it was delicious as well but the first dessert was significantly better. <br><br>Overall, love the vibe- not too formal, not casual, great service, amazing food :)",

I consider myself something of an Earl Grey connoisseur and their EG sorbet is divine... tea-y and citrusy, not overly strong or sweet. Yum!<br><br>Erin, the owner, is lovely and it&#39;s obvious she is truly passionate about what she does. I appreciate her attention to quality and pureness of flavor. I do wish they had a gluten-free sandwich available regularly but even still, I&#39;m super happy with the other g-free offerings, of which there are plenty!<br><br>I am definitely putting G-Cream on my short list for my next special event.

"reviewcomment":"I&#39;m a native San Franciscan, and I&#39;ve been priced out of my hometown. <br><br>I can&#39;t afford the rent. <br>And now, I can&#39;t afford the pastries. <br><br>$4.50 for a pastry. That&#39;s what I paid at B Patisserie for a Kouign Amann. And like that covetable 700 sq feet apartment in Civic Center/Hayes Valley that I was paying an arm and a leg for, I happily paid it.<br><br>I don&#39;t know what a Kouign Amann is nor where it comes from. I just know that it Â is $4.50 for the flakiest, most buttery, lightest, crispiest, perfectly sweet pastry I&#39;ve ever had. It&#39;s like a croissant x 10. I&#39;ve never understood the appeal of $5 pastries from Tartine, but this, THIS, I get. I&#39;m not a dessert person, but I LOVE this little pastry. The original was already super yummy. I just tried the chocolate Kouign Amann = YUUUUM. Savig the ginger-pear Kouign Amann for my evening snack tonight! <br><br>MMMM, a must-try and well worth the 15 times you will circle the block looking for parking only to illegally park at a red zone down the street while one person sprints to buy pastries and the other anxiously waits to move their car.",

"reviewcomment":"I have two separate reviews of Phoebe that I will roll into one.<br><br>First, I took a few different &#34;group&#34; cooking classes with Phoebe as a work event and then with co-workers. Â The events were mostly important fun, secondly she had us make food that we could realistically recreate on our own after, and third, she gave us hints along the way that were helpful for cooking in general. Â After cooking, we would sit down at her table and eat together in a nice, cozy setting. Â While her kitchen isn&#39;t enormous (it isn&#39;t small either), we didn&#39;t have any problems with the 10 or so people cooking there.<br><br>Separately, I asked her for personalized cooking lessons after that to help me with cooking quick, tasty, and nutritious meals for my daughter. Â These sessions were absolutely wonderful as she taught me basic, intermediate, and more advanced cooking skills that I have continued to apply today. Â I also go to sample a bunch of the foods she was cooking for her clients, which were delicious.<br><br>I&#39;m surprised to read a review below saying she wasn&#39;t particularly friendly. Â I found Phoebe to be genuinely friendly at all the events - a nice contrast to the sort of fake &#34;I need to be super friendly because I&#39;m being paid&#34; mentality you can sometimes find.",

Speakeasy is borderline ghetto Third street, but it&#39;s a great place to go if you&#39;re looking for great beer in a spacious bar with sexy 1920s prohibition vibe. They have the bar with two mini rooms if you have a large group to go with. They also allow you to wander to the back where all the magic happens. This place has become my favorite place to go because it&#39;s honestly really difficult to get great beer in SF for cheap. <br><br>Pros:<br>Plenty of parking<br>Large selection of their beers available on tap<br>Sexy am-BeyoncÃ© <br>$3 Happy hour (1-6pm<br><br>Cons:<br>Not open for late night",

And god help you if you decide that you want a sandwich of some sort, as you will hear a huge amount of groans and complaining from the rest of the drunk customers who just want those fresh delicious donuts. I got glazed donuts and donut holes that were so fresh they just melted in your mouth.

"reviewcomment":"Cindy&#39;s market offers a great selection of deli items for lunch as well as all of my favorite beers and snacks. They also have competitive prices on typical corner store items ($2 coconut water!) . I just wish Cindy&#39;s was the corner store across the street from my apartment instead of Deli Plus ($3 coconut water) a few blocks down . <br><br>They also have a good selection of produce that you may need in a pinch (not necessarily the most fresh but not bad), good bread, and even vegetarian bacon. So glad to have this place in the neighborhood.",

Grab a spoon... or a grain if it&#39;s Ghost Pepper Sea Salt), they have an incredible selection, and the owners are super friendly! I love that all containers come in different sizes depending on your needs, and the prices are really reasonable for the quality. We&#39;ve come here for staples as well as blends, looking for specific salts as well as chatting them up to seek recommendations and we&#39;ve yet to be disappointed. <br><br>You can tell that there&#39;s a passion for food and flavours when you come in here, which is why I love it so much. I have a feeling that our rack will end up having exclusively SpiceAce jars..",

But cafe au lat is good enough for me. <br>Another must have, cinnamon roll. I&#39;m not a cinnamon person, but I like their cinnamon roll.",

The bolognese sauce was probably one the most rich and flavorful I&#39;ve ever had. My husband knew he was in for a great meal when he smelled the delicious sauce bubbling in the kitchen. <br><br>The total was only $16 for dinner for two.

No show. No text saying she&#39;d be late...no response. So while I was waiting I looked over the entire menu, observed the folks casually enjoying their morning brews in the parklet seating area, and checked out some of the small details of the shop. <br><br>This place is like the perfect combination of things: bike shop, coffee shop, good food, and even beer with a happy hour! Can this place be more hipster than that?! <br><br>Anyway, I chalked up the date as a loss and ordered myself a breakfast bagel to go and went home. The bagel hit the spot and I&#39;m glad that I at least got to enjoy some kind of bagel! <br><br>I shall return! Hopefully I&#39;ll have a more successful bagel and check out the little garden in the back. Oh! And don&#39;t forget that the cafe is cash only.",

"reviewcomment":"I have so much love for this market!<br><br>I used to live just across the street and came here almost every day. Everything is top quality. We would get fresh sashimi-grade fish and make our own hand rolls. Sometimes (for lunch) I would get their sushi or chirashi or curry to go. For breakfast I got their onigiri. When I&#39;m lucky they would make one to my order (only happened once). Everything is fresh, very well made, and you feel the careful craft of their food in your hands. <br><br>The only complaint I can think of, is that they don&#39;t carry a big variety of veggies. But I think Japanese don&#39;t eat that many veggies anyway....<br><br>I moved away (only about 15 mins away) so I don&#39;t really go there anymore. But I will always remember those sunny afternoons in the quietness of Japantown walking into the market, happily planning what to eat for lunch.",

But munchery just blew my mind. I heard good things about it from coworkers so I decided to give it a try when my bf and I were too lazy to go out. I still can&#39;t believe how cheap their food is (considering the quality and the fact that it&#39;s organic). I mean, how do they even make money? They&#39;re amazing. <br><br>They have a diverse selection of dishes to choose from online- I&#39;ve seen steak, burgers Moroccan chicken, pad Thai, ramen, pho, and so much more. They also have side dishes like salads and soup, dessert and wine! You can even read about the chefs that prepare your food! Pretty cool. <br><br>I loved everything that we decided to order and I also love how they&#39;re in oven/microwave-safe trays so we didn&#39;t even have to wash any dishes! The asparagus/pine nut salad was really fresh. Our steak was so good! We had to heat it up a bit more than instructed because it was still cold, but when ready, it was so tender and juicy- definitely restaurant-quality. I really liked my spring pasta that came with my steak too. We also ordered the zucchini apple oat bread and vanilla buttercream cake- both were so deliciously moist and the butter cream was perfect! Oh and they even gave us 2 really good and huge chocolate chip cookies for free with our order!<br><br>Not only is their food delicious, but they&#39;re also so punctual! We chose the 7-8pm time slot for delivery and they arrived at 7pm sharp. They even beat us home! <br><br>Tip: order a few days in advance because some dishes sell out!",

Â I&#39;ll get one every time I go to Japantown now.<br>I didn&#39;t know the corner store &#34;Benkyodo&#34; makes mocha from scratch every day. Â The fresh mocha is 100 times better!!<br>We&#39;ve tried &#34;onigiri&#34; (Japanese rice ball), &#34;taiyaki&#34; (baked fish shape cake), udon.....<br><br>Last stop is Dosa Indian restaurant. Â I like the idea that because it&#39;s in Japantown, why not includes them? Â It&#39;s an open minded community! Â <br>Dosa is a very elegant and high end Indian restaurant, we&#39;ve been there before and like it a lot. Â They made the signature Dosa and homemade gin tonic for the tour which was great! <br><br>Tour guide was this very sweet Japanese lady who lives in Japantown. Â She started with the history of the Japanese community, not too much to bored us. Â She does a great job introducing Japanese food and culture. Â She made the 3 and a half hour tour very pleasant!<br>I couldn&#39;t say enough great things about the tour!",

Produce is always fresh and varietal and the people who run this business are nice and appreciate their customers. I come in without a specific list and buy whatever they have to offer that day.

Â I never thought of yelping for actual shabu meat, bc I always bought shabu meat from Japanese grocery stores. Â <br><br>We got invited to a hotpot dinner and we had to bring the meat. Â I took the 30 bus got off at Stockton &amp; pacific and walked up a 1/2 block. Â It doesn&#39;t look like much, but the old Chinese guy helped me and he even spoke English (which is surprising in Chinatown). Â I told him I wanted 2 lbs of snowflake beef for hotpot. Â He showed me the beef and weighed it in front of me before slicing it in the back. Â He was super nice and the beef was great! Â <br><br>Everyone said it was better than ranch99 beef, but the quality is probably inline with the Japanese grocery stores. Â It&#39;s hard for me to judge without having both in front of me. Â My guess is it&#39;s cheaper than nijya or suruki, but I&#39;ll have to check next time. Â Overall, the beef and service were quality!",

Sure, if you want really cheap stuff, hit up the Inner Richmond. But the stuff they sell here is like Whole Foods level goodness for so much cheaper. I swear, my yuppie organic mongering friends have given me their grocery lists so I can snag quality goodies for them from here.<br><br>Even more amazing than the products is the people themselves!! I love everyone who works here. They are never without a smile or a helpful tidbit about picking the ripest pineapple or the freshest greens. They really make sure their customers get the best stuff available. They also carry rare Hawaiian papayas (insanely delicious) and save some for their favorite regulars...hohoho. <br><br>I love just strolling in here randomly at all hours. I never feel the need to buy all my groceries at once anymore. Whenever I need something for a quick meal, I just pop on over to this place for a breath of fresh air and the experience is always pleasant and makes me so wonderfully happy to live here.",

"reviewcomment":"I would have never known this place existed if it wasn&#39;t for a certain &#34;dark&#34; co-worker that loves his coffee like he lives his life. In total darkness. He brought in a bag of their extra dark French roast. I thought it was &#34;ok&#34; but not worth $15 a pound... <br><br>A recent experience left us with nothing but Folgers &#34;French Roast&#34; in the cupboard *puke* Never again! Never Again! So I check online and find it&#39;s only $10.25 for Fair Trade Organic French Roast! Seriously? That&#39;s about as much as you can get stale Peet&#39;s and Starbucks from Safeway since they usually come in smaller 12oz bags. It&#39;s also considerably cheaper than what the new coffee houses Ritual, Four Barrel, etc. are charging. Is the taste on the same level? No, not quite. It&#39;s more than serviceable for the price. I will continue to try new roasts here until I find the one I like most. Right now the Dark Sumatra $13/lb is hitting the spot.<br><br>I&#39;ve driven by here on 10th st without even knowing it exists. Super nondescript location! The interior of this place is nothing fancy at all. While they have tables and chairs, and even sell pastries, it screams FACTORY rather than coffee shop. They have a glass partition where you can watch the workers packing freshly roasted beans into huge trashcans. <br><br>It&#39;s not a hip place on Valencia but maybe that&#39;s why I like it so much. Another reason to appreciate it is the employees here are excellent. No aloof hipsters in sight... After our recent purchase the cashier told us to help ourselves to a few cups of joe while we waited for our brew to be ground and packaged. Of course we had to take him up on that offer!<br><br>While I don&#39;t have a need for this place for home use as I am a recent Nespresso convert <a href='http://www.yelp.com/biz/nespresso-boutique-san-francisco#hrid:jj1oIAb51P9fxJocPWJ0_A'>yelp.com/biz/nespresso-bâ¦</a> it makes an excellent and economical coffee for use at work. Since I like to start my work day with a delicious cup of coffee and some computer work *cough* Yelp *cough* Capricorn helps me do this at a reasonable cost.",

"reviewcomment":"I first stepped into a Coffee Bean on a recent trip to Las Vegas, and was impressed with the quality of their ice blended coffees; in fact, their Pumpkin Spice ice blended coffee was the best of the many coffees I had during vacation there.<br><br>Researching them a little more on the web, I found out they were not some small independent, but in fact the oldest and largest private specialty coffee and tea retailer in the U.S., celebrating their 50th anniversary in business this year. Although they are huge in Southern California, and interestingly, overseas in Asia, they only have four coffee shops in Northern California, three of these in San Francisco. So this small Coffee Bean in the Embarcadero Center is actually the tip of a very large coffee iceberg!<br><br>Like the couple Coffee Beans I visited in Las Vegas, the Embarcadero Center shop is small, comfy and friendly. There are a decent amount of places to sit, as well as a few tables outside. And of course, being in the Embarcadero Center, you&#39;ll never find a shortage of places to sit and watch the people.<br><br>I ordered one of their holiday special drinks, a Toffee Nut ice blended coffee. It was delicious, and a unique flavor I haven&#39;t seen elsewhere. Although it was November, the weather was still pleasant enough to sit outside and watch the comings and goings of everyone while sipping my coffee. All in all, a delightful coffee break.<br><br>Now that I know it&#39;s here, I&#39;ll make a point of visiting the Coffee Bean when I&#39;m in the area.",

It has a floral flavor but it&#39;s so good and doesn&#39;t need any seasoning. It&#39;s truly delish.<br><br>I like the ppl that work at the truck always so nice. The prices still compare to a Peets or Starbucks bc I think they know they can make their dime yay way but it&#39;s still valued over a designer coffee place any day!<br><br>I&#39;m super impressed by the simplicity of it and I think great things of my new addiction :-)",

Â He ordered the Onion Soup and it was delicious. Â Best I have tasted. Â My sandwich was great. Â My friends loved their club sandwich. <br><br>I find La Boulange&#39;s cafe au laits Â the best in SF -- and this is saying a lot in a city full of great cafes. But the icing on the cake is that when we returned a hour later to buy some bread to take home, Christina (one of the managers) prepared a small tuna melt (and then cut it into 4&#39;s) so my friends and I could taste it. Â It was amazing and so is she!<br><br>Next visit to SF, I will be back to the Polk location for a tuna melt and cup of onion soup. OH, and did I mention their Congolais?

New favorite corner cafÃ©.<br><br>As someone who lives just a block from Velo Rouge, the fact that I&#39;m willing to walk ten times as far to go to Fifty/Fifty says a lot. I love Velo Rouge, but sometimes a girl gets tired of Blue Bottle. There. I said it.<br><br>Fifty/Fifty serves Ritual coffee, and the people who work there are so nice that they make me want to cry out of happiness/relief. It&#39;s really fascinating that it&#39;s actually possible to be a friendly, charming person AND make a delicious cappuccino. I thought that you had to be rude/aloof/busy-reading-pretentious-literature-Â­behind-the-counter to even stand within five feet of an espresso machine.

"reviewcomment":"I first stepped into a Coffee Bean on a recent trip to Las Vegas, and was impressed with the quality of their ice blended coffees; in fact, their Pumpkin Spice ice blended coffee was the best of the many coffees I had during vacation there.<br><br>Researching them a little more on the web, I found out they were not some small independent, but in fact the oldest and largest private specialty coffee and tea retailer in the U.S., celebrating their 50th anniversary in business this year. Although they are huge in Southern California, and interestingly, overseas in Asia, they only have four coffee shops in Northern California, three of these in San Francisco. So this small Coffee Bean in the Embarcadero Center is actually the tip of a very large coffee iceberg!<br><br>Like the couple Coffee Beans I visited in Las Vegas, the Embarcadero Center shop is small, comfy and friendly. There are a decent amount of places to sit, as well as a few tables outside. And of course, being in the Embarcadero Center, you&#39;ll never find a shortage of places to sit and watch the people.<br><br>I ordered one of their holiday special drinks, a Toffee Nut ice blended coffee. It was delicious, and a unique flavor I haven&#39;t seen elsewhere. Although it was November, the weather was still pleasant enough to sit outside and watch the comings and goings of everyone while sipping my coffee. All in all, a delightful coffee break.<br><br>Now that I know it&#39;s here, I&#39;ll make a point of visiting the Coffee Bean when I&#39;m in the area.",

It was a tall order to make cake delicious enough for such a happy and important occasion, but Pinkie&#39;s exceeded expectations. <br><br>The chocolate ganache with sea salt was the crowd favorite. My sister-in-law, who is not a &#34;cake person,&#34; pronounced it &#34;the best cake [she has] ever eaten.&#34; People came back for seconds, even thirds. This cake is rich, super chocolate-y, and the flakes of salt on top are so, so good.<br><br>Our other flavor was the lemon chiffon with coconut flakes. I adored this, and those who either tried both or resisted the chocolate, loved it, too. The frosting is incredible, the cake crumb is moist, and the lemon curd filling is tart and lovely. <br><br>I would definitely order from Pinkie&#39;s again and highly recommend. As we had them write on the cakes, &#34;Boo yeah!&#34; and &#34;Huzzah!&#34;",

"reviewcomment":"Tried Fogcutter out this week at OtG: UN Plaza. I&#39;m not sure how long this truck has been around but I recently discovered them. :) <br><br>I ordered the Dolores torta. It was simply delicious. The meat was very tasty, and an egg with it made it even better. Everything about it was awesome! The price of the torta was not bad, $7 I think. The food comes out quick, so you won&#39;t be waiting long. Then again there wasn&#39;t a lot of people in line at the time I went. If you want a tasty sandwich and great service, go to Fogcutter. Follow them on twitter or Facebook for their location.<br><br>I&#39;m a fan and I can&#39;t wait to try Fogcutter again!",

"reviewcomment":"After seeing masses of locals hopping in line, I decided to throw my hat in as well. Â Turning to yelp, I learned that the piece de resistance here is the egg custard tart. Â Despite being only 8 or so people back in line (a very long line developed behind me), it still took 20-30 minutes to get my coveted tart. Â People in front of me ordered by the dozen, and the ladies behind the counter were pulling them out of the oven as fast as possible but not keeping up with the demand. Â The tarts are $1.80 each, which is a steal for how filling they are. Â The flaky, crispy crust is delicious. Â Where the custard started to set up and cool around the edges, I thought it was good. Â Eggy, but slightly sweet. Â For me, the hot jiggly center wasn&#39;t ideal, but I&#39;m happy I tried it and got the GG Bakery experience. Â <br><br>I also ordered COCONUT MACAROONS, which can only be ordered in half dozen amounts. Â While I didn&#39;t think I needed that many, I was later SOOOO glad I got them. Â By far the best coconut macaroon I&#39;ve ever eaten. Â It was carmelized and buttery and crunchy on the outside with a nice, sweet, soft, coconut bite in the middle. Â I left the bakery to bike around the City for the day, and I was so thankful to have these gems in my bag to stave off starvation.",

I used to depend on Flywheel on Stanyan for that business, but eventually they took it off their menu and disappointed me forever.

"reviewcomment":"I had my wedding here last weekend and it was a dream come true! Patty helped me from start to finish, from showing us around the winery, to the rehearsal, and eventually coordinating the day. She was so helpful, kind, patient, and fun to work with! When we first visited the winery, my fiance and I fell in love with the breathtaking views and beautiful pavilion area. We knew we wanted our wedding here and signed the contract that day! We chose a day in February because of the discounted winter rate and prayed for a sunny day-which we got! The wind was still icy cold but it was gorgeous and sunny.<br><br>On the wedding day, we arrived and the girls went directly to the bridal suite. It was a perfect and cute little room where we got ready. There was a balcony outside which we would&#39;ve used more if it was warmer. The guys had their own room too upstairs. We had two hours to freshen up, relax, and take photos.<br><br>When I walked out to the ceremony with my mom by my side, it was more beautiful than I ever imagined! The wooden pavilion overlooks the vineyard and bay area, and since it was sunny and clear, we had a great view--though I was just staring at my now husband. After the cocktail hour and so many photos, we went to the reception. Surrounded by glass windows, family, and friends, we ate while watching the sun set. It was perfect. We were rushed at the end because we were going over time, but Patty was so gracious and patient with us, and throughout the whole day I was put to ease because I knew she was helping coordinate. If you&#39;re looking for a gorgeous venue for your wedding and love the rustic and naturey feel--look no further. It was the best day ever! :)",

I ate nearly every sandwich on the menu, enjoyed every panna cotta, sipped tea and lemonade, and supped all the soups I could.

Good flavor and reasonably priced at $2. The 2nd item I purchased was the pork chewy cookies. Theyre fattening and delicious though. Probably has lard, Â but what has lard that doesnt taste good? Theyre the rite thickness so u dont pull any cavity fillings out.<br>They make the best cow ear snack crackers!! Pricey at $4 a bag, makes u wanna stretch em ovr a week.

Forgive me.<br><br>i&#39;ve edited the review. i returned the following day (yup forgot to check-in AGAIN). my co-worker requested some loh poh beng. $2 each but they fit jus nicely in a small square plastic container that they packed em in. the owner scotch taped it so it wouldnt pop open (and deterred me from jacking one).<br>i also upped MMB from 4 stars to 5 STARS<br>so u can tell, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS BAKERY. it has some old school yummy items (read as, stuff still made of lard, which makes the pastry flakey and delicious)",

"reviewcomment":"Okay, so to begin my confession; if the SeÃ±or Sisig truck were a person, I&#39;d have a restraining order slapped on me by now. Seriously, I&#39;d be ordered to stay 100 feet away from them at all times or found in violation of my parole. I&#39;d have to have my blood drawn weekly and tested for calemansi juice and coconut vinegar, I&#39;d have to register when I move to a new neighborhood, and I woudln&#39;t be legally permitted to own chopsticks. THAT good.<br><br>So I go where they go, like a dutiful groupie. And this night, this is where they were. I didn&#39;t get anything else, but I definitely saw some I&#39;d like to try on another night.<br><br>Shockingly, I got parking. But it looks like it was dumb luck and others weren&#39;t as lucky.",

It&#39;s nearly impossible to get the same nutritionals as a Berrylicious smoothie without paying more.<br><br>TIP #3: Get a loyalty card--buy 7 smoothies, get your eighth one free. <br><br>Confession: sometimes, after work when I&#39;m really tired, I stop by here to get a meal replacement smoothie and call it a night. It&#39;s filling, nutritious, and yummy. It&#39;s quick and easy. It&#39;s in my gym. So what if I didn&#39;t work out right before dinner? Work is one really long workout. (I know, excuses, excuses.)<br><br>If you&#39;re looking for a supersweet candy treat smoothie, go to Jamba Juice. <br><br>They also offer breakfast for us earlybirds at the gym: oatmeal with toppings, bagels, coffee, and tea. Cheaper than a comparable meal at Starbucks or any other cafe, and probably healthier too. And sometimes, if they made too much of a smoothie, they pour the leftover stuff into little sample cups.

"reviewcomment":"Agree with others--this places gets 5 stars because Hanna knows how to run a true neighborhood market. While you won&#39;t find organic food or high end specialty items (go to Little Vine on Grant for those), Hanna stocks a crazy variety of items, makes tasty homemade dishes (try the chicken salad!), signs for packages when you&#39;re not home, and is always happy to chit chat with the local residents. He has surprised me time and time again by having items in stock that I didn&#39;t think he would--a single sweet potato, C batteries, capers, fresh dill, double sided tape, brown rice, powdered sugar, the list goes on! My favorite story to tell: we were getting into our car, parked next to Fog Hill while telling our friend how that store has everything. Car didn&#39;t start, and Hanna walks out w/ a car jump starter and starts our car for us. So yes, he does have everything. :) So glad to have this place in the neighborhood.",

"reviewcomment":"The Whole Tortilla provided food for my work party this past week and they were a big hit. The tamales come in neat little pie tins which are extra awesome when flipped over and covered in guacamole sauce. Vanessa helped me order enough food for 50-75 people. By the end of the night no food was left and no one went hungry, so it was just right. If anything we could have ordered more tamales, and less salad and beans, but that was because we might have overestimated the number of vegetarians. <br><br>Definitely get a variety of their drinks, which were enjoyed by non-drinkers and drinkers alike. Adding a splash of tequila to the cucumber mint and mango drinks made it a really tasty mixed drink. <br><br>If they had delivery or sold their little tamale pies in local stores here, I can see myself getting these regularly.",

"reviewcomment":"I finally had a chance to try Lovejoy&#39;s gluten free Queen&#39;s Tea and I have to say that (aside from the &#34;crumpet&#34;) it was amazing.<br><br>Yes, this place gets crowded...the place was packed for their 11 am seating on a Sunday and people were lined up outside 15 minutes before the place opened. It&#39;s crowded for a reason. The food is great and the kitschy-ness makes it so fun to have tea here.<br><br>Our server was very friendly and always made sure our teapots were full. The service flowed seamlessly.<br><br>The gluten free scone was warm and soft. It had a nice flavor and the lemon curd, preserves and clotted cream complimented it well. <br><br>The gluten free bread was seriously THE BEST gluten free bread I have ever eaten. In fact, I&#39;m not even sure if it was gluten free (okay, I am...the bread was brown in color and still had the crusts on; my dining partner had wheat flour based bread and the crusts were removed). But seriously, THE BEST gluten free bread I have ever eaten. I had the cucumber cream cheese and one of their daily specials...I think it was a turkey and chutney. I&#39;d skip the turkey and chutney concoction and head for the salmon mousse to go along with cucumber cream cheese next time. <br><br>The cabbage salad with caraway is a favorite of mine. I&#39;ve always enjoyed it. I&#39;ve tried to replicate it at home...but I can never make it the same. <br><br>I always enjoy the delicate green salad with the vinaigrette. <br><br>The fruit was fresh.<br><br>The tea biscuit was tasty. <br><br>The crumpet...well...the crumpet was actually an english muffin from Kinnikinnick. A good try, but no match to a real crumpet. I didn&#39;t finish my gluten free version...and I almost always finish everything on my plate...so that&#39;s saying something. Not bad, but not really worth eating toward the end of my tea service. <br><br>Instead of a petit four, I received a gluten free cake pop...and to my delight it was lemon. I love all things lemon, so this was perfect. It was moist and lovely. It was actually the first cake pop I ever had. They weren&#39;t popular back in the days when I was eating gluten and now that they&#39;ve made their way into many markets, I hadn&#39;t had a chance to try one until I had the Queen&#39;s Tea at Lovejoy&#39;s. <br><br>In short, a lovely tea experience. I am already making plans to head back. <br><br>Call at least 4-6 weeks in advance to get the weekend seating of your choice. They&#39;re often booked many weekends in a row and if you&#39;re hoping to get a last minute reservation, you might just be out of luck. <br><br>I highly recommend Lovejoy&#39;s Tea Room. They&#39;re my favorite tea room in the Bay Area...even before I was gluten free...and now that they have such a wonderful gluten free tea service I am beyond a fan. <br><br>GO!

I wake up most weekends craving a Chiotras meatball sandwich. I always like the sandwiches but the meatball sandwich has a special place in my heart. Someone once stopped me on the street to ask me where my sandwich was from because yes it looks that good. It tastes that good to.<br><br>This is also a good spot to pick up odds and ends when you don&#39;t want to go to a full grocery store. Eggs, pasta, etc. <br><br>The people who run it are always very nice, and even let me open a tab one day when I locked my wallet in the house that I was locked out of. All around great neighborhood store.",

"reviewcomment":"THE BEST German Wine shop I have ever seen, including anywhere in Germany I have been. Â Awesome Awesome. Â Excellent customer service as well. Â Trouble free mail order service. Have Â been shopping here for many years. Â Great variety, only thing consistently missing are German reds from the Wurttemberg, but there are outlets for such if you look hard enough. Â But really, German is about Riesling and here you can experience all aspects from this diverse noble grape.<br><br>On one or two occasions a year, they have a Riesling tasting open to the public. Â Its usually around Christmas I think. Â Its real cool as they have the flight start perfectly from the super dry Troken varieties all the way to the jewel-like TBAs. Â  Good for any wine enthusiast who Â still only associates Blue Nun with German wine.",

The scones were to die for and it was amazing with tea. <br>Originally, I made a reservation on Yelp but I don&#39;t think their reservation system with Yelp is working so be careful. My boyfriend and I had to wait an hour for our tea and food. I felt pretty bad because it was only one person working so we just waited patiently. Other than the wait and the reservation system being on the fritz. everything else was amazing. The owner called in someone to help and after that, the food came on time and the service was really good. <br>I am definitely going to come back!

"reviewcomment":"I would have never known this place existed if it wasn&#39;t for a certain &#34;dark&#34; co-worker that loves his coffee like he lives his life. In total darkness. He brought in a bag of their extra dark French roast. I thought it was &#34;ok&#34; but not worth $15 a pound... <br><br>A recent experience left us with nothing but Folgers &#34;French Roast&#34; in the cupboard *puke* Never again! Never Again! So I check online and find it&#39;s only $10.25 for Fair Trade Organic French Roast! Seriously? That&#39;s about as much as you can get stale Peet&#39;s and Starbucks from Safeway since they usually come in smaller 12oz bags. It&#39;s also considerably cheaper than what the new coffee houses Ritual, Four Barrel, etc. are charging. Is the taste on the same level? No, not quite. It&#39;s more than serviceable for the price. I will continue to try new roasts here until I find the one I like most. Right now the Dark Sumatra $13/lb is hitting the spot.<br><br>I&#39;ve driven by here on 10th st without even knowing it exists. Super nondescript location! The interior of this place is nothing fancy at all. While they have tables and chairs, and even sell pastries, it screams FACTORY rather than coffee shop. They have a glass partition where you can watch the workers packing freshly roasted beans into huge trashcans. <br><br>It&#39;s not a hip place on Valencia but maybe that&#39;s why I like it so much. Another reason to appreciate it is the employees here are excellent. No aloof hipsters in sight... After our recent purchase the cashier told us to help ourselves to a few cups of joe while we waited for our brew to be ground and packaged. Of course we had to take him up on that offer!<br><br>While I don&#39;t have a need for this place for home use as I am a recent Nespresso convert <a href='http://www.yelp.com/biz/nespresso-boutique-san-francisco#hrid:jj1oIAb51P9fxJocPWJ0_A'>yelp.com/biz/nespresso-bâ¦</a> it makes an excellent and economical coffee for use at work. Since I like to start my work day with a delicious cup of coffee and some computer work *cough* Yelp *cough* Capricorn helps me do this at a reasonable cost.",

"reviewcomment":"We just used Drink for our 100 person wedding at the Log Cabin in the Presidio and they could not have done a better job. From the beginning Melissa was great about answering our questions and replying to our emails in an extremely timely fashion. <br><br>As far as the drinks go--they were amazing. We went with 3 signature cocktails and I would describe them here if only I could remember the details. Since I can&#39;t, I&#39;m sure I won&#39;t do them justice so I&#39;ll just say that they were amazing and that everyone loved them. They all tasted wonderful and looked great too--one of the drinks came with a flower and they lasted all night. They stocked top shelf liquor and poured all we wanted. One of my friends, after forgetting the name of the signature cocktail featuring bourbon asked for &#34;one of those bourbon drinks&#34; and received an entire glass of Maker&#39;s Mark. Needless to say, he loved our wedding. <br><br>The bar they set up looked beautiful and they never ran out of anything. Â Anything we asked for they gave us and were as sweet as could be while serving us. Â I really can&#39;t say enough about the staff at Drink. <br><br>We were slightly concerned because we only had an hour after the end of the event to be out of the venue but the had everything packed up and out on time. They worked very well with our caterers and overall we couldn&#39;t be happier that we booked them. I would highly recommend Drink to anyone seeking interesting drinks and great service.",

"reviewcomment":"Dear yelpers,<br><br>As I was having my tires fixed, I had 2 hours to spare with the goal to have some food with hopefully some kind of WIFI to entertain myself. Â  Well right around the corner of the car place I saw a little cafe whose identity was more confused than hybrid. Â <br><br>After stumpling in this icecream, sandwich, gyro, sit around establishment, I regonized one of the sandwich makers who used to make me be the best sandwiches in Noe Valley. Â I said hi and he regonized me right away and remembered what I used to order, he then recommended a new sandwich the Try Trick Me for only $7.75. Â  I was not tricked, the meat was succalent, and marinated with some spice just right. Â The bread was fresh and toasty. Â The pickle was just a skinny pickle one step away from being a shy cucumber dipped in pickle juice. Â  However the 3rd bite I just realized that I can not do my work I was meant to do as I had to have the second half before I even started anything incorporating keyboards and finger licking juicy dressing exploding out of the sandwich. Â  <br><br>As all true sandwich shops they had a wide variety of soft beverages with the must of the true sugar cane colas hecho en Mexico. Â That combination was a suberbe. <br><br>The sandwich did not leave me any room for Ice Cream but did leave me some extra money I could spend wisely. Â <br><br>The only downfall is that you can see that it is just opened a year ago, and wires are very in sight. Â This could be easily modified and the owner was mentioning that he did all the work himself and he was planning to get some cool art work on the walls and apply for a wine license. Â That could beat my Mexiican Cola and would even be better.<br><br>The WIFI was amazingly fast and for Free! Â Please don&#39;t tell too many people as that could change with the beanies and beardies of SF downloading the latest mythbusters episodes :)",

I also got a cookie for my 1.5-year-old coffee date (before you ask, I&#39;m a nanny!). <br>As I waited, my date gobbled the cookie up and thoroughly enjoyed it!<br>It wasn&#39;t long before I got my latte &amp; I was headed for the counter to add some sweetener (because I usually have to adjust lattes to my taste), but I took a sip and my eyes lit up, the clouds parted for the sun to shine through, &amp; I&#39;m pretty sure I heard some magical chimes for a second...<br><br>It was just the right sweetness that I didn&#39;t need to add anything or feel like I&#39;d get a toothache &amp; just the right temperature that I didn&#39;t burn my tongue on that first sip. It was amazing! I might just have to stop going around town to try every place because I know Antigua won&#39;t disappoint! <br><br>I happily skipped out of the shop with my date yelling &#34;Byeeee!&#34; to the kind barista with a genuine smile on MY face now because my hump day got a little less humpy thanks to Antigua! I&#39;ll DEFINITELY be back! ^__^",

"reviewcomment":"I adore project juice. The product is the best I&#39;ve tired in the bay area. I definitely haven&#39;t gotten to all of the various juice companies, but I can say that Project Juice has the best flavor, smoothest consistency, and most unique combinations out there. <br><br>I adore the mylks they offer. Turmeric, Get Up and Go Go, Mint Chip Shake- they&#39;re all amazing.<br><br>The juices: Clean Green, Dr. Green Plus, EZ Green Plus, Immunity, Master, Swizz Beets-- SO SO good. I don&#39;t like super sweet juices and they have a great variety of not so sweet, not sweet at all, and sweet if you want it. I find myself craving these juices every three or so days. It&#39;s amazing and terrible at the same time- Love it.<br><br>On a more serious note, I have an autoimmune disease that really inhibits the things I can eat. I&#39;ve found that Project Juice gives me the veggies I am lacking often in my diet because I can&#39;t digest them very well. My skin has improved and my digestion is less interrupted now that I incorporate juice in my diet. <br><br>On top of that, yes it&#39;s pricy. But, not at all unreasonably so. All organic, cold pressed, unique- it&#39;s going to cost you money. It&#39;s worth it. Bottom line.",

There are a TON of vendors for such a newly organized farmers market, all of which having amazing quality and selection of organics. The parking is also not so bad (for san francisco) and the inner-richmond area is just growing and growing into a very cool little neighborhood with all its new parklets and stores/coffeeshops.<br><br>From what I understand they are just testing out how well this farmers market will do and the permit they have to host it is only a temporary permit?? If so, I really do hope they stick around. It seems successful enough and if you have the time and money it really is a great farmers market experience",

Â When walking in, don&#39;t miss the doggy treat jar if your dog is waiting outside for you! Â Excellent coffees and food menu items. Â Brunch favorites include the egg sandwich with bacon &amp; kale (add avocado and ask for it to be cooked with olive oil instead of butter for a fun twist!) and fried egg with avocado on toast (i like to add the kale and leeks to it for more of a filling brunch option). Â <br><br>Reveille also has a truck just a couple blocks down on Pacific/Sansome that opens up bright and early every weekday (at least it&#39;s always there when I walk down to work around 7:30am).

I sit for an hour getting caffeinated as I write and sketch by myself. They play a lot of old 80&#39;s music. Families, locals, chatty ladies, old people, vagabonds, youngsters come in and are all welcomed. The birdies are chirping, the ocean is close by. They&#39;ve got a big water dispenser. The seating can be a little awkward, but some of the tables are shaped like surfboards, which is neat. I love the location and relaxed environment. <br><br>I only wish they would get one of those fancy high-powered hand air dryers in the bathroom.

"reviewcomment":"I LOVE this place! No really, every time I go to Japan Town, this place is a must. I&#39;m not even sure what attracts me here - perhaps it&#39;s the fresh sushi, the little boxed lunches, the aisles upon aisles of snacks, or what.<br><br>Granted the place may seem a bit cluttered, you&#39;re sure to find a gem here and there. Personally for me, I love coming here because I feel a bit nostalgic while I walk down the snack aisles. In fact, I&#39;d occasionally stumble on a snack that I haven&#39;t seen since I was a kid and buy a handful of different goodies. <br><br>You may think that&#39;s good, but there&#39;s something even better. When you walk through the big automatic doors to enter Nijiya, you should look to the right at the open fridge area. There you will find an assortment of Japanese lunches and snacks. The best part is that I was told that everything is made the day of so you can expect quality and freshness. The fridge stretches for a good length of the wall, so don&#39;t miss out on the takoyaki or croquettes in the smaller area. <br><br>Overall, great pit stop to get a quick snack. I recommend trying something you&#39;ve never seen before or perhaps buy a box of snacks that you can&#39;t even read. You never know if you&#39;ll stumble upon your new favorite snack!",

These are the 3 most important things to remember when buying live crabs. <br><br>So far every crab I&#39;ve taken home has been well over 2 lbs and of outstanding quality. The ladies who work there are very helpful and knowledgeable. I learned that you have to cook these crabs for 30 mins. in boiling water - they&#39;re that big!

"reviewcomment":"I&#39;ve finally found a good sandwich shop in my hometown! Daly City doesn&#39;t have much to offer in the restaurant business, so finding a gem like Sam&#39;s really makes me happy. My sister and I had some time to kill while waiting for our car to get washed at Touchless Car Wash. Immediately, we were greeted by a really friendly male (I&#39;m assuming it was Sam?) and he explained to us that the sandwiches were made to order and directed us to the check off cards. We ended up getting a toasted Turkey sandwich on Dutch Crunch with mayo, lettuce, tomatoes, provolone cheese and their delicious pesto sauce. Our total was about $7-$8 which wasn&#39;t bad. The sandwiches at Sam&#39;s are delicious and filling! <br><br>I was really impressed with the service and products that I ended up visiting the next day. The same male employee remembered me and thanked me for coming back! You&#39;ll be seeing me on the regular check in list, Sam! Great products, even better prices, and friendly service.. what more could you ask for?!",

He knows chocolate is the way to my heart! <br><br>Each handmade chocolate is crafted into a unique geometric shape and is painted a bright color some with paint splatter accents. It&#39;s truly a delectable piece of art. The chocolate itself is smooth and silky. The flavors cannot be found in your typical day-after-valentines-clearance-chocolates. No chunky coconut cream, strawberry, or overly sweet raspberry flavors that make your sweet tooth ache. Chocolatier Blue carries flavors like &#34;sage honey,&#34; &#34;sweet potato casserole,&#34; &#34;passion fruit caramel,&#34; and &#34;vanilla rum&#34; that are just as delicate, silky, and subtle as the chocolate itself. <br><br>You just can&#39;t stop after eating one.

"reviewcomment":"This shop carries bite-size chocolate covered gelatos - similar to mini-bonbons - Â and is definitely a must try! These gelato pieces are individually wrapped pieces which is nice for snacking as compared to a large dessert, and there are almost a dozen flavors to choose from. I liked orange, pistacchio and basic vanilla. Each piece is not cheap so you&#39;ll have to splurge a bit for the goodness.<br><br>Recommended if you need to quickly grab a dessert snack on your way to a party/event. I reckon a pack of 32-pcs is good for a party of two dozen. And, if not eaten within a couple of hours, they will give you a double layered bag with dry ice to take the goods with you. Or you can stay as this has a feel of a small ice cream shop.<br><br>The place is right off Third St and Harrison and is not hard to find. I don&#39;t know of any other place like it!

And yes, I&#39;m aware that last comment sounded super creepster-y. I mean, they were talking loudly anyway...) Â Someone asked the barista of a coffeehouse open beyond 8 and they suggested Another Cafe. I Yelp bookmarked it, visited it, and have remained a happy customer since. <br><br>Located at the corner of Pine and Leavenworth, Another Cafe is two stories. It doesn&#39;t look very big from the outside, but it is. The bottom floor has long community tables with stools and numerous 2-people tables. Upstairs there is limited seating; they are definitely appropriate for studying. Another Cafe serves Bicycle Coffee and like others have noted, their beverage and food prices are reasonable. But what distinguishes Another Cafe from other places is the service and ambiance. The baristas are incredibly friendly and probably the nicest ones I can think of in this city. They also bump good music. One minute it&#39;s R&amp;B, next it&#39;s rock, and then it&#39;s folk. Along with that, the environment is unpretentious and relaxed.",

The produce here has never disappointed and the prices are SO much cheaper than chain grocery stores. It is REALLY hard to spend more than 20 bucks if you&#39;re only buying produce. Actually, I once bought 3lbs of meat and a huge amt of fruits to make a fruit salad for a bbq and still only managed to spend $22. <br><br>Finding out that the owner for my favorite Mission coffee shop, L&#39;s Cafe, shops here for her business made me like it even more.",

"reviewcomment":"What a fantasticky lunch idea! We headed for an early lunch and i wasn&#39;t exactly hungry. As I was standing in a line, reading the menu hunger came to me. From 3 types of meal, I chose the rolls with shrimp and avocado. For sides, I added all the vegetables accept pineapple and jalapeÃ±os.<br>You can choose each roll to be different but my combination was sooo good, I really wanted all 3 of them to be the same.<br><br>The best part of this experience were definitely the sources. I tried all 4 of them and preferred the peanut butter one. With lychee tea, it was a perfect light lunch.<br><br>Seating is a bit tricky. We managed to get there early enough but after 12, I would take it to go!",

I met her a year ago when I needed her to make some cupcakes to give to my son&#39;s daycare as a &#39;thank you&#39; gift, so even though I didn&#39;t get to try the cupcakes then, they were delivered on time and I heard rave reviews.<br>A few months later I placed an order for my son&#39;s birthday cake - Mario themed, and Kingdom Cake rose to the occasion. My son&#39;s cake was visually stunning and also tasted really good. A lot of our birthday party guests commented on how moist and delicious the cake was, and I was pretty impressed that my fussy 8 year old loved it.<br>Anyway, fast forward and Kingdom Cake has since made 2 birthday cupcake orders for me - each to the high standard I have come to expect from them. For San Francisco, I think their prices are reasonable, and I have never been disappointed in what we receive from them. Always tasty, always themed to my satisfaction.<br>Chelsea is responsive and I have been lucky enough to always receive a finished product that exceeds my expectations.<br><br>Be sure to check out their Facebook and Instagram accounts!",

"reviewcomment":"My personal favorite place in the City to get away from it all. <br><br>I take the &#39;M&#39; train on pretty much a daily basis for my commute into Downtown. When riding through the quaint West Portal Area, I constantly eye places to check out when I get the chance. The Greenhouse Cafe was one of the places that stood out to me and once I tried it, it quickly become one of my favorite local coffee shops and an oasis for me when I needed a place to retreat from the hustle and bustle.<br><br>Their drinks are perfection and how coffee truly should be made. Much unlike the Starbucks and Peet&#39;s of the world, they treat coffee as an art, which is extremely extremely refreshing. There is a wide range of coffee and hot drinks to choose from, so there will definitely be one you will fall in love with. Their seasonal drinks are a must try as well! The Pumpkin Spice Latte is one of my all time favorites.<br><br>The ambiance of the shop is really calming. I love that the workers will sometimes play some good ol&#39; hip hop, so beats at this place are always on point. The front of the house is really chill and I sometimes like to sit at the counter near the window to people watch when I take study breaks. The front outside is also extremely nice on beautiful SF days. <br><br>My FAVORITE though is the back of the cafe. The Red Room is my escape when I feel like losing myself in a good book. You can either bring one or choose from the eclectic, but awesome collection that sits on the bookshelf. It&#39;s quiet and you have a window that creates a beautiful light into the room on nice days, as well as gives you a view of the oasis that resides outside. I love chillen in bigger groups on the outside patio. It brings a really good vibe over coffee and is gorgeous.<br><br>Overall, a perfect place for me. I can understand some people don&#39;t dig it. Different strokes for different folks. This place will always be one of my SF faves though.",

Unfortunately I do not Â live near the Marina anymore so I cannot o there as often as I would like but when I do I have never been disappointed. I love SF but there are a few things she doesn&#39;t do as of yet. Pizza, cuban, and deli especially a good jewish one. I had pretty much have given up on deli in San Francisco well CA, period. Until....Lucca. Super Special #1. You can now add arugula and gardenire Thank You!!! Here&#39;s at least two things you need to know before you go. Take a number and know what you want. Not Difficult! <br> Â  Cheese lovers? Go right now! Pasta lovers? Go! Love Deli, you will fall head over heels. However if your looking for deli with super friendly service, need to be coddled, going to complain about the size of this place, or are looking for subway type sandwiches (without an open mind) this isn&#39;t your place and please stay away. You are just taking up space and wasting everyone&#39;s time. Think I&#39;m mean? I think your soft. <br> Â  Â My husband and I are going now. I might try something new with my super special.

Â Located on the corner of where Pacific, Kearny, and Columbus meet, the front door is the tip of a triangle and that tip opens up as Columbus and Kearny spread their separate ways. Â When walking in, don&#39;t miss the doggy treat jar if your dog is waiting outside for you! Â Excellent coffees and food menu items. Â Brunch favorites include the egg sandwich with bacon &amp; kale (add avocado and ask for it to be cooked with olive oil instead of butter for a fun twist!) and fried egg with avocado on toast (i like to add the kale and leeks to it for more of a filling brunch option). Â <br><br>Reveille also has a truck just a couple blocks down on Pacific/Sansome that opens up bright and early every weekday (at least it&#39;s always there when I walk down to work around 7:30am). Â The food truck has coffees and pastries for morning cravings.",

"reviewcomment":"It&#39;s cute when non-vegans give vegan businesses three-star reviews because they&#39;re underwhelmed. Especially when they complain about it being carb-heavy and unhealthy and then state their preference to eat &#34;healthy&#34; meat.<br><br>I&#39;ll keep this short because if you&#39;re looking for reviews of Hella Vegan Eats you&#39;re probably vegan, since it has &#34;vegan&#34; right in the title. And if you&#39;re vegan you know it&#39;s a challenge to find really good food when you leave the house and go hunting and gathering for twigs and berries elsewhere.<br><br>While most of the veg fare available out there is either mockmeat Asian or some sort of burger, HVE is constantly adding creative combinations to their menu with a wide variety of base cuisines. Donut burger. Fried mac n&#39; cheeze balls. Potsticker burrito. Chicken in a waffle cone (with ice cream!). Cola-soaked seitan banh mi. A variation on poutine. Southern spicy fried chicken in mini soft taco shells. And they make their own buns and breads, which is a nice touch.<br><br>Even though I have my favorites I like that they keep changing the menu. I can always find something that sounds really good. I was trying to think of one thing I got that wasn&#39;t the greatest but honestly couldn&#39;t think of one. And after moving back to SF from the land of food trucks, I have to say that HVE is doing a bang-up job with the quality when it&#39;s served from their truck at Dolores Park.<br><br>It&#39;s ironic that some people are complaining about the heaviness or portion sizes. HVE&#39;s portions are usually humongous, especially for the prices they charge. I like Millenium, but for 1/3 of the price you can get twice the amount of food at HVE. You don&#39;t have to eat everything in one sitting; you can take some of it home with you. I&#39;m surprised how many people don&#39;t realize this. I usually get half of whatever I order to go and then have it for leftovers the next day; and it&#39;s always enough for a second round.<br><br>HVE is continually growing (more pop-up dinners at other locations are being added), which hopefully will lead to their own restaurant some day. They are always friendly, and it&#39;s nice to be recognized when you&#39;re a regular customer. You can tell they work hard at this because it shows (and tastes). And they also try to keep it &#34;fun&#34; with theme menus and creative promo graphics. Word is getting out how excellent HVE is because they routinely sell out of everything before call time.",

Re: sandwiches, the Buddha (goat cheese, roasted mushrooms, balsamic onion, broccolini, thyme-meter lemon gremolata (no idea) and butternut squash on country levaine) was simply incredible -- like how could it not be? as for the salads, I cannot get over the Winter seasonal salad (mixed greens, arugula, dino kale, toasted brussel sprouts (genius), blanched broccolis, roasted winter squash, pomegranate seeds, pine nuts, parmesan, and meyer lemon-balsamic vinaigrette. <br><br>but don&#39;t let my choices trick you as they LITERALLY have something for every set of taste buds. also, they have a whole list of grilled cheeses.

"reviewcomment":"We did the Tasting Tour of Japantown, it was wonderful!<br><br>A couple friends told me that they need one more couple to go on the tour, they don&#39;t have enough people. Â So I said OK. <br>When I told my boyfriend, he was like &#34;what&#34;? Â Because we go to Japantown often, to watch movies (Kabuki Theater is definitely the best theater in town!) and have some sushi. <br>When we did the tour last Saturday, we enjoyed it very much. Â We were both surprise that we don&#39;t know Japantown as well as we thought . Â We&#39;ve learned a lot, and eat a lot too.<br><br>It turned out to be a full tour, there were 12 of us, all of us are from Bay Area.<br>We had &#34;sweet potato latte&#34;, none of us have heard about it, but all of us love it! Â I&#39;ll get one every time I go to Japantown now.<br>I didn&#39;t know the corner store &#34;Benkyodo&#34; makes mocha from scratch every day. Â The fresh mocha is 100 times better!!<br>We&#39;ve tried &#34;onigiri&#34; (Japanese rice ball), &#34;taiyaki&#34; (baked fish shape cake), udon.....<br><br>Last stop is Dosa Indian restaurant. Â I like the idea that because it&#39;s in Japantown, why not includes them? Â It&#39;s an open minded community! Â <br>Dosa is a very elegant and high end Indian restaurant, we&#39;ve been there before and like it a lot. Â They made the signature Dosa and homemade gin tonic for the tour which was great! <br><br>Tour guide was this very sweet Japanese lady who lives in Japantown. Â She started with the history of the Japanese community, not too much to bored us. Â She does a great job introducing Japanese food and culture. Â She made the 3 and a half hour tour very pleasant!<br>I couldn&#39;t say enough great things about the tour!",

I&#39;ve been waaaaaaaaaay too many times since I have friends that live about a block away.<br><br> I still remember the first time I had dutch crunch and it was from this place, so its easy to say that was a huge reason I come back! I love their roasted turkey sandwiches. Although, I expected more out of their breakfast sandwiches, they are pretty bland.<br><br>The market is super clean and well kept, but just a tad overpriced. I love coming here for a quick coffee in the morning. The staff for the most part is super friendly, and you can tell they work hard-especially during the lunch rush.",

"reviewcomment":"My friend and I stumbled upon this joint by chance (overdue review, came here July of 2013), convinced to go in by a woman with a GIANT falafel plate sitting at the window. We were hungry, and it looked good, so why not? In the end, I&#39;m really glad that we took the chance to hit up the Blue Front Cafe. We chatted with the owner of the store, who took our order. He said his name was Peter, but after further questioning he admitted that it wasn&#39;t his real name (LOL) and he just said his name was so because his real one was too hard to pronounce. (We tried. He was right.)<br><br>I settled for a falafel wrap, wondering why most of the items on the menu were around $10~... and I got my answer when my order arrived. The portion was HUGE. HOLY cow, I&#39;d say it was a little bigger than your average Chipotle burrito! So in terms of the price to size ratio, I&#39;d say things evened out rather nicely.<br><br>But then things got even better. I took a bite of this gentle giant of a wrap, neatly diagonally cut, and the taste was superb! Really fresh, and I actually really liked the fact that the falafel was a bit warm. The contrast in temperatures played off really well on my palate. <br><br>In terms of ambiance, it&#39;s your average cafe -- order at the front, your order comes, and you eat. What I&#39;d like to try next time is their breakfast items/coffee. The menu, posted on a gigantic blackboard behind the order/deli counter, was pretty overwhelming.<br><br>This place was a definitely a pleasant surprise. Will go back if I ever have the chance!",

"reviewcomment":"In only its second year the staff at Fans of Lamb have really gotten this lamb and wine tasting event down pat. Â Invite some noteworthy San Francisco Bay Area chefs to come out and create their best lamb dish with the incentive of winning a first place prize and a trip to New York City to compete with other great lamb chefs from Boston, Washington D.C., Seattle and New York for the title of Lamb Jam Master. Â Invite wineries from an entire region all representing the Paso Robles Wine Country to bring a sampling of their best wines to taste. Â Invite some key San Francisco Bay Area breweries to come on out to satisfy the non-wine drinking crowd. Â Bring it all together at a beautiful new site, the picturesque Golden Gate Club in San Francisco&#39;s scenic Presidio.<br><br>Last year&#39;s crowd was a bit on the meager side but send out an email blast to your 2010 attendees and offer a three tickets for the price of two deal and you&#39;re almost certain to pack the house. Â The second annual American Lamb Jam stop in San Francisco was a phenomenal success. Â Of the 16 restaurant chefs who committed to competing only one could not attend. Â The 2010 winner for Best Lamb Shank, Chef Ola Fendert of OOLA could not compete meaning a new lamb shank champion was inevitable.<br><br>Reducing the number of lamb samples from 16 to 15 makes all the difference when your goal is to sample every lamb dish presented.

"reviewcomment":"This is the perfect pie! Â For all of you, pot pie seekers, your quest is over. Â These individual hand held pies are fantastic! Â Each one is wrapped in plastic and comes in a paper sleeve with heating instructions. Â You can Â <br>pick up these pies at the farmer&#39;s market at the Stonestown Galleria on Sundays.<br><br>Trust me, I know the anticipation sucks when you&#39;re hungry. Â After 10min in the oven you&#39;re rewarded as the crust browns and it&#39;s ready to eat. Â The pie crust is golden, flaky, and buttery as a croissant...perfection! Â You could put any filling in this crust and it&#39;ll taste so good. Â Luckily, the filling choices are also amazing. Â All are excellent but my favorites are:<br><br>Butter Chicken- big moist chunks of chicken with an Indian flair<br><br>Lamb Curry- Moist, tender lamb in a savory sauce<br><br>Chicken Vegetable- chicken, carrots, broccoli...traditional comfort food!<br><br>I&#39;ve been wanting to try these pies for awhile now. Â With the rainy weekend, these pies were a great excuse to leave the house. Â Again, these amazing little pies with have the greatest pastry crust ever. Â I sure wish the owner opens a store front so I can get these hot over the counter!",

Â I had the &#34;Flaky Friend&#34; (double chocolate crÃ¨me brulee with pie crust, cinnamon strudel and salted caramel topping) and &#34;The Godfather&#34; (double chocolate crÃ¨me brulee with &#34;midnight&#34; chocolate cookies and bourbon butterscotch topping) - both were amazing, especially if you&#39;re a fan of chocolate crÃ¨me brulee.<br><br>This really is an incredible spot and I totally recommend it for any dessert fan, especially if you&#39;re looking for a unique spin on a very traditional dessert.",

Â I believe the smell of this dish that is cooking, is what lures customers, such as myself, during the lunch hunt, to come here! Â I love this entree the most!<br><br>Bunny Chow - I ordered it up as chicken for the meat option. Â The concept is like clam chowder, but curry chowder! Â The chicken curry was stuffed in a hollow bread bowl and the curry sauce was good. Â I would avoid this dish for lunch, personally, because curry gives me food coma and I am super unproductive when that happens! Â I do recommend to go early for lunch, to get this dish because they sell out quickly and don&#39;t restock!<br><br>Their entrees are reasonably priced about $10. Â The owners are the chefs as well! Â They are super friendly and personable!<br><br>The smell of spices that this kitchen exudes, is undeniable!",

"reviewcomment":"I had my wedding here last weekend and it was a dream come true! Patty helped me from start to finish, from showing us around the winery, to the rehearsal, and eventually coordinating the day. She was so helpful, kind, patient, and fun to work with! When we first visited the winery, my fiance and I fell in love with the breathtaking views and beautiful pavilion area. We knew we wanted our wedding here and signed the contract that day! We chose a day in February because of the discounted winter rate and prayed for a sunny day-which we got! The wind was still icy cold but it was gorgeous and sunny.<br><br>On the wedding day, we arrived and the girls went directly to the bridal suite. It was a perfect and cute little room where we got ready. There was a balcony outside which we would&#39;ve used more if it was warmer. The guys had their own room too upstairs. We had two hours to freshen up, relax, and take photos.<br><br>When I walked out to the ceremony with my mom by my side, it was more beautiful than I ever imagined! The wooden pavilion overlooks the vineyard and bay area, and since it was sunny and clear, we had a great view--though I was just staring at my now husband. After the cocktail hour and so many photos, we went to the reception. Surrounded by glass windows, family, and friends, we ate while watching the sun set. It was perfect. We were rushed at the end because we were going over time, but Patty was so gracious and patient with us, and throughout the whole day I was put to ease because I knew she was helping coordinate. If you&#39;re looking for a gorgeous venue for your wedding and love the rustic and naturey feel--look no further. It was the best day ever! :)",

Every single Thursday, and we pretty much get the same thing every time too.

If you want a bento box, you can skip the line and order right away but I&#39;ve never gotten one so I can&#39;t really vouch for that. The chicken katsu curry is my staple here.<br><br>This is also a great place if you like your food spicy. You can specify the spice level by telling them the number of &#34;S&#34; you want in your food, like &#34;Chicken Katsu Curry 4S&#34;. The highest I&#39;ve seen anyone get is 8S, but I&#39;m totally a spice wimp so I&#39;ve never gone higher than 4S. If you just say &#34;spicy&#34; they&#39;ll give you 1S, so be more specific if you want your food spicy!<br><br>If you don&#39;t like spicy food, don&#39;t worry!

Space is pretty limited and not much &#34;street parking&#34; is available (well, like anywhere in SF) - it&#39;s creating some &#34;parking rage&#34; situations, even for consider to be &#34;well mannered&#34; type of people who usually shop at WFM ;-)<br><br>CROWDS - during some hours (11am-2pm), since this WFM store location is next to CCSF, it&#39;s will became very crowded with CCSF students - who create long checkout lines and impossible to pass thru &#34;Deli Section&#34; with the large cart ;-) (Note to myself - AVOID this WFM location for grocery shopping at lunch time Mon-Fri)<br><br> Overall - GREAT JOB!!!

Well, this was either my first or second time in a vitamin shop, and because of their great labeling, I was able to find the rice protein powder. Impressive, huh?! They had a huge assortment of goods and people were flocking in there up until 6:00.

"reviewcomment":"Giving up coffee has been one of the hardest things I&#39;ve done for the sake of my health. To compensate, I&#39;ve been cultivating my taste in tea.<br><br>As fortune would have it, I was given some Red Circle Teas as gifts: Gold Medal Jasmine Green Pearls, Ying De Red, and White Leaf Dan Chong Oolong. <br><br>They have all been exquisite - delicate flavors without bitterness, even with longer steeping (as I like to do sometimes, Â to get all the medicinal benefits. Or other times I just forget and wander away from my cup). I steep each serving at least three times to get the most out of it, because I know these are precious specimens!<br><br>The White Leaf Dan Chong Oolong is particularly delicious - floral, complex. <br>And best of all no coffee-like side effects, even if tea does have caffeine.<br><br>I haven&#39;t been to their tastings yet - I live in the East Bay and don&#39;t get to the Mission often. Â But if I had the chance I would jump on it.",

"reviewcomment":"As always, skip the body down to the Bottomline.<br><br>Sure has been my long while since a genuine yelp posting. Ten minutes ago, I finished my bagel and hot-mugged 16oz coffee, chatted a bit with the folks running the place, walked around a few blocks to find a large-scale chain coffee cafe to suck on the free wi-fi to write this review (large-scale business is falling further and further and further away from my desires to participate -- me: &#34;do you have free wi-fi?&#34; barista: &#34;yeah, for customers&#34;), bought a compulsory superfood drink (with compulsory $1 tip jar deposit) and left a porcelain deposit. TMI? Well tl;dr didn&#39;t even get this far, so bear with me.<br><br>How did I find Bereka? Word of mouth. I applied to a retail job around the corner after quitting my last job, which was for a monopolizing bookstore entity buying up the digs to our nation&#39;s college and university bookstores. My first pay was short 2/3 -- I wasn&#39;t in the system and the transition manager for the private university bookstore I&#39;d been working at, simply processed my missed punch slips late. I brought it to their attention and they decided to add it to my next pay. Writing an email to document the matter and outlining some labor laws, I decided, &#34;Why do I have to take this?&#34; and put in my termination and demanded cash, which is my right pursuant CA Labor Code Sec 226(a). With cash in pocket the following Monday, I am now back to getting my foot in the door. USA business ethics strike number one.<br><br>To clear my mind, I signed up with a large-scale chain sports club last night to fulfill the need for affordable gym amenities to get my bars up. I called first, and when I arrived later in the day, it was revealed I was misinformed: no, I could definitely NOT sign up with cash to pay the upfront first/last+initiation dues. After a day of work-searching and navigating MUNI, I was exasperated. The person helping me was on the last 1/4hour of their shift, so they began to speak to me with condescension: &#39;let me say this slower&amp;verbatim but not really explain what and why.&#39; Troubleshooted with a manager next, walked a couple blocks, bought a prepaid card, paid the card fee, went back to finish the registration and got my cardio and reps in. Maybe they don&#39;t trust their employees with a till, but what&#39;s with phasing out cash? USA business ethics strike number two.<br><br>Rain finally poured overnight with a few beloved downpours and despite sleeping with a drip-drop pot at my feet, I made my way across town to my interview with positive energy. While waiting for a bus adjacent a large-scale, Pleasanton-based supermarket chain, I decided I&#39;d relent and get the famed jalapeÃ±o/cheddar bagel. What?? they now skimp on the cheese AND the jalapeÃ±os are diced&amp;sparse? meh. Got a piece of breaded pollock from the overstocked, understaffed cold deli. I asked the bouncer at the door if I could sit in the chair by the door. Response: &#34;you need to pay for it.&#34; &#34;..I just paid.&#34; I was at the self-serve check-out by the door while they were spaced-out talking on an iThingy. Halfway through, the fish turns out to be cold and raw. These should be ready-to-eat. Tripping on food poisoning, I took it up with the customer service desk. The manager is so pleasantly laissez-faire that my congeniality just ends. &#34;I don&#39;t care about a refund, I don&#39;t want a replacement, what am I supposed to do if I get sick from this?&#34; &#34;That&#39;s a lot of what-ifs. What if you ate something last night, what if you eat something later?&#34; Asked a dozen times to document the situation, and when I asked to call corporate, accident forms magically appear. I gave him my name, but decided not to be that one rat-bastard to call corporate and walked out the door. USA business ethics strike number three.<br><br>Got to my interview late, luckily, they were running behind schedule and the interview went well. I filled out some additional pre-hire paper work and introduced myself to my co-worker-to-be. Walked out the door, but popped back in to ask for a nearby cafe recommendation. &#34;Are you looking for coffee? Bereka! They brew it by the cup [...] and tell them Roger sent you!&#34; &#34;Thanks!&#34; Even if I don&#39;t get the job at this local, small-scale chain, the recent strike-out is worth finding this spot! Bereka means exactly how I felt when I walked out the door. Walk in and look up to see what it means. Ethiopia is the birthplace of the coffee plant and subsequent drink and some things are best sourced from the source. I must say skip the large-scale, USA business ethic, customer service situation with coffee pre-brewed and sitting in a heater pot. Do yourself a favor and support a local small business that has an honest, small, local business ethic.<br><br>BOTTOMLINE: Â I drink my coffee black and unaltered, and WOW! I&#39;m glad I do! Been a barista, and know how to brew my own in all the fancy ways, but this cup was the smoothest, cup of brew that I&#39;ve had. Confidently, EVER.",

That gives them a 5/5 for me. They have a nice array of donuts, bagels, bagel sandwiches, and coffees -- HUGE plus since I love having options! I&#39;ve only tried their bagel with cream cheese and avocado, apple fritter, and old fashioned donut. All of them were delicious and sweet tooth worthy! Although I wish their closing times were a bit later, I still really adore this place and will consistently come back for more.",

I love that all containers come in different sizes depending on your needs, and the prices are really reasonable for the quality. We&#39;ve come here for staples as well as blends, looking for specific salts as well as chatting them up to seek recommendations and we&#39;ve yet to be disappointed. <br><br>You can tell that there&#39;s a passion for food and flavours when you come in here, which is why I love it so much.

"reviewcomment":"This is my staple for a coffee and quick snack in Cole Valley. Â The coffee is smooth and if you drink in, comes in a large bowl. Â La Boulange is famous for its pastries. I usually can&#39;t pass up on the macarons or the fruit Danish. Â The staff are super sweet and always helpful and friendly regardless of how crazy the line is. Â I occasionally camp out and code for a few hours. Â No power outlets or wifi but that makes it all the more peaceful. Â Nothing to complain about ;)<br><br>Oh and you can ignore all the &#34;this place has gone downhill since Starbucks bought them and it&#39;s all mass produced&#34; posts. Â The food is still made out back an as good as ever. Â  Hating SB is a Bay Area hobby and good pastry owned by a large organization triggers cognitive dissonance. Â Have another perfect latte.

"reviewcomment":"Yelp is my confessional. Â Overall, I&#39;m always open to new things and willing to try anything that my pocketbook can handle. Â And, because it&#39;s sort of rare when the bf wants to do something, I will always tag along to whatever he wants to do. Â I guess it&#39;s sort of a tradeoff for those times when he comes into bookstores or girly stores that I want to go into. Â So, I will sometimes be apprehensive on where we go when he chooses...<br><br>That said, I did want to come to this boutique, but I was a bit concerned about the prices. Â This is a place that my cheap-ass would not normally go into. Â I felt a little intimidated walking through the front doors to this place, and we waited a short time before being serviced and shown to our table. Â Everything is really nice. Â Like, really nice. Â So nice that I don&#39;t know what I was doing there this morning when we visited....<br><br>Once we were seated, we were handed our menus. Â The waiter came by, we ordered a few things, and waited. Â The bf ordered the iced cappuccino with a very strong (rank 8) espresso, Â which he liked and thought it was made very well. Â I got the iced latte, which was AMAZING. Â It had the shot of espresso (rank 4), 2 scoops of ice cream, whipped cream on top, and cinnamon on top of that. Â It wasn&#39;t too sweet, and it complemented very well with the espresso.<br><br>For a meal, the bf had the pulled pork sliders. Â It was cooked correctly, had fresh bread, and the meat was just perfect. Â A little fatty and a little pricey for what he got, but he thoroughly enjoyed it. Â <br><br>We also ordered the creme brulee for dessert. Â Not sure what may have happened, but we were waiting a bit longer than what was probably normal. Â The waiter apologized for the wait and provided two macaroons to try while we were waiting. Â One was mint, which wasn&#39;t bad, and the other was a chocolate, which was very good. Â We eventually had the creme brulee brought to us, with ice cream on the side. Â The actual custard part of the creme brulee had espresso in it (of course), as well as raspberries. Â Overall, the creme brulee was good, but not the best we&#39;ve ever had.<br><br>This is a place that I would not go every day, but it is a place I would love to go to when I need a good sugar rush and have the funds to splurge a little. Â The prices are a little high, but you are paying for being in their very nice cafe, and the quality of their foods/work/service. Â The service here was top-notch, and we had no problems whatsoever. Â Will likely come back whenever we visit SF again.",

The birthday girl has severe lactose intolerance. What did Jennifer say? No problem! She said she&#39;d make a devil&#39;s food cake with raspberry preserves in the middle, and Â she came up with a delicious dairy free frosting!<br><br>The birthday girl lived much of her life in the Northern Mariana Islands so they wanted a tropical themed cake and something to represent her 10 grandchildren.<br><br>Jennifer placed beautiful and elegant pearlized shells along the bottom of the cake and then she made 10 beautiful plumeria flowers and placed a &#34;pearl&#34; inside each to represent the grand babies. It was just beautiful.<br><br>And the taste was just perfect!

Â The regular size is a perfect portion for lunch, but it also comes in a large roll if you&#39;re looking for more.<br><br>Besides the delicious korean take-out food (I&#39;ve only tried the sandwich, but everything else looks , what makes me come back time and time again is the service from the two lovely Korean ladies behind the counter.

Non-snobby staff who chatted easily with each person who came in no matter how third wave savvy their coffee order. Behind the counter they talked excitedly about ideas for future dishes and events.<br><br>This cafe is a short walk from the Haight in a cool, residential area with a few other bars and shops, but none of the touristy bustle. Maybe it was because the sun came out and the fog burned off while I was here but this was the moment I began to feel like SF was a place I could love and live in. I get bummed and freaked here sometimes by the heartbreaking poverty and nauseating gulf between rich and poor, but that&#39;s when I have spent too long in the financial or touristy sectors. Getting out to a real neighbourhood where food and drink are served with a love for local and a quiet mellow sunny rhythm heals all, always.",

Mimi was very easy to communicate with, and she asked all the right questions to make our cake special for our big day. With a number of ideas we brought to her, we went with her recommendations that conformed to our requests. Sure enough, the cake looked classy, elegant and beautiful. Â Our wedding was on July 4th, and it had a navy blue ribbon on the base of each tier, with white chocolate frosting and red rose petals - a perfect red white and blue Â theme that was sophisticated, minimalist and classy.<br>On top of that, the cake was delicious. She knew that I didn&#39;t like cakes that are too sweet, and it was good to hear she thinks the same. We had a chiffon cake with mango filling - it was perfect! <br><br>Thank you Mimi for helping to make our day memorable and special, and thank you for all the effort you put into your work.",

"reviewcomment":"Yall, beer fest is the real deal! Â $40 for all you can taste for 3 hours...seriously, what&#39;s not to love? (aside from the debilitating next-day hangover, that is...that was not cool.) Â <br><br>This event is very similar to the Vintner&#39;s Market (aka Wine Fest) offered in Spring / Fall of each year, except obviously it&#39;s beer instead and also refreshingly unlike the wine vendors who are kind of peddling for you to buy a bottle right there, the beer people leave you alone to enjoy their stuff. Â <br><br>There is a good mix of well-known and lesser-known breweries from all over -- local, from other states, and even international. Â Most stands (there were probably around 80 stands) have at least 2 varieties for you to try, and the pours are pretty generous.<br><br>A live band was performing as well and there are a few food stands. Â Since the event is usually like late November / early December time frame there are a lot of good seasonal beer choices available. Â <br><br>It&#39;s rained both years I&#39;ve went, which perhaps helped keep the crowd under control. Â It&#39;s certainly well attended, but I never found that it got too crazy in terms of lines or waits in order to get the beer. Â <br><br>Most all of the vendors are very friendly and a lot have schwag to give away as well. Â I don&#39;t think it sells out either (nor do the prices increase unlike wine fest); a few friends bought tickets day of or day before and got in just fine.<br><br>Definitely check out this event if you are in town!",

This place has bread (duh), coffee, and I saw a big cauldron of I-don&#39;t-know-what. <br><br>I went here just for bread and bought a 1lb sourdough. $3 and some change. I was pleasantly surprised that they offer to cut it for you. Yes, thank you. :) <br><br>Another note: I went really late in the evening just before they closed, and the bread was still wonderful and fresh. I&#39;ve run into issues with stale bread at other bakeries when I&#39;ve gone just before close. Not this place!",

Warm fresh rolls! Â There are pumpkin baked turnovers with custard filling and then also apple and piÃ±a. Â The tamales are completely great. Â I love the homey feel of this bakery and having breakfast here. Â You can basically get a huge bag of freshly baked pastries for under 5 bucks. <br><br>p.s.

I finally went for the kimchi fried rice with beef while my friend got the spicy tofu soup (snooze, I wanted him to get an entree..). <br><br>Anyway, they &#34;cook when you order&#34; as they so kindly remind their customers with a sign in front. It&#39;s a little bit of a wait for the food, but it&#39;s totally worth it and it&#39;s authentic!! The kfr was delicious and so was the soup!

"reviewcomment":"A corner store in the TL that manages to stay clean deserves four stars. Â Period. Â So that&#39;s where those came from.<br><br>The additional star is for the facts that they are well-stocked, have friendly employees, and don&#39;t put up with the in-store or just-outside-of-store presence of crazy conmen trying to run some sort of shady game. Â OK, I&#39;ll admit that crazy conmen in the TL aren&#39;t the toughest to spot, as they&#39;re in the TL because their skills have deteriorated from their height in 1983 or whatever, but a conman past his prime is a dangerous conman; whereas in the old days you&#39;d just lose your wallet and not notice until a solid seven minutes later, now you might catch him trying to lift your wallet, and then what do you do? Â Fight? Â Grab him? Â Block his way? Â Disabuse him of his wannabe-pimp cane? Â None of these options are appealing, especially in the TL.<br><br>Take it from a paranoid mark if ever there was one: Â If you need a convenience store in the TL and don&#39;t want to deal with the TL, duck into Tsunami Market for a second and let your guard down--OK, maybe that&#39;s bad advice.

Their chocolate pots de creme are amazing and luscious and perfect. I would need to have them in my life again.<br><br>When it came time to plan the desserts for our recent wedding, my husband and I knew we wanted to go with Bicyclette. Christina and Katie are super flexible and easy to work with, which was helpful since my chef husband is very particular about his food! The ladies at Bicyclette were totally in sync with what we wanted - seasonal, local, and delicious. They even created custom items based on our ideas. In short, they rock!<br><br>This all led up to the big day. Christina and Katie knocked it out of the park. They did an amazing job setting up our entire dessert table and candy bar for us. It looked spectacular. Our guests were wowed. I even caught the waiters snapping photos of the dessert table, that&#39;s how awesome it was. And the best part - I didn&#39;t have to worry or spend my time and attention on it at all (except to sneak over and snag sweets every now and then).<br><br>I can&#39;t rate Bicyclette highly enough. From their professionalism in how they run their business to the perfection of their desserts, they deserve every star. Thank you, ladies!!",

The lady working said that it must be because of the New Year resolution to &#34;eat healthier&#34; lol (she was SUPER friendly and gave me a cup of water too) I asked how many spring rolls she makes per day, and she said about 450 a day!

Whether you come just for the coffee or want a place to unwind after a day at the galleries, I&#39;d recommend this to anyone visiting the area!<br><br>I ordered a cappuccino. I added a little bit of sugar but it was honestly creamy enough to drink straight. I wish I ordered the mondrian or damien heist dot cakes, too cute! #artnerd Only complaint is it is a bit pricey and I do believe this locations prices a little more than the ferry market building (may be wrong) Though I thought the service was better here (the market building had a bit of pretentious hipster attitude) <br><br>The atmosphere is what makes this location prime. There is an indoor space where light floods in from all directions thanks to the glass walls. There are two courtyard spaces where you can chill by the sculptures and enjoy a view of the skyscrapers around. I&#39;d love to spend a saturday working away here.<br><br>note: this BBC location is dine-in only. so if you are looking to take your coffee to go, consider bringing your own travel mug and see if they comply :P",

This shoo differentiate itself from others. Not a shop were they order for delivery and mark up a percentage. What you see here is a shop that has his own kitchen area with equipement and materials makes everything on hand each day and whenever is runs out they make them again guaranteed fresh.<br><br>Staff: As soon as you walk in you&#39;re greeted. They offer samples to people who looks to buy not transients walking with blankets covering their bodies. Very knowledgeable about what they sell I even ask if do gift baskets. <br><br>Cleanliness: Immaculate can&#39;t pick out anything to say. From the kettles to counter no sticky residue can be found. <br><br>Eats/Drinks: Sea salt caramel slabs $7.85 this was so delicious. The taste tells you it too fresh as every bite was point on. The peanut brittle like slabs were looking good but didn&#39;t want any at the time. Was on the look out for coconut chews clerk said funny you&#39;re the only one who ask for it so far.

I was caught off guard thinking it was a adult superstore the color scheme got me and the area. Upon further inspection found out it was all sweets inside that is made in house. I like their concept the name little john&#39;s sounds like a kid made the candies lol. Anyways I think this place can make it because not a lot of candy makers of this level are locates in SF anymore. With crazyhorse a block away stop by and buy a box for your best performer they&#39;ll really like you lol.",

"reviewcomment":"When I moved in down the street I made note of the cleverly decorated cafe (there&#39;s a red bike that rests above the door to match its name). But, I when I finally made it down there I knew it would become a second home. <br><br>On my virgin voyage here, I had ordered a coffee and a toasted whole wheat bagel. I know myself to be overly eager and burn myself drinking coffee on the regular, so I went to town on the bagel first. Honestly, I&#39;m not sure what the fuck kind of cream cheese they use, but it was like a creamy heaven in my mouth (yes... I know). I mourned its end for a moment and I nearly forgot about my coffee. Then came the second &#34;wow&#34; of my visit. I had wondered why my coffee took so long, but after taking a sip and looking back towards the register, I saw the Blue Bottle logo. Skipping the long winded praise, it was awesome.<br><br>Since then, I have gone there an embarrassing amount of times in a short time period. There&#39;s a great mix of people of who come through here, which is great for people watching while I get some work done. Also, despite it being seemingly crowded all the time, I haven&#39;t had any trouble getting a spot. The staff are extremely friendly, something I can&#39;t understand when they are so busy. <br><br>I&#39;d recommend this place to people passing through, but please don&#39;t come here often...

All the quiches have a lot of the filling (bacon, veggies, cheese, etc), instead of being mostly egg), which I appreciate. <br><br>Every bread is good.<br><br>This is a place where you can grab a meal or individual baked goods to take home, both sweet and savory. <br><br>But it IS a bakery, if you come in at the very end of the day you might get something that&#39;s a little more dry or has absorbed flavors from something else it sat next to all day in the case -- that&#39;s just how bakeries work.",

"reviewcomment":"So I was running on about three hours of sleep (maybe three and a half). Needless to say, my hankering for coffee was somewhat desperate. Fiendishly, I typed in the word &#34;coffee&#34; on my handy dandy Yelp search, and lo and behold, the closest spot was Prima Cafe. <br><br>It&#39;s a tiny little slice of heaven. There are no chairs or tables inside, so be prepared to take your beverage and foodstuffs with you. <br><br>I had a soy latte and man, oh man, this was the latte that dreams are made of! It tasted rich, creamy, and smooth. Not at all bitter or sweet like some coffee chains tend to make theirs. The barista even made some stellar latte art on top (oh, happy day!). What can I say, I am a girl and sometimes I like pretty things. <br><br>I had their Vegan Breakfast Sandwich. It comes on an English muffin but you can substitute a bagel or croissant. A croissant sounded amazing, but I wasn&#39;t sure if it was vegan and didn&#39;t want to be a bother. This breakfast sammie is freakin&#39; DELICIOUS. It comes slathered with avocado, and topped with spinach, tomato, and onions. It tasted so buttery and yummy! I scarfed it down before I had to start work at 7am. Honestly, anything with avocado has a spot in my heart. <br><br>All in all, a very solid breakfast for a very sleepy gal. It was just the pick-me-up I needed after a crappy weekend and an even crappier commute. <br><br>I will definitely return!",

Grab a spoon... or a grain if it&#39;s Ghost Pepper Sea Salt), they have an incredible selection, and the owners are super friendly! I love that all containers come in different sizes depending on your needs, and the prices are really reasonable for the quality. We&#39;ve come here for staples as well as blends, looking for specific salts as well as chatting them up to seek recommendations and we&#39;ve yet to be disappointed. <br><br>You can tell that there&#39;s a passion for food and flavours when you come in here, which is why I love it so much. I have a feeling that our rack will end up having exclusively SpiceAce jars..",

Â I thought I left early enough to beat the traffic to make my friend bday party, but obviously there are smarter people than me in the bay area...jam packed! Â I was starving after I realized I wouldn&#39;t make it in time for the BBQ lighting...and the two year old ate all his snacks (which yes, I do try to sneak in a bite here or there). Â Anyhow, I saw this bread truck in front of me. Â So I went over to him with cash in hand, begging for a crumb or something he could have spared. Â The guy gave a whole bag of they delectable break sticks...they saved my life!! Â Seriously! Â And I guess he felt bad for me because he just understood my situation he probably heard the nagging wife or the crying kid)....but had he not given them to me, I dont think I would have made it over the GG bridge.

She responded to me really quickly with a quote and some good ideas for the simple cake I wanted to surprise my sister with and was able to schedule me in for a tasting.<br><br>The cake came out great, especially for the price. Patty gave me the best quote among the various places I contacted in SF. She also delivered the cake to the wedding venue.<br><br>What really was the cherry on top for us was that we froze the top layer of Patty&#39;s cake so my sister and her new husband could eat a slice on their anniversary (we were too tempted though and ended up eating it less than a month after their wedding) and the cake was still really moist. We were amazed at how well it kept. I think it says a lot about the quality and freshness of Patty&#39;s cakes.",

Â The custom design work looked very impressive and the overall presentation stood out from the other attractions. Â Guests gathered around the candy bar throughout the night as candy flowed and flowed from what seemed like a never-ending supply.<br><br>The candy bar is functional enough that it could have served as the standalone piece of the event. Â However, couple SF Candy Bar with a good dj and a photo booth, and now you&#39;ve taken your event to the next level. Â CONGRATULATIONS!<br><br>And to top it all off, Yvette is an amazing listener with event planning experience, industry connections, and a creative drive. Â I highly recommend you give her a call for your next event! <br><br>P.S. She is also manages Perspective Photo Booth. Â How convenient!",

Did I mention that I love my job?<br><br>February&#39;s cupcake day was hosted by Kara&#39;s Cupcakes! Now, my sister used to rave about them all the time but I&#39;d never really given them too much thought. After all, cupcakes are cupcakes -- right?<br><br>Apparently not. Kara&#39;s cupcakes are moist, delicious and aren&#39;t overly sweet (the bane of all dessert items). We had 10 (TEN!!) flavors to choose from, and I chose five of them. Don&#39;t hate; I can feel those judging looks. I didn&#39;t say I ate them all myself. And they were MINI cupcakes -- half the size, half the guilt (or so I tell myself).<br><br>I personally adored Kara&#39;s Karrot and wasn&#39;t a huge fan of the Sweet Vanilla. And I wish I could&#39;ve managed a bite of the Banana Caramel, Java and Peanut Butter Milk Ganache cupcakes I gave to Boyfriend, but I was too far gone in sweets to want any more (the shame of it all).<br><br>So what I&#39;m ultimately trying to say is that the next time I see Kara&#39;s, I&#39;m going to inhale about a dozen or more of their cupcakes.",

When I saw the &#34;People love us on Yelp&#34; sticker today in All States I KNEW it was time for an update.<br><br>I am a weekly regular customer now. I try to make it a point to visit All States every week on the day I am in San Francisco. I have got my Mom hooked too. We can always find great deals here on produce and other goodies and always love to visit Mo and his brothers who help run the store. We love these guys. They honestly treat you like family. Â Their kindness alone will make you want to come back and shop. <br><br>Seasonal fruits and veggies are coming in fast. All States has some really awesome promotional sale prices on fresh produce. They are constantly restocking and sometimes you can even pick right out of the box they picked up that morning during produce haul. I have got some GORGEOUS asparagus right out of the box, super fresh and on awesome sale (.99 cents - 1.99lb &#34;a bunch&#34; depending on sale - any figure in that range is a super good value). Today we scored some gorgeous plump and ripe seasonal figs and berries as well as other great produce finds. I am happy to see my Mom buy so many fresh fruits and veggies there when we go. Today she made herself a nice little picnic with some of her All State scores: fresh figs, cheese, cashews and personal sized avocados and Mo hooked her up with utensils and an area to wash some of her fruit she planned to go eat. He is so sweet. <br><br>This family really takes pride in keeping up their business, keeping well stocked and keeping their customers happy. This family and store is truly a gift to San Francisco.",

"reviewcomment":"I love the Juice Shop!<br><br>I originally wanted to write a review for the Corte Madera location, but it looks like the owners haven&#39;t activated the page yet. I&#39;ve been to this location as well, but I live in Marin so i&#39;m in the Corte Madera store more often.<br><br>Anyways, I&#39;m a big fan of fresh pressed juice. When i&#39;m not at the Juice Shop you might find me in my kitchen dancing around and prepping veggies for juice. Let me tell you though, juicing takes effort. You&#39;ve gotta wash the produce, chop it, rotate it so that it doesn&#39;t clog, strain it (celery and greens give way to much pulp!), clean the machine etc. I juice on a regular basis, but when I want to treat myself Juice Shop&#39;s got my back. <br><br>My favorite juice is the A+ Deep Greens. I&#39;ve attempted to get the seed smoothie many times, but they are almost always sold out!! I finally got last week in the early hours of the morning and it was very tasty. I also love that they give a deposit for the glass bottles! Awesome job Juice Shop. <br><br>At both locations the employees are always so friendly!! I&#39;ve met most of the brothers and you can definitely see how passionate they are about juicing and living a healthy lifestyle. Although its not cheap, this is definitely the kind of business I love to support.",

"reviewcomment":"Probably one of the best tents you can visit at Off The Grid Fort Mason for the 2013 season has to be Bok Ssam and their Korean fusion comfort food.<br><br>They only have two items on their menu. Â And both are really awesome!<br><br>The first dish is their Korean BBQ Wrap. Â Unfortunately I don&#39;t have a pic of this, but think of it as an oversized Vietnamese Spring Roll with Bulgogi Beef and Noodles and sweet sauce. Â It&#39;s pretty damn good! Â <br><br>The other dish is pretty much the real reason why you must try Bok Ssam. Â <br>Korean Fried Chicken and Waffle Sandwich -- <a href='/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F14mFwnw&amp;s=0e80faedc7e6fa7384139f3202793cb344be5411266cb891630f5fe44b914e30' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>bit.ly/14mFwnw</a><br>Oh man, this is soooooo gooooood!! Â It&#39;s OMGYUM!! Â I&#39;ve been to other places that have their own take on the Chicken and Waffle Sandwich, but I think Bok Ssam makes the best version of it. Â The Waffles are cooked perfectly where they aren&#39;t too hard and have a nice chew to them. Â They hold together nicely with the nice sweet and spicy fried chicken with the same sauce at the Korean BBQ Wrap. Â It&#39;s so effin&#39; good!!!<br><br>So that&#39;s Bok Ssam. Â Delicious Korean American Comfort Food. Â I really hope they go and sell their food at other locations soon. Â They have a really good thing going on with their two entrees. You definitely should make the trip out to OTG Fort Mason and try them out! Â It&#39;ll be worth it!!",

I&#39;m glad they chose Bicycle Banh Mi. I had the curry chicken with lemongrass, with some cole slaw salad on the side, and it was delicious. The curry was spicier than I expected, but in a good way.<br><br>Keep in mind that the curry is going to stain your face and hands yellow, so make sure you grab plenty of napkins!",

"reviewcomment":"I&#39;ve been on this green tea latte craze as of late, so I&#39;m trying them e v e r y w h e r e :D <br><br>I decided to give this place a try since I saw good reviews, and boy, oh boyyyyyyyy, I&#39;m soooooo glad I did!<br><br>On a gloomy Wednesday San Francisco morning, I dragged my feet into Antigua feeling tired and in dire need of some caffeine for this humpity-humpy hump day. Â Greeted with a GENUINE smile by the barista/cashier, I ordered a large green tea latte with almond milk (LOVE how they have this as an option). I also got a cookie for my 1.5-year-old coffee date (before you ask, I&#39;m a nanny!). <br>As I waited, my date gobbled the cookie up and thoroughly enjoyed it!<br>It wasn&#39;t long before I got my latte &amp; I was headed for the counter to add some sweetener (because I usually have to adjust lattes to my taste), but I took a sip and my eyes lit up, the clouds parted for the sun to shine through, &amp; I&#39;m pretty sure I heard some magical chimes for a second...<br><br>It was just the right sweetness that I didn&#39;t need to add anything or feel like I&#39;d get a toothache &amp; just the right temperature that I didn&#39;t burn my tongue on that first sip. It was amazing! I might just have to stop going around town to try every place because I know Antigua won&#39;t disappoint! <br><br>I happily skipped out of the shop with my date yelling &#34;Byeeee!&#34; to the kind barista with a genuine smile on MY face now because my hump day got a little less humpy thanks to Antigua! I&#39;ll DEFINITELY be back! ^__^",

Unlike other coffee chains (ahem, Starbucks), Peet&#39;s brews some damn fine coffee. And make no mistake, this coffee is STRONG (like Red Bull strong). So consider yourself warned.<br><br>Peet&#39;s also offers a selection of teas, sweets, and other goodies. I would come here more often, but the place is just too damn crowded. That&#39;s obviously no fault of Peet&#39;s. They&#39;re just a victim of their own success.<br><br>For the record, Peet&#39;s is an excellent member of the community.

I don&#39;t know if this problem has been resolved yet, but I&#39;ve seen signs for management/supervisor positions opening and then soon those signs were gone. Maybe there has been a change of management?<br><br>You also have to consider that despite how many people go here every day, there are only 80 reviews for this place. It&#39;s because no one really has time to review it, + there&#39;s probably no point in reviewing it because it&#39;s not super great, it&#39;s not terrible, and everyone would probably have a similar review of the place.<br><br>Peets is Peets. It&#39;s good. Maybe a bit realistically overpriced, but with people going here almost every day it&#39;s not seen as being overpriced.<br>I have coworkers that go here every morning and the baristas already know exactly what to get him.<br><br>They deal with a lot of customers per day, have nice baristas that know what they&#39;re doing, and they get your orders out fast and accurately.<br><br>Every time I have been here I haven&#39;t had a problem. It&#39;s a 1 minute walk from my office, which is closer than the 2 minute walk to Starbucks.<br><br>Even when the line has 10 people in it, it goes by really fast because they&#39;re really super-efficient with their orders.<br><br>This is a quality Peets establishment with great working wifi that I use all the time.<br><br>Until I find something wrong with this place personally, 5 stars for me.",

"reviewcomment":"Overall 5 star establishment. Options were just about right compared to 2-page menu. Staff were very friendly and accommodating. The place is a little small with outdoor tables on the side walk with street parking only. Decor was inviting, although you felt like you were in Tin Man&#39;s house. The food was great!!! Even if the place was a dump and staff were rude, food alone deserves the 5 stars. <br><br>I had the Jake&#39;s Meal ( a 2 step meal choice) with Step 1: Choose your protein and Step 2: Choose your sauce, accompanied with Royal Rice Pilaf, Siracha House Slaw, and Chef&#39;s Salad with Citrus dressing. <br><br>I chose the Flashy Fried Chicken and Sweet &#39;n&#39; Tangy BBQ Sauce with a side of Mac &#39;n&#39; Cheese Sticks.<br><br>Food tasted fresh, energetic, portion appropriate, and healthy. I would come to Jake&#39;s Place for the Mac &#39;n&#39; cheese sticks alone. Thinking of the deep fried mac &#39;n&#39; cheese stick goodness makes me crave it. Price is what you would expect to pay for fresh ingredients.<br><br>Staff were very friendly. They were playing music I enjoyed so I walked over to their Jambox speaker and turned it up. I apologized for touching their belongings, but I was glad I did it since they accepted my poor boundaries and encouraged me to dance and enjoy the music with them as they handed me my food.<br><br>So to sum it up:<br>Pros:<br>Staff were very friendly<br>Food was tasty, fresh, clean, and good looking.<br><br>Cons: <br>Place is a little small and not good for groups.<br><br>Recommendations:<br>Order for pick up and get the mac &#39;n&#39; cheese sticks.",

I&#39;ve been to this location as well, but I live in Marin so i&#39;m in the Corte Madera store more often.<br><br>Anyways, I&#39;m a big fan of fresh pressed juice. When i&#39;m not at the Juice Shop you might find me in my kitchen dancing around and prepping veggies for juice. Let me tell you though, juicing takes effort. You&#39;ve gotta wash the produce, chop it, rotate it so that it doesn&#39;t clog, strain it (celery and greens give way to much pulp!), clean the machine etc. I juice on a regular basis, but when I want to treat myself Juice Shop&#39;s got my back. <br><br>My favorite juice is the A+ Deep Greens. I&#39;ve attempted to get the seed smoothie many times, but they are almost always sold out!! I finally got last week in the early hours of the morning and it was very tasty. I also love that they give a deposit for the glass bottles! Awesome job Juice Shop. <br><br>At both locations the employees are always so friendly!! I&#39;ve met most of the brothers and you can definitely see how passionate they are about juicing and living a healthy lifestyle. Although its not cheap, this is definitely the kind of business I love to support.",

They really helped work with our budget to put together an awesome menu and I am STOKED to pick up our ingredients and grill for everyone.<br><br>Also, stop by on the weekends -- I think it is only on the weekends, but I may be wrong -- for the tacos they made.

"reviewcomment":"Agree with others--this places gets 5 stars because Hanna knows how to run a true neighborhood market. While you won&#39;t find organic food or high end specialty items (go to Little Vine on Grant for those), Hanna stocks a crazy variety of items, makes tasty homemade dishes (try the chicken salad!), signs for packages when you&#39;re not home, and is always happy to chit chat with the local residents. He has surprised me time and time again by having items in stock that I didn&#39;t think he would--a single sweet potato, C batteries, capers, fresh dill, double sided tape, brown rice, powdered sugar, the list goes on! My favorite story to tell: we were getting into our car, parked next to Fog Hill while telling our friend how that store has everything. Car didn&#39;t start, and Hanna walks out w/ a car jump starter and starts our car for us. So yes, he does have everything. :) So glad to have this place in the neighborhood.",

"reviewcomment":"My COO [Chief Operating Officer] at work recently went to Paris for a business trip, as our mother company is located there. Â I&#39;d been harassing him nonstop to bring back macarons from Laduree Paris since I love macarons with a passion, and also because they have such a long, rich history. Â My idol, Marie Antoinette, loved macarons from a young age and even named her cat Macaron at the age of 5!<br><br>After months of wheedling and pleading, he brought back a whole box for me and the office to share. Â &#34;$46 euros for that box,&#34; he griped. Â &#34;Worth it!&#34; I chirped happily, devouring a quarter of the box. Â They were perfect; the exteriors were crisp, the centers chewy. Â The ganache filled macarons were rich and decadent; the jam filled ones were tart and flavorful. Â They were heavenly, by far the best macarons I&#39;d ever had. Â <br><br>Then Oui Oui came along and blew me away. Â The taste and texture of Oui Oui`s macarons almost totally mirrored those of Laduree`s, as blasphemous as that sounds. Â For a macaron purist such as myself, I`m extremely picky about the macarons that I put on my palate. Â Trader Joe&#39;s frozen macarons? Â Disgusting. Â Miette&#39;s strawberry macarons with the whipped cream-like filling? Â Overly sweet and deplorable. Â <br><br>We ordered the Mint Chocolate, Lychee, Green Tea, and Triple Chocolate. Â At $1.75 each, they were a steal! Â They were light and decadent, but not overtly sweet. Â It&#39;s so unfortunate that the booths and neon lights from Burger King are still installed; they take away from the ambiance. Â But then again, a macaron patisserie inside Serramonte Mall seems out of place as well. Â LOL Â However, I was informed by the two employees there [a big guy and a smaller girl] that they were only on a 6 month lease, and that they might be moving somewhere better, so hopefully they`ll leave the tackiness that is Serramonte for somewhere more refined! haha The two employees there were also very helpful and friendly...even if they didn`t know what Laduree is when I gave them a compliment about how their macarons tasted like Laduree`s.<br><br>The biggest compliment I could ever give Oui Oui is that they taste like macarons from Laduree. Â To be compared to the legend that is Laduree is the highest honor I could bestow to you, Oui Oui. Â Keep up the baking, because I&#39;ll be back for more!",

"reviewcomment":"Great place for that morning cup of joe.<br><br>Not a super fan of the staff at this establishment, but they make my drinks the way I like &#39;em so that&#39;s all okay with me. Â I wish there were more of these around the area so I wouldn&#39;t have to walk so far to get my chai lattes in the morning! <br><br>Quick notes: <br>-good seating area, sufficient amount of plugs around the cafe. Feels a little like a cafe you would study at in college, but with a lot more foot traffic. Â <br>-Seems like a place where people tend to like meeting up in the mornings before work.<br>-standard pastries for breakfast, like what you would find at a peet&#39;s. Â I need to find a cafe in FiDi that serves some relatively healthier options!!",

"reviewcomment":"Definitely a fan when I have been transformed to another city, London. The perfect little tea house nestled up on the most random street on 3rd/Harrison. My friend and I made a reservation for a 2 for 1 $25 deal on a Friday afternoon (last seating 4:30pm).<br><br>We got our choice of seating and chose two sofa chairs. There was a huge menu selection and I picked the Chai (bottomless, what what!). Also included were three sandwich options (both of us got three full sandwiches, or 6 total). We chose eggs &amp; bacon (sooooooooo good!), fish &amp; chips (sooooooo good!) and apple (sweet, but still good).<br><br>To top it off, it came with a plate of freshly baked warm scones and biscuits/cookies. Needless to say, we ate everything. We had an amazing 1.5 hours catching up in the intimate, cutely decorated setting. Felt like Alice in Wonderland. Great date spot!",

Â Every Wednesday afternoon, Casey&#39;s is parked right on Sansome and California from 11am-2pm. Â You can order a whole pie (6 slices) or a mini pie (4 slices) and have the thin crispy crust pie all to yourself. Â Their standard pies are the Margherita, Zoe Pepperoni, and the Arugula. Â They also have a special or two on rotation from week to week. Â <br><br>The Margherita is definitely the best for me. Â The Zoe is good, but after the first slice, it get&#39;s a little salty. Â Also, if you go after 1:30pm, it&#39;s happy hour, so all pies are $1 off! Â You can also order slices during happy hour if you just want to try a slice. Â <br><br>Casey himself works on the truck and interacts with his patrons regularly. Â He remembers peoples names and recognizes faces. Â It&#39;s rare that you see the owner actually working on site, so you get a real sense that he really cares about his patrons and just loves what he does. Â I must say, he seems like a pretty awesome dude.",

Wonderful roasted taste from the brown rice, not too intense of a flavor that it overpowers the tea itself. You can choose different levels of sweetness and they even have those ridiculously large cups like the ones from purple kow. <br><br>The genmaicha flavor is going to be hard to top, but that won&#39;t stop me from coming back over and over again until I conquer the menu.",

The boat circles around the bay for about an hour and you can catch some beautiful views of the Bay Bridge, Alcatraz, AT&amp;T Park, and downtown SF while sipping on some good wine! Kevin drives the boat while his wife, Melissa, pours the wine and they are both sweethearts. You get 4 tastes per person(not including your welcome glass) and they provide a small assortment of cheese, bread, and crackers.<br><br>I had a really good time with friends and the wine was actually pretty good. They have bottles for sale just in case you happen to love it that much. The particular bottle that I chose was $20/$22. Wine tasting on the Bay is a great concept and such fun!

"reviewcomment":"Had a meeting in the area and arrived early. Stopped in for a quick Chai and breakfast.<br><br>The folks at the counter were so happy, friendly and welcoming, just what someone needs early in the morning. Lots of delicious options and they were ready to answer all of the questions I had about what to order, what options existed for beverages, etc. (Love a place that has almond milk ready for my beverages).<br><br>The chai was served hot, and had an excellent spice and flavor to it. (The unsweetened almond milk was very effective for making a delicious chai.)<br><br>I also ordered the breakfast sandwich on a whole wheat bagel. They offer multiple meat (or veggie) options and it had some of the most generous egg portion I have seen on a breakfast sandwich. They did not skimp on the egg, the bacon and they made it all fresh.<br><br>If you live in the area you are lucky, a socially responsible place that does it right. If you are going to be near the area, stop in for a smile and a good bite.",

It was the best sandwich I ever had. I also think it&#39;s cool they keep all their deli meats in a viewable case and slice it when you order. Even though it&#39;s slightly pricier than other places around here, it&#39;s well worth it. The ingredients are MUCH fresher and the place looks clean. Plus, this place is only 1 block from SFGH.

"reviewcomment":"I have two separate reviews of Phoebe that I will roll into one.<br><br>First, I took a few different &#34;group&#34; cooking classes with Phoebe as a work event and then with co-workers. Â The events were mostly important fun, secondly she had us make food that we could realistically recreate on our own after, and third, she gave us hints along the way that were helpful for cooking in general. Â After cooking, we would sit down at her table and eat together in a nice, cozy setting. Â While her kitchen isn&#39;t enormous (it isn&#39;t small either), we didn&#39;t have any problems with the 10 or so people cooking there.<br><br>Separately, I asked her for personalized cooking lessons after that to help me with cooking quick, tasty, and nutritious meals for my daughter. Â These sessions were absolutely wonderful as she taught me basic, intermediate, and more advanced cooking skills that I have continued to apply today. Â I also go to sample a bunch of the foods she was cooking for her clients, which were delicious.<br><br>I&#39;m surprised to read a review below saying she wasn&#39;t particularly friendly. Â I found Phoebe to be genuinely friendly at all the events - a nice contrast to the sort of fake &#34;I need to be super friendly because I&#39;m being paid&#34; mentality you can sometimes find.",

As the waiting area is very small, 10 people made the place seem like it was a sardine can. There was one very nice woman manning the counter, and I think one guy making the donuts, so the line can go only but so fast. And god help you if you decide that you want a sandwich of some sort, as you will hear a huge amount of groans and complaining from the rest of the drunk customers who just want those fresh delicious donuts. I got glazed donuts and donut holes that were so fresh they just melted in your mouth. We didn&#39;t finish them before passing out, and the next day, they were still fantastically soft<br><br>Now I have been back during quieter hours on a Sunday evening, and the donuts weren&#39;t as fresh and although they were soft, just not like the first time.

"reviewcomment":"For a small time cafÃ© this place does just about everything right. I&#39;d say its not a study type of place, but everything else is kickin. They&#39;ve got tons of beer and drinks including wine and sangria. You can buy the sangria in a pitcher form which is pretty perfect for a bunch of friends. They host music events regularly and for a small place it fits in just right. The alcohol they sell for cheaper on week nights by like 2$ which kicks ass. There&#39;s tons of little tables and chairs and benches and couches everywhere and you can group up with a bunch of people and just chat the night away with ease. They have indoor and outdoor seating and there&#39;s people going in and out all the time or just hanging round out front chatting. Smokers def dig this place. I&#39;m not sure what&#39;s the deal with the name. Kinda not alot connecting it with the atmosphere, but w/e I guess. Every place has got to have some kinda hook in their name I guess. There&#39;s a piano against the wall when you come in which they use for performances. I&#39;d be surprised if you couldn&#39;t play it regularly though too.<br><br>They make food here as well which I didn&#39;t get to try, but I have a feeling is prob pretty good. This place almost feels like a really mellow bar when you&#39;re there at night which is kinda it&#39;s main appeal. You get kinda a smarter less rowdy crowd but all the good drinks and fun friendly atmosphere you could ask for. The bathroom in the back is also pretty clean too. All red walls and a couple locks for the person who is just too paranoid about someone walking in on them. Oh I should mention there&#39;s just one bathroom, no guys vs girls here.<br><br>It&#39;s a cash only place which is the only annoyance for me, but like anyone they keep an ATM next to the bar for easy access. I believe the charge is $2.85. Damn you Mission!",

Grab a spoon... or a grain if it&#39;s Ghost Pepper Sea Salt), they have an incredible selection, and the owners are super friendly! I love that all containers come in different sizes depending on your needs, and the prices are really reasonable for the quality. We&#39;ve come here for staples as well as blends, looking for specific salts as well as chatting them up to seek recommendations and we&#39;ve yet to be disappointed. <br><br>You can tell that there&#39;s a passion for food and flavours when you come in here, which is why I love it so much. I have a feeling that our rack will end up having exclusively SpiceAce jars..",

"reviewcomment":"I have so much love for this market!<br><br>I used to live just across the street and came here almost every day. Everything is top quality. We would get fresh sashimi-grade fish and make our own hand rolls. Sometimes (for lunch) I would get their sushi or chirashi or curry to go. For breakfast I got their onigiri. When I&#39;m lucky they would make one to my order (only happened once). Everything is fresh, very well made, and you feel the careful craft of their food in your hands. <br><br>The only complaint I can think of, is that they don&#39;t carry a big variety of veggies. But I think Japanese don&#39;t eat that many veggies anyway....<br><br>I moved away (only about 15 mins away) so I don&#39;t really go there anymore. But I will always remember those sunny afternoons in the quietness of Japantown walking into the market, happily planning what to eat for lunch.",

"reviewcomment":"One of my most favorite bakeries ever. Ambrosia&#39;s got it all for me.<br><br>1st star for desserts. I la-la-la-love desserts with a fiery passion. The most important thing in a bakery is how they present their pastries and desserts, and Ambrosia always is a hit for me.<br><br>- Princess cake: If you&#39;re not a big fan of marzipan then this cake probably won&#39;t be to your liking. But otherwise it&#39;s probably the most tastiest cake here. It&#39;s light, fluffy, and not too sweet. The custard in it compliments the cake and the marzipan adds that almondy texture to it. Totally worth getting over here.<br>- Strawberry shortcake: This one is my favorite cake. I always get this whenever I&#39;m here. The cake is a light batter that is paired with whipped cream and sweet strawberries. It tastes fresh and is a refreshing cake for any day.<br>- Mousses: There are three kinds of mousses here: Mango, Raspberry, and Pistachio. I like the pistachio one best, it&#39;s not too sweet but not too bland and it&#39;s so smooth. Hubs likes the mango one, it&#39;s a bit sweeter.<br>- Fruit tart: This one, presentation-wise, is so cute. But it was a bit hard on the crust. The interior custard however was yummy and the fruits were sweet.<br><br>2nd star for drinks. Every bakery needs to be able to make make a mean cup of coffee and this place makes some pretty good stuff. Not only do they make coffee, but they also make smoothies also!<br><br>- Green tea smoothie/latte: I really like this drink. You can have it sweetened or unsweetened. It&#39;s way more easier to down than Starbucks, and the smoothie is made smooth and not chunky.<br>- Chai tea smoothie/latte: This is my favorite drink here. When I need a break from the coffee and caffeine, I opt for this. Sweet, not too spicy, and it tastes a bit like cinnamon. Nommmmmmiez.<br><br>3rd star for sandwiches. Finally tried some of their sandwiches and I&#39;m hooked. Their sandwiches come with a free bag of lays chips also heehee.<br><br>- Roasted turkey: So good. I like my sandwiches without pickles or onions on french roll.<br>- Crab salad: This one is usually limited, but luckily I got to try it. So good, the crab tastes so good with the lettuce on french roll.<br><br>4th star for pastries. They have a lot of these and they all look so appetizing :)<br><br>- Chocolate croissant: A classic. Theirs is pretty good warm or cold.<br>- Blueberry muffin: My favorite kind of muffin. It&#39;s fluffy here. Yummies.<br>- Cherry Twists: A unique twist to the classic twist! The cherries were slightly prominent in the glazed twist, but still good.<br><br>5th star for the workers and overall business. Such nice ladies! They&#39;re patient with you if you&#39;re still deciding on what to get, and they&#39;re helpful also. They accept cash and card and they make bigger versions of their cakes. These usually range at $25 and above, but they are worth the monies.<br><br>My most favorite bakery evar.",

"reviewcomment":"One bonus star because I grew up on this stuff. It&#39;s pretty much the go to brand for Chinese flavors for ice cream. I&#39;ve tried many different brands for green tea ice cream but I always come back to polly ann. The others are great, however most of polly ann&#39;s flavors aren&#39;t too sweet which fits my taste perfectly. <br><br>The shop is located in a neighborhood, not really what I&#39;m used to, but there&#39;s a school nearby so i suppose it makes sense; kids, walking distance etc. It&#39;s just a bit strange that you can&#39;t actually see the ice cream since the counter isn&#39;t those glass freezers. It&#39;s not a BIG deal, but.... what if I just want to see what it looks like.. without having to ask for a sample? <br><br>Anyways, used the yelp check in buy one get one scoop for free so pretty worth it. Their stock has been quite limited in ranch 99 these past few months. I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s because ranch 99 isn&#39;t ordering from them as often or if it&#39;s being grabbed up as soon as it&#39;s in the freezers. <br><br>There are a few tables in side (4 if I recall correctly) parking (non street parking) is available right in front. It was pretty empty when I went.",

Â i&#39;m also told you can view the current day&#39;s menu online, which i like.<br><br>the other thing i like is the service was impeccable and the place was empty. Â oh yeah, and their prices were reasonable as well. Â i do expect to be going there again, maybe for some GINGER LEMONADE (mmmmmm!) Â or maybe some squash and brown sugar coffee cake, or a deviled egg sandwich (where else have you seen that on the menu?) <br><br>the only thing is, i wish their sandwiches were available in the morning so i can pick one up for lunch on my way to work.",

They are right across the street from each other, and a short walk from home, but I find El Chico consistently has more produce selection, sometimes better prices, and it as a butcher counter in house, which is nice. The produce here has never disappointed and the prices are SO much cheaper than chain grocery stores. It is REALLY hard to spend more than 20 bucks if you&#39;re only buying produce. Actually, I once bought 3lbs of meat and a huge amt of fruits to make a fruit salad for a bbq and still only managed to spend $22. <br><br>Finding out that the owner for my favorite Mission coffee shop, L&#39;s Cafe, shops here for her business made me like it even more.",

"reviewcomment":"Man, Harrison is a bee with an itch to park on, but I finally found some parking behind the Best Buy across the street which was ok because it was right by the stereo installation department which meant that I most probably wouldn&#39;t have to worry about weirdos getting into my car or anything. In fact, when I got back to my car, it was exactly how I left it with the exception of some small child&#39;s pink pajamas abandoned on the sidewalk nearby. But I digress...<br><br>Goody Goodie is a cute little cafe / bakery on Harrison in the middle of some industrial type buildings. It&#39;s got a couple of tables outside and some tables inside. Once you get inside you place your order at the counter and then they bring it to you when it&#39;s ready. The menu is very limited, but the items all seem really tasty, so it wasn&#39;t hard to find something to eat. I was torn between the egg salad sandwich and the turkey sandwich, but it was the sound of the graham cracker wheat bread with the turkey sandwich that helped make the choice. That being said, I&#39;ll totally try the egg salad next time. My lunch companion also ordered a side salad for us to split which he swore up and down was the best side salad ever.<br><br>My sandwich was super yummy! The bread was everything I imagined it would be with a slight sweet taste to it kind of like King&#39;s Hawaiian bread. I think this bread and the oatmeal roll at Gracie&#39;s Delectables (in San Carlos) are two of the best breads I&#39;ve ever tasted. I could have just eaten a loaf of this stuff for lunch and been fine! The turkey was unusual, but very tasty. Unusual because it wasn&#39;t white meat turkey, but a mix of white and dark meats that looked and tasted a little bit like ham. The sandwich also had some little zesty pickles on it. The side salad was really good! It was a spring mix with a little light dressing and some thin cut potatoes and pickled red onion. Yum!<br><br>I really enjoyed Goody Goodie. The staff were super nice and Remi (the proprietor) came out to deliver my sandwich and explain the turkey to me. After my meal, I went back in and got a couple of chocolate chip cookies to go. I ate mine on the way home and it was really good! If my wife doesn&#39;t get home at a reasonable hour this evening, I will be eating hers as well. Mwa ha ha!",

"reviewcomment":"Why haven&#39;t I been coming here every single weekend??<br><br>I stopped by Andersen on a Thursday after work because I was feeling like indulging in something sweet. I chose the espresso cream layer cake ($3) and raced back home so I could eat it slowly and savor every bite. But.... when I took the first bite it took all my willpower to eat it slowly because it was DELICIOUS! It was even a bit hard to offer my boyfriend some because I wanted to hog the entire thing to myself lol The cream was super light and tasty and the cake layers were moist and perfect. It also really tasted like espresso which was awesome! Sometimes you get a cake or a sweet that is supposed to be one flavor but it doesn&#39;t really taste like it.. but Andersen totally hit the nail on the head here, this was the real thing =) <br><br>I&#39;m so coming back here as soon as possible to eat more cake. It&#39;s super delicious, affordable, and if you ask for your cake slice to go they will put it in a cute little box. Yay for Andersen Bakery!! =D",

Their hummus is to die for! They stocked 2 liters of Dr. Pepper after I hassled them about it! Their coffee is incredible! Carrot cake! Pieces of chocolate cake the SIZE OF BABY HEADS! They just installed new freezers and fridges and have a LOT MORE variety! Oh, and have I mentioned the chocolate selection at checkout? <br><br>I can&#39;t rant enough about Pine and Taylor Market!

In any case it was a treat and worth it. If you&#39;re going and on the cheap, just go for the Rebel Within. I still have no idea how they baked a pastry yet did a 4-6 minute egg with the yolk still running. <br><br>High recommend. On your way, stop by Paxton Gate a few doors down and Happy Moose Juice.

"reviewcomment":"So I just started this thing called Coffee Meets Bagel and saw this place serves bagels for breakfast so I thought it be a fun place to meet my &#34;bagel&#34; here. <br><br>I waited for 40 minutes. No show. No text saying she&#39;d be late...no response. So while I was waiting I looked over the entire menu, observed the folks casually enjoying their morning brews in the parklet seating area, and checked out some of the small details of the shop. <br><br>This place is like the perfect combination of things: bike shop, coffee shop, good food, and even beer with a happy hour! Can this place be more hipster than that?! <br><br>Anyway, I chalked up the date as a loss and ordered myself a breakfast bagel to go and went home. The bagel hit the spot and I&#39;m glad that I at least got to enjoy some kind of bagel! <br><br>I shall return! Hopefully I&#39;ll have a more successful bagel and check out the little garden in the back. Oh! And don&#39;t forget that the cafe is cash only.",

"reviewcomment":"Please excuse me of my infatuation with this coffee shop, but I am just in love with the idea of combining a laundromat and coffee shop. I&#39;ve seen coffee shops combined with beauty stores, Bike clubs (SF Rapha Cycle Club, I&#39;m looking at you), and markets. But, not a laundromat! I just get tingly sensations reminiscing about the unique experience of smelling laundry detergent &amp; drying sheets with fresh coffee. <br><br>There is a lot of detail that went into building the coffee section of Mission Bubbles and Coffee. The wood and glass also provides enough separation between the laundromat and the precious coffee, pastries, and other goods.<br><br>Thoughts/Things you may want to know:<br>+ They serve Verve coffee<br>+ Very clean laundromat <br>+ There is seating! Well, sort of. They have those tables/seats (whatever you call them) you used to use in grade school. Scrappy and slightly ghetto. I like it. <br>+ You can order from the outside counter or immerse yourself inside for a fuller, aromatic ordering experience.<br><br>My mind is still blown at the thought of these two things coming together. I need to get over myself. Freakin&#39; Laundromat + Coffee.",

They only ever have one or two people working the cash register/food prep, so plan on waiting a bit, it&#39;s worth it! <br><br>The bagels are the real deal, not just round bread like at other places. Just the right amount of chewy outside soft inside. <br><br>Bagel breakfast sandwiches are great, add some pastrami (and Tabasco), it&#39;s better than bacon (really!). <br><br>They&#39;ve also got a great selection of other pastries: cookies, sticky buns, hamantashen, bear claws. You&#39;ll be standing right next to the cases of them, staring as you wait to order. It&#39;s hard to resist a few impulse treats for later.<br><br>If you show up early enough in the day, the day old rack in the back has pastries in addition to half-price bagel dozens. <br><br>The coffee is hit or miss. It&#39;s not bad tasting, but if they&#39;re busy, they&#39;ll probably be empty. Decaf is a better bet. Coffee is directly to your left as you walk in.

I have been too many Mexican places that are &#34;amazing&#34; in and around SF, only to leave disappointed or unsatisfied. What I mean by disappointed or unsatisfied is a Carne asada burrito filled with rice and lettuce and a few pieces of asada or dropping $12 for a couple of ok tacos.<br><br>No longer do I have to deal with rice filled burritos. I can get my San Diego style Mexican food here in SF, and that makes me happy. I can get the fresh rolled tacos I love and miss. I can get my California burrito fix here.

Â If you want mayo or mustard, they add it to the sandwich at the point of sale, so that the bread won&#39;t be soggy from soaking up mayo.

"reviewcomment":"This hands down is my favorite cafÃ© in the city. <br><br>I was one of their first customers when they first opened their doors. I was thrilled to have an alternative to the Starbucks. The first thing I ordered was a cappuccino and a Green tea cupcake. The cappuccino was perfectly creamy, like a dessert with a rich shot of espresso swirled in. I don&#39;t usually get very excited about coffee. I just need to get it down for the caffeine boost. This cappuccino made me feel warm and happy. Â I savoured every single sip. The Green tea cupcake was incredible too. Â It was fresh baked with a delicious frosting and moist filling. It was the perfect size for an afternoon treat. Delise has high end desserts with quality ingredients in smaller portions so you can afford it. You can really taste the difference. They know what they are doing and it shows. They&#39;re at the top of the game with their craft. <br><br>Going to Delise is a special experience that I look forward to. It&#39;s the way I like to treat myself. If I&#39;m having a hard day, I know I can get a scoop of in house made gourmet icecream (My current favorite is the mint chip) and eat it slowly as I head back to the office. Their lunch sandwiches are incredible too. I also recommend the **Truffle egg salad sandwich**. Amazing.<br><br>What I like most about Delise are the owners. They&#39;re warm and kind. They share samples of their newest culinary creations and you see that they truly love what they do. I witnessed them becoming parents and saw their little boy growing up. Sometimes he&#39;s in the shop playing with his toy truck and making the customers smile at this antics. I remember back to when he was just a little baby. I&#39;m glad Delise is around because it makes my day a little brighter every time I visit this cafÃ©. They&#39;re always inventing new recipes so I look forward to discovering what&#39;s new each week<br><br>This CafÃ© gives a warm hometown feel to an otherwise tourist trap area of the city. I&#39;m really glad Delise exists and I hope they stick around for a long time.",

I have eaten pineapple buns in Hong Kong, New York Chinatown, Vancouver BC Chinatown, and just about every Chinatown in major US cities, and this one is the best!! Make sure you ask for the pineapple buns with the bright orange egg custard...you won&#39;t regret it :-)",

"reviewcomment":"This review is for Early breakfast only but I Love Love LOVE this spot and will update my review for lunch items very soon :)<br><br>If you not from around here, there is some quick tips and directions:<br><br>The shop is BEHIND the Hilton (the main entrance of the Hilton is located on O&#39; farrel street just next to Mason street)<br><br>From O&#39;farrrell, Walk DOWN on Mason street for less than one block next to the Hilton&#39;s back entrance and across from Hotel Fusion, <br>Turn LEFT and Tadahhh there it is... there is Daniel&#39;s Cafe, you can recognize their green store front and a couple of tables right away when you look on the left.<br><br>They open everyday at 7am sharp like promised on their schedule and they are very punctual, Always open on time and ready to get things cooking by 7am<br><br>I never had to wait outside for the place to open unlike other similar breakfast joint that made me wait outside 30/45 minutes late behind opening schedule ... so rude...<br> But not at Daniel&#39;s and I highly appreciate that.<br>Because after working all night, by that time, I AM STARVIN!!!<br>So Daniel is now my new FAVORITE breakfast spot early mornings!!!<br><br>And the custumer service is TOP NOTCH! Friendly, attentive, He will describe proudly each item on the menu that are be new to me... With a smile and a great attitude!<br><br>Now the food... <br>I ordered the egg, ham and cheese croissant many time with different kind of cheese every single visit and they are ALL SO GOOD!!!<br>PLUS the croissant it self IS huge!!! Flaky just right on the outside and so soft and buttery on the inside, just the right way for a croissant to be meant to be.<br>I swear I could eat 3 of those each single day, Thats how good their sandwiches are!<br><br>They offer 4 of 5 different kind of cheese to chose from,but I am talking about the higher quality fromage, semi aged cheddar, Swiss, Provolone, pepper jack, and Deli American but not the yellow processed &#34;Krap&#34; straight out of a plastic wrap, REAL DELI CHEESE. Definitely next level...<br><br>Most similar spot offer only one kind of cheese for their breakfast sandwiches... <br><br>So YES, Daniel&#39;s coffee is a small hole in the wall but they sucker punch all their competitor from Market street all the way up to Lower Nob hill<br>Because of Their ultra personable and friendly customer service.<br><br>They also offer several bread and bagel options to Â to customize your sandwich to perfection.<br><br>breakfast sandwich meat selection is: Ham, Bacon, Sausage and turkey i believe<br><br>The Eggs are FRESH, NOT the time saving blend that come from a milk carton<br><br>The sandwiches are Always cooked to perfection with the melty cheese drooling on the hot ham all wrapped into delicious croissant, soft and buttery inside and slightly crispy outside :) breakfast heaven.<br><br>The also have a very nice choice of both french and American Â Boulangerie style pastries such as donuts, Giant bear claw, muffins of many variety, chocolate and almond croissant...<br><br>Fresh cut fruits salads, both East Coast and west coast style sandwiches combo and many more :)<br><br>I cant wait to go back for lunch and get one of those California Style bagel sandwich with cream cheese, avocado, tomato, oignon and Â cucumber yum yum yum!!!<br><br>Great selection of teas and coffees, but only one kind of tea latte (chai latte)<br>I wish they can add green tea latte or thai tea latte perhaps?<br><br>Not that dont like coffe I LOVE COFFEE but because i work night shift schedule, I have my breakfast BEFORE going to bed and nothing is more soothing for my tired body than a delicious Hot milk tea :) (makes me sleep like a baby)<br>Milk tea before my nightime (8am) and coffee in the morning (5pm for me)<br><br>But i heard regulars costumers saying that Danial&#39;s&#34; house&#34; cup of joe beat any chain of coffee shop around the neighborhood.<br><br>The prices are excellent considering the quality of ingredient, food cooked fresh to order and the Huge portions and toppings :) between $3 to $4,75 for fresh made to order breakfast items in that &#34;more expensive side of town... Its as good as it get!<br><br>Go check out this clean, affordable, delicious breakfast joint and and your delicious sandwich plus the smile and kindnes of Daniel will just make your day :)",

"reviewcomment":"Hooray! Peet&#39;s now offers ALMOND MILK LATTES. Currently you can CHECK-IN ON YELP and get $1 off any vanilla latte. If you opt in for Peet&#39;s electronic newsletters, you also frequently receive coupons via email. I recently got one for $2 off any size soy/almond milk vanilla latte and decided to give it a try. Delicious! The nutty flavor of almond milk goes really well with the vanilla, and I don&#39;t feel that extra sweet flavor that I taste in soy milk. <br><br>I like this particular location because it&#39;s right by my office. For some reason it doesn&#39;t get ridiculously crowded in mornings unlike Starbucks around the corner. If I need a breather from working at my cube, I often walk down for a quick break. There&#39;s also a few tables available if you want to eat lunch here too (usually I grab a bahn mi sandwich from Tart to Tart and come eat at Peet&#39;s). Additionally, there is no overwhelming background music if you want to do some work at this location--just the hum of espresso machines.<br><br>Tips:<br>+ Check-in via Yelp for a discount<br>+ Subscribe to online newsletter for more coupons/discounts<br>+ Try the almond milk vanilla latte<br><br>Things to note:<br>- Peet&#39;s tends to have a lower temp on drinks compared to Starbucks. Just ask them to make it extra hot if you prefer it.",

I met the guy behind them (no clue it was him at the time) when he was manning a sampling table at our local Whole Foods on Telegraph Av. <br><br>I was drawn to the concept of having a cereal bar:<br>1) With less ingredients than fingers on a single hand!<br>2) That, complemented with two glasses of water, subbed for a meal.<br>3) Most important for me, as someone with type 1 diabetes (though I only discovered this later), a bar that I could cover for with impeccable precision with an insulin shot/bolus and not see a significant spike in my blood sugar as a consequence. <br><br>I have since learned that the nice post-prandial BG levels are influenced by the lack of surprises in the list of ingredients (nothing you need a Ph.D. to pronounce) and the use of whole oats flour.<br><br>Now, every time I go to Whole Foods I stack up on CORE bars.

Some pies in clear see through boxes. Very simple! <br><br>Staff: Terri herself was a great lady takes no non sense approach and will answer your concerns immediately on the spot none of that let me give you a call back or let me see what I can do attitude, service was instant spot on.<br><br>Cleanliness: Nothing to be said!<br><br>Eats/Drinks: Her chocolate chip and peanut butter $3.25 is what I highly recommend if you&#39;ve never have gourmet home made cookies you better call your doctor on the spot to see if you can have a cheat day.<br><br>Products: Seasonal goods,pies,cookies,slices,custom decos,cake pops.<br><br>Punch Line: Fresh cookies,organic ingredients, friendly cordial,samples,gift wraps&amp;packages.<br><br>Final Thoughts: What I see is a lots of people passing by her table take quick notice of the items but make no attempt to ask or walk any closer. For those of you who buy only from certain types of ethnicity you better check their items compare to that of someone who you avoided. No hating here just good ol eats made from scratch with hearty ingredients.",

"reviewcomment":"I always called this place Deli &amp; Espresso, and all my friends would be like, um, where? But I see someone else called it that too, so I feel much better. I am a big sandwich lover, and I think Deli &amp; does their sandwich well. I have ordered off the board, I got a Rueben when I was going through a Rueben phase of life, but prior to my Rueben days, I was obsessed with the BLTTAS (bacon, lettuce, tomato, turkey, avocado, &amp; sprouts) and a bag of Dirty jalepeno chips. <br><br>Even though it&#39;s like a $10 sando, I think it&#39;s worth it. Fresh meat, veggies, cheese, and bread, lots of dessert and drink options. There is indoor seating upstairs so you can look down on the peasants still in line while you happily eat.

"reviewcomment":"It took over three years of living a mile away, along with countless recommendations from trusted friends, before we jumped at the opportunity to celebrate Valentine&#39;s Day in this tidy, homey spot on the surprisingly lively Cortland Avenue strip. Â The walls are decorated with old windows propped up on small ledges, giving it a pleasant, somewhat antique, country farmhouse vibe. Â The space is incredibly small and looked tight towards the front - we were lucky to be in the far back of the tiny second room, giving us a bit more space to maneuver.<br><br>The cornerstone of our meal was the amazing chicken pot pie. Â The pastry crust was buttery, soft towards the middle, and gently crisp as it wrapped along the porcelain edges of the dish. Â Underneath, a stew of tender chicken and seasonal root vegetables doused in a complex, aromatic palette of spices. Â If the crust were available as a dish unto its own, that alone would warrant a trip.<br><br>The vegetable courses were very nearly a match for a pot pie. Â The delightfully light salad of arugula, pear, Parmesan, and shaved fennel was a palate pleaser, even a palate cleanser after the hearty pie. Â Our Brussels Sprouts, a food I subsist on in great quantity whenever they are available, were exquisitely roasted to a just-right texture and done-ness that is hard to come by, even if there was a smidgeon too much oil in the finish.<br><br>We were also extremely impressed with the fish tacos, featuring enormous and tender battered fish fillets, infused with cilantro, with a heaping portion of jicama slaw, avocado spread, and mild salsa. Â This was quite possibly the best fried fish I&#39;ve had, not greasy and very moist. Â The tacos themselves are more of a fork-and-knife dish given their girth, although I managed a few fully-wrapped bites.<br><br>The downsides here were a disengaged server who didn&#39;t spend a moment extra with us, seemed overly formal and not warm. Â For a restaurant with such stellar food, we were also disappointed by the dry, tasteless Italian bread slices, Â  made slightly more tolerable by the whipped butter.<br><br>Overall, The Liberty Cafe created a winning evening and a nice, romantic setting for a special meal.",

"reviewcomment":"We practically jogged to this place when we got to the Golden Gate. My small bladder had my husband and I in a panic, so we walked down the path to the restrooms--thank goodness those existed, since my &#34;waterlogged&#34; brain was thinking of all of the horrible things that could happen in that situation--and decided to get some coffee to warm up from the drippy fog and to relax from the distress. <br><br>The chai I had was pretty tasty (worth noting that both of our beverages were extremely hot, which isn&#39;t the best thing in the world, but it&#39;s better than cold!) and the chicken salad that we shared was also really good. I love chicken salad, but sometimes get turned off by extra creaminess and bad chicken. This was not the case, as we devoured our little lunch and continued to explore the rest of the day. <br><br>The items in the shop weren&#39;t anything too unusual or eye catching and what really didn&#39;t help was the fact that the place is very tiny, so there wasn&#39;t much room for the line at the counter, and especially limited room for browsing.",

"reviewcomment":"I had my wedding here last weekend and it was a dream come true! Patty helped me from start to finish, from showing us around the winery, to the rehearsal, and eventually coordinating the day. She was so helpful, kind, patient, and fun to work with! When we first visited the winery, my fiance and I fell in love with the breathtaking views and beautiful pavilion area. We knew we wanted our wedding here and signed the contract that day! We chose a day in February because of the discounted winter rate and prayed for a sunny day-which we got! The wind was still icy cold but it was gorgeous and sunny.<br><br>On the wedding day, we arrived and the girls went directly to the bridal suite. It was a perfect and cute little room where we got ready. There was a balcony outside which we would&#39;ve used more if it was warmer. The guys had their own room too upstairs. We had two hours to freshen up, relax, and take photos.<br><br>When I walked out to the ceremony with my mom by my side, it was more beautiful than I ever imagined! The wooden pavilion overlooks the vineyard and bay area, and since it was sunny and clear, we had a great view--though I was just staring at my now husband. After the cocktail hour and so many photos, we went to the reception. Surrounded by glass windows, family, and friends, we ate while watching the sun set. It was perfect. We were rushed at the end because we were going over time, but Patty was so gracious and patient with us, and throughout the whole day I was put to ease because I knew she was helping coordinate. If you&#39;re looking for a gorgeous venue for your wedding and love the rustic and naturey feel--look no further. It was the best day ever! :)",

Â She mentioned one would have to drink about 3 cups for a month to really benefit from the tea and improve health. Â That&#39;s not much for someone who enjoys and drinks tea.<br><br>I bought tea and they sealed it in packaging that made it easy to travel with. Â Even after a few years, the tea stills tastes fine after steeping. Â I don&#39;t know if the price is expensive but the leaves can be steeped to make a few cups so it lasts a long time for the price I paid.

"reviewcomment":"Right off the bat, I&#39;m a big fan of Simple Pleasures. I&#39;ve lived in San Francisco for a little over 17 years and I&#39;ve been going to this cafe for pretty much just as long. Want a cup of coffee and a bagel or pastry to start off your morning? They&#39;ve got that. Want some lunch in the afternoon as you study or catch up on work? They have that too. How &#39;bout some dinner after a long day? Hey, guess what, they&#39;ve got that covered as well! But it&#39;s not just about the food abnd drinks they have, it&#39;s the people who work there, the live music that&#39;s there 3-4 times a week, and the comfortable, Â welcoming homey vibe Â that they put forth.<br><br>San Francisco, like so many major cities in the US and around the world are filled with Starbucks&#39; and other big box coffee shops that all serve the same type of drinks, play the same types of music, and that practically look the same. Among all that sits Simple Pleasure in WAY Outer Richmond uneffected by the coffee gentrification and continuing to offer quality beverages, food, and what&#39;s essentially an extended living room for all those who&#39;s days can be made better by a beverage, a bite to eat, some live music, and some friendly conversations.<br><br>I love Simple Pleasures Cafe, and I think if you come on out and take a visit that you will too!",

Â Michelle was amazing, she helped us pick our flavors and brought us so many samples to try that I was awake for three days! Her selection of cupcakes was vast and she even offered to make custom flavors if we did not find the ones we wanted (we did). Â We worked out the amount of cupcakes needed for our wedding and I&#39;ll be damned if I didnt eat the very last cupcake as I was leaving the venue...Michelle was easy to work with and very accomodating, I can&#39;t wait to work with her again!!<br><br>Thank you for helping make our special day so sweet!!<br><br>Michael and Krista Neuman",

"reviewcomment":"I would say this is the most popular and busiest of the Russian specialty market food stores in SF&#39;s &#34;Little Russia&#34; on Geary Blvd. - on weekends this place is packed. Their selection of meat and deli products are second to none. Large cases full of whatever you might be craving in the way of Eastern European specialties are in great abundance at New World. Â  <br><br>Fine caviar, sturgeon, interesting smoked/cured salmon - its all here. Â Cheese blintzes and cherry blintzes, potato and mushroom vareniki are wonderful. <br><br>They have two different kinds of sauerkraut. One of them is just labeled sauerkraut and is very fresh, crispy and salty/tangy. The other is called Buriyski-style sauerkraut, also good. <br><br>Dark and light rye breads from &#34;The Bavarian Bread Company&#34; in San Leandro are always good (Russians in the Bay Area seem to love German bread) . <br><br>Pork and veal Pelmeni, Piroshki and many different kinds of fresh salads, all Russian style, are available every day, all the time. <br><br>I am not Russian, but two years with a lovely blonde from Moscow made me a big fan of Russian food and drink. With Sochi on every night this week and the &#34;Russian Festival&#34; coming up in SF this weekend (we&#39;ll be there) I have that nostalgia running through my mind and soon will need to make a trip back to New World Market. <br><br>PS - I also like to shop &#34;European Food&#34; on Clement (@ 32nd) because it is not as crowded and parking can be a little (but not much) better, both are good, with New World having a larger selection of fresh items.",

The food comes out quick, so you won&#39;t be waiting long. Then again there wasn&#39;t a lot of people in line at the time I went. If you want a tasty sandwich and great service, go to Fogcutter.

I suspect their other truffles were delicious, but I can&#39;t afford that kind of luxery. Only one purchased because it was $3.50.

It was a little hard for me to find this spot since I was unfamiliar with this indoor farmers market thing. I went from one end to the other thinking I was looking for a store or restaurant but when I finally found it It was worth it. <br><br>The donuts are different from other places since they don&#39;t sit in a case to preserve freshness so I feel like they were a tad hard. But it could also be because I showed up 10 minutes before they were closing up. They were heavy too! Very dense in a good way. Less of a airy cake and Moore like a this thick bread with really good frosting. Usually I will get a couple different donuts but despite the bright frosting or sprinkles they will taste kind of the same. Every one of these donuts had a distinct and unique taste. I some how managed to wait till we got back to our spot to cut these puppies into pieces and have a taste test with my friends. We all agreed they were not only delicious but very filling.

I saw a few people walk in and out who probably thought the same thing.<br><br>Stuck it out though, and was treated to some great chirashi for a great price. Didn&#39;t come with any super fancy fish but did come with a piece of real crab which was a nice surprise. It survived the 20 min public transit ride back home and still tasted fresh.

They have the freshest, cheapest, cleanest fruits and vegtables around, and a great butcher. <br><br>They also have a wide variety of Mexican products including, quesos, chicharrones, and I even saw Bacalao (salted dried cod), there! All for EXTREMELY REASONABLE PRICES. The lady who is at the counter is very friendly too! I am thankful to have a go to place like this and have found it well worth the trip from nob hill.

Â Well, the staff there could not have been more helpful and accommodating. Â K2 (Kevin #2) was super helpful in planning, set up, close down, and he worked to transform their already cool space into an amazing venue for the service.

I&#39;ve been here twice and had the banana split both times. Reason being, it was so good the first time, I couldn&#39;t NOT get it the second time. It is the only sundae option that I saw that had the strawberry ice cream, which is very flavorful and delicious. If I get the opportunity to stop by here again, maybe I&#39;ll try a different menu item.<br><br>Stop by at this place for some dessert if you&#39;re a visitor in San Francisco.<br><br>Oh, and check in on Yelp to save 10% !!!",

"reviewcomment":"This is a review for the customer service there. Although I only went into the store and not past the register I must commend Austin (I believe that was him name) for doing such an excellent job. I came in last night with a list from a client and he went out of his way to journey around the store and collect everything while I hung out.<br><br>Once everything was rung up the price came to $1K. Yes, it&#39;s easier than you&#39;d think to spend $1000 on a shopping bag full of glasses. I called the client to confirm. She ended up modifying her order and Austin was pleasant and understanding despite the fact he spent awhile collecting everything.<br><br>He even assured me that if the client didn&#39;t pay for some reason they could pay me back if I brought the receipt in. Talk about amazing customer service.<br><br>The store itself had a nice layout and had levels and levels to explore.<br><br>I hope Austin gets a raise. He deserves it.",

I don&#39;t mind that they don&#39;t open until the mid-afternoon (usually around 3pm, sometimes a little later, sometimes a little earlier - it all depends), because I only go there at night if I need a snack or a drink. Everyone in the family is really nice and they will remember your face if you are a regular in there (like we are) and if you ever see them outside of the business, they will always say hi. All in all it&#39;s a nice place, and they have a vast selection of alcohol and wine for you booze hounds :) Their prices can be a little high, but it is a convenience store and it is in San Francisco.<br><br>Also there is a $10 minimum if you are using a credit/debit card. For those of you non Wamu users there is an ATM outside, but I don&#39;t know their fee and sometimes I do see that it&#39;s not working, but it&#39;s always fixed within a day or so.<br><br>I love you Nimer&#39;s!",

Â I have to say that their Glazed donuts are probably one of the best I&#39;ve ever head! Â It&#39;s so plump, fluffy, not too yeasty or overly glazed. Â They also serve my favorite donut, which a lot of places don&#39;t make; the French Cruller. Â It&#39;s airy, light, not overly glazed and doesn&#39;t have that waxy taste as other Crullers do.<br><br>It&#39;s $1 for a Glazed, $1.35 for a Cruller and $1.75 for a Twist or Apple Fritter...which is really good, but I tend to only eat the crunch outer parts, because that&#39;s the best part!<br><br>Also, the staff that work there have always been so super nice, not just to me but to everyone. Â Not to mention, if they get busy, people will come from the back out of nowhere to help out. Â I like that, it shows how much they really care about their customers.<br><br>I&#39;ve been to Donut World just down the block, they can&#39;t hold a candle to California Bakery, trust me!",

Â Besides the usual Spam Musubi, they offer a whole variety of Musubi such as Peking Duck, Pork Belly, Bulgogi, and Banh Mi. Â My two favorites are the Peking Duck Musubi and Pork Belly Musubi (<a href='http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/TO1ccxi_Pypigtfc0dtL0Q?select=WM8uO2tG4Q6DGOOq9dSPzQ'>yelp.com/biz_photos/TO1câ¦</a>).

Â And they&#39;re very meaty with a very balanced meat to rice ratio as you can see from the pic.<br><br>I can&#39;t wait for Fort Mason Off The Grid to start up again in March so I can taste their magical Musubi again.

Not some dinky plastic hummus full of lackluster &#34;eh&#34; ingredients - but a hearty solid jar full of spicy organic ingredients that tickled my tongue with pure excellence.<br><br>Hummus is everywhere now. It&#39;s an excellent, easy, and accessible source of vegetarian protein. And it&#39;s so easy to play around with. Spice it up. Garlic it up. Tang it up. Sweeten it up. But with the wealth of hummus on the market - I&#39;ve found that very few hummus concoctions actually taste authentic and great. And some hummus producers add ickiness into what is fundamentally a very basic recipe. I don&#39;t want to see any canola oil in my hummus. I don&#39;t want to see any preservatives. I just want simple garbanzo beans, tahini, garlic, and olive oil. Â The Love and Hummus Co get this and go the extra step by making sure that all of their ingredients are simple and organic. Thank you.<br><br>And perhaps one of the best parts of supporting The Love &amp; Hummus is that you get to take away a wonderful well made jar with you - perfect for transporting leftovers and other yumminess.<br><br>They&#39;re the only hummus that I&#39;ll pick up at Whole Foods now and I&#39;ll make the extra trip to Whole Foods - (when I can&#39;t get over to Royal Market - which truly does make the best hummus in San Francisco) just for some heavenly healthy hummus.<br><br>Trust.",

The tamales come in neat little pie tins which are extra awesome when flipped over and covered in guacamole sauce. Vanessa helped me order enough food for 50-75 people. By the end of the night no food was left and no one went hungry, so it was just right. If anything we could have ordered more tamales, and less salad and beans, but that was because we might have overestimated the number of vegetarians. <br><br>Definitely get a variety of their drinks, which were enjoyed by non-drinkers and drinkers alike. Adding a splash of tequila to the cucumber mint and mango drinks made it a really tasty mixed drink. <br><br>If they had delivery or sold their little tamale pies in local stores here, I can see myself getting these regularly.",

He knows chocolate is the way to my heart! <br><br>Each handmade chocolate is crafted into a unique geometric shape and is painted a bright color some with paint splatter accents. It&#39;s truly a delectable piece of art. The chocolate itself is smooth and silky. The flavors cannot be found in your typical day-after-valentines-clearance-chocolates. No chunky coconut cream, strawberry, or overly sweet raspberry flavors that make your sweet tooth ache. Chocolatier Blue carries flavors like &#34;sage honey,&#34; &#34;sweet potato casserole,&#34; &#34;passion fruit caramel,&#34; and &#34;vanilla rum&#34; that are just as delicate, silky, and subtle as the chocolate itself. <br><br>You just can&#39;t stop after eating one.

On the search for vegetables (which prove hard to come by in SF; a side of fruit with a main is bizarrely the option usually given) I chose to eat here purely on the basis of them having a side of steamed veg. Not expecting much from a corner cafe with a huge menu and an odd amount of unappetising assortment of baled goods wrapped in cling film their rotisserie chicken was amazing! Vegetables were fairly standard but it couldn&#39;t have mattered less next to the meat and mashed potatoes.<br><br>After such a great meal there though I decided to venture back for breakfast. I shared the Dutch (poached eggs, hollandaise and salmon) with my girlfriend and was a little disappointed with it so perhaps this place isn&#39;t an all rounder. In saying that though, it really bares no relevance because that chicken is worth coming back for time and time again.",

"reviewcomment":"Probably my favorite farmers market in the city. The inner Richmond district is pretty much in the middle of SF, so its relatively easy to get to. There are a TON of vendors for such a newly organized farmers market, all of which having amazing quality and selection of organics. The parking is also not so bad (for san francisco) and the inner-richmond area is just growing and growing into a very cool little neighborhood with all its new parklets and stores/coffeeshops.<br><br>From what I understand they are just testing out how well this farmers market will do and the permit they have to host it is only a temporary permit?? If so, I really do hope they stick around. It seems successful enough and if you have the time and money it really is a great farmers market experience",

"reviewcomment":"TIP #1: You can make your own smoothies! Start with the base (milk-based or soy milk), choose the fruit combo you want, and then choose your add-ins. It&#39;s $.75 per add-in, or two for $1. Not on the menu: sugar-free chocolate sauce!<br><br>TIP #2: The meal replacement smoothies are worth the price. It&#39;s nearly impossible to get the same nutritionals as a Berrylicious smoothie without paying more.<br><br>TIP #3: Get a loyalty card--buy 7 smoothies, get your eighth one free. <br><br>Confession: sometimes, after work when I&#39;m really tired, I stop by here to get a meal replacement smoothie and call it a night. It&#39;s filling, nutritious, and yummy. It&#39;s quick and easy. It&#39;s in my gym. So what if I didn&#39;t work out right before dinner? Work is one really long workout. (I know, excuses, excuses.)<br><br>If you&#39;re looking for a supersweet candy treat smoothie, go to Jamba Juice. <br><br>They also offer breakfast for us earlybirds at the gym: oatmeal with toppings, bagels, coffee, and tea. Cheaper than a comparable meal at Starbucks or any other cafe, and probably healthier too. And sometimes, if they made too much of a smoothie, they pour the leftover stuff into little sample cups. Perfect to grab on the way out of the gym. <br><br>If you have any questions, the employees are all young and eager to help!",

"reviewcomment":"I would probably have to vote Farley&#39;s as one of the most relaxed coffee shops that I&#39;ve been to here in San Francisco. Nestled in a quiet neighborhood in Potrero Hill, you are instinctively drawn in by the chatter and the house full of patrons eagerly waiting for their caffeine fix and clicking away on their laptops as they sip on house brewed coffee and tea. <br><br>The organic chai tea latte was creamy, piping hot, and perfectly spiced, all in a unique Farley&#39;s black and white mug. Now, the gibraltar, that monster is no joke. Perfect for those who need an extra pep in their step, nice and strong, served in a shot glass!<br><br>So what made this coffee shop so enjoyable was the fact that there were so many different things available to occupy your time. They had different board games, quirky books, current magazines, and good ol&#39; WiFi. The atmosphere is wonderfully casual, yet hipsterish at the same time. <br><br>The baristas were friendly and prompt. I would definitely recommend Farley&#39;s as a fun, cool, coffee shop to visit on a lazy day! What a hidden gem!",

But they really know how to make a lox scramble... I&#39;d highly highly recommend doing that if you can handle salmon before 12pm. Also, when you get fruit on the side, it&#39;s not your average cantaloupe and grapes... But today they gave mango..

Â So I figured that the best way to sample a bit of everything on their menu is to order the Old World Plate.<br>Old World Plate - <a href='/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F12L6Mgw&amp;s=a17f39c190f9471a35d2bb7cc41734f568bb8000479c509bc8b9efd9906afc98' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>bit.ly/12L6Mgw</a><br>There&#39;s a lot going on here with this loaded plate. Â Chicken schnitzel with caraway honey and pepper relish, pierogi with condiments, and apple-cabbage slaw. The schintzel was good but it seemed a little bit overcooked. Â I think the real stars of the plate were the pierogi. Â I really couldn&#39;t get enough of those.<br><br>Once I figured out how everything tasted, that&#39;s when I decided on ordering everything separately starting with my next visit where they were at Off The Grid Upper Haight. Â Starting with their Pierogi.<br><br>Pierogi Combo -- Â <a href='/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F14QoAn5&amp;s=237843ea44199edb316ea28d6791874294b1e1df16c162771de424398121d92c' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>bit.ly/14QoAn5</a><br>Their pierogi combo comes with Â your choice of 4 pieces each with a different filling which changes periodically but most of the time they&#39;ll have the one with goat cheese and potato. Â I&#39;m not big on goat cheese, but with their pierogi, they&#39;ve made it actually tolerable for me.<br><br>My most recent visit, where they were at Off The Grid Burlingame, I wanted to give their Chicken Schnitzel another chance, but this time in their Schinitzelwich form which is their top seller. Â After all, they call it &#34;The Chosen One.&#34; <br><br>Chicken Schnitzelwich aka &#34;The Chosen One&#34; -- <a href='/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1clJDAo&amp;s=5f10ab74a708c5c486c1654e29357e415faec6217b2b276d24bf39997c8d7470' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>bit.ly/1clJDAo</a><br>Chicken schnitzel with caraway honey, horseradish aioli, apple-cabbage slaw &amp; optional chopped liver schmear on an Acme roll. Â <br>Okay, now they had me convinced. Â This sandwich is ridiculous! Â But I think the key factor in me liking this is actually the liver schmear. Â It just held everything all together and kept the schnitzel very moist and added more flavor to it. Â And with the Acme roll, it made the sandwich a total winner!<br><br>Some of their specials are pretty awesome too. Â At last year&#39;s Eat Real Festival, they offered a Savory Rye Bread Pudding. <br>Savory Rye Bread Pudding with Corned Beef from Old World Food Truck -- Â <a href='/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F19JsAsi&amp;s=2bb37c16538571afd97d75bd9011a8b52c59d97a73ad2addb08027ba948dd46f' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>bit.ly/19JsAsi</a><br>Sounds both strange and awesome at the same time but believe me, it was the best thing I&#39;ve eaten at the whole festival. Â Very savory bread pudding and had a nice amount of corned beef added. Â I hope they add this to their regular menu someday.<br><br>And the Beef Brisket Borscht is pretty damn good! Â A beet and vegetable soup served with sour cream, fresh dill and croutons. Â You can order this with half a sandwich for $10. Not a bad deal at all!<br><br>So overall, a very solid food truck. Â I&#39;m giving Old World Food Truck a big 5 stars because of their fantastic menu, and for cranking out awesome specials!",

"reviewcomment":"Best meal EVER!!!!!!!!!!!! <br>A friend of mine wanted BBQ and there isn&#39;t much good BBQ in SF. For a super multicultural city it&#39;s pretty depressing. So it was worth giving it a try. BBQ is one of my favorite cuisines and this place rocked my socks! <br><br>First I got the &#34;safe word&#34;.... I&#39;m all about safe words so this was perfect. <br>For starters we got the sweet breads...cooked perfectly. Even the greens with the hidden jalapeÃ±os could have been a meal on its own. The deviled eggs were damn good! Yummy I wish I had more.<br><br>For the meal I got the pork ribs with greens and Brie Mac and cheese. Holy hell this stuff was good. I could have just ate the sides on their own. <br>But those ribs tho.....much bigger than I was expecting. Sooooo tender and meaty. Again cooked perfectly. The dry rub was too die for. I had a bit of the sauce...but whatever...the ribs stood on their own. My friend had the dinosaur bone. It was a big piece of meat with a large 12&#34; bone. It came out piping hot and very juicey. <br><br>This food was soooooo good. 3 hours later and I&#39;m still full. It&#39;s a bit pricey and worth every penny. I was going to ask the chef to marry me but I was soo full I could barely walk. After this glorious meal I saw they have a tasting menu for $35. That is going to happen with stretchy pants. I highly enjoyed my meal.",

"reviewcomment":"I just completed a 5-day cleanse with juice to you and I was impressed with the overall experience and especially the quality of the juice. Having done juice cleanses before, I customized my program to do a &#34;step&#34; cleanse where each day was progressively more difficult (i.e. the ratio of green juices to other juices increased until all the juices were green). They accommodated my custom menu (including a mid-week change to my last day) without error and I found everyone that I interacted with to be sincere and dedicated.<br><br>Highlights:<br>- the juice was incredibly fresh. it makes a difference. I was nervous that the green juices would be icky -- but i found them to be quite refreshing. <br>- someone else does all of the work! you just drink juice. This is very relaxing. <br>- the portions were healthy -- it felt like a meaningful amount of juice each time which meant I could enjoy drinking them (instead of gulping them down in one swoop)<br>- on any cleanse of this type you are going to have side effects (it&#39;s a big shift!) and I had all of them, with day 2 being the most difficult (caffeine withdrawal) and day 3 being the most satisfying. <br>- i had a lot of energy in the mornings, but tended to fade in the afternoon and was sometimes a bit spacey. I expected this and planned accordingly. Naps are key!<br>- the almond milk is AMAZING. I&#39;m not sure I can ever go back to the store bought stuff. <br>- I feel like I cut my sugar cravings and changed my relationship with food in terms of how much I eat and when. This is useful. <br><br>Overall, I was incredibly happy with the experience and I plan to continue to integrate their juices into my weekly regimen.",

"reviewcomment":"The cheapest produce around, hands down. Not only that, they rank at the top of the local mission produce markets in terms of quality and freshness. The cheapest paletas around, and if you don&#39;t know what that means, I&#39;m sorry. The cheapest salad around, but use your eyes to spot the best ones. A variety of daily items if you are a one stop shopper and a very efficient cashier who can cut your cheese and wring you up as he watches the Chivas defeat America while he converses about the daily happenings and gentrification. Yeah, Casa Maria is bomb and I will go here any day over De Lano&#39;s which besides, everyone knows is really a Cala Foods in disguise.<br>The only complaint, if there ever was any here, is that my Inka Cola is not sold cold out of the freezer, but that&#39;s ok I come in early and put one in the freezer and come back later and pick it up nice and cold and ready to drink. <br>I have no idea why the cats belong in the business profile pic, because I have never seen them. Maybe they are co-owners or trust fund cats. Or maybe I&#39;ve been checking into the wrong place this whole time. FML",

"reviewcomment":"While sight seeing at Ghirardelli Square with visiting family members, we found ourselves in front of this store. Â My first reaction after trying to pronounce the sign was what kind of place is this? Â As I peeked into the window, my second thought was, that it was just another specialty condiments store. Â But when my boyfriend went inside, I decided to follow suit as my curiosity became peaked. Â It turned out that this shop had more to offer than expected! Â I was amazed at the large number of choices you get in flavored oils, vinegars and powdered seasonings. <br><br>This unique store displays casks of infused oils such as extra virgin olive oils, infused oils, nut oils, seed oils, and wellness oils, featured with smooth tasting flavors like pistachio, walnut, garlic, avocado, basil, chili and a whole lot more! Â <br><br>The vinegars are aged in oak barrels while blended with their own special recipes that included ingredients such as apple, cherry, lemon, grape, ginger, white or red wines and even beer! Â <br><br>The friendly and helpful staff were very enthusiastic about their products and offered free tasting of any number of the oils and vinegars separately or mixed together. Â At first it seemed strange for me to start tasting the oils, but the nice flavors quickly eased my mind. Â Then when they combined it with a flavored vinegar, I realized how delicious mixing them both together could be! Â <br><br>So many options are available here that also include a large variety of spices and seasonings. Â Just find the flavors you want, purchase the size and number of bottles you want to fill, and then they fill and seal them for you so you don&#39;t have to worry about any leakage before getting them home.<br><br>This is definitely a shop that caters to anyone who enjoys gourmet cooking. Â Now, the possibilities can be endless in creating your own unique recipes or give to someone as a gift. Â And it&#39;s nice to know that you can also order from them online!<br><br><a href='/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D1P4m_29MOpU&amp;s=daa92711fec81e1215fbcf842e8cc5201738d55bf3bf1e87c9389e42bb6edbe3' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>youtube.com/watch?v=1P4mâ¦</a>",

"reviewcomment":"I am a HUGE fan of Dark Chocolate and finding GREAT Vegan Dark Chocolate is hard to come by. Â <br><br>I came across Organic/Vegan Alter Eco Dark Almond Chocolate yesterday (06-02-2013) and I am in love. This Dark Chocolate was included in my Healthy Surprise box and I quickly began the search of where I could find it locally. <br><br>I quickly went onto Alter Eco&#39;s website and discovered that they had a search feature that allows you to enter your zip code and find local store that sell &#39;Alter Eco.&#39; After discovering that several Whole Foods store sold &#39;Alter Eco&#39; I gave them a call and quite frankly the person(s) I spoke with had no idea what I was talking about so I called &#39;Alter Eco&#39; themselves and they were extremely helpful. <br><br>The folks from &#39;Alter Eco&#39; went into great detail about all of the &#39;Fair Trade&#39; products they carry. Alter Eco not only sells Chocolate but they sell Quinoa, Rice &amp; Sugar, all of which are &#39;Fair Trade Certified&#39; items. You might ask yourself what is &#39;Fair Trade&#39;? Well &#39;Fair Trade&#39; means the producers have been paid a price that ensures sustainable production and living conditions, along with a premium to support the growth and advancement of the cooperatives and their communities.<br><br>Contract prices between Alter Eco and the supplying farmers are 10% to 30% higher than the local market price, with an additional Fair Trade premium set every year by the Fairtrade Labelling Organization (by product category and country of origin). In a global food system where farmers often carry debt three times their annual income, Fair Trade provides concrete opportunities for a stable, prosperous life.<br><br>I was pleased to discover that since 2007 Alter Eco has provided: <br><br>$1,116,000 beyond market prices.<br>$150,000 in premiums.<br>Sustainable development for 6 co-ops.<br>A living wage for 5,300 farmers.<br><br>Alter Eco is also NON-GMO. <br><br>To me there is no question where I will be buying my Vegan Dark Chocolate from this date forward. <br><br>I truly do not care that I am paying $1.00 - $1.50 more for Chocolate knowing where it comes, who Alter Eco is supporting and the quality/care that goes into the product. <br><br>If you have yet to try this product Vegan or not, you have to give Alter Eco a shot and I in my opinion you will not be disappointed.",

Our organization had used Sun Sang before and I can say it is a huge reason why students keep coming back to our events! They are always on time to deliver (early, even) and all the food is steaming hot when it arrives (which is incredible seeing as to how it comes all the way from the opposite side of the city. You can request for trays or individually boxed meals. We went with the boxed meals this time and the students loved it! <br><br>The prices are extremely reasonable for the huge portions of food they prepare for you - definitely a place to order from if you&#39;re on a tight budget! They were even nice enough to give us extra boxes :) WHAT A DEAL!<br><br>I cannot emphasize how delicious the food is as well. The crispy chicken was everyone&#39;s favorite.

"reviewcomment":"I&#39;ve never been super into pies until I met Mission Pie! We love their mixed berries pie. Anything with berries in our pies have been delicious. The pies are made to perfection. If I wasn&#39;t a pie person before, I am now!<br><br>I have a huge sweet tooth and was surprised when the pie wasn&#39;t overwhelmingly sweet. It had a subtle sweetness to it and it worked so well! It was light and tasted so fresh. The crust is to die for and the pie is topped with a delicious crumb topping. I could eat the crumb topping alone and be happy. Â <br><br>Our all time favorite pie is the Mixed Berries, which is only in season during the summer. We also like the apple huckleberry pie. Honestly, we have tried a couple of pie slices that we weren&#39;t a huge fan of but the ones that we really love are definitely worth the 5 star review. We tried the Pear Frangipane which was not our favorite. The pear flavor was too light and it didn&#39;t quite hit the spot. <br><br>Anytime we come to the city, we bring back a pie. $22 a pie is steep but for us, it&#39;s all worth it! Cash only!",

"reviewcomment":"This farmer&#39;s market is a delight. It&#39;s held every Saturday morning from 9 to 1. It is located next to Starbucks and across the street from Safeway. The Fillmore Farmer&#39;s Market is small, but has all the essentials: fruit, veggies, nuts, eggs, honey... and of course some treats like smoked salmon, sundries, baked goods, and Indian food. Most of the vendors are reasonably priced. You can walk away without feeling disconcerted with how much you&#39;ve spent on fresh produce (in this case, I&#39;m thinking of every visit I make to the Saturday market at the Ferry Building! Eeep!). The vendors are quite friendly and know the neighborhood well. Like any farmer&#39;s market, I would suggest getting there early to get the best pick and it does start to crowd by 9:30/10.",

I sit for an hour getting caffeinated as I write and sketch by myself. They play a lot of old 80&#39;s music. Families, locals, chatty ladies, old people, vagabonds, youngsters come in and are all welcomed. The birdies are chirping, the ocean is close by. They&#39;ve got a big water dispenser. The seating can be a little awkward, but some of the tables are shaped like surfboards, which is neat. I love the location and relaxed environment. <br><br>I only wish they would get one of those fancy high-powered hand air dryers in the bathroom. The one they have is like the little dryer that couldn&#39;t. And there&#39;s no paper towels, so I end up wiping my wet hands on my pants. Other than that, there&#39;s a lot to like about this no-frills, clean and casual cafe.",

I met her a year ago when I needed her to make some cupcakes to give to my son&#39;s daycare as a &#39;thank you&#39; gift, so even though I didn&#39;t get to try the cupcakes then, they were delivered on time and I heard rave reviews.<br>A few months later I placed an order for my son&#39;s birthday cake - Mario themed, and Kingdom Cake rose to the occasion. My son&#39;s cake was visually stunning and also tasted really good. A lot of our birthday party guests commented on how moist and delicious the cake was, and I was pretty impressed that my fussy 8 year old loved it.<br>Anyway, fast forward and Kingdom Cake has since made 2 birthday cupcake orders for me - each to the high standard I have come to expect from them. For San Francisco, I think their prices are reasonable, and I have never been disappointed in what we receive from them. Always tasty, always themed to my satisfaction.<br>Chelsea is responsive and I have been lucky enough to always receive a finished product that exceeds my expectations.<br><br>Be sure to check out their Facebook and Instagram accounts!",

"reviewcomment":"There is a food that is near and dear to my heart and harder to find on the streets of San Francisco than enriched Uranium. Â That food is black pudding and this is a tale of two loves reunited.<br><br>Black pudding is considered contraband by the FDA when imported from the UK or Ireland and as such it is near impossible to find a good interpretation in this fair city. Â This surprises me because there are quite a lot of us ex-pats living here. Â I was out and about in the sunset, not a hood I usually frequent and we were looking for some breakfast and chanced upon this place.<br><br>Walking in I saw they offered an Irish Breakfast sandwich which is proper back bacon, &#34;bangers&#34; or as we like to call them, pork sausages, grilled tomato, fried egg and saints be praised, black and white pudding. Â Being unable to turn down anything involving dried blood I ordered up one and started stuffing my face uncontrollably. Â <br><br>The sandwich is as close to perfection as I dare ask for, the bread is soft, gently chewy and stuffed to the gills with memories of breakfast. Â I&#39;m not actually Irish, but from England but the Irish version is so close to the British one that I enjoy it just as much. Â The main difference is oats added into the Irish version making it a little more dense and easier to hold together.<br><br>Since discovering the Beachside I&#39;ve made special trips to the other side of the city just to pick up the Irish Breakfast sandwich, but I&#39;ve also made excursions to other parts of the menu and can highly recommend the chicken and waffles as well as the whoopee pies (salted caramel being a particular hit).",

They now have various treats including homemade banana bread, Rip Van Wafels, and occasionally cookies. They are more than happy to answer your questions especially if you&#39;re new to the shop. <br><br>Soon they are adding some outdoor seating I believe, and are always expanding every time I stop by. <br><br>In addition, Taelur is an expert on fashion trivia as well as a wealth of knowledge on cult sci-fi shows, so is always entertaining to talk to!

"reviewcomment":"Everything is great here. Add their friendly customer service and you&#39;re set for breakfast, lunch and snacks. Even dinner, if you arrive before they close, and want a sandwich.<br><br>It&#39;s key that they make delicious bread for their sandwiches. One could also order different bread for their sandwich choices. I always choose Herb Bread for the Four Cheese Sandwich. The Caprese Sandwich on focaccia is delicious. There are many choices for vegetarians and vegans.<br><br>Don&#39;t forget their salads. Dawn&#39;s Vegan is great. With salads, one has the option to delete ingredients one doesn&#39;t want, like for the sandwiches. The small salad size is a good portion. Soups are very good and vary often.<br><br>They also make a delicious selection of baked goods, which are good for breakfast, snacks and desserts. For breakfast, I enjoyed the yogurt, fruit &amp; housemade granola parfait. Try their famous cookies. One could also buy different cookie mixes to bake them at home. For quite a while, I wouldn&#39;t try the Oatmeal Wheat Germ Chocolate Chip cookie because of the wheat germ, but after I did, wow! One could tell oneself it&#39;s healthy (not exactly). It&#39;s great if one doesn&#39;t want a sweet cookie, since its chocolate chips are balanced by the oatmeal and wheat germ. Look for day old cookies which are less expensive and just as good.<br><br>One could also order one&#39;s food in advance, which saves a good amount of time at lunch hour, when they&#39;re very busy. (Pick up is from a shelf on the side.) However, the cooks are speedy, so the line goes quickly. For catering, they offer a variety of platters and boxed lunches for events. Try Specialty&#39;s!",

All the tables around us also ordered this.<br><br>Other than the dumplings, we also ordered the lunch specials, which were Americanized Chinese food as expected, and was very tasty. The portions were huge, and the fish was deeply marinated, which I thought was much more professionally made than I had expected. The service was great as well--the waitress would often come and talk to the customers or ask how they were doing etc. Overall the wait staff seems to really care about making a good impression on customers.",

"reviewcomment":"What attracted me to American Eatery was the sound of white carrot soup. I have never even heard of white carrot before. Well, I got it and devoured it. It was absolutely delicious. I also got a burger, but I have to say I wouldn&#39;t go back for one. It was way too greasy and the mound of bacon that they gave me was a little too much for my liking. BUT the bacon was really well done and that is the way that I like it. <br><br>I love that they serve Boylan out of the fountain. I grew up on Boylan as they are from New Jersey. I never had Boylan other than in a bottle. The fountain was just as good for sure! <br><br>Lines are insane. If you are going around lunch time...let it be known that you will wait a decent amount of time. I waited for my two things for around fifteen minutes, and people just kept pouring in after me. <br><br>Overall - good stuff! When I am visiting San Fran again one day - I may go back!",

"reviewcomment":"I usually HATE bar food/pub food because it is usually greasy and unhealthy. Â <br><br>But, I have now been to 21st Amendment twice and really enjoyed both times. Â Going for lunch is an entirely different experience than going at night. Â When we went for lunch we easily got a table and had pretty good service. Â I noticed that the lunch menu is also a little different than the dinner menu - more salads on the lunch menu. <br><br>We went on a week night during SF beer week which may be why it was PACKED. Â It definitely felt more like a bar on a friday night rather than a restaurant on a wednesday night. Â After standing in their upstairs area for a while we were able to grab a table. They were pouring some of their signature craft beers which you will never get to try outside of the 21st amendment brewery! <br><br>We ordered a chicken sandwhich and the reuben. Â The chicken sandwich was realtively healthy, compared to a lot of other pub food. Â The reuben was meh -- the pastrami was sort of dry so if you are a pastrami snob I wouldn&#39;t order it. Â I ate it anyways! Our tabl had an order of onion rings which were made just right! <br><br>Over all- good food, great beer. Â Really fun during Giant&#39;s games but it can be very hard to get a table/ seat at the bar!",

"reviewcomment":"I&#39;ve been to this location twice and I really enjoyed both trips to try a variety of teas. Â It wasn&#39;t busy both times so we spent some time sitting and sipping tea without being in a rush. Â The woman working was very knowledgeable about the teas and shared which teas were good to drink for various health conditions. Â She mentioned one would have to drink about 3 cups for a month to really benefit from the tea and improve health. Â That&#39;s not much for someone who enjoys and drinks tea.<br><br>I bought tea and they sealed it in packaging that made it easy to travel with. Â Even after a few years, the tea stills tastes fine after steeping. Â I don&#39;t know if the price is expensive but the leaves can be steeped to make a few cups so it lasts a long time for the price I paid. Â Definitely will visit again when I&#39;m in San Francisco next.",

"reviewcomment":"I very much enjoy stopping off at Lovejoy&#39;s Attic on my way home after work on my scooter. Â  <br><br>My first vehicle I owned while growing up in San Francisco was a Vespa Primavera 125. Â I always wore vintage 3 button coats and vintage gloves when I rode my scooter. Â I&#39;ve been an avid collector of vintage gloves since high school. Â Because of this, I ADORE Lovejoy&#39;s attic.<br><br>Not only do they have a wonderful, affordable collection of vintage tea-things, but they also have vintage GLOVES! Â I&#39;m typically the girl in the motorcycle helmet digging through the pile and trying on gloves Â they have in the window. Â <br><br>Quarters ARE tight SO, best to get into the shop prior to the throngs arriving. <br><br>If you DO have children ladies and gents, simply take time to have a chat with them just prior to going in and have your kids practice the following:<br><br>1) Â Look but don&#39;t touch.<br>2) Â Move SLOWLY through the store. Â Good opportunity to practice good manners<br> Â  Â  Â like, &#34;May I please?&#34;, &#34;excuse me&#34;, &#34;thank you&#34;.<br>3) Â Use inside voices.<br>4) Â Remind them that they&#39;ll each receive a memorable little something-treat if<br> Â  Â  Â they&#39;re on their best behavior.

"reviewcomment":"Do you like pig? I (like pretty much everyone else in this world [even the vegetarians...don&#39;t lie to me...]) love pig, in all of its forms (grilled, smoked, cured, ground into sausage...). How about pie? I&#39;m damn near Toby Zieglerish in my adoration of pie (and my misanthropy, but I digress). Pig &amp; Pie? Before walking into the restaurant I had to apologize to my arteries for a majestic onslaught of cholesterol they were about to experience.<br><br>Strangely enough, it was neither the pig nor the pie which sold me on the Pig &amp; Pie experience, but the Beef &amp; Beer (please, someone make that into a restaurant right now and open it down the street from my home [or in my living room, I promise that I wouldn&#39;t charge rent]). The &#34;Beef Tongue and Maple Bacon Sandwich&#34; was a clear winner, with meltingly tender tongue, crisp bacon, and a fantastic tart relish coming together with a touch of horseradish atop a biscuit-like, egg washed, flakey bun. Walking the line of tart, juicy, crunchy and spicy? Yep, that&#39;ll do it for me.<br><br>The burger was pretty superb as well. A Challah-like bun crowned with a gentle dusting of sesame seeds and another effective application of egg washing effectively stood up to some delectably rich, coarsely ground (and wicked juicy) beef, slightly sweet onion Jam, and crisp bacon (no extra charge). I&#39;m not going to say it was my burger of the month, but it was certainly a damn fine specimen.<br><br>However, their take on Poutine didn&#39;t quite come together. Although I adored the inclusion of pickled onion relish, a too-thick sausage gravy buried the cheese curds and wilted their otherwise wonderfully crispy french fries. Next time I&#39;ll just buy another beer or two.<br><br>Speaking of beer, these guys have a pretty good (and reasonably priced) selection. If you want a pitcher (and why wouldn&#39;t you?), it&#39;ll set you back 18$ across the board. You want a pitcher of Brother David&#39;s Tripel at 10% ABV (and a wicked hangover the next day)? 18$. How about some of Pacific Brew Lab&#39;s intriguing (and rare) hibiscus-infused Nautilus? 18$. A high gravity Imperial IPA (no brewery listed)? 18$. Miller High Life (which I sort of secretly enjoy on a hot day)? 18$. Its the sort of place that encourages you to go big (in terms ABV), and then stumble home. I can dig it.<br><br>Overall: 4.5 Stars. While the poutine was disappointing, everything else was pretty exceptional.<br><br>Extras:<br><br>Near the Mission Corridor Bus Lines, 48-Quintara/24th Street, 12-Folsom/Pacific, 9&amp;9L-San Bruno, and BART (24th Street Station).<br><br>Window seating (and awesome people-watching) available.<br><br>Check out that awesome Discolandia Sign!<br><br>Try some of their house-made Beer Mustard, I promise you won&#39;t be disappointed.",

"reviewcomment":"My co-workers and I have been eating at the Curry Up Now truck regularly for about two years. The truck started with a fairly limited menu but has expanded its options a lot over this time. That said, I&#39;m a huge fan of the old stalwarts - the CTM burrito and the deconstructed samosa. I order from the Curry-Up Now truck around three times a month and the food is consistently good.<br><br>Couple of things to note: the spiciness level of the burritos has changed over time so if you have not been there for a while, it may be less spicy than you remember it. One tip - the line gets pretty ridiculous starting at about 12:15 so if you can make it to the curb by 12:00 on the dot, you&#39;ll be in better shape.",

In short, they rock!<br><br>This all led up to the big day. Christina and Katie knocked it out of the park. They did an amazing job setting up our entire dessert table and candy bar for us. It looked spectacular. Our guests were wowed. I even caught the waiters snapping photos of the dessert table, that&#39;s how awesome it was. And the best part - I didn&#39;t have to worry or spend my time and attention on it at all (except to sneak over and snag sweets every now and then).<br><br>I can&#39;t rate Bicyclette highly enough.

It was also covered in teal fondant with circles in pink, yellow and white (the party theme colors). Not only did it look great, it was so moist and delicious. My husband said it was one of the best cakes he&#39;s ever eaten! And Pei is super professional, friendly and warm and so great to work with.

I was so surprised to see it still open at around 11:30pm. Their fruit lined their sidewalk in big bins - inviting in late night customers.<br><br>I roamed around inside and was pleasantly surprised to see a variety of granola and oats, organic chicken apple sausage, brown rice cakes, Casa Sanchez chips, salsa, and guacamole, and a plethora of healthy frozen meals intermingled between your standard convenience store items.<br><br>I didn&#39;t end up purchasing anything - since I was on my way to meet someone, but I am absolutely delighted that a late night, inviting grocery spot like this this exists in the hood. There&#39;s no need to lug your wallet over to Safeway - when Sunny County radiates such good energy on Stanyan.<br><br>Trust.",

"reviewcomment":"You can find this food stand locally, at the Ferry Plaza Farmers Market and the Alemany Farmers Market, as well as a few other bay area markets. Their dairy products are also used by a few bay area fine dining restaurants.<br><br>They sell different varieties of cheddar and monterey jack cheeses, plus a few specialty cheeses. The best part is that you get to sample every single cheese for free (use toothpicks to help yourself to samples from open containers). Butter and soft cheese samples are available by request, served on a small toast.<br><br>What caught my attention was their delicious butter ($5), I had not tasted butter this good in a long time. This is the closest you&#39;ll get to home churned butter, without the work. It&#39;s similar to Plugra brand european-style butter, but this is better because it&#39;s organic and hormone free. Available salted (for table use) and unsalted (for cooking). I also bought a white cheddar cheese ($12.99/lb. so each portion is about ~$6). Even if you don&#39;t plan to buy anything, definitely ask for a sample of the butter. Delicious!<br><br>Cash only.<br><br>**************************************<br><br>On a separate note: this cattle farm &amp; separate creamery are located in Petaluma, CA - and during the month of October (right now!!) the farm is open to the public (daily 9am - dusk) for the &#34;Great Peter Pumpkin Patch&#34;, with activities for kids, hay rides, hay tower, hay maze, cheese tasting, pumpkin ice cream, pick/buy pumpkins &amp; potatoes, and live music on weekends.

I love that all containers come in different sizes depending on your needs, and the prices are really reasonable for the quality. We&#39;ve come here for staples as well as blends, looking for specific salts as well as chatting them up to seek recommendations and we&#39;ve yet to be disappointed. <br><br>You can tell that there&#39;s a passion for food and flavours when you come in here, which is why I love it so much. I have a feeling that our rack will end up having exclusively SpiceAce jars..",

Â Spicely has tons of organic spices and teas, the tea selection is a bit overwhelming for me but the girl working there made it easier. Â I knew I wanted to buy some tea but I just wasn&#39;t sure what kind. Â I sampled a DELICIOUS vanilla chocolate pu-erh tea and was immediately hooked. Â This tea tastes like it should be bad for you but there&#39;s no sugar or calories, just yummy natural organic goodness!! Â I ended up purchasing the pu-erh and a dulce mactcha spice tea and I think I may have found the cure to my afternoon sweet craving (which will be wonderful for my waste line). Â <br><br>If you&#39;re in the FIDI area check this place out, they have several samples you an try the customer service is excellent!!

"reviewcomment":"I think I have been to one coffee location with Peets name that has had good WiFi. There should be ratings of WiFi services. Peets WiFi truly sucks. They pour coffee and understand not one cent beyond that. Cafes have been around forever. Coffeeshops historically have been dynamic places. They arrive in America and get perverted into whatever brings a dollar in. Then they grow with the culture and become vital and vibrant again. That becomes the expectation and standard. They don&#39;t sell coffee. They are bigger in a cultural sense. That is the cultural standard. Even Starbucks understand that. The once locked and pqay-for-a-little ATT WiFi eventually became free and abundant. Progress for American culture. Others never will reach there because they never get anywhere. They understand a money versus receipt as beginning, middle and end. There cannot possibly be anything beyond the coffee machine and cash register to this business. WiFi is not the issue here. The inability to think is. Somebody thought them how to count to 5 and that is all they do. There is no possibility counting can go on beyond 5 and why? Because they lack any understanding of the business. They duplicated what somebody else would have and got stuck there. Ironic is the history of these firms how one begins and another develops while some never grow. This is a great location for Peets and though small they always do interior design very well at all Peets and sell coffee. The world is so small. 25 Oct 2013",

"reviewcomment":"In the past two weeks I must have stopped by Panaderia Andrea about 4 or 5 times. Â And my experience only gets better with each visit. <br><br>For anyone that doesn&#39;t know, Panaderia Andrea specializes in El Salvadorian and Guatemalan breads/pan dulce. Â The shop offers various other offerings such as atole and tamales but I have yet to try these. Â There is limited seating inside so be prepared to take your items to go just in case. Â And be forewarned, parking can be difficult so it might be best to look for parking on London instead of Mission.<br><br> I have been more than satisfied with everything I have tried so far. Â The pastelitos are great and a bargain at only $0.50 each (I recommend pineapple and strawberry). Â The santanecas are delicious and inexpensive at $0.50 each. Â I have tried a variety of the cookies ($0.50) and I assure you that you won&#39;t be disappointed with any of them. Â I&#39;ve become a huge fan of a Guatemalan pan dulce they sell which I believe is called a cortada. Â Someone can correct me if I am wrong. Â This pan dulce is usually on the bottom rack all the way on the right. Â It appears to be one long segmented piece of pan dulce and each segment is $0.50. Â The mini quesadillas are $1.50 and they are fantastic! Â I love the flavor and texture. Â I look forward to trying their semita alta on a future visit.<br><br>Oh - and to top it all off the service is friendly and warm. Â I&#39;ve interacted with 3 different employees so far and each has been wonderful. Â I highly recommend stopping by if you&#39;ve got a thing for pan dulce or if you&#39;re just curious.",

"reviewcomment":"I visited a client in the area so before my appointment, I decided to grab some breakfast so that my stomach wouldn&#39;t growl during my visit. Â I ordered a bacon burrito and a can of guava juice. Â The burrito was yum! - the flavors were melded together so tastily, and they give you salsa in a small container. Â Awesome!! Â I poured a little bit of salsa per bite, and it was a great combination - yum!! Â I also like the guava juice. Â Service was friendly and smiley - that always makes mornings so nice. Â Thank you - it was the best breakfast burrito I&#39;ve had! Â :)",

Â The owner takes pride in his recipes and it show. Â He is often understaffed and overworked, but always polite. Â The kitchen is usually not up and running till after 2 pm, but open till 3.

"reviewcomment":"This shop is hugely underrated.<br><br>To be fair, it doesn&#39;t look like much. I have this attitude about local wine shops: I assume they&#39;re either super-fancy (and out of my price range) or they&#39;re mediocre (and I&#39;m probably better off at BevMo/TJs/Safeway anyhow). I would occasionally buy stuff here (what, I don&#39;t remember) but I basically regarded these purchases as a sort of &#34;shop local&#34; charity, did all my stocking-up at the big box stores, and otherwise ignored the place for the entire eight years I&#39;ve been living in this neighborhood.<br><br>Then one day I needed a bottle of wine on short notice and I didn&#39;t know what to get, so I asked the lady behind the counter to find me something nice for ten dollars with a screw top. She did. And it was FANTASTIC. It was easily better than any of the &#39;great wine scores&#39; I&#39;d found for the same price at the places I usually shopped. Everyone I shared it with loved it. (For the record, this was a Mercer Canyon Cabernet, and I&#39;m only sharing that info because I kept buying until they sold out.) <br><br>Apparently, there are a lot of great wines at good prices that you&#39;re only going to find at your local wine shop. The reason for this is that every wine you see on a shelf in a store got there by being evaluated and chosen out of a bunch of other possible wines by the store&#39;s buyer. This selection and procurement represents a certain amount of work. Big box stores only have a few people doing this work. Therefore, they have to choose wines that are produced in large enough quantities to stock all of the stores in that chain that the buyer is responsible for. This is a massive amount of wine, and there are many, many smaller wineries that produce good wine, but not enough of it to make it worth it to be chosen by a big box store. <br><br>A wineshop, however, can afford to offer these smaller wineries, and (in a mom and pop shop) you&#39;re quite likely to get referred a wine that was chosen buy the actual person selling you the wine. It&#39;s also way, WAY more convenient not to have to stock up on wine (because there&#39;s a store two blocks away where you can get it any time) which involves using a car (and parking, and traffic, and more parking) and finding storage space for it when you get home (rent is about $5/mo per square foot now dontcha know). I have a totally different attitude about local shops now :)",

Â Saw the Starbucks across from the Pyramid building and hoped that it was open considering it was a holiday and FiDi was pretty quiet.<br><br>Yep, it was open. Â Yes, gonna get my caffeine. Â What surprised me was that they quite crowded in that most of the tables were taken. Â After ordering my cup of Starbucks, I took was able to park myself at a vacant bar table to chill with my cup of Joe.<br><br>This Starbucks was large, modern, and spacious. Â The counter/barista area is in the center of the store. Â There were about a ten bar stools surround two sides creating a bar-style setting. Â There were about a dozen tables on the side of the store, a mixture of regular and bar style tables. Â The crowd were a mixture of families, tourists, gentlemen playing chess and some of with laptops utilizing the free Wi-Fi. <br><br>Overall, a nice large and spacious Starbucks for your caffeine fix. <br><br>(<a href='http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/starbucks-san-francisco-130?select=B81rp89hqK2OcBbi-dMX3w#B81rp89hqK2OcBbi-dMX3w'>yelp.com/biz_photos/starâ¦</a>)<br>(<a href='http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/starbucks-san-francisco-130?select=B81rp89hqK2OcBbi-dMX3w#cyqGkYjN-6NfGq0yALqcpw'>yelp.com/biz_photos/starâ¦</a>)",

My favorite in their lot series is the 100, a wonderful cab from Stags leap.
