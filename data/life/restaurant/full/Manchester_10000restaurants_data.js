"reviewcomment":"Food: The sushi is fresh and I love the vegetable tempura. The fried rice could be better. seaweed salad is excellent also. I also enjoy the scallion pancakes. I would give it 4 stars but the fried rice needs work and to me thats a staple of an Asian restaurant. The fried rice must be done well.<br><br>Service: The staff is very nice and attentive and the restaurant is nice and clean with great ambiance.",

"reviewcomment":"Amazing. Hands down one of the best restaurants I&#39;ve been to in a while.<br><br>The atmosphere is really laid back and the staff is super friendly.<br><br>The drink menu houses some really unique cocktails. I had the &#34;Zinger&#34;...and it was fantastic. Very refreshing. I tried the Falafel Fried Fish. That alone, deserves it&#39;s own 5 star review. The fish was super fresh, and fried perfectly, with a thin layer of crumbed falafel encasing the perfectly cooked white fish. Surprisingly, this perfection wasn&#39;t even the star of the dish...<br><br>...THE FRIES!!! Unbelievable. Thin, crispy, but not over cooked fries with a whole bunch of spices that meld together to create the best fry I have ever had. There were even capers in with the fries, like hidden treasure. They must&#39;ve been fried with the French fries because they were crispy and seasoned as well. <br><br>They have a great selection of beers too. Local brews on tap and some of the domestics everybody knows and loves. They had Smuttynose IPA so I was happy.<br><br>The menus are awesome! All are loose papers rubber banded to clipboards. Simplistic and artsy, but only in the best way. <br><br>They bring water to you when you&#39;re seated, and it&#39;s in a repurposed Patron bottle. That alone, gave me the notion that this was going to be a fantastic dining experience. <br><br>If you&#39;re in the downtown Manchester area...stop in. Whatever it takes. This place is just straight up awesome.",

It&#39;s a little small inside but cozy and serves Nepalese cuisine. I had an excellent wild boar dish and my Â buddy had a lamb dish. All well done. Momo&#39;s food is fresh and inexpensive. I thought it was very well done and I would go back...The dining area is little small but there is a larger dining room off to the right also.<br><br>If you are looking for exotic food in Manchester, check it out. You won&#39;t be disappointed.",

"reviewcomment":"I was skeptical to the Chicken Tender hype, &#34;How good can they really be? It is just Chicken Tenders!&#34; But after having tastes of the Prime Rib, Greek Salad Wrap, Baked Stuffed Haddock, and Filet Mignon, I was shocked to discover the unique and light yumminess of the Chicken Tenders was my favorite thing of all! <br><br>I am not a chicken tender person. This is generally a kid&#39;s food as far as I am concerned. However, the batter and seasonings on the chix tenders at the Backroom are So Different than typical chicken tenders, that kids who are used to them - like my eight-year-old - may not be wild about them. Which was the exact reason the adults at the table loved them! They are just not the taste you expect a chix tender to be, though it looks like any other chicken tender. The Puritan has done the impossible - it elevated (and they claim, invented) the chicken tender. This was just Â regular chicken tenders - now I would love to try the buffalo, coconut and spicy tenders sometime as well. <br><br>There is also an accompanying, light oil-based dipping sauce that reminded me most of a Chinese duck sauce of sorts, but more refreshing. Absolutely delicious. Get a plate to share, just to try them. They are crave-worthy. And get a Greek salad for its fresh, cold, wonderful ingredients and olive oil dressing to balance the chix tenders batter. <br><br>As to the restaurant itself, it is totally old-school from decor to clientele, with a distinctly Greek influence on the food but not the decor. Old Yankee style dark brown booths and Grandma&#39;s kitchen chairs charm. Perfectly fun and fine. Comfy in jeans or Grandpa&#39;s patched elbow jacket. <br><br>You may also order take-out food from the ice cream window / shop in the front of the building. There is also a bar area near the Backroom entrance that serves a full menu. The Appletini was strong, thereis no skimping on the booze levels. <br><br>Make a reservation if you go on weekends. It is jam packed with hungry retirees itchin&#39; for the kitchen. Service can be a little slow but not unbearable. Can easily see this place as a favorite of anyone who grew up in the area, and it has been around for many years so they are doing things right. <br><br>In addition to being famous for its Chicken Tenders, the Puritan is also known for its Mudslides. They have a variety of &#39;slides, but at $10 a pop, I waited and opted instead for a Mudslice Ice Cream cone after the meal! It was delicious, as was the Black Razz, Coffee Oreo, and Charlie&#39;s Chocolate Factory. Unique flavors also sell by pints and half-gallons at the ice cream shop. <br><br>A solid choice in the Manchester area with a large variety and unique choices on this classic menu.",

"reviewcomment":"People seem to love or hate Cotton. It&#39;s very low key and closes early due to the building being owned by UNH - 10pm closing as to not encourage their students to go drink there (however commercial st campus doesn&#39;t have housing.....so it seems like an odd stance)<br><br>They have a kick ass martini and by kick ass I mean it literally knocks you on your ass, and they have a two martini limit. Which actually means they won&#39;t serve you ANY DRINK after two martinis. I hate places with this rule and I also hate when the bartender doesn&#39;t tell you that when you order your 2nd martini....instead they say &#34;Sorry, it&#39;s on the menu&#34; when you go to order a third. Most people who drink martinis on a regular basis don&#39;t read the fine print on a drink menu...<br><br>Their food is pretty good, awesome crab cake, good calamari, good lobster ravioli....it&#39;s not a 5 star place, but a great upscale casual spot if you want something different.",

I love my pizza and I am proud of it. <br><br>We called about 25 minutes away, and they came just when we pulled up to the hotel. Perfect timing. When I ordered, they asked me &#34;What type of crust I would want&#34;. I was a bit confused.. what do you mean? I have to choose pizza AND crust types now? I asked for options and they listed several. I asked what people normally got and he said &#34;regular&#34;. We went with that. Jimmy and Gavin talked the rest of the carride about &#34;what type of question is that&#34;. I agree, it was odd. But then again, we are in Manchvegas. <br><br>The pizza was a bit pricey ($17 for a large cheese)... but I have always wanted to try PPC. I will honestly say I didn&#39;t love the cheese/sauce, but the crust and bread was unbelievable. It was so fresh, airy, moist and voluminous. There were a lot of bubbles in my pizza. I loved it. It was the best decision I made of the night . Except we did get some stares from the other people attending the wedding, as to why we were eating a pizza just minutes before going to the reception. With the amount of alcohol I consumed that night, we were all thankful that I had that pizza to hold me over. Otherwise, it would have been like Spring Cocktail of 2010 all over again.",

"reviewcomment":"I will say the first time I went to The Farm I swore I&#39;d never go back. Terrible drinks, terrible service and way too crowded (Post NHSSC games). <br><br>Then we ended up meeting some friends there a few times and I developed a love affair with the place. They by far as THE MOST consistent restaurant of their category within 25 miles. My husband orders the Half Chicken or Steak Tips when we go, portions are great and it&#39;s always cooked perfectly. If it&#39;s not....they take care of it without a second thought (this only happened once). Not a fan of their burgers, but I hear most people like them. <br><br>To the reviewer who said their food is pre-packaged, they use frozen chicken tenders, etc....this is absolutely not true. I think their tenders are some of the best around and they are hand pounded and breaded on site. <br><br>I will however agree that the service is AWFUL 99% of the time.....if you sit at the bar you&#39;re pretty safe, because you&#39;re hard to ignore.....if you sit at a table you&#39;re probably screwed. If you ever get seated and have a Julie as your server, prepare yourself for the worst service ever....I&#39;ve had her twice and I&#39;ve actually left a table when I realized she&#39;d be our server. I&#39;d say most of their waitstaff, unless you&#39;re getting the manager are slow, distracted, too busy chatting with each other, etc...<br><br>I think their poor service can put people in a mindset to not enjoy their food, but honestly if you can look past that and know what you&#39;re getting into then you&#39;ll likely have a good experience. <br><br>What to Order<br>-Steak Tips<br>-Half Chicken<br>-Lobstah Pizza (hoping its back on the seasonal menu!!!)<br>-Fajitas<br>-Fried Zucchini<br>-Mozarella Bites<br>-Chicken Tenders<br><br>What to Avoid:<br>-Burgers, too small for the bun<br>-Nachos (too heavy and soggy for me)<br>-Chicken Pot Pie (they struggle with cooking it right)<br><br>Oh and they have Karaoke on Thursday nights...and do a lot to get people involved....house shots if the DJ liked your song, offer GC&#39;s if no one is signing up (I got a $30 card for being the first one to sing!)",

"reviewcomment":"I came here to update my review on the Chophouse and was SHOCKED to see recent negative reviews....as recent as apparently the same weekend I received beyond excellent service and food quality. Â Where to begin?<br><br>First off, Yolanda, the hostess, is as pleasant at they come. Â She goes out of her way to accommodate seating and server requests. Â For the reviewer who complained about calling at 4pm on a Saturday...when you call the nicest restaurant in the entire state on a Saturday for same day reservations, it just isn&#39;t going to happen. Â I usually book at least a week in advance to ensure my requested date and time. Â This isn&#39;t that bad considering I&#39;ve dined at restaurants all around this country where I needed to call 6 months in advance to make a reservation (after being on hold for 20 minutes). Â <br><br>And I&#39;m pretty sure that I dined here at the same exact time as another recent reviewer (got to love profile pictures) at an adjacent table on the floor. Â His particular review reflected the belligerence and bourgeois attitude of the patron. Â Complaining about not having sorbet (I&#39;ve dined here countless times and never remember seeing this on the dessert menu) is beyond ridiculous. Â I&#39;m also confused how this patron racked up a $350 bill with steaks and drinks comped!!?? Â Maybe this reviewer was charged for his profanity laced tirade as they exited this restaurant. Â Keeping it classy, NH! Â <br><br>I also got a nice chuckle at someone mentioning that they had prime rib in other major cities. Â Good for you! Â I&#39;ve eaten at several three star Michelin restaurants myself, and yeah, I&#39;m not being served caviar or gold foil over my steak, but the food quality and service of the Chophouse has always impressed my wife, family, and guests. Â You should enjoy your time at the Chophouse. Â Treat it like an &#34;event,&#34; not a quick meal. Â Enjoy the company you are with at your table. Â Enjoy the wine. Â The cocktails. Â Don&#39;t come in expecting a rushed service. Â Maybe this is the &#34;American&#34; in us, but if you want fast food, try a McDonald&#39;s I guess. Â <br><br>Now onto my personal experience...I made my reservations on OpenTable a week beforehand. Â Yolanda welcomed us as we entered the restaurant with a big smile and took our coats. Â Rarely has our table not been ready early, but if we are running too far ahead of schedule, the bar is a nice spot to grab a drink while waiting. Â The bartenders come over to you even if you are not sitting AT the bar. Â <br><br>For years, the Chophouse has had a pianist playing on Saturday night (see my review from 2011). Â It&#39;s a wonderful touch to the ambiance of the restaurant. Â Yes, it reminds me of what a nice steak house in NYC should look and sound like. Â And quite honestly, I have never eaten at a steakhouse in Boston, NYC, Chicago, Vegas, etc, that is consistently as excellent at the Chophouse. Â That&#39;s the reason we keep coming back. <br><br>We started with oysters and bacon wrapped scallops. Â Both dishes blew my taste buds away. Â We accompanied this with a perfectly mixed drink from the bar. Â The selection at the bar is very wide ranged, so you can rest assured that they probably have your &#34;poison&#34; of choice. :) Â  <br><br>For the salad course, we split the steakhouse staple &#34;Wedge&#34; salad. Â The kitchen split the salad for us on separate plates, which is always a plus!<br><br>I did order a bottle of wine which was decanted for us. Â The Chophouse has a wide range of prices on wine, whether you want to binge drink a lesser priced chardonnay or sip a nice cab with your steak. Â <br><br>My wife and I both had the grass-fed Delmonico steaks, cooked medium to perfection. Â I tried the truffle butter on top of mine, but decided it didn&#39;t really need but only a light smear to add to the taste. Â For sides, we ordered brussels sprouts (yuck, right? Â Well not the way chef Stuart prepares his...so delicious) and creamed spinach which was extremely tasty. Â <br><br>For dessert, we had the carrot and molten cakes with espresso/coffee. Â Both were timely delivered and enjoyed despite being pretty stuffed at this point. Â The Chophouse also makes a point to have a manager or even the owner stop by the table to ensure your experience is delightful. Â <br><br>The bathroom downstairs is always kept very clean and is discreetly out of the way, which is a huge plus. Â <br><br>We have had many servers over the years since we have been going to the Chophouse. Â I have always found the servers to be personable, professional, and knowledgeable. Â If you request your own server upon making your reservation, as I stated earlier, Yolanda will grant this request. Â We typically ask for Jimmy and are never disappointed. Â His professionalism, understanding of wines, and attentiveness really constitute that &#34;cherry on the top&#34; of this dining experience. Â <br><br>In my personal opinion, the Chophouse is far superior in comparison to the establishment, big name steakhouses you&#39;ll find in major cities. Â Relax. Â Enjoy the atmosphere, the wine, the company with you, and the evening!",

I would give it 4 stars but the fried rice needs work and to me thats a staple of an Asian restaurant. The fried rice must be done well.<br><br>Service: The staff is very nice and attentive and the restaurant is nice and clean with great ambiance.",

"reviewcomment":"Went to the Copper Door recently to meet up with my cousins.<br><br>It was a weeknight, so seating wasn&#39;t a problem. We sat at a table in the main dining area, and the ambiance was terrific. We wanted a spot to have a relaxing dinner, no rush, and catch up. This was the perfect spot.<br><br>I started with a Martini which was OK, but I thought the price was a little high considering the alcohol was bottom shelf, but I drank it nonetheless.<br><br>I had the Seared Scallops with multi grained pilaf and fennel salad. It was delicious, and exactly what I was looking for. Scallops were fresh, tasty and super sweet.<br><br>The girls enjoyed their dinner as well.<br><br>Everything is cooked to order, so have patience and enjoy you&#39;re company.<br><br>This place is a great spot to get together for a great meal. The only comments I may have are; if you are looking for a meal with good quantities, you may be disappointed.<br><br>If you not looking to spend $ 50.00 per person including tip, you may be disappointed. But for that special occasion, where you want to relax and enjoy the food and your company, its a great experience.<br><br>But the quality of what you do get for the price (al least what I got) is worth the price. That&#39;s more than I can say for more upscale places in my area like the Tuscan Kitchen that have great ambiance but really crappy quality food!!<br><br>They also have a great outside deck for dining in the warmer months. Oh, and last but not least....that Monkey Bread is fabulous!!!!!",

I *may* be in love with several of the bartenders - they all rock so hard - they should go on tour.<br><br>This is a great place to go to try different beers. Maybe find something new to enjoy. They don&#39;t mind giving you a few samples of new brews to try. If you are like me, and have a fear of commitment then this is for you. Get a taste of something before you throw down for a full pint.<br><br>The food is ok - one of my perennial gripes is they put beans in the chili. Only one bartender picked them out for me! When I eat there I almost always order from the specials. They seem to excel at the specials.<br><br>You may want to check and see if it is karaoke night or if there is a band playing. It can get pretty loud on those nights. So, be aware if you are looking for a quiet pint.<br><br>Good luck!",

"reviewcomment":"Having been to the Epping location, we decided to check out 900 Degrees while in the Manchester area. The building is old and very cool, and the seating arrangement is miles better than the Epping location. Not one person bumped into me the entire meal which I feel is a win! The menu is good. Lots of pizza choices plus a great selection of appetizers and soups. My partner was a bit obsessed with the cheese plate so we went with that again. An amazing assortment of cheeses and fruits for under $7! I have no idea how they can give you so much cheese for that price. Lots of variety and just stacked high with cheese. I went with the soup of the day which was creamy asparagus. Delicious. I wanted two more bowls of it! I also went with the hummus plate. Somewhat disappointing as I&#39;ve had a lot of awesome hummus lately and this wasn&#39;t nearly as good. The hummus was okay but the choice of veggies was odd. Cucumbers (good) and then various slices of peppers. Why not celery or carrots? Peppers are just a weird choice, and I don&#39;t like peppers so it meant my partner had to gobble them down in between bites of cheese. We had one small hiccup when they brought us a delicious looking pizza and there was confusion all around when we steadfastly maintained that we didn&#39;t order pizza (although very tempted)! Turns out they thought I said cheese pizza when I said cheese platter. Ah well, it happens. We were more than full after the soup and appetizers. Price is outstanding. Two huge appetizers and a soup for under $30. We&#39;ll be back for sure!",

The man that took my order told me that I could pay the next day, and not to worry about it. He took my order and did not make me feel bad or act like it was a big deal. I was so thankful!

Â This is my favorite place now. Â We ate there on a Sunday evening around 5pm, the weather was terrible outside which might have been why it was relatively dead inside. Â The pre-dinner foods section was pretty good. Â We liked the grape leaves a lot. Â I also tried some of the seafood salad. Â <br><br>When the meats started coming out, we were ready. Â My favorites by far? Â The salmon, top sirloin, and beef ribs, in that order. Â The salmon was so soft that it just melted in your mouth. Â It was served with a very tasty sauce that taste sort of like Hollandaise. The top sirloin was a surprising second. Â The person that brought it out told us they only prepare it with a salt rub and I find that hard to believe because it was so tasty. Â It must have just been a perfectly cooked steak, very dark red in the middle which is how I love my steak. Â The beef ribs were very good too. Â I only helped myself to one serving though but I probably should have had more.<br><br>We also tried the lamb, prime rib but I didn&#39;t have any of the pork loin. Â Everything was really fantastic and if I&#39;m ever up in the Manchester area again, I would consider going back. Â You just have to be in that kind of mood with the right appetite to handle that much beef though!",

I ordered the fresh spring rolls w shrimp, a great appetizer if you&#39;re looking for something light and refreshing. I got the vermicelli bowl with vegetarian fried spring rolls and tofu. The medley of vegetables, tofu, and sweet but not overpowering fish sauce, was flavorful. <br><br>I plan on coming back to try their meat entrees. I don&#39;t expect to be disappointed. This place deserves to be at least a 4 star, considering where it&#39;s located and how authentic the food is. Leaving with a happy tummy (twice).",

The waitress did a great job of communicating my allergies to the cook, and the curry didn&#39;t bother me at all. It was very tasty, and I will certainly return. The menu is more Japanese than Thai, and I was very impressed with their selection of fresh fish for sushi, sashimi, nigiri, and more. The atmosphere was a little tight, as it is not a large restaurant, but it&#39;s decorated well and is comfortable. I gave it 4 stars because it didn&#39;t blow me away with its amazingness, but it was very tasty and my special needs were honored well. Totally happy!",

I&#39;ve been here many times at the bar for just drinks or outside in the summer for drinks/dessert. <br><br>Our water glasses were filled promptly and our server came over and shared the specials. He stumbled through them and we had to help him finish what beef wellington was. We overheard another server sharing the specials to a nearby table and they were explained so much better. Too bad. Anyway - we ordered drinks and then the calamari and spinach salad. Drinks came over in a timely fashion. We noticed other servers were giving tables rolls/butter/oil. Not us. We had to ask for it after the apps came and there was no room on the small table for two. It would have been nice to enjoy w/drinks.<br><br>After finishing apps, our forgetful server brought over bread to enjoy before entrees. Entrees came right out. The chili salmon was great. The best I&#39;ve had in Manchester with nice flavor and the broccoli was cooked perfect. My boyfriend&#39;s cranberry orange duck special was good he said. It came with couscous and broccoli. As I was halfway through the salmon, I ordered a glass of wine. It never came. I was nearly done when he realized he forgot and brought it over on the house. (Thank you for realizing that you needed to do that at least!)<br><br>The food was worth the price we paid for Manchester I felt. I would certainly go again, this time I hope that server is no longer there or he brings his memory to work. Too bad, service nearly ruined the meal!",

Â The prices are a tiny bit steep, which is why the 4 instead of 5 star rating.<br><br>The service is excellent, and they have developed a perfect system for people who just want to be left alone: Â Place a flower in a vase when you want service, take it out when you do not. Â I had a lovely date here several months ago because we were actually left alone to talk when we wanted to talk, and were able to order when we wanted to order.<br><br>Also, she wore polkadots and had bangs.

Restaurant was fairly crowded as well.<br><br>I had the Asian BBQ Steak Tips and the wife had the Bison Burger, we both started with side salads. The side salads were good, the Bison burger was cooked well but the sauce was a little hotter then she expected. Â Which she was fine with but was surprised it didn&#39;t mention it in the menu. The steak tips were cooked perfectly and were very tender but I was not wow-ed by the sauce. It wasn&#39;t bad, but it wasn&#39;t amazing either. Â I had asparagus and mashed potatoes as sides, both very good, wife had sweet potato fries, also good.<br><br>The beer (dogfish head) on draft was excellent and the bar service was good as well. <br><br>I like the menu options the atmosphere and the prices here at Ignite.",

Â I sat at the bar, so I can&#39;t really speak to the waiter/waitress service, but at least one seemed very very new. Â <br><br>The food was better than expected. Â I had the appetizer sampler platter earlier in the night. Â I really liked the mac-and-cheese bites and the onion rings. Â The wings were pretty solid to. Â The fries and chicken tenders were not very good, decent at best. Â Later on, I had the chicken ceaser wrap and really enjoyed it. Â The dressing was slightly peppery, but that&#39;s my style. Â I thought in NH drinks would be cheaper, but single-malt was still $12 a glass. Â The service was fine, nothing exceptional, but I guess a bartender&#39;s main job is to make drinks anyway.

"reviewcomment":"Just simply one of the best restaurants in a 30 miles radius. <br><br>I have HIGH standards for sushi. I&#39;ve had a lot of mediocre sushi from restaurants that are priced comparatively or even more expensive, and I&#39;ve always been disappointed because it&#39;s not as good as Chen&#39;s.<br><br>This is the kind that gives you a straight up tastegasm. Every single bite just makes me roll my eyes back in disbelief. You can taste each individual flavor coming together on your taste buds in the perfect combination of savory, sweet, and spicy depending on what roll you ordered. This is like NH&#39;s Mona Lisa of sushi. You can spend up to 15 dollars on their speciality rolls or about 4 on an avocado/cucumber roll and they will both be prepared to perfection. Ingredients are unfathomably fresh and the presentation is top notch. It&#39;s so beautiful it&#39;s ALMOST hard to eat. And that&#39;s just he sushi!<br><br>Chen&#39;s menu is DEEP! In addition to sushi they have an epic menu filled with delicious Chinese, Japanese, and Thai dishes. Some familiar and some unique. The ginger sauce that is served with the scallion pancake will make you question why you&#39;ve gone so long without tasting something so amazing.<br><br>This is my favorite restaurant in the area. Parking is limited but you can generally always get a table with little to no wait. Service is awesome to boot! Truly a 5 star establishment.",

"reviewcomment":"I recently relocated here for business from San Diego and immediately started to miss Mexican food. It has been a difficult battle trying to find it out here.<br><br>Naturally I started out trying the most obvious choices from online reviews like <br>La Carreta and Margaritas. I was so disappointed that I didn&#39;t finish more than a few spoonfuls of food at each place. I mean, how hard is is to make fresh salsa without making it inedible? Both places were worse than a TV dinner, yuck.<br><br>I know from experience that the most popular places online aren&#39;t always the best or &#34;authentic&#34; so I began researching other places. It led me to El Jimador which was pretty darn close to the real deal! They use imported Cotija cheese which is unavailable in markets around New Hampshire and their salsa is fresh, with bits of cilantro (as it should be). They even admitted to using a little lard in their refried beans after a little coaxing. If you&#39;re going to eat refried beans they should be authentic and they didn&#39;t miss the mark. Even their rice has a flavorful quality about it that makes it cravable!<br><br>The bartender made me a special cucumber margarita that isn&#39;t on the menu, it was soooo good that I ended up having three of them!<br><br>I&#39;m sure that most locals in New Hampshire haven&#39;t had authentic Mexican food unless they are well traveled so that could explain why the terrible places are so popular. All I can say is this is the best Mexican food I have found in NH to date and I will definitely be going back!<br><br>My only complaint was the pre-fab taco shell that tasted like it came out of a box. Since they are from LA they agreed but explained how hard it is to find good tortillas out here. That&#39;s understandable, and making them from scratch with masa would be too labor intensive. Hopefully they start ordering them online from tortilla factories out west (frozen) and fry up their own taco shells. Â There is a good factory in Albuquerque that ships nationwide. But otherwise this place hits the spot!",

We love this place and the people who make us feel welcome and well fed! <br><br>We started coming to Chen Yang Li after we moved to the area. We used to take my mother here every Saturday for lunch, and we ate our way across the menu over time. We have our favorites: Ginger Shrimp and Scallops with String Beans is a particular favorite; we like the Pineapple Fried Rice, the Hot and Sour Soup, the Ginger Salad (LOVE the dressing), the Seafood Rice Noodle Soup (a little bland, but nice and clean flavors), the standard General Tso&#39;s Chicken, and the Sushi (pretty tasty and generous portions). The Lo Mein is good and tasty as well. I&#39;m not particularly fond of the &#39;East Coast&#39; (brown) fried rice here and at most restaurants on this side of the country, which is why we opt for the Pineapple version when we&#39;re in the mood.<br><br>This is not &#39;real&#39; Chinese food. I&#39;m half Chinese and grew up eating the real deal. South Garden in Merrimack has the closest thing to &#39;real&#39; Chinese in the area. However, I find the dining experience pleasant and the food consistently good at Chen Yang Li. Lunch specials are particularly a good deal, and the friendly, warm and caring service we get from Kim and Frank make this a place we will continue to visit.",

We both got the house special, I had it with kielbasa and blueberry pancakes (extra) and she had it with bacon and regular pancakes. The food was good and the service was up to par as well. I really enjoyed the pancakes and the home fries. The atmosphere was cozy and we have no complaints. <br><br>The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because I believe a place should blow me away or do something really different and special to get 5 stars. I really wish yelp would go to a 10 star or a 0-100% ranking because I would love to give this place 4.5 stars or a rating of 90%. Will be returning!",

"reviewcomment":"Murphy&#39;s Diner has become a new favorite of my group of friends. My boyfriend got a coupon for here so we went and were incredibly impressed, and spread the word which quickly was verified by everyone who tried it. We are here almost weekly now, every Saturday morning. I have had a few items, deep fried French Toast (good but not all that different from regular French Toast), Captain Crunch French Toast (my favorite, and pretty much everyone who has tried it&#39;s favorite) and the Banana&#39;s Foster Waffle (they put like 4 cooked tiny banana slices on a waffle, the waffle was so tasty but the small amount of bananas and lack of any special &#34;sauce&#34; was a bit stupid for a &#34;Special&#34; waffle). The breakfast sausage is a real sausage, not the tiny ones you expect. I personally enjoy the typical breakfast sausage and cannot stomach real sausage for breakfast but if you like that you will LOVE their sausage like my boyfriend does. Their homefries are pretty good, not seasoned so they are a bit bland but I enjoyed them. They use high quality eggs which I enjoyed, the fried eggs I got were very tasty. Overall I recommend Murphy&#39;s Diner, if you go do yourself a favor too and get the Maple Bacon Milkshake, it is AMAZEBALLS<br><br>P.S. The parking SUCKS. If it is busy you will not find a spot in the lot, just a heads up. If you go with a group, car pool.",

"reviewcomment":"We took my mother out to dinner here for her birthday. This is where she wanted to go. It started off really rough. We had 11 of us in our party. When we arrived we were told that they had just seated a party of 12 so they had no room for us. They asked why we didn&#39;t call ahead, which was very strange because when we did call ahead we were told they don&#39;t take reservations. The host told us it would be at least an hour wait. We decided to wait. After about 10 minutes of waiting a table that could seat us all just happened to open up. <br> Â  After sitting down our waitress Kristine came over with bread she took our drink order. Came out with all our drinks knew which one of us got what drink. At that point we ordered some apps. All total we ordered 7 apps lobster shrimp dip, western cheese fries, fire cracker chicken wraps, grilled white cheddar stuffed mushrooms, house made chips and dip, wild west shrimp and one other I can&#39;t remember. The apps were all very good I was a little disappointed with the western cheese fries the menu said chili was suppose to be on them. I felt the chilli was lacking. Other then that everything was very good. <br> Â  Â Our food was very good everyone got steak and all our steaks were perfectly cooked they all came out together. Again our waitress Kristine knew exactly where everything went. Kristine stayed on top of all our refills we didn&#39;t need to ask they always just showed up at the perfect time. <br> Â Overall our experience was very good it started rough but ended very well no one in our party was disappointed with Â anything and we were all very very impressed with Kristine our waitress.<br> Â I would recommend the longhorn in Manchester to anyone that wants a good meal at a good price if you want great service request Kristine as your server.",

Where&#39;s the love?<br><br>[the bad reviews are actually out of date now]<br><br>A Bit of Perspective<br><br>Ok I&#39;ve been to probably a dozen Chipotle&#39;s in across CA, NV and now NH?? Wow, that is amazing in itself. And this one is now [in 2014] EXACTLY like the rest. In all, I&#39;ve had probably 30-40 visits total between all of the ones I&#39;ve been to. This one in Manchie kicks a$$. I&#39;ve been to it twice since I&#39;ve been visiting in town [both in 2014]. And both times, it was exactly what was expected, amazing.<br><br>Having said all that, I read thru some of the bad reviews below and suggest that when any chain restaurant like this is just opened [and on the opposite side of the country from where home is] they&#39;re far away from &#34;corporate&#34; and more errors are made and not corrected very quickly. My personal opinion is that they got a really bad rap for a pretty rough start. What I experienced was nothing like what was written below...<br><br>Seeing as most of those reviews are 1-2 years old now, new managers, new staff, they clearly have it all sorted out now and are running smoothly. Yes the ppl are really nice, and yes the managers are too. <br><br>But the food is great! And you can never beat the price. $<br>: ]...<br><br>[drool]",

"reviewcomment":"Two my colleagues and I ventured to Tinker&#39;s on our last night on business in Manchester. We noted to the cashier at the order counter that we were first-timers and she gave us menus, encouraged us to grab a booth and order when ready. One of my colleagues and I shared the twin lobsters (one each--- though we only got one bib) and split an order of haddock. Both were delicious. I had a baked potato which was cooked perfectly. The coleslaw was not to my liking (but I generally am not a fan of any coleslaw made with mayo so this was not Tinker&#39;s fault). The decor is very casual but the service is not -- our food was delivered very quickly by a very friendly server. The prices are very reasonable and we all agreed that we had a tasty dinner here. <br><br>My only suggestion to Tinker&#39;s is to use a wider cup for the butter as it was hard to dip in the lobster without it overflowing the cup. <br><br>Even better, I got a senior&#39;s discount on the lobster!",

I&#39;m used to Chinese places just shoving the food at you and getting their money, but the people here are definitely friendly and welcoming.<br><br>I ordered the cashew chicken, beef teriyaki, and side of rice.

"reviewcomment":"Probably the best dining experience I&#39;ve ever had. <br><br>I went with my two and a half year old daughter. We went after her doc appt which wasn&#39;t fun so I wanted to cheer her up. Not to mention, we both looked like train wrecks cause she was sick and it was a last min appt. <br>We were greeted warmly as soon as we walked in. <br>Our waiter Calvin came over immediately. He was very fast at getting food out so my daughter was occupied. He checked on us regularly. The GM came over and asked us how things went and gave us a coupon. I watched her greet all of the tables at one point or another. She even refilled my drink which wasn&#39;t even empty yet. I was impressed . <br>During the meal I had asked my daughter if she wanted a booster seat, and a random waiter overheard me and brought it over. Very thoughtful. <br><br>I had a simple soup salad and breadsticks. But they were awesome as always. The dessert was mouthwatering though. Black tie mousse cake. <br>I&#39;ve worked in the business a long time, I&#39;d be honored to have any of those people on our team! <br>Kudos Olive Garden :)",

"reviewcomment":"The first thing you&#39;ll think when you walk in is &#34;where are all the people?&#34; which may give you the thought that this place is terrible, but it&#39;s actually quite the opposite. Prices are great and the food is delicious, Lobster Rangoons are I think $8 for 12 of them. Granted, there probably isn&#39;t even real lobster in them, but they taste good and are cooked perfectly. <br><br>Sushi/Make is great and tastes fresh, I got a platter with sashimi and the pieces were a bit too large for my liking. You almost start to think too much about the raw fish you&#39;re chewing...I like a few chews and done! <br><br>The downfall would be their service - the girl bartender makes decent drinks but you often order a drink and see her texting on her phone or disappearing for a bit before she actually makes you your drink. A young kid works with her sometimes and he is pretty awful; just isn&#39;t paying attention and ignores you, I think it&#39;s more inexperience than malicious though. <br><br>So if you want great Chinese food and Sushi and don&#39;t mind sacrificing a little service then it&#39;s awesome or just get take-out and not deal with it!",

I have to say...next to my mother&#39;s lamb..and she even admits this because I bought her a plate it&#39;s the best lamb shoulder I have ever tasted. It falls right off the bone. They give you huge portions also. Don&#39;t let the outside fool you...the food here tastes like home cooked. It&#39;s just outstanding food. Â Also it&#39;s nice and clean and the staff are very warm. If you want a good, old fashioned home cooked Greek meal with moussaka packed with lamb shoulder, etc this is the place. Desserts are great also. I would honestly say this could be one of the best places in Manchester. Â <br><br>One last thing...The staff is friendly but may not be the hippest when it comes to customer service. You have to give them some grace. They mean well...but it&#39;s not Copley Square Boston. They aren&#39;t rude...just old school...serve the food...get back to work types.",

"reviewcomment":"My friend and I had dinner at Villaggio Ristorante (former KFC in a strip plaza) very recently. I was in here about two years ago for lunch, but I opted not post a review back then since the place was new, the service was very slow (empty dining room) and the pasta was undercooked. Fast forward to the present and things have changed in the right direction My other friends gave this place two thumbs up and recommended I should Yelp this place.<br><br>I made a reservation for a 6PM dinner arrival. Reservations are definitely recommended since the dining room is small and the place may be booked solid on busy nights (Fri &amp; Sat-very likely no walk ins!)<br><br>Upon arrival, we were promptly seated and given menus. The waitress poured house ice water and took our drink orders. After the drinks arrived, the specials were recited. A warm basket of bread (chewy and a bit dry) with olive oil &amp; seasonings for dipping was provided.<br><br>For an appetizer, we shared an Antipasto Italiano (for 4 $13.99) consisting of a modest plate of Prosciutto di Parma, Salami Sopressata, Asiago and Provolone cheese, homemade mozzarella, grilled and marinated eggplant, Â roasted peppers, olives, and tomato slices. This antipasto here was good, but IMHO Fratello&#39;s still makes the best antipasto platter, which is larger with more variety for the same price.<br><br>The dinner entrees included side salads served on plates with basic lettuce with tomatoes, carrots, topped with homemade balsamic dressing.<br><br>Spaghetti Alle Vongole ($17.99) was pretty good with a salty flavor, which consisted of nine clams (in the shell) sautÃ©ed with fresh garlic, white wine, and parsley, topped with scampi sauce over al dente spaghetti.<br><br>The Salmon with Scallops ($28.99-on special) was excellent, which had a soft moist texture topped with capers &amp; lemon butter sauce served with soft mashed potatoes and fresh vegetables (beans, carrots, broccoli). <br><br>We finished our dinners and had room for dessert. The waitress brought out a big dessert tray and we chose Cannolis (2 for $9.90) and a Homemade Tiramisu ($6.95). The cannolis were good and sweet, which came in a crunchy sweet shell, filled with a light ricotta filling, topped with whipped cream, strawberry, powdered sugar, and chocolate drizzle. The tiramisu was a home run, which consisted of layers of soft lady fingers with a creamy chilled sweet filling, soaked with espresso on the bottom, sprinkled with cocoa powder, topped with whipped cream &amp; strawberry.<br><br>The dinner check total for two with tax/before tip came out to $109.19 including appetizer, entrees, desserts, a Grey Goose martini ($10), a glass of Quercito ($10) and a cup of coffee ($2.35).<br><br>In all, this dinner was very good and the service was adequate in a relaxed pace. We were given refills on ice water, but not on the bread. The used plates were cleared promptly, but the used utensils were not replaced. We were offered and given sprinkled parmesan cheese and fresh cracked ground black pepper on the food.<br><br>We plan on returning to Villaggio again for dinner.",

I have eaten at other Sal&#39;s as well, they weren&#39;t as good - quality wise.<br><br>My review:<br>Number 1, it&#39;s pizza, there&#39;s only so much you can do with it, the difference in my opinion is the quality of the preparation. The staff at Sal&#39;s in Manchester, NH were willing to put any topping they had on a pizza, any type of cheese and they have multiple types of sauces.<br><br>The crust is usually very flavorful and tastes very fresh and their individual slices are huge! Though I would rather buy a large and take home the leftovers for breakfast.<br><br>When I look at the price, the quality and the nice people that work there - I really don&#39;t have any negatives, I highly recommend Sal&#39;s Manchester.<br><br>Wait, I take that back: Negative: They need to be open 24/7 for all my pizza consumption needs. ;)<br><br>PS.<br>I agree with Chad P. that the BBQ Chicken is AMAZING!<br><br>My fav:<br>pomodoro (sp?) sauce<br>fresh basil<br>fresh mozzarella cheese<br>grilled chicken<br>little bit of garlic",

The service is beyond slow and the servers had no clue about anything! The drinks and beer menu online are nowhere close to what they stock. Even the beer menu in-house is not accurate. It took me 3 tries before I found something they actually had. The bartender was rude and inattentive, half the games were either broken or not giving the correct amount of tickets AND the ticket redemption machine was pretty much empty of prizes. The food is really good, at least the apps we had were. I don&#39;t know about the entrees or desserts. From the other reviews I&#39;d say this place needs some serious help in the customer service dept. Hopefully the owners take notice and do something about it.",

"reviewcomment":"People of Manchester, you are seriously fortunate to have this in your city!!<br>Stopped in for Vday goodies and decided to try the croissant. Well worth the calories. They are amazing. Just as delish as the croissants I&#39;ve enjoyed in France. <br><br>The place is so charming and filled with exotic chocolates. My afternoon was made complete when the uber friendly woman behind the counter informed me lunch is served daily and is completely vegetarian! <br>Nice to find exceptional people displaying their exceptional talents...",

"reviewcomment":"For a big chain restaurant, these people do a terrific job. Â The prices are very reasonable for the most part, with steaks in all price ranges. Â I went with my girlfriend on a busy Saturday night. Â A projected 30 minute wait was only about 20, and the remote buzzers they give you works out in the parking lot in your car - nice! Â I had to to prepare for the meal anyway with an &#34;appetite enhancer&#34;.<br><br>The Texas theme thing is a little tacky but that&#39;s OK with me - I like western themes. Â I had a rough week, as had my girlfriend, and we needed a really good, no problem meal - the Roadhouse delivered in spades! Â Our server, Meghan, was truly outstanding. Â Right on top of things, very knowledgeable about the food, and super friendly, yet not overbearing. Â The workers in this type of place are on a tightly controlled script, and that can be tiring, but Meghan walked that thin line of singing the corporate line but also injecting her own warm and sparkling personality. Â Along with the food - she made our night!<br><br>Both our steaks were cooked as ordered and were terrific. Â I had a small sirloin and my friend had the steak kabob. Â My house salad with house Italian dressing was off the charts for a house salad. Â Lots of cheese, chopped eggs, croutons, etc., it was perfect!<br>Many times I only eat half the salad - I was scraping the bowl with this one!<br><br>We each had a large house margarita, and they were excellent. Â My only problem with the drinks was the price - $8.99 each. Â In the future, I&#39;ll have water here and drink when I get home. Â As the prices are for the most part VERY reasonable, I can understand them making up for it on the alcohol.<br><br>A lot of people, as you see in these reviews, like to dump on these corporate giants, which in many cases is legitimate. Â I&#39;ll take the guaranteed Texas Roadhouse experience of great food at great prices over your snobby, expensive, small portion bistro type place, ANY DAY.<br>And I&#39;ll ask for Meghan!",

"reviewcomment":"I finally decided to check out PJ&#39;s this week with a good buddy of mine. I have to admit I was a little nervous going in because of the location and such on South Willow. Not sure if I created a self fulfilling prophecy going in but when I entered to wait for my friend three guys at a table started staring at me like I was some kind of alien creature...unsettling for sure...theories: off duty cops checking out the black guy, it&#39;s bizarre for blacks to go in there, they were in a mood to beat someone up and I looked good for that..who knows but they stared at me for quite a while until my buddy came...very weird.<br><br>Service: Excellent!! Some of the best I have seen in ages for Manchester. Nicole the server was very pleasant, FUN, had a killer smile, and served us promptly. No issues what so ever. I suspect we may have gotten Nicole in trouble though for talking to her too much. Again...she was excellent.<br><br>Food: We had the fried onion rings for an appetizer and they were so good we had to fight to stop eating them...Excellent!<br>I ordered the BLT sandwich which I had a craving for and it satisfied. Very good. The tomatoes are breaded and fried though...it was great but I like raw cut tomatoes with my BLT. My buddy got the hamburger but to be honest and this rarely happens to me I was so engrossed in my own meal I didn&#39;t notice him even eating it...He finished his plate so I assumed he enjoyed it. It looked good. Fries were outstanding also. No issues there. It&#39;s standard pub food but done well with outstanding prices. I want to go back for breakfast...The menu is vast with many choices standard pub food. If you don&#39;t want to break the bank and want a decent meal it&#39;s a good choice! Â <br><br>Decor: Nice...Updated...tons of tv&#39;s...Great looking bar..Kind of a retro 70s meet modern day feel. It was cool.<br><br>.",

They are absolutely delightful! They also have many other tasty sweet treats. I always leave with far more sweets than I expected to get going in. Â <br><br>The imported salami and smoked Gouda sandwich is also a great option. The homemade chicken and tortellini soup is fantastic as well. The bacon potato soup is loaded with bacon. It&#39;s a broth based soup, rather than the traditional cream based. It&#39;s very good! Â <br><br>The staff is always very pleasant. The shop offers a few specials daily.

When My plate came I was so surprised: Banana slices cut on the bias and strawberries cut in half cooked into these large cakes. I&#39;ll never go back to plain! His sandwiches are always made with tasty fresh ingredients, the specials are always amazing. He packs flavor and a touch of something unexpected onto every single plate. <br>Presentation is great too. I don&#39;t like to get hung up on lack of presentation, but when the food is great-tasting and the presentation is great as well, it&#39;s a bonus in my book.<br>The location is super easy to access just off Elm. After ordering at the counter, you can help yourself to coffee and flavor syrups. The seating area is warm and pretty chill. You can watch the news which isn&#39;t my preference, but it&#39;s generally pretty easy to ignore too. <br>Come on back a couple of times and you&#39;ll feel like family. My kind of place.",

"reviewcomment":"I stopped by Brothers this week for lunch and had the BEST spinach pita I&#39;ve honestly ever had in my life! It was all homemade and clearly made using the freshest ingredients. The spinach was perfectly soft which the onions were still firm and had just the right slight crunch. But my favorite part was the filo dough, crispy and buttery on the outside while being soft and firm still on the inside. Firm and held together perfectly without being mushy or soggy. Amazing!<br>When I arrived the take out window was directly to my left and I could see into the kitchen. A Greek women who I realized later was the owners wife greeted me as I walked in with a friendly smile as she was busy at work. The waitress carried over that same friendly inviting welcome as she brought me to my table. I needed to charge my hot spot and asked if there was an outlet I could use. She went out of her way to plug it in for me up at the waitresses station and kept an eye on it for me. When I left she brought me my device and bill and thanked me for coming in. Oh! I almost forgot! While I was enjoying my yummy lunch the owner came over to my table personally to see if my lunch was to my liking and introduce himself. I found that to be a very nice touch. The entire experience from start to finish was EXCELLENT! They treated me like I was a regular customer that they see all the time. I can&#39;t say that was the case on this trip but they definitely will be seeing more of me on a regular basis. Fairly priced, yummy food, top notch customer service! What else could you ask for? Â  Which is why I give Brothers hands down 5 stars! <br>Thank you for a wonderful experience!",

"reviewcomment":"My wife and I are pretty big pizza nuts. Â We really enjoy a good pizza...of all types...New York Thin, Chicago Deep Dish...or Brick Oven style. Â While we enjoy many of the pizzerias around the area (900 Degrees, Carraba&#39;s, even Pizza Hut at times), we rediscovered Bertucci&#39;s last night.<br><br>When we first moved here 2.5 years ago, we frequented the Bertucci&#39;s in Andover, MA...but, for some reason stopped going.<br><br>Last night, I got the Carmine pizza (even though it is off the menu, it is ON their &#34;back menu&#34; and they gladly made it for me). Â The Carmine has a special roasted tomato sauce that makes it incredible. Â It is then topped with balls of fresh mozzarella and piles of deeply caramelized (not just sauteed) onions for a very unique and delicious pie.<br><br>My wife got the Pizza Verde...a relatively new creation that I dubbed the &#34;salad on a pizza crust.&#34; Â It has the same fresh mozzarella balls with prosciuotto...and then arugula piled VERY high on top...making it green looking (hence the Pizza &#34;Verde&#34;). Â To eat this, you fold a piece in half, like you would in New York, to keep the arugula on there. Â Another simply amazing variety of pizza.<br><br>Service...our waitress was quite pleasant and on the ball. Â The only issue, if there was one, was that the wait from drinks to taking order was maybe a couple minutes slow...but...absolutely nothing to complain about, I am being very nitpicky here.<br><br>Finally, the wait...if you go to this Bertucci&#39;s...and I heard people complaining about this...realize that it is (1) IN THE MALL and (2) IS VERY POPULAR...so, you will, most likely, have to wait to be seated. Â This is not the fault of the restaurant...and, frankly, is quite a good sign about the quality of the restaurant!",

"reviewcomment":"My friend and I have been to Puerta Vallarta several times for late dinners. This Mexican restaurant is tucked away in a small strip plaza. The atmosphere inside is very cozy, colorful and decorative, divided in two sections, dining room to the right and full bar (flatscreen TV behind bar) with high chair seating and lounge area to the left. <br><br>On each visit, we were graciously welcomed and seated promptly. We&#39;re given complementary chips (warm &amp; crispy) and salsa (comes in a bottle). The food we&#39;ve ordered here has tasted very fresh with good flavors, good sized portions of food. We&#39;ve ordered the following dishes here<br><br>The Steak Fajitas are served on a sizzling skillet with steak, peppers, onions, &amp; tomatoes, served with soft warm flour tortillas, rice, refried beans, guacamole salad, cheese, sour cream. These fajitas were very tasty and the steak was very tender.<br><br>The Vallarta Special includes two chicken flautas, one tamale (filled with pork) with, grilled steak, chicken, rice, beans and a second plate with sour cream and guacamole salad. The sauce is on the salty side for taste.<br><br>The Chimichanga de Camaron included two fried flour tortillas filled with grilled shrimp,onions, &amp; tomatoes, topped with melted cheese,lettuce, tomatoes, sour cream, served with rice. This dish was very good!<br><br>The Mole Poblano consisted of shredded chicken with a thick mole sauce (with seeds) on top served with rice, guacamole salad and tortillas. My buddy has ordered this mole dish three times already<br><br>The Margaritas here are good sized and the free refills are given on soft drinks.<br><br>The service here is very attentive, efficient, and polite. The food comes out in timely fashion. On my last visit, we hung out in the bar to watch some football, as our waiter (our amigo on a few dinner visits) made sure our drinks were replenished (frequent refills on Diet Coke) and prompt margarita reorders. The chips and salsa were replenished too!<br><br>We really like this place since it&#39;s very local, the food &amp; service are very good, and this place is not crazy packed and busy like the regional Mexican chains such as La Carreta, Margarita&#39;s, and Shorty&#39;s.<br><br>We have not yet ordered a dessert from here since we are very full after dinner with to go boxes given to us.

"reviewcomment":"One of the best parts about summer in New England is when all the little seafood shacks and ice cream parlors open up. When you&#39;re in Manchester, this means Cremeland. This restaurant is a family-owned, 3rd generation operation, and you can taste the love and attention between every bun, on every plate, and in every cone.<br><br>The first thing that you notice is how fresh the seafood is. It is definitely fried to order, never frozen, and I&#39;m sure they are on a first name basis with their purveyor. The seafood plate, although a tad expensive, is enough to feed 2. You get several U25 scallops that are moist, sweet, and buttery. A nice haddock filet also comes with the plate and it is fresh and flaky. In addition, you get about a pound of clams that are both bursting with freshness and taste like the ocean. And finally, you get a couple jumbo, and I do mean jumbo, shrimps. Well worth the splurge.<br><br>The hotdogs there are mediocre as well as the cole slaw. But honestly, that is not really why you go to Cremelands. They also have a good selection of ice cream - scoop, soft serve, and sorbet. The one thing I have to say about the ice cream is that they are generous with the mix-ins. I recall finding a whole oreo in the oreo flavor and the pistachio ice cream is littered with real pistachios. <br><br>The seating for the restaurant is all outside, so pick a nice day to go. They call your name out once your order is up, and nothing makes a day like enjoying a steaming pile of fried seafood on a sunny day. I don&#39;t care what Jack says, this is a great family restaurant and I never feel in danger. If you don&#39;t enjoy the atmosphere and food here, get back on your high horse and get out of Manchester.",

"reviewcomment":"There is no shortage of pizza/submarine shops in and around the Manchester area. Â Souvlaki&#39;s is a standout for the following reasons: 1) They make you feel genuinely welcomed when you enter their shop. Â The man generally at the front counter is super friendly, always. Â 2) Â The food is above average in quality. Â 3) Â The prices are the most reasonable in town.<br><br>Why anyone would want to go to a chain pizza or submarine shop instead of a private shop like Souvlaki&#39;s is a mystery to me. Â Yes, their pizza is Greek-style; but, if that&#39;s not to your taste there&#39;s always The Alley Cat, Tano&#39;s, or Cessario&#39;s which all serve good Italian-style pizza.<br><br>Give Souvlaki&#39;s a try, if only for the service alone, which, unfortunately in many establishments today is severely lacking.",

You feel like your basically in someone&#39;s home as the area is residential and the decor was inviting. The coffee we definitely a bit bland (hey it&#39;s basically a diner!) and I don&#39;t know if it was an off day but the beens weren&#39;t anything special (unfortunately they were out of potato pancakes). I really want to come back Fridays they have fresh seafood! Nomnomnom!<br>Went with the boyfriend and 2 meals, coffee, and the side of beans with a hefty tip was only 20 bucks! Highly recommend :)<br>Left with a warm, fuzzy, and very full feeling!",

"reviewcomment":"Been here twice and I have never been disappointed with the food. Yummy, homey, and friggin cheap!!! Best Breakfast in Manchester hands down!!!! It&#39;s warm and inviting and during the week it doesn&#39;t ever seem to be busy. Â I always get a seat. <br><br>It did seem their hash was from a can, but those yummy strawberry pancakes made up for it!!<br><br>When the owner takes the time to come over and talk to you, you know you matter to then and they want to ensure you have the best service available:)<br><br>That being said the first time I was there, I had left overs, she boxed them for me, added a cup of syrup to take home and asked if I would like my side to go. AMAZING SERVICE. Served by the blonde owner herself. ( I was one of 4 tables of people)<br><br>At my most recent visit- the girl wAs rude, never coming back to check on us and basically threw the box at us leaving us to do pack it up ourselves and without any little syrup or Togo cups.( only ones here)<br><br>I realize that isn&#39;t the end of the world but it was nice to feel as if everyone in there mattered. Maybe if she hasn&#39;t felt talking to whom we could only assume was her bf Â the whole time was more important out experience might have been better service wise.<br><br>Fantastic food ad with the right waitress, fantastic experience!! :)",

"reviewcomment":"When I&#39;m at work and hungry, this is usually the go to for their wrap selection. &#34;The Zorba&#34; and &#34;Dirty Frenchman&#34; are favorites. Delivery is usually pretty fast and of the dozens of times we&#39;ve ordered, they&#39;ve only messed something up once, and it was only forgetting a drink--they did go back and get it though.<br><br>As for the pizza...sometimes it is awesome, sometimes it is not. I have found the dough and amount of cheese they put on a pizza to be very inconsistent. One Sunday I ordered the special $5 cheese pizza, and the ratio of sauce to cheese was just NOT good.<br><br>The specialty pizzas are probably the way to go here. The signature &#34;Awesome Pizza&#34; is really good if you like a little spice. Recently, we ordered the &#34;Backyard Barbecue&#34; and were amazed! Hamburger, lettuce, onion, tomato, pickle and cheese on thousand island dressing never tasted so good! It&#39;s basically a big mac on a pizza and a small was sufficient enough to feed 3 people to the point of gut explosion.<br><br>So if you can look past the silly name, give it a try!",

The plain Buttermilk pancakes are great too. My husband likes his eggs over easy and his home fries extra done ; not a problem here. He appreciates that they listen to your requests and cook your food the way you order it ( he has gotten eggs over hard and barely cooked home fries at too many places to count). At Butter My biscuit they always get it right.<br><br>The service is as good as the food. The staff are friendly and attentive. The staff check on your coffee regularly and anything else you might need.<br><br>Your can&#39;t miss the purple building where it&#39;s located. Â You wouldn&#39;t guess from the outside, but Â it&#39;s very roomy on the inside. It&#39;s a cute little breakfast spot.<br><br>PS- They also make muffins and desserts like cookies and brownies.

"reviewcomment":"I absolutely loved this place! Â My friends and I actually ran into this place by chance. We were driving around on Elm, and saw this restaurant nicely place outside from the &#39;city&#39; scene. I think we might have been a little under-dressed for this place as we were just planning on going to some chain restaurant. However, the people who worked there were fantastic! So I didn&#39;t feel so bad after that. <br>The place is nicely decored with a tuscan theme. For some reason, I felt like it was very comfortable like being in my own home. The menu was great! <br>I got a salmon filet with some spinach and mashed potatoes on the side. I ate everything! I could have had seconds! hehe, I had a big appetite that night!<br>I had a tough time picking out what to eat - there were so many items on the menu that I wanted to try. Fortunately, my friends had ordered items that I wanted to try as well :D like the grape leaves but they had a fancy name instead of grape leaves ... they also got lentil soup and then also gnocchi with a meatball - let me tell you, they have some serious meatball! Notice it&#39;s not meatballs ... it&#39;s one large meatball! Â it&#39;s good :D <br>They have great olive bread to serve while waiting for the dishes to be prepped.<br>I will definately come back here to try the other menu items!<br>Oh, one more thing, they were not busy on a Friday night! We were hungry and we found we were lucky to run into this place with fairly quick service!",

"reviewcomment":"China Wind (formerly Tung Sing) opened up in May 2011 at the sharp corner of Massabesic St &amp; Hall St. The place itself looks the same as before, very cozy with an order counter with overhead lighted menu boards, open kichen and a few tables for eating in. There is now a flatscreen TV on top of the Coke cooler.<br><br>There were some changes to the menu (from its predecessor), some items/dishes are gone and Â new items are now on the menu. The prices have gone up slightly on most items. The menu is all Chinese and there are no more Thai dishes. The pu pu platter for two has changed slightly which has 2 egg rolls, 4 chicken fingers, 2 chicken teriyakis, 2 beef teriyakis, 4 chicken wings, boneless spare ribs, &amp; 4 rumakis (shrimp &amp; bacon). Unfortunately, the pu pu platter for one is no longer on the menu, but assorted appetizer combos with 4 chicken wings are offered for $8.95. 30 Combination Platters served with pork fried rice are offered for lunch ($5.75-$6.95) with egg roll or chicken wing and for dinner ($8.50-$8.95) with egg roll &amp; chicken wing. A Weekly Special Dish Combination is also offered for $4.50 &amp; up (lunch) and $6.50 &amp; up (dinner).<br><br>House Specials now offered here include fish in black bean sauce, Peking duck for 2, orange flavor prawns ,General Tso&#39;s bean curd, and eggplant in garlic sauce, just to name a few. Also, an express lunch buffet (12PM-3PM during the week) is offered for $4.95 which includes rice and soda and choice of 3 items from the buffet setup on folding tables.<br><br>I stopped in here for lunch very recently and the staff was very welcoming telling me I get a 20 percent discount off the menu for the grand opening special. I ordered the C30 Shrimp Lo Mein with Pork Fried Rice &amp; Egg Roll ($5.95-20 percent discount, plus tax). The food was ready in under 10 minutes and a couple of the staff were also busy filling and folding cheese wontons on big trays on the front tables as I waited.<br><br>The lo mein had a good mix of vegetables (sprouts, onions, cabbage, sliced mushrooms), tender small shrimp and soft noodles. The fried rice was soft in texture with a mix of roast pork, egg, onions, and sprouts. The egg roll was stuffed with a mix of cabbage, celery, and ground pork, crispy outside and not too greasy. Overall, the food I had was very tasty and filling like before.<br><br>Fast Delivery offered",

"reviewcomment":"Stopped by for a late Saturday lunch with my favorite dining companion in the world, my nine year old son. I ordered the Grace Potter grilled cheese and chili, and he had a hot dog, ugh, and a loaded baked potato soup. Please note, he despises cheese more than any other food. And yes, I brought him to a restaurant that specializes in grilled cheese. The man at the counter let him try the soup before buying luckily, and my son declared it the best soup he&#39;s ever had! (He loves to add to his &#34;best&#34; list constantly these days.) <br><br>Service was friendly and our food was brought out promptly. My sandwich was perfectly grilled, and had that yummy crispiness on the outside that you can expect from a well done grilled cheese. The fillings included Granny Smith apples, pepper relish, bacon, and a couple different cheeses and everything blended together very well. I was hoping the pepper relish would have more of a kick to it but I have a high tolerance for hot and spicy food so to the average person it may have been spicy enough. The chili was decent, typical recipe with green peppers and kidney beans and great for dunking my sandwich into. I had pasta salad on the side and it was tasty-homemade I believe. <br><br>My son&#39;s hot dog disappeared in minutes, but what else is new. He also sucked down his pickle spear and mine in no time. They were the good kind too-(the things I do for love, like giving up my pickle). He ate about half of his soup, which is great progress for a picky eater trying new things. I didn&#39;t try it, but the broth looked thin. For me, I would prefer a thicker, cream based chowder. <br><br>We both considered this a great discovery and we will definitely go again soon. There were a lot of great sounding sandwiches, and a build your own option. I was told the soups rotate too. Every since I saw the Tom and Chee episode of Shark Tank, I&#39;ve been dying for a place similar and I&#39;m happy to have found it. The prices were a little steeper than I&#39;d hoped for, but unlike the Pick 2 at Panera, you get a full sandwich with the combo. And it was very filling-I could&#39;ve taken half home and made another meal out of it....but do I ever do that? No willpower here!<br><br>Great addition to the ever growing quickservice realm of dining options out there!",

"reviewcomment":"The owners of one of my favorite restaurants, Republic, opened Campo Enoteca. If you&#39;re familiar with Republic, Campo has that same atmosphere of liveliness and community. The interior is restrained and modern - no silly campy Italian restaurant &#34;decorations&#34; in sight.<br><br>Love that you can order half or full plates of the pasta dishes, which leaves you more stomach capacity for the other yummy menu items. At the server&#39;s suggestion we split a few antipasti and an order of the crostini (choose three out of six options) and then moved onto half orders of pasta. Or, at least everyone else did. I still went with the full size. I ate it all, because it was delicious, but a half would have been a much wiser move. <br><br>The best Italian pasta dishes are the simplest (or at least are the ones that seem simple, but taste like they took all day to make). The Classic Roman Carbonara is in that class of dish. Made simply with black pepper, spaghetti, guanciale, parmesan and a sauce created with local eggs, the result is authentic awesomeness. Most people think this dish is made with cream - it absolutely is not. One of the reasons I ordered it was that &#34;no cream&#34; was listed in the description of the dish. That&#39;s a big clue that you&#39;re about to get the real deal.<br><br>Even though it&#39;s relatively new, Campo has the same great friendly, knowledgeable and professional service I&#39;ve come to expect at Republic. Not to mention that it was already hopping close to opening - you know it&#39;s only going to get crazier!<br><br>One thing I noted - dinner ends at 9 p.m. Sun.-Thurs. and at 11 p.m. on Fri.-Sat. They stay open later for cocktails: 10 p.m. on Sun.-Thurs. and 12 p.m. on Fri. and Sat.",

"reviewcomment":"Pizza Market moved across the parking lot in the Eastside Plaza to a bigger space a few years ago with more seating here. Pizza Market also offers a giant 30&#34; pizza pie, great for parties. <br><br>On my most recent visit, I decided on an X-Large 20&#34; Pizza Market Special ($21.99-regular price) since I had to use up a 50 percent off coupon on a 20&#34; Pizza (Pick Up Only). Total with tax came out to just under $13 after discount. The service was good and the pizza was ready to go in under 20 minutes after I ordered.<br><br>OMG!! This 20&#34; Pizza Market Special was loaded heavily with plenty of toppings (pepperoni, ham, sausage, onions, mushrooms, salami, tomatoes, green peppers), sauce and melted cheese on a firm soft thin crust with soft and puffed edges. I can only imagine what the 30&#34; Pizza Market Special looks like. The pizza was not too greasy and very tasty. The first pizza slice fresh out of the oven was enjoyable and very filling to eat as I chugged down an ice cold Diet Pepsi. <br><br>I will continue ordering from this Pizza Market location since the pizza, pasta, and subs have been consistent on each visit.",

Just about the only chain where the cooking still feels like Mom&#39;s Thanksgiving supper, except tastier. Everything, from chicken to veggies to cornbread, tastes fresh.<br><br>This location is convenient to the mall, and is a healthier option than surrounding chains.

"reviewcomment":"5 Star Calzones!!! I was first introduced to the best calzones ever in 1997 and haven&#39;t had a better calzone since! I was ordering from Annula&#39;s religiously when I lived in Manchester. I must have ate from Annula&#39;s at least 50 times back in the day. That sounds like an exaggeration, but its not! Since 2006 I have moved away, but Annula&#39;s is the first craving I fulfill whenever I get back to Manchester. As a matter of fact I was just there Labor Day weekend; I drove (750 miles) up for a weekend visit, I checked into the hotel I stay at, and then I got right back into the car and headed for Annula&#39;s! I already know what I&#39;m going to order, a menu is never necessary -- for me, it&#39;s always the #7 Calzone! It&#39;s a very simple combination of Spinach, Onion, Cheese, and Greek Magic! I don&#39;t know what they do to make this calzone so special. I love the flavor combination so anytime I want a calzone I give a variety of pizzeria&#39;s the opportunity to make me that same calzone (Spinach, Onion, and Cheese), and some places do a good job -- but none will ever resemble the calzone YOU can get from Annula&#39;s! I will be back next year Annula&#39;s! <br><br>If you&#39;re a calzone fanatic, try one from Annula&#39;s, you will not be disappointed.",

We sit up at the bar for prompt and friendly service and to catch the Bruins game on the TVs. The place is a bit loud since the jukebox is blasting rock music. The food prices here are very reasonable and the portions of food are generous. <br><br>The pizzas we&#39;ve ordered from here are quite tasty, which is a Greek style crust and the toppings and cheese a generous, slightly on the greasy side. A Large Cheese Pizza is $6.99. I&#39;ve enjoyed the Chicken Parm Dinner ($9.25), Shrimp Marinara ($9.25), and Chicken Cacciatore ($9.25), which all come with salad (dine-in only) and baked garlic bread. The pasta is cooked just right and the marinara sauce is thick and hearty. <br><br>We will continue to stop in at Season Tickets for late night tasty dinners, pizzas, and beer specials at reasonable prices.",

"reviewcomment":"A convenient place to stop for drinks before Verizon events. Located at the corner of Elm Street &amp; Lake Avenue directly across from the Verizon Wireless Arena, Greg&#39;s Place is open everyday for breakfast (8:00 AM-12:00 PM), lunch &amp; dinner (12:00 PM-9:00 PM), and boozing (until 1:00 AM). The menu offers basic American fare including typical breakfast items (eggs, pancakes, French toast, etc), appetizers, sandwiches, chili, soups, salads, comfort food, pasta, and desserts (chef&#39;s special). On Verizon event nights, a special menu is served. Check out the food and beverage menus at <a href='/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gregsplacenh.com&amp;s=14f41e4680dabf35ed3708e4330d816c351a091400fb117162f58b0816bde842' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>gregsplacenh.com</a><br><br>Upon entering Greg&#39;s Place, you&#39;ve stepped into a dark and very laid back lounge. The place is one open room with table seating, high top tables, seating around the bar, and beer signs on the walls. Holiday lights are strung around the bar. They have several TVs, a pool table, video games (Big Buck Hunter &amp; Bowling), bar table games, and the Internet jukebox.<br><br>I stopped here for dinner on a quiet Tuesday evening (no events). The place was empty with only a couple having beers at the bar and chatting with the bartender/waitress. I sat myself at the bar to make things easier. I was ordering food only tonight.<br><br>I started out with a Crock of Clam Chowder ($3.25) which was good on a chilly night, served very hot with oyster crackers, not thick, but loaded with minced clams, potatoes, and a creamy savory broth.<br><br>For dinner, I ordered the Meatloaf Dinner ($7.25) served with mashed potatoes and niblet corn. The meatloaf (4 slices) was a bit dry, but tasty since it was covered in brown gravy. The mashed potatoes were chunky topped with brown gravy. The side of Linguine Marinara ($2.25) was cooked al dente and topped with a zesty chunky tomato sauce.<br><br>For dessert, they had two choices: apple pie or apple crisp. I had some Apple Crisp a la Mode ($4.95), which was prepared the way the bartender likes it, a generous pile of hot apple crisp with a scoop of vanilla ice cream topped with whipped cream &amp; cinnamon sugar, a good dessert.<br><br>Overall, the service was very friendly and attentive with refills on ice water and timely delivery of the food. The food here was good, but nothing special. I enjoyed my dinner to some groovy 1970s music playing from the jukebox. The atmosphere was a bit dark. I wouldn&#39;t recommend this place for a romantic meal, but it&#39;s a great place to chill out over some drinks and good homestyle food and to listen to some Barry White. Enough said!",

"reviewcomment":"One of the better buffet places in the area. The staff is extremely friendly, and they do a great job keeping the dining room clean. This is a very well run business, the owners are usually at the door greeting customers. The food is your typical selection of chinese food with some fruits, desserts, and american food like pizza mixed in. I recommend like others that have reviewed that you visit at peak business times, so you ensure you get food that doesn&#39;t sit for extended periods of time.<br><br>If you&#39;re hungry and want a quick bite to eat without waiting, then this place is perfect. The price is right and the food is for the most part good and fresh. A solid 4 star buffet.",

"reviewcomment":"I really enjoyed my Saturday night at 11Eleven Bistro. I have been to the previous restaurant Saffron Bistro with executive chef Joe Drift and enjoyed the food and service at that location. When this new restaurant opened I could not wait to try it and finally did. I started the night off with a delicious prosecco ordered the swordfish with a pineapple salsa and slaw. My table shared two appetizers. The crab cake and beef. I enjoyed the swordfish but the portion seemed small for the price. I would have liked to see some risotto on the side to add a starch. Everything was well displayed and looked presentable. The dessert was amazing! Pumpkin cheesecake and creme brule. The service was very slow and it was not a busy night. We got in right away but took a long time to order our food. The brioche before the drinks were very good too. They looked homemade and they were nice and warm. Overall the food was great but could use a little more on the plate, service was not the best but can always improve. I will sure to be back again! I miss Saffron Bistro so coming here was like being home again.",

We had personalized service from the general manager, Chad, and our hostess Saundra was excellent. Both knew exactly how to cater to first time party goers as well as frequent flyers. We had a party sampler tray with buffalo windGs which were very good. The pizza (cheese and pepperoni) was cooked well and great for small children and adults. The games were all in working order and there were many to choose from. Even on a busy weekend the place was well strafed and attendant&#39;s were easy to find if needed. It was our first time to this Chuck E Cheese location and we will definitely be back!",

"reviewcomment":"This is a major asset for anyone interested in real Mexican food. Â I&#39;ve only scratched the surface, but I love what I&#39;ve had - the chicken and beef tacos. Â They use two soft corn tortillas to wrap the goodies in. Â There&#39;s a mixture of fine chopped lettuce and cilantro on top of the beef or chicken, and it&#39;s spiced with a subtle, but very pronounced hot spice. Â But if you&#39;re into it, make sure they include a little container of their own hot sauce - I think it&#39;s the best I&#39;ve had. Â The beef is a chipped style as is the chicken. Â Another nice touch - they also give you a little ball of tinfoil wrapped radish slices with a quarter lime. Â I&#39;m guessing you drip the lime on the radishes and eat them to cool your mouth afterwards. Â As I take the tacos home to eat, I find my superb margaritas do a much better job cooling me off!<br><br> Â I love Mexican food, and this would be a great place to call in and order food for a get together(phone #603- 305-1970). Â In this post Bush/Madoff era, when everyone is feeling the pinch, this is a great place to get terrific ethnic food at a low price and eat and drink at home for a song. Â The truck is owned by the same people who operate a similar truck on Pine Street in Nashua. Â I was talking to the woman in the Manchester truck yesterday, Virginia, and she remembered me from the Nashua truck a couple of years ago! Â I was impressed she remembered an old gringo like me.<br><br>I&#39;m no expert, but I seriously doubt you will find a better taco in the state of New Hampshire than what they serve here, for $2. Â Lake Av. and Union St. is in the heart of a tough neighborhood, but it&#39;s making a comeback, and this Taco truck is helping. Â There is also a brand new, state of the art laundromat across the street with the best washers and dryers I&#39;ve ever used. Â They do wash and fold laundry for 65 cents a pound - cheapest in the city. Â <br><br>Ole!!!",

"reviewcomment":"This is a new found place for me and my friends. We normally do delivery and they always deliver great hot food. <br><br>Their chicken is amazing, they have a great batter and their chicken is always moist and delicious! Their fries are good and they serve an ample amount of it with the dinners. I&#39;ve ordered the potato wedges and they were good, but there are other places I would rather get potato wedges from. Their mashed potatoes remind me of KFC, except it isn&#39;t like an ice cream scoop of potatoes. <br><br>Their chicken kabobs are amazing and from what I&#39;ve heard (and smelled) - their spicy rice has a good amount of kick to it. A friend tried their fish and fries and they use a white fish and the same batter they use for the chicken. Since the fish is generally thinner, the batter can overpower the fish and so it can seem like you&#39;re just eating the batter. <br><br>This place shows lots of promise and there is absolutely no better place for friend chicken. Just writing this review makes me want to order some chicken.",

"reviewcomment":"I will sometimes stop at the Wendy&#39;s on South Willow Street location out of convenience. I have no issues with the food here and it is what I would expect at any Wendy&#39;s I visit. Wendy&#39;s has been one of my favorite fast food restaurants for many years. I enjoy their chili, frostys, chicken salads, baked potatoes, go wraps, and grilled chicken sandwiches.<br><br>However, this location has very very slow service compared to other locations in NH. On my last visit, it took about 17 minutes to receive my food order (grilled chicken sandwich, large fries, small chili, and large Diet Coke) and the place was not busy, which is definitely not acceptable turn around time. <br><br>The staff as a whole seems to have trouble working together and I&#39;ve also seen orders get messed up here (drive thru customers walking in because items were missing or the sandwich was not made correctly). Recently, the customer before me was waiting for two cheeseburgers for a very long time and he finally gave up and walked out of the building with frustration. <br><br>QUICK NOTE: &#34;You&#39;d think that just working at a Wendy&#39;s restaurant would be difficult for Ronald MacDonald.&#34;- Associated Press<br><br>This Wendy&#39;s location made national news in 2005 because there was an ex Wendy&#39;s employee named Ronald MacDonald who stole money from the safe here. The manager did catch the &#34;Hamburglar.&#34;<br><br><a href='/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fusatoday30.usatoday.com%2Fnews%2Foffbeat%2F2005-11-28-burger-theft_x.htm&amp;s=dcdd64ccaf88c419677db0f2c2094589fbfbc813aa31af27f25d8b306b50b783' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>usatoday30.usatoday.com/â¦</a><br><br>I was LMAO when I read this story back in 2005 and I actually clipped this story from the newspaper and posted it in my office.",

"reviewcomment":"Chain restaurant, no surprises. Food is okay, good for the price. All of their ingredients come from the chain&#39;s suppliers, so the dishes are identical in any Applebees. I found the wait staff to be really pleasant and courteous, meals were prepared quickly and as ordered. For example, I had the 7oz sirloin medium, and it was medium. <br><br>One thing I wanted to mention concerns food allergies. The staff were all VERY nice and would have been helpful had the store any options to give us. This is no fault to them, which is why I am giving four stars, but I want to share it as a shortcoming for the chain itself. Food allergies are becoming increasingly important for restaurants to be aware of, and this chain seems slow on that road. Let me detail, in case someone can find this useful:<br><br>My wife has an a gluten allergy and a corn allergy. They have no allergen info on menus. Upon entering, the host gave us a binder with photocopied papers in it, turned to page ten which was the &#34;gluten free&#34; page. So she couldn&#39;t even use a menu, to see photos or read descriptions to know what these things actually were (an appetizer? a full dinner?), but that wasn&#39;t horrible. They did not have listings for corn allergies. Our waitress asked out back and the manager said there is exactly one item she could have that is gluten and corn free: a plain side salad with no dressing. Yikes!<br><br>We eat at casual dining restaurants often and we&#39;ve never had such a restriction from her allergies. For example, we asked if she could have just a baked potato with butter. Reasonable, right? It&#39;s often her go-to if we end up at a restaurant that doesn&#39;t attend to food allergies. Well guess what? They roll their baked potatoes in corn oil before baking and they use margarine and not butter. Yikes. Plain side salad for $5 it is.<br><br>If no one in your party has food allergies, it&#39;s a nice restaurant - good price, courteous staff, comfortable setting.",

"reviewcomment":"Recently, after not wanting to wait the 40-minutes for a table at the Puritan, I happened upon Blake&#39;s once again. Â The good thing about Blake&#39;s is that you&#39;ll always find a table. Â The not so good thing is that most of the servers are teenagers and what typically comes with teenagers is not long attention spans. Â The food here is as good as the more highly overrated Red Arrow. Â I&#39;d also say that the food is more creative than The Red Arrow. Â A major plus at Blake&#39;s is that they use freshly-ground angus sirloin for their burgers which means you can get a burger cooked to your liking and not the horridly overcooked med-well that most restaurants now insist upon serving. Â They also serve plain fries. Â I don&#39;t know when this &#34;seasoned&#34; French fry trend will end but I wish it would end now. Â Blake&#39;s is also an ice cream shop so if you want to complete your diet-busting after your meal they do have a creative line up of sundaes.<br><br>All in all, if you want to avoid the lines and tight-quarters of The Red Arrow, and you enjoy diner-type food certainly do give Blake&#39;s a try.",

I&#39;m really fond of the lamb sub, the lamb is always nicely cooked and the vegetables fresh. Their pizza is pretty standard, but the prices (especially for the specialty pizzas) are low and the pizzas good-sized, so you get a lot of value for your money. Â And um, it&#39;s Â a small thing, but the fries are always crispy and well-seasoned. I really like fries, but I&#39;ve sort of resigned myself to getting soggy, mostly flavorless fries from pizza/sub joints. I don&#39;t have that problem with Grand Slam. :)<br><br>I get delivery from here a lot, they have a low minimum ($7!) and I&#39;ve never had any problems with the order or the delivery itself.<br><br>Recommended for delivery/pick-up if you&#39;re in the area.

"reviewcomment":"Mayflower II is a Chinese &amp; Japanese restaurant &amp; lounge, located in the Hampshire Square strip plaza, which was formerly Oishii Asian Cuisine and Feng House. The other Mayflower location is in Ipswich, MA. I&#39;ve been here a few times for lunch and dinner. The food served here is solid good and prepared fresh to order with good portions.<br><br>The full service dining room/lounge is nice and modern, yet casual, has several comfortable booths along the walls, a full cocktail bar/sushi bar with high chair seating and flatscreen TVs, and tables in the middle of the room.<br><br>On a recent lunch visit, I ordered the L15 Hunan Chicken ($7) served with pork fried rice, chicken fingers, and hot &amp; sour soup. <br><br>The hot &amp; sour soup was decent and had a semi thick spicy broth with a good mix of egg, tofu, bamboo, mushrooms, and vegetables. <br><br>The Hunan Chicken was a very good dish, which had tender slices of boneless chicken, broccoli, carrots, mushrooms, snow peas, peppers, &amp; baby corn in a spicy brown sauce. The fried rice had a light fluffy texture with tender roast pork pieces and sauteed onions, topped with bean sprouts. The 3 battered chicken fingers were on the greasy side, which had a nice crunch on the outside with tender white meat chicken inside.<br><br>The service on this visit was good and prompt from my waitress/bartender (Lucy). The food was served to me in timely fashion, soup came out first, followed by the entree on a big square plate.<br><br>On another side note, while I was enjoying my lunch, another patron who was sitting at the bar was trying to flirt a bit with the bartender urging her to come out to the west coast and go out on a date with him. <br><br>Also, one of the TVs was blaring an infomercial on &#34;wonderbras&#34; for about 10 minutes and the bar patron finally spoke up and requested the channel be changed to ESPN, thank goodness!!! For some, a &#34;wonderbra&#34; is a great idea, but it&#39;s definitely not for me!",

Inside, the small dining area has lunch counter stool seating (bright orange counter &amp; small TV) and table seating. There are old saws hanging on the walls.<br><br>My boss and I usually enjoy lunch at the other eatery Moe Joe&#39;s Family Restaurant (closed Mondays) on Candia Road. Since it was Monday, we popped into Moe Joe&#39;s Country Diner for lunch instead. We sat at the lunch counter.<br><br>The Diner menu here is very similar to the Restaurant menu, which offers typical breakfast fare (served all day), sandwiches, burgers, subs, wraps, pasta, soups, and salads. For dessert, there&#39;s a bakery case near the entrance. Yes, they have Whoopie Pies!!<br><br>We ordered sandwich specials (with fries and pickle): BBQ Pulled Pork (chewy/tender meat) on a Bulkie ($6.75) and marinara Meatball Sub ($5.50), which were both big and tasty. The fries were hot and a bit salty, average. Good value for lunch. The service was pretty good and attentive.",

"reviewcomment":"The 4 stars I posted for Grand Slam should be thought of as the average of 3 for the food and 4.5 for the bar. Â <br><br>The food is very, very typical Greek pizza joint stuff, just like you find in most &#34;House of ...&#34; places. Â Yes sometimes I crave it, but not very often. Â Pizza, subs, fried apps, etc. Â It is never great, but never bad. Â <br><br>Grand Slam is the closest bar to my house. Â I&#39;m not a big alcohol fan. Â I probably drink on average less than three times a month, mostly with friends over dinner (in or out). Â Once in a while I just want to go to a bar and usually one close to my house. Â I have been into the bar at Grand Slam probably 10 times over several years and I have to say that although the crowd gets younger the later it gets, I have always found the service to be excellent and the patrons to be accepting of the older (mid forties) guy and his wife - and no - my wife and I are not generally the only &#34;older&#34; people there, but we are in the minority. Â <br><br>The jukebox always provides a new experience in music for us. Â Not dance and generally not hip/hop or rap. Â Sometimes a song I recognize, old or newer, is playing. Â Most often the music playing is some new fusion of head banging rock, punk and hard rock. Â What I like is that unlike most places you can easily hear the person talking to you on the other side of the table and your waitress. Â  <br><br>The shooting (which reviewer Ryan C. brought up) I read about I think was random. Â One of the too many that happen in Manchvegas on too regular a basis. Â Maybe I should move, but so long as I don&#39;t, I won&#39;t stop enjoying Elm Street, where it seems most of these shootings happen, nor will it keep me from occasionally dropping into the bar at Grand Slam Pizza. Â I have actually come to think of it as my neighborhood bar.",

"reviewcomment":"UPDATE:<br><br>Since my initial posting, I&#39;ve ordered takeout a few times from Hong Kong City (HKC) during lunch hours. <br><br>SUMMARY: This Chinese takeout place is order at the counter with open kitchen and a few hard booths for eating in. The menu offerings consist of the standard Chinese American dishes including Szechuan, Hunan and Cantonese dishes, most items under $10 and house specialties $9.75-$17.50. 25 Luncheon Specials ($5.50-$6.25) served with pork fried rice or white rice, add choice of one appetizer for $1.25 more, until 3PM except Sundays &amp; Holidays. 18 All Day Dinner Specials (entree &amp; appetizers-$8.50 each) served with pork fried rice or white rice.<br><br>The portions for the Lunch Specials are very generous portion, enough for 3-4 smaller meals. I enjoy ordering the L8 Szechuan Chicken ($5.50) which consists of chopped tender boneless chicken, celery, peppers, onions, carrots, peanuts in a light spicy sauce, slightly salty taste. The pork fried rice (dark color) is made fresh which has sauteed onions and small pieces of roast pork in soft rice. The chicken teriyaki and beef teriyaki sticks are now pretty good, which have plenty of marinated tender (slightly chewy) meat with a sweet flavor. I still order the L11 Pork Lo Mein ($5.50) which has the same ingredients as my previous post with carrots, onions, vegetables, preserved mushrooms, water chestnuts and tender roast pork strips tossed in soft noodles.<br><br>Overall, Hong Kong City still offers tasty Chinese food at pretty good prices.<br><br>DELIVERY: Minimum $20 order",

"reviewcomment":"I&#39;m going to come right out and admit it: I&#39;m a little biased. My cousin is the owner/head chef of WSB. BUT, I completely stand behind my 5 star rating. The establishment itself is quite small, with 6, maybe 7 tables. They just re-decorated the entire place, and it looks amazing. Insanely clean, nicely laid out, and overall very welcoming. <br><br>The food, you might ask? The food...oh LORD. Where do I start?? Appetizers seem appropriate. We got the onion rings and mozzarella balls, and my mother got a crock of french onion soup. The fried goods were delectable. Not greasy or soggy, and very well-seasoned. Â The mozzarella balls were accompanied by a charred tomato salad, which added a nice fresh note. Â All the meat eaters at the table had a turn at the soup, and all agreed that it was sinfully rich and delicious.<br><br>Next, the entrees. My parents both had the shortribs, and let me tell you they raved about them for days. Both of them are big eaters, and neither could finish the amount of food on the plate. Extremely generous portion of perfectly-cooked meat, veggies, and some noodles. Boyfriend got the braised beef sandwich. They set it out in front of him, and I do not think he spoke a word until he had eaten the entire thing. The fries were INCREDIBLE. I am a self-professed fry snob (read: total addict), and these were amazing. Crispy on the outside, tender inside, and not greasy or too dry. Gah. I would kill for some of those fries right now... I myself got the mac and cheese. Killer. Another huge portion of well-seasoned and appropriately cheesy (nothing worse than getting watery and unflavorful mac-- not to worry here!) and had a great little parmesan/cheddar crisp sitting on top of it, which added a fabulous texture to the whole dish. I literally inhaled the stuff. So yummy.<br><br>Things get even better with the price. I believe my plate of mac (and by plate, I mean a portion that could have probably fed two people and then some) was $6. Whaat? I know we&#39;re in NH, but still. The bill came to a very low amount for the sheer amount and extraordinary quality of the food.<br><br>So I&#39;m kind of pimping my cousin&#39;s restaurant out (hey, isn&#39;t that what family&#39;s for??), but I honestly would have Yelped this place if it wasn&#39;t his.

They have a wide variety of sub choices to satisfy any craving - haddock, chicken, steak, veal, etc. - in small, medium, or large sizes.

The prices are very reasonable and they give out discounts, and you also save 10% just by coming back and providing a receipt. When I&#39;ve eaten here at about 5 pm, it&#39;s never been crowded, so it&#39;s quiet and comfortable. The parking is super easy too as they&#39;re located in a complex right next to Gold&#39;s Gym.<br><br>The best thing I can say about this place is that they are SUPER fast.

"reviewcomment":"Good food, GREAT price! Â Definitely try their all day super specials. Â They mound the food in there for you, and it&#39;s definitely not a &#34;load it down with crappy fried rice and skimp on the good parts&#34; situation like a lot of other lower priced places I&#39;ve been. Â They go big on the entrees in the all day super specials. Â And it also helps that the pork fried rice that comes in most of the specials is actually really good, and loaded down with plenty of meat, unlike just about EVERY other Chinese place I&#39;ve been to in NH, including much higher priced places.<br><br>As another reviewer said, it&#39;s take out and delivery only, and run by a husband and wife team. Â Expect to wait a bit when it&#39;s super busy, around half an hour seems the norm when they&#39;re busy. Â The wait times aren&#39;t really an issue for me since I live right near the place. On nights when it&#39;s not so busy, I&#39;ve never waited more than 15 minutes, and the order has always been ready and in the bag when I get there.<br><br>Overall, this place is a great value. Â Unlike some less expensive Chinese places I&#39;ve eaten at in NH, the meat is really good here, without the occasional little bits of bone and tendon you&#39;d find at most cheap hole in the wall type places. Â I&#39;ve been there quite a few times now, and never been grossed out at the quality of the meat, unlike most cheap Chinese places I&#39;ve been to.<br><br>My only real complaint is that the all day super specials are pretty limited as far as entrees go, and they don&#39;t sell soup in the tall, large containers you would usually find at other places for $4-6, but rather only in smaller containers for $2.50 (I&#39;m the type who will drop in and get just a large soup for dinner or lunch). Â Although I DID get one of the tall containers when I ordered egg drop soup, and it was still just $2.50, so I don&#39;t know if that was a fluke or what. Â That said, they&#39;re open until 10 or 11pm depending on the night, which is nice, as well as around lunch time.<br><br>Definitely give this place a shot if you&#39;re looking for something inexpensive and tasty.",

"reviewcomment":"The Stage Door Restaurant &amp; Bar opened in the former Penuches Grill on Hanover Street, next door to Ignite Bar &amp; Grill. <br><br>Like its predecessor, the atmosphere inside is pretty much the same as before with the old classic bar saloon atmosphere which has a pool table, darts, digital jukebox, performer area, and three TVs mounted near the bar. There&#39;s seating at bar counter (with high seating-not suitable for big folks) at one end of the place and high top tables with seating at the other end.<br><br>They offer 18 draft beers and several bottled beers, as well as a full bar serving mixed drinks and margaritas. The food menu is typical pub fare including fried appetizers, sandwiches, burgers, hot dogs, chili, and salads. The prices here are reasonable, most items are under $10, nachos are $10.99. <br><br>Several specials are offered here including daily Happy Hour (3PM-6PM) when select draft beers are $3 and appetizers are $5 each. On Sundays and during Boston sports games, select draft beers are $2. <br><br>After walking around Manchester for much of the day, I needed to chill and decided to stop in at Stage Door for Happy Hour. The place was pretty empty around 5:40PM on a Wednesday night. I took a seat up at the bar and started out with a $3 Coors Light pint on draft, very refreshing! I also ordered two $5 appetizers, 6 Buffalo Chicken Tenders with Bleu Cheese Dip (normally $6.50) and Chili Cheese Fries (normally $7.00). The bartender literally had to type &amp; spell out what I had ordered on the glass screen of the digital dining register. <br><br>The 6 Buffalo Chicken Tenders served on a silver plate were good sized tenders, lightly breaded boneless white meat chicken, which had a very spicy flavor, just the way I like it. <br><br>Next, the HUGE platter of Cheese Fries arrived, which were a big pile of fresh hand cut fries topped with lots of melted cheese and chunks of tender chicken breast, not there was no chili?? I asked the bartender about the missing chili for the fries and she went back to the kitchen and arrived with a very basic bowl of chili (ground beef &amp; beans). The printed slip in the kitchen was apparently incorrect, though I saw the order typed correctly on the register. The chili cheese fries were very filling and had a soft potatoey texture (could be crispier). I barely made a dent in the pile and asked for a takeout box. I will be chipping away at the chili cheese fries for the next few days. <br><br>The service here was good and the food was typical for pub style fare. I do wish they offered fried pickles on the menu, which was served at Penuche&#39;s (New Cheese) Grill. I would probably order the Buffalo Chicken Tenders again, but I would also like to try their Haddock Sandwich next time with a cold draft beer.",

The waitresses were pleasant and conversational, but not *overly* talkative even though it can be slow. Â They give you enough space to enjoy your meal, but still make sure your drinks are replenished without having to ask. Â <br><br>The decor is very Mom &amp; Pop&#39;s, homey, and warm. Â Flowers and small lights around the windows... The seating is comfy (booths and tables), very good feng shui table arrangement, and the bathrooms are VERY CLEAN (which means a lot to me). Â This restaurant seems to be very well cared for.<br><br>I only take off one star because I would have liked more options with the platters... fries or... (pause) rice....? Â Hmm... I&#39;m sure I could have finagled a steamed veggie substitution somehow if I put enough thought into it...<br><br>Overall, great place, great service, yummy food, good drinks!

Â This seems simple, but its strikingly hard to find a good salad at the pizza joints around Manchester. Â <br>3. The guy running the place is very friendly and accommodating.

The fried rice must be done well.<br><br>Service: The staff is very nice and attentive and the restaurant is nice and clean with great ambiance.",

"reviewcomment":"I wanted to like the India Cuisine Restaurant. There were a few things I really liked, sadly there were many more things I did not like. <br><br>I&#39;ll start with my ordering for pick-up over the phone. Â It took 7 minutes to order 4 items. Halfway through the call the man told me he&#39;s sorry he&#39;s just learning English. This made me feel immediately better as I went from thinking he was rude to feeling compassion for trying to take an order in a language that&#39;s new to you. Â <br><br>They were very kind when I walked in to pick up my order. I almost felt like a family member walking in given their warm welcoming. The restaurant still looks like the old pizza shop that was there prior to their opening. There was also a sign that they are CASH ONLY temporally despite the menu stating they accept credit cards. Â Luckily, this was one of the extremely rare occasions I actually had cash on me. <br><br>The Mixed Vegetable Appetizer was fantastic, including the tamarind and mint chutney! If I actually go back, it would be for this appetizer again. <br><br>I ordered 2 naans and got one. That one I got, garlic naan, was not good. By not good I mean it was hard as a rock and had no butter on the top which made it as Â dry as can be. <br><br>I ordered the Chicken Malabar Murg Curry very spicy and I actually received two entrees, Chicken Saag and Chicken Vindaloo, neither of which I ordered nor either being spicy at all. I&#39;ve had Saag and Vindaloo many times before at many other Indian restaurants. I would never intentionally order either of these items from this restaurant despite actually not ordering them this time around. The sauces were extremely watery and thin. There wasn&#39;t a lot of developed flavor to the sauces as Indian cuisine is known and respected for. I suspect that the sauces were made in the microwave actually. Furthermore, the basmati rice was cold and flavorless. Â The only positive of both the dishes was that the chicken was very flavorful. I had plenty of chicken in both my orders unlike another reviewer. <br><br>As much as I want to like them, I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll return again for anything other than the appetizers unless I see positive reviews suggesting the food has improved. I would recommend ordering in the restaurant where you can point to what you want instead of getting whatever they think you asked for if you do choose to try them.",

"reviewcomment":"Stopped here with my mother after a visit to Elliot Hospital. Â I wanted something close but also something with some YELP referrals, plus I am doing my best not to eat at chain restaurants anymore.<br><br>Both my mother and I were very pleased with Pindos. Â The food was just fine, nothing fancy but satisfying, hot, and nicely presented. Â My mom had a cup of beef vegetable soup that I&#39;m sure was home made. Â Very thick and rich, lots of vegies, and steaming hot. Â And no skimping on the saltines. Â We both chose the fried chicken sandwich based on another review. Â It was indeed a simple breaded chicken patty like you would get frozen at the supermarket. Â You can&#39;t really go wrong with one of those, especially if the person frying goes light on the grease, which they did here. Â A nice fresh slice of tomato, crisp lettuce, mayo, and a very soft and fresh roll. Â This is not haute cuisine, but the sandwich was $2.50. Â Yes, $2.50! Â I ordered a side of fries, and they were delicious, very fresh and again fried just right without a lot of grease. Â I had tea, Mom had coffee, which she said was unfortunately, &#34;not the best.&#34; Â You know, the Greeks don&#39;t much like their coffee the same way Europeans like their coffee, and I hate coffee, so I&#39;ll reserve judgement on that beverage. Â Anyway, so the whole meal comes to $11. Â This is a very nice, clean place, easy to park, friendly and attentive waitress (owner?) and the bathroom was spotless. Â I can see myself going there alone quite a bit because they had a very inviting counter that snaked around the whole front room. Â You walk in the door and the place looks probably not one bit different than it did 30 years ago. Â But in a good way, like a welcome back we&#39;re glad to see you way. Â I can recommend this as a very nice little local diner.",

I like to be able to taste the sub fillings, which may prompt to get the wrap next time.

Â <br><br>Anyway, I was in the middle of a crazy long road trip, so I went inside to stretch my legs rather than using the drive-through. Â The people behind the counter were very friendly. Â Unfortunately, they insisted that they had given me a chicken *wrap*, despite the fact that I could see them putting it in the bag, and it looked exactly like a chicken sandwich. Â When I explained that the item in the bag was round (sandwich) not square/rectangle (wrap), they acted like I was completely crazy. Â I finally gave up and left, thinking that maybe Wendy&#39;s makes fancy round chicken wraps. Â <br><br>They don&#39;t. Â It was a chicken sandwich, which is exactly what I thought, because a sandwich is on a bun and a wrap is on a tortilla. Â So maybe, in the future, when a customer says the order is wrong, instead of swearing up and down you don&#39;t know what they&#39;re talking about, you could check.<br><br>P.S. Â Not sure the sandwich was &#34;Caesar&#34; either, unless &#34;Caesar&#34; means &#34;breaded chicken with lettuce and mayo. Â It was tasty enough, but not what I wanted, and I didn&#39;t have time to argue all day. Â <br><br>P.P.S. Â Their &#34;medium&#34; iced coffee was freaking huge. Â I was a little afraid to ask the size of the large. Â It was pretty good though, and I needed the caffeine. Â Just - if you order a medium, realize that it&#39;s about the same size as a Dunkin Donuts/McDonald&#39;s large.",

"reviewcomment":"My buddies and I sometimes call Domino&#39;s Pizza for delivery on our gaming nights. This location is open late until 2AM on Friday and Saturday nights, 1AM on Monday-Thursday nights, and 12 AM on Sunday nights. The food usually arrives at our door in about 45-60 minutes on busy nights from the time we call in the order. We&#39;re so occupied with the intense gaming on the big TV that time flies by fast.<br><br>The Domino&#39;s classic hand tossed pizza has a thick doughy crust with a sweet taste with the right amount of sauce &amp; cheese, a bit skimpy on the toppings. We enjoy some Cheesy Bread and Cinna Stix with our pizzas. We keep enough frosty beverages on hand to wash down the food.",

Somehow she charged me for something else and I had to pay an extra dollar. A dollar increase for a fast food meal is a drastic difference from a gourmet restaurant. I couldn&#39;t even complain about this wrong order because the line was so long from their slow service.",

"reviewcomment":"While Ian&#39;s review is dead on, I love this diner so much that I feel obligated to write one of my own.<br><br>The key to Cote&#39;s (and any good diner) is simplicity. The layout is simple; the menu is simple; the food is simple. <br><br>Yes, you could probably make everything they have in your own kitchen, but the food is incredibly cheap (as it should be - we&#39;re talking eggs, bacon, and pancakes here!), and the service has always been good to excellent. It&#39;s perfect for a cold, lazy, Sunday morning.<br><br>A couple notes - <br><br>1) Bring cash! No credit cards accepted (as of mid 2010)<br><br>2) There&#39;s a very small lot (4-5 cars) right behind the diner, but you&#39;ll probably have to use street parking on Laurier St. (the right fork where Mast Rd. and Kelley St. intersect)",

"reviewcomment":"On my way downtown, I made a lunch stop at The Front Anchor located at the pointy corner of Massabesic Street and Hall Street. The place was pretty quiet around 1:45 PM on a Friday afternoon. It&#39;s an order at the counter type of place and parts of the dining area looked cluttered with newspapers and kids toys, almost like I being at my former boss&#39;s pad, so I was definitely getting the food to go. The menu offers seafood, pizza, calzones, pasta, salads, subs, burgers, sandwiches, chicken, gyros, appetizers, and drinks from the cooler. The prices are reasonable, most dinners priced $5.50 (spaghetti with bread) to $15.95 (fried seafood platter of haddock, bay scallops, baby shrmp, clam strips with fries &amp; cole slaw).<br><br>I had printed a coupon off their website (<a href='/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.TheFrontAnchor.com&amp;s=25b28072f0bd134791a104cd01d174b3a5a17a342842f25eff1e880e160b032f' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>TheFrontAnchor.com</a>) for a $5.95 Lunch Special (choices of fish &amp; chips, bay scallops/fries, baby shrimp/fries, or chicken tenders/fries). I ordered the Bay Scallops with Fries. While the guy was cooking my food, his mobile went off and had a cool ringtone with a joint that goes: Smack that all on the floor, smack that give me some more,......&#34; Akon rules!<br><br>The food was ready in about 8 minutes after ordering and I was given a good portion of lightly breaded &amp; fried bay scallops (juicy)and lightly fried fries, seasoned with pepper. While heading downtown, I ate my lunch at each red light I hit along Lake Street and Elm Street.<br><br>Lets&#39;s just say I had some greasy &#34;finger smackin&#39;&#34; good scallops and fries for under $7, smack that!<br><br>For now 3.4, STARS.",

"reviewcomment":"This cozy diner is located off the beaten path in a small strip plaza. I&#39;ve driven by here several times during the afternoon, but the diner was closed each time. Andre&#39;s Diner serves breakfast only until 11AM. <br><br>This place is owned and operated by a friendly woman, who does the short order cooking in the kitchen and serves the customers too. This diner has a cozy feel with a few tables and booths and a small C shaped lunch counter and a good sized kitchen area and grill. The walls are painted futia and sea green colors. <br><br>The menu offers the typical breakfast dishes including 18 kinds of omelettes on the menu and breakfast specials are offered as well. The prices are pretty reasonable, most omelettes priced $5-$7, served with pan fries and toast.<br><br>I finally dined here for the first time this morning on my way to work. I needed to have a good breakfast, but enjoy it very quickly since I had a long day ahead. There were a few customers already here including a group of City Highway Dept. workers. That&#39;s a good sign the food has to be pretty good.<br><br>I sat up at the counter for prompt service. I was offered coffee ($1.50) which was good and on the strong side. I ordered the top Breakfast Special ($4), which included 2 eggs any style, pan fries or beans, bacon, and toast. I watched my food being cooked to order on grill. The breakfast was solid good and very tasty. The pan fries (fresh cut grilled potatoes) were crispy and browned outside and soft inside. The folded scrambled eggs were soft and fluffy and I put some hot sauce on it for some kick. The bacon strips were crispy, just the way I specified. The wheat toast was already buttered. <br><br>The service was pretty good and quick. I was offered more coffee, but I needed to boogie and quickly settled up on the tab, $6 even with tax, before tip. In and out in 15 minutes!<br><br>I&#39;ll definitely be returning to Andre&#39;s Diner for the good breakfast, but I&#39;ll try to stop in here on my day off.<br><br>HOURS: Mon-Fri: 5:30AM-11AM; Sat: 6AM-11AM; Sun: CLOSED",

"reviewcomment":"NOTE: The place is now Venice Old Style Pizza.<br><br>I was visiting some friends in NW Manchester in the &#34;condo ghetto&#34; near Hackett Hill. The only pizza place in the area was the &#34;Big Cheese&#34; which is no more as of last year. So Bernie &amp; Bill&#39;s on Front Street near Dunbarton Rd was the next closest pizza place to call on. According to their menu, they offer MILD or SPICY SAUCE on their pizzas, pasta dinners, and selected Italian style subs. The menu also offers salads, hot &amp; cold subs, sandwiches, gyros, wings, and appetizers. We ordered a large Sausage Pizza (14&#34;-$10.45) with spicy sauce and some 9&#34; Steak &amp; Cheese New Mexico subs ($6.75 each). The food was ready for pickup as promised in 20 minutes.<br><br>The large pizza pie (close to NY style) had a thin chewy crust with the right amount of sauce, cheese, and sausage chunks, folding the greasy slice, BUT the sauce was NOT SPICY and tasted like a typical MILD pizza sauce. Maybe they forgot, but I specifically ordered it SPICY. The pizza was still good tasting. The Steak &amp; Cheese New Mexico subs were pretty good, which had shaved steak, provolone cheese, onions, and green hot chile peppers served on a thick and chewy baked Artisan sub roll. Overall, a good little basic pizza place for delivery or takeout. Hopefully next time, we&#39;ll get some spicy sauce.<br><br>NOTE: Takeout and delivery only, no seating. The parking lot is very tight, no more than four spaces, in and out is the modus here.",

"reviewcomment":"I had breakfast at Double B&#39;s Diner, which opened recently in the former Alperini&#39;s space at 157 Amory Street. This small building has been home to several eateries in recent years which have opened and closed for short stints.<br><br>Double B&#39;s Diner started out as Barb&#39;s Coffee Plus, which was a small shop specializing in K-cups sales, originally located on Mast Road in Pinardville. I can recall several months ago driving through Pinardville and I needed some caffeine. I spotted Barb&#39;s Coffee Plus and was actually waved into the parking lot by an employee. I ended up choosing a single Green Mountain Breakfast Blend K-Cup and brewing my drink onsite for $1. My caffeine fix was met that cold winter day. However, I was thinking to myself if this shop was going to survive on just selling K-cups only (need a food menu too?) since there are several other places in the area also selling K-cups at comparable prices. Fast forward, Double B&#39;s Diner is now here selling K-cups and serving breakfast, lunch, and dinner in a comfortable cozy atmosphere. <br><br>The menu is fairly streamlined which includes the typical breakfast dishes including eggs, omelets, breakfast sandwiches, pancakes, French toast, hash, and Green Mountain Coffee, plus salads, burgers, hot dogs, subs, salads, fries, steak tips, homemade chicken tenders, and homemade onion rings. The prices here are reasonable here, menu prices under $10. As for the K-cups (sales), the prices are $0.75 for a single K-cup and $14.99 for 24 K-cups. They also serve Gifford&#39;s Ice Cream and have a takeout window.<br><br>I arrived here for breakfast during mid-morning on a Saturday. The place was pretty quiet upon arrival and I took a seat at an open table. Barb (owner) was not here since she had a family emergency to tend to. Her business partner was running the dining room and kitchen solo. I was offered coffee ($1.25) as I took a seat. The coffee was brewed just right, just what I needed to start my day. The cozy dining room looked very inviting with painted yellow walls, coffee mug prints, wood floor, shiny painted tables (olive color) and sturdy wooden chairs.<br><br>I ordered a Western Omelet ($5.95) with pan fries and wheat toast. The food was cooked to order and served to my table in about 10 minutes. The omelet was a good sized, a thin folded egg filled with chunks of honey ham, green peppers, onions, and cheese. The pan fries were chunks of red skin potatoes, grilled and seasoned with onions. The wheat toast was buttered. Â The business partner came out to the dining room to speak with me and this was her first time cooking breakfast here since Barb was usually the regular cook here. The breakfast food was very good, very tasty and filling, so very nice job! I was also offered refills on the coffee, which I accepted.<br><br>I will have to return to Double B&#39;s Diner for the homemade chicken tenders and onion rings, which was highly recommended by other diners.",

"reviewcomment":"A small joint tucked away in the corner of one of Machester&#39;s many strip malls. The exterior is deceiving, once inside this place offers a wonderful atmosphere and great food, coupled with a good beer selection. The burgers are the centerpiece here. Many versions are available, and they come out juicy with just the right bit of crunch. They are also open for breakfast, and offer many variations not necessarily offered elsewhere in the Queen City. I would suggest this for a local favorite, or a good place to host a gathering of friends or colleagues.",

"reviewcomment":"All Seasons Pizza &amp; Fried Chicken opened up recently in the former Paisano&#39;s Pizza/Manos Pizza/Dat Hing Restaurant space near the intersection of Mast Rd &amp; Pinard St in Pinardville.<br><br>Like before, the place is an order at the counter place with inside seating. The menu offerings include traditional and gourmet thin crust pizzas (12&#34; &amp; 16&#34;), subs, salads, pasta, appetizers, fried chicken, and a few Indian dishes (chicken tikka, mo:mo, chicken biryani). They also serve cold Pepsi products and have mango lassis too! The prices here seem reasonable, most subs $5.75-$6.99, large &#34;danger zone&#34; specialty subs $8.99 and pizzas $6.99 (sm chz) to $14.99 (lg specialty). Coupon specials are offered on the printed menu.<br><br>I stopped in here recently on a rainy Tuesday evening. I decided on the Large 16&#34; Cheese Pizza Special for $5.99 plus tax. There was Indian music playing over the speakers as I dried off from the rain outside. The pizza was all set in less than 15 minutes. I enjoyed a slice fresh out of the oven. The thin crust was crispy on the bottom baked with ground flour, soft texture inside and topped with plenty of tomato sauce (slightly sweet flavor) and melted Grande mozzarella cheese. The pizza was very good, similar to its predecessors at this location. <br><br>I really hope this new pizza place in does well at this Pinardville location this time.<br><br>FREE DELIVERY ($10 min - limited area only)",

The place was empty around 1PM and it&#39;s a very cozy bar &amp; lounge with dim lighting, comfortable velvet seating, and seating at the bar offering bottled beer and other drinks. The kitchen is in the back and the older Bosnian woman owner runs the place.<br><br>OWNER: May I help you?<br><br>ME: Yeah, can I see a menu please?<br><br>The Owner gives me a plastic menu (in English on one side &amp; in Bosnian on the other side) which is very simple and (23 items) offers pizza (smoked beef, turkey ham, cheese, mushroom), Bosnian food (grilled meats, sausage sandwiches, burgers, veal steak, veal shish kabobs), Bosnian pie (meat &amp; cheese), salads, cake &amp; fruit salad. The prices range from $3 (salad) to $20 (Grilled Meat Samples).<br><br>ME: Can I get a pizza?<br><br>OWNER: We don&#39;t have pizza!<br><br>I looked puzzled and I would&#39;ve expected to find pizza here since the business has the name &#34;Pizza&#34; in it and there was pizza on the menu.<br><br>ME: What do you have?<br><br>OWNER: We make Bosnia food.<br><br>ME: How about a sandwich?<br><br>OWNER: I make you a small Bosnian sausage sandwich, 5 dollars.<br><br>ME: I&#39;ll have that!<br><br>The Owner goes back to the kitchen to grill the sausages and bread, which takes about 7 minutes to be ready. I leave 5 dollars and grab the food!<br><br>ME: Thank you very much!<br><br>I hurry out because I see the City Parking Robot was outside checking vehicles and I had less than one minute left on my parking slip and I just made it out to my ride in time! Â My car was reeking of onions by the time I got back to the office. The Small Bosnian Sausage Sandwich was pretty good which had small chewy &amp; spicy &amp; salty link sausages (similar to brown &amp; serve) on soft grilled flatbread with sides of mayo &amp; raw onions. I&#39;ll keep the Maccao in mind when my group goes out drinking. Bottled beers are $3 here and would go well with Bosnian food.",

"reviewcomment":"This is your standard issue Subway. There are some perks: a few customer specific parking spots, usually a fast turnaround due to its location, and it&#39;s clean. The service is a mixed bag. They are usually very friendly, but in the 20ish times I have been there, at least a fourth of my orders have been wrongly charged in some way. <br><br>The sandwiches are like any other Subway. I wish they would be a little less skimpy on the fillings but I&#39;m guessing that is more a corporate/managerial choice.<br><br>This branch does not seem to promote a lot of Subways better promotions, and I would stick to the one on Elm Street if you need a local Subway to honor the better &#34;commercial&#34; deals.<br><br>Solid enough Subway, good in a pinch, but with the number of quality surrounding options it can be hard to justify.<br><br>Edit: OK, bringing it down to two stars, regretfully. In addition to the promotions (they do usually honor the monthly $5 footlong, but other ones are tough to judge), there was another ordering snafu yesterday. It was a mutual error (I should have specified the length, they should have asked), but it&#39;s probably the fourth or fifth time something has gone wrong. Have to edge towards the other side of 2.5. Â On the other hand, I can honestly say that the staff is friendly, so that puts them well above some other places. I&#39;ll still be going there, as it&#39;s way too convenient for me.",

"reviewcomment":"We went to Chandler&#39;s Grille &amp; Bar a couple weeks ago for dinner, which is located in the Chandler Building at the corner of Elm St and Bridge St. This restaurant/bar was formerly The Chambeaux, which had good pub food, 3 bars including a back bar area with a HUGE TV where we used to play Rock Band with other patrons.<br><br>At the time of this review, the place was being partially renovated with the front bars closed, so the back bar area was open for dinner and drinks, no more HUGE TV though, just normal HDTVs. We were greeted as we headed to the back and sat at a high top table. There&#39;s also an outside patio area along the Bridge Street side.<br><br>The menu offers American cuisine and pub fare including steaks, seafood, chicken, pasta, salads, sandwiches, and appetizers at moderate prices. <br><br>We started out with Buffalo Style Chicken Rangoons, which were very tasty, shredded spiced chicken stuffed in deep fried wonton wrappers served over greens with a creamy dipping sauce. For dinner, my friend enjoyed the Grilled Salmon with over roasted vegetables. I had the Meatloaf over mashed potatoes and topped with crispy asparagus tempura, a nice touch. The meatloaf with gravy was very moist with good flavors and the mashed potatoes were very good. For dessert, I had the Creme Brulee with fresh strawberry slices/drizzle, which was light, creamy and refreshing, a nice ending to a very good dinner.<br><br>The service was very attentive since our waitress/bartender was close by. We received our drinks and food in a timely manner and I got a complementary refill on Diet Coke without asking.<br><br>LUNCH: Thurs-Fri<br>DINNER: Tues-Sat<br><br>LIVE ENTERTAINMENT: Fridays and Saturdays",

DJ&#39;s Deli &amp; Subs (owned by DJ Dave) serves up hot &amp; cold subs (8&#34;&amp;12&#34;) and wraps, sandwiches, breakfast sandwiches/subs (served anytime), salads, appetizers (wings, rings, tenders, fries, wedges, mozz sticks, bread sticks), Ms. Vickie&#39;s bagged chips and Pepsi products. Lobster rolls are offered when in season (warmer months). There is seating in front of the order counter. <br><br>I was in here this week to grab some lunch and was greeted by the owner as I was deciding what to have. I got a 12&#34; Steak &amp; Cheese Sub ($7.50 plus tax) and a Large Seasoned Fries ($3.50 plus tax) to go. The total came out to $11.88 with tax and at first I was skeptical at what I was going to get, since the price was comparable to a sit down place. A younger worker took care of my order. While I was waiting, the owner was discussing menu printing options (prices were updated recently) and advertising ideas with a sales rep, interesting part of running a small business.<br><br>Anyway, the Steak &amp; Cheese Sub was very good, which had hand sliced /grilled cube steak (no grizzle &amp; not greasy) and lots of melted cheese on a soft and chewy sub roll. The very generous amount of Seasoned Fries (crinkle cut) was fried golden brown to perfection and I really didn&#39;t need the ketchup, since the fries were done right and tasty. I ate half of the fries on the way back to the East Side office.<br><br>Definitely worth checking out if you happen to be in West Manchester!<br><br>CLOSED on MONDAYS.",

"reviewcomment":"Shorty&#39;s Mexican Roadhouse is a very solid Tex-Mex restaurant. Â Many people are searching for &#34;authentic Mexican.&#34; Â Well, having spent a lot of time in Mexico, I am pretty sure you cannot find authentic Mexican...but you can find authentic Tex-Mex...a cuisine unto itself and quite good!<br><br>Shorty&#39;s extends the Tex-Mex a bit. Â They add BBQ pork to some of their dishes, in addition to the typical Chicken, Steak, Beef. Â This makes them a bit different, in a good way.<br><br>My wife and I have been there a few times now and have basically enjoyed it each time. Â Service has always been rock-solid, nothing super great...but there when you need them, food served fast and refills on drinks as necessary. Â One small quibble with the service...you have to ask for them to bring out chips and salsa...most Tex-Mex places just go ahead and bring them out...I am sure this is a restaurant policy and not the servers.<br><br>Food...on one visit, I tried one of their specials a Chorizo Taco (not sure of the &#34;official&#34; name). Â While definitely ok, this could have used a bit of balance in its flavors, it simply rocked the Chorizo flavor with no cooling counterbalance to make it a truly great dish. Â Another visit saw the Hawaii 5-0 Quesadilla...Chicken, Ham, Pineapple, Cheese all with the BBQ sauce. Â Very good...but excellent when some of the house salsa is added!<br><br>My wife has gotten stuck on their BBQ Pork Chimichanga. Â She loves chimi&#39;s and she loves BBQ pork...so this is right up her alley. Â This is served with the typical refried beans and rice. Â The beans are ok, sometimes a bit bland and the rice, well it is typical rice.<br><br>On our last visit...and the reason for three stars as opposed to four...they gave us a list of specials for Sept 29 - Oct 6. Â As I like to go for specials, I decided to order one of the dishes. Â When I ordered, the waitress said...&#34;oh, I do not think we have that as a special, let me check with the kitchen.&#34; Â When she came back, sure enough, they could not serve it. Â Oh, did I mention that this was on Oct 1? Â It disappointed me to have to move to something else. Â Do not offer it and then not have it!<br><br>All in all, my wife and I will be making this a regular stop...particularly when they reopen their Bedford location.",

The place has a few tables for dining in.<br><br>I stopped in here twice recently. On my first visit, I picked up a package of sugar cookies to snack on at work. However, the cookies were extremely hard and tough to eat. On my recent visit, I stopped in here for some lunch takeout and decided to order to try the $5.99 Buffet. I got the Beef Stew, with rice, beans, and a lettuce salad with pico de gallo, which was a good sized portion of food dished out into the styrofoam takeout container. The Beef Stew was very good with great flavors and had big chunks of Â very tender and soft slow cooked beef, carrots, potatoes in a spicy sauce. The short grain Mexican rice was decent and cooked just right. The red beans were cooked firm, not mushy.<br><br>Overall, the hot lunch I had, though not fancy, tasted pretty good and was filling! As for the baked goods, I&#39;d skip the packaged cookies next time, and get a slice of frosted cake or a danish instead.",

"reviewcomment":"This is the second Nepali restaurant in Manchester, and is much more casual than Cafe Momo. Specials are written on the board in the window, and prices are very reasonable. There are a few small tables in the restaurant, but it&#39;s much more of a takeout restaurant than a sit-down. Â I tried the chicken momos, which were delicious. They were served with two types of achar and both were good (and really spicy). One of the owners was at the restaurant while I was waiting for takeout, and she sat down and chatted with me for a few minutes. Both she and the woman cooking were very pleasant and accommodating. I&#39;m not sure of the exact hours of operation, but I went on a Tuesday around noon. They weren&#39;t open when I tried to go on a Saturday. Also not sure if cards are accepted yet.",

"reviewcomment":"I&#39;ve visited city cafe twice and have had their chai latte and cappuccino. Â The service is great and the people working at the cafe are super friendly. Â My chai latte was a bit too hot too my liking, and I wasn&#39;t a huge fan of the chai they offer. Â  I would get the cappuccino again. Â They also have assorted muffins and other baked goodies. Â <br><br>Love this cafe&#39;s focus on non-profits. Â Knowing that the cafe was associated with a church, I was concerned that there would be a lot of church pamphlets laying around- not the case at all. Â I think there was one small reference to the church in the entire store and this seemed appropriate. Â I will frequent this cafe when I&#39;m in the area, just for their admirable business plan, good service, and comfortable atmosphere.",

Â Colleague had the fish and chips and was well received. <br><br>Afraid I didn&#39;t try the beers but had a wide range or lagers and beers.<br><br>Nice atmosphere in impressive 17th Century building, lots of seating and good outside patio area.<br><br>I will be back to sample other things on the menu!",

"reviewcomment":"There are two things that make me very happy. One would be excellent dining outside of the city centre. A few outstanding places would have to include The Church Green, Aumbry, Nutter&#39;s and Grenache, in my humble opinion. These are surely some of the finest modern British in the country, never mind the North West, but they are few and far between. The other joy in life is a great curry. Not a Westernized version of the cuisine from the subcontinent, but authentic, regional specialities from the familiar Punjab to the lesser-known Chettinad, Mangalore and Pondicherry states.<br><br>So you can image my glee when I dined at a little gem of an Indian restaurant in Altrincham. Just outside the Metrolink station, good ol&#39; Alti almost appears to be a ghost town, with closed shops on Stamford New Road and what seems to be a permanent state of construction going on. But if you stroll up the road just a bit, the town centre springs back to life and has a bevy of marvellous independent shops and restaurants. And here is where you will find Dilli.<br><br>I was impressed with the reviews I read from the Dilli website, and who wrote them:<br><br>&#34;The menu reads well, ingredients are fresh, and the sauces have depth and complexity ... I left Dilli very happy indeed&#34; <br>Jay Rayner: The Observer <br><br>&#34;The interesting menu has a lot to entice ... vegetarians get a huge choice ... breads deserve a special mention ... there&#39;s plenty to enjoy ... a buzzing atmosphere.&#34; <br>The Times <br><br>&#34;The tastiest Indian food I&#39;ve eaten since I was in Bombay.&#34; <br>Neil Sowerby: Manchester Evening News <br><br>&#34;Quality ingredients ... totally authentic Indian dishes&#34; <br>The Michelin Guide <br><br>&#34;Top-notch ... a notably popular haunt ... in an area awash with restaurants, it stands out for the quality and authenticity of its food.&#34; <br>Harden&#39;s Guide<br><br>As you enter through the curtains, your nose is teased with the aroma of lush and exotic spices. The restaurant itself is small but perfectly formed...cozy tables with the right amount of space between them so you aren&#39;t rubbing elbows with your neighbouring diners. Sure, it&#39;s not tricked-out like most of the new city centre joints, but I think it adds to its considerable charm. Besides, I much prefer when the focus is the food, not trendy dÃ©cor.<br><br>The restaurant manager, Pankaj, warmly greeted us and we were sat in a little corner booth. As I was with friends who have frequented the restaurant, I left it to them to decide what we should order. But after struggling with this monumental decision, we let Pankaj select dishes for us. He kindly asked about our ability to handle &#39;the heat&#39;. Being cursed with Irish taste buds, I&#39;m fairly wimpy when it comes to vindaloo-strength dishes. But everyone&#39;s heat-tolerant palates were catered to.<br><br>I found out why such acclaim has been heaped on the restaurant by prominent foodies as soon as I sampled our dishes of Achari Tangari Kebabs (chicken drumsticks marinated overnight in pickled spice mix, then cooked in a tandoor Â£6.95) Lamb Chop Adraki (prime trimmed lamb chops steeped in ginger flavoured marinade and cooked in a tandoor Â£7.95) Boti Kebab (boneless lamb pieces marinated overnight in chef special spices and cooked in tandoor Â£7.95) Tanoodri Prawn (saffron flavoured prawns marinated and cooked in tandoor Â£7.95) Lal Chicken Tikka (tender chicken marinated in Degi chillies yoghurt and tandoori spices Â£6.95). There was also Kali Mirchi Ke Mushroom (mushrooms with dry roasted spices and fresh coriander and lemon juice Â£5.85), which I was forewarned might be too spicy for such a delicate flower as myself. <br>What a joy it was to experience this food. There was layer upon layer of flavour and depth to each succulent dish. The fresh garlic and cheesy naan breads are made onsite by Pathak in a tandoor, and the delicate Jeera Pillau rice was superb; both can also serve as eating utensils (an authentic means of Panjub dining as demonstrated by the dapper Graham). All served by a friendly, helpful and attentive team. <br><br>If you haven&#39;t been to Dilli before, or if you haven&#39;t visited for a while, I highly recommend taking yourself, your friends, your family, your co-workers, your neighbour, your hair dresser or anyone else who loves enchanting Indian cuisine to Dilli. It is open for lunch and dinner, or you can take a cooking class. Find out more by contacting the Dilli team or dropping in.<br><br>.",

"reviewcomment":"I remember watching a &#39;Fast Food Kitchens: Exposed&#39; ITV special which focused on a branch of Chicken Cottage. I can&#39;t really remember what exactly was being exposed but it had something to do with the staff all picking their noses and not washing their hands and leaving bleach in the fridge with the uncooked chicken. That always put me off Chicken Cottage as a franchise. The branch on that programme was in Croydon, I would like to point out that actually this branch of Chicken Cottage is actually clean and the staff kept their hands in front of them at all times so there was definitely no funny business but my point remains, I had been put off coming to Chicken Cottage by the documentary. And the name, actually. I know it&#39;s trying to evoke an idea of &#39;chicken cottage - like pizza hut but with chicken&#39; - but really it just makes me think of thatched rural housing and/or an act of public indecency neither of which fill me with any feelings of hunger.<br><br>All that said I did venture into Chicken Cottage and was not unimpressed with what I received therein. I had a chicken fillet burger box meal (rather similar actually to the sort of box meals offered by KFC - do we think this was the point?) which included beans, fries and a piece of chicken for under Â£5 which is pretty good (there are better offers to be had in the fried chicken shops of curry mile but still, not bad). It didn&#39;t taste awful at all, although as Alfie points out the chips were soggier than my rained-in heart. Still, I liked that they had caricatures of famous people on the walls and that you go a dispensed drink rather than a can. It felt a bit like being at McDonalds which is about as close as I&#39;m going to get to home for a few weeks.",

"reviewcomment":"A maze of towering glass structures, impossibly clean concrete, angular slabs, chain restaurants and coffee shops and a grassy mound where one can watch sport on a giant screen in summer or an ice rink, winter bar and miniature markets for the festive period. Welcome to Spinningfields. Meet me there indeed, as the slogan consistently tells us.<br><br>This riverside community has become known as Manchester&#39;s Canary Wharf. Located here are banks such as RBS, Natwest and HSBC, the newspaper Manchester Evening News, a branch of Deloitte, all of which have offices above where the 9-5ers toil away. When they become overwhelmed with hunger there&#39;s a Pret and an Eat waiting for them to yoink sandwiches and coffees from, or if they want a sit-down meal they&#39;ve got Nando&#39;s, Carluccio&#39;s, Gourmet Burger, Giraffe, Strada et al in residence. For an after work drink there&#39;s the likes of CafÃ© Rouge and Ha Ha, and the patios overlooking the Irwell offer a great unwinding sun spot.<br><br>But Spinningfields isn&#39;t all about the suits. It&#39;s rapidly making a name for itself as a bit of an entertainment destination. Take the seasonal joys, like the cinema screen with its accompanying shack of a Giraffe bar, complete with deckchairs, or when it&#39;s frozen solid, there&#39;s mulled wine and hot donuts to be had at its very own Winter Wonderland. It boasts one of the greatest Japanese restaurants in Manchester, Samsi, right on the corner of RBS, and much as the yellow signs may seem cheesy, it is in fact a great place to meet up.<br><br>Spinningfields is also home to the Leftbank Apartments, giant luxury pads which overlook the river and are about as central as you can get, as Spinningfields is located just off Deansgate and Castlefield. It provides a nice shortcut for me between my local Sainsbury&#39;s and town itself, and having worked there myself for a year I must say I enjoyed the culture and still do as a lowly freelancer, although I do feel a bit conspicuous walking around such a sharply dressed area in my leggings and Bear Paw boots. Never mind, I might power-dress for jaunts through there just for the sake of it in future.<br><br>It&#39;s insanely family friendly and there&#39;s plenty of interest nearby, such as the John Rylands library juxtaposed against all that glass and steel. I do like Spinningfields and it&#39;s my first stop for a summery glass of wine by the water. Do meet me there.",

"reviewcomment":"Abergeldie is great. Maybe it doesn&#39;t deserve 5 stars, but darn it they try so hard, like a slightly dim child who just wants a star next to their name to show their mummy, so the teacher gives it to them out of pity. Well done little Abergeldie. <br>Recently Abergeldie had an overhaul and went MEGA. It takes food orders AT your table now and has an extended restaurant type area. At heart, Abergeldie is still a chippy and serves delicious chippy food for Britain to augment its growing obesity. But Abergeldie wants to be so much more, and it would break my heart if Abergeldie didn&#39;t become a global phenomenon.<br>Abergeldie&#39;s prices are pretty standard as chippies go, but they go the extra mile with a nice(ish) homemade coffee and a woman who kissed her fingers when i ordered a jacket potato with chili as if it were some kind of beautifully selected dish.<br>You can go to Abergeldie for a nice working lunch, a lazy quick tea, or for the midnight munchies after a night on the town. Abergeldie&#39;s food will never disappoint.<br>I love you Abergeldie.",

"reviewcomment":"I tend to avoid the Arndale food court, just to avoid the mass amounts of people who flock there over the weekend. (I presume people aren&#39;t aware of other places to eat)<br><br>However, when the odds are against you. Or, if you&#39;re just too lazy to search for anywhere else. Then go to Wings!!<br>It&#39;s situated between McDonald&#39;s and &#34;SpudUlike&#34; and visible by the massive &#34;Wings&#34; logo above the counter.<br><br>they offer a wide arrange of various Chinese dishes (With an English influence) However, I only ever buy the Roast Duck and noddles (only Â£4.50 without the drink. BARGIN!!)<br>I can safely say you get what you pay for. Might not be the cheapest meal, but god it&#39;s the most for filling. Huge portions, with a great taste. I also on rare occasions purchase the Seafood Nigiri (Sushi) for a fiver (Includes various sushi pieces, Pot of Wasabi, and a bag of crushed onions.<br><br>Everything I&#39;ve purchased from here tastes great, even the sushi (If you aren&#39;t a big fan). The staff are surprisingly friendly and talkative at the counter, which is unusual for fast food. The place seems incredibly overstaffed. But I can&#39;t complain about that, as long as the food is reasonably fast, and of a good quality.<br><br>Sadly, when you do buy a meal make sure you scout out for a seat first. If you aren&#39;t aware of the food court seating, then don&#39;t get your hopes up on having a nice sit down without a little competition.<br><br>All in all, a great place to get some food from. Just make sure you are close to a bin. I&#39;m still yet to finish a full meal....There&#39;s sooo much!!!<br><br>Final comments: Yes, there are chopsticks and forks. Yes, some of the meals come in those little Chinese take away boxes you see in American films.",
