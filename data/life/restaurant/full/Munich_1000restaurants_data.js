"reviewcomment":"First off - don&#39;t get this place confused with the Augustiner Keller (the bier garten) which is close by.... definitely a different feel - and this may not be what you are hoping for if you have that in mind. <br><br>This place has all of the wonders of its more famous and popular cousin (The Hofbrauhaus) without having the unfortunate dual role of being a tourist attraction. Awesome beer and food - i just ordered off of their German menu having no clue of what i was getting and it turned out to be one of the best meals of my trip - unfortunately i cant recall what it was (pork shoulder was part of it, but that&#39;s all i recall). <br><br>The seating is the traditional beer hall style (picnic tables), so be prepared to be social with your table - (small tip: the language barrier is easier broken down after a few of the giant steins - apparently &#34;drunk&#34; is a universal language). <br><br>The service was kind of horrendous, but somehow added to the experience. Having an old German frau literally roll her eyes at me when i told her I wanted to pay with a card really brought me back a few decades and make me feel i had picked a local&#39;s place.",

"reviewcomment":"I ate at Weisses Brauhaus this past October, and it was awesome! The restaurant is located in a very central area of the city, close to many of the tourist attractions. The employees are dressed in lederhosen. Thankfully, they have menus in English.<br><br>We started with a basket of the most delicious soft pretzels that I&#39;ve ever had. The beer was very tasty as well. I can&#39;t remember the name of what I ordered, but it was sautéed potatoes and sauerkraut and so so good! My husband loved the pork knuckle, my friend devoured his plate of sausages and my other friend had a type of omelette that she really enjoyed as well. <br><br>I learned here that I am a big fan of German food and will definitely visit Weisses Brauhaus again!",

Still great stuff on it.<br><br>We picked the starter combo and it only took 10 minutes to arrive. Wings, onion rings, potato skins, chicken fingers, spring rolls, plus dips and salad. Very nice.<br><br>As entree we had a Cesar salad, the pulled pork sandwich, and the BBQ trio (ribs, pulled pork, chicken) with fries, beans, and coleslaw. The taste was great and it was a lot of food.<br><br>Btw: Free refills on soft drinks! In Germany;-)<br><br>The prices were OK, didn&#39;t expect anything else.

"reviewcomment":"When my parents wanted to take me to a burger place I was a little apprehensive. I mean...when I come to Germany I don&#39;t really want to eat American food. But, they assured me it was good and my little brothers are crazy about it, so off we went. <br><br>I loved the interior of the restaurant! Super cool! We were promptly seated and after looking over the menu, I decided on the chicken burger with wasabi mayo on a regular bun. We also got a large order of fries to share with the table (well actually, it was split between me and my stepmom since everyone else wanted their own order). <br><br>Burgers came out pretty quick. The chicken burger was good! I enjoyed the wasabi mayo. It was a bit toned down, but nonetheless tasty. But these fries!!!!! Soooo goood. We had various dipping sauces, including the ones that are already on the table. My little brothers (ages 5 and 8) finished their entire burger AND their fries. Not something that&#39;s common, so I know they really love it. <br><br>Service is quick and friendly. A great place to go for &#34;American&#34; cuisine that will do the trick! <br><br>And make sure to get those fries!!",

I went with the beef schnitzel which came with a light potatoes salad. <br><br>My sisters boiled Ox won a landslide victory. It came with the first side of veggies I&#39;ve seen since the first week of August. The spinach it came with was cooked perfectly but what made the meal was the horseradish gravy that came on top of the Ox. Also try only had a German menu since they have a special menu for Xmas and our server walked us through each item.

"reviewcomment":"Except for an apropos emphasis on deers, Wirtshaus im Hirschgarten is no different from other Bavarian restaurants. EXCEPT for their &#34;Culinary trips&#34; aka All-You-Can-Eat buffets, which is the first I have seen in a Biergarten and also all I can speak for in this review.<br><br>A friend recommended coming here for their &#34;All You Can Eat&#34; buffets, which start after 6 PM and offers a variety of main dishes, sides, and dessert. The type of buffet changes daily, ranging from &#34;Around the Roulade&#34; to &#34;American BBQ&#34; to &#34;Pasta Italiana.&#34; From buffet prices ranging from 12 to 17.50 EUR, it is a bargain!<br><br>We came for the &#34;Steak Tag,&#34; which is all about steaks. They offered (1) 4 choices of steaks: pork neck, pork loin, Ribeye, and a version of beef rump steak (Rinderhüftsteak), (2) 4 choices of dips: BBQ, sweet chili, sour cream, and herb butter, (3) fries/potato gratin/baked potatoes, (4) salad buffet of greens, red beets, olives, cabbage slaws, etc, and (5) Millirahm-Apfelstrudel (milk-cream apple strudel) with homemade vanilla and strawberry ice creams. All for 12.30 EUR.<br><br>The steaks were cooked nicely. The beef steaks were medium, juicy, and tender. Unfortunately, during the entire dinner, I managed to get only one piece of ribeye and the rest of the beef steaks was the beef rump. The potato sides were made to perfection. The salad bar and dessert were decent. In addition with our Augustiner beers, we left the restaurant stuffed and nearly passing out from food coma.<br><br>I could easily come back to try their other buffet selections.",

"reviewcomment":"One does not expect terrifically composed, organic, fresh food at two in the morning. But sometimes one is pleasantly surprised.<br><br>Such was the case for me late on a recent Saturday night (early on a Sunday morning?) in Munich. My red-clad crew and I had just cleaned up from a super cool event and were in need of sustenance. <br><br>I wasn&#39;t sure what to expect when I entered this futuristically designed late night burger joint with a vaguely Japanese æsthetic. A crisply written menu of burger options lay before me. I opted for the green meal deal which included a cheeseburger, Provence potatoes and a housemade iced tea for under €10.<br><br>I watched all of our food being grilled to order: the burgers, their buns, the potatoes. This was somewhat hard given my slightly ravenous state but it was nice to know they don&#39;t start cooking until you order. The result was an exceptionally juicy burger - cooked a true medium - a bun hearty enough that it held up all the way to the end and lovely, crisp and herby potatoes that could easily make you forget fries. And the housemade iced tea was a lovely berry flavour with little to no sweetener (read: perfect!)<br><br>Day or night, I&#39;d gladly return to Cosmogrill!",

"reviewcomment":"Well I heard a lot of good things about this place by my friends and i really wanted to try it. One fine night I was there with a few friends. Its not on the main street but one of the side lanes and hence always missed our attention. I am being told this one is quite old and famous not sure how old though. After visiting it once, I think this palce deserves to be a regualr hot spot for many in the city. <br><br>I already had my dinner so wasn&#39;t there for food, but for a few drinks and desserts. So on drinks you have an awesome bar. On desserts I was slightly disapointed as it didn&#39;t meet my expectation though. They have a seating arrangement outside as well. Best part was service which was top class. When you are there don&#39;t forget to meet a beautiful staff from Austria. She has wits and humour and that covered up for my not so great dessert experience. <br><br>As I have an davntage of being in the surrounding, I defientaly will go again here and spend some time. And if you are around here, I would totally recommend.",

"reviewcomment":"This was the first restaurant I bookmarked on Yelp for the trip, so I just had to make sure I went.<br>The restaurant is quite large, especially in comparison to most European eateries. I started off with a tomato and moz appetizer, which was presented with small bottles of olive oil and balsamic vinegar. Tasty but nothing over the top. I also ordered the Tomato Lentil soup, perfect for such a chilly day. In my American brain, I was picturing chunks of tomatoes in a lentil soup. Nope, it was all pureed. So, I was a little let down when it was brought to the table, until I tasted it. I ate almost all of it, and it was a huge bowl! Creamy, yummy goodness. And it warmed me up.<br>The prices are very high, I guess just because it only serves vegetarian food, so fellow veg-heads flock here. I almost ordered the vegetarian stroganoff, but it was 19 euros, which I thought was too steep for lunch. One dish, for around $24? No thanks.<br>The restaurant itself is lovely and airy, with nice waitresses and English menus available. Definitely worth a try for any travelers looking for tasty vegetarian food.",

"reviewcomment":"I entered here at a somewhat odd hour and was one of only a couple people in the restaurant.  I could tell its a pretty touristy place but I still loved the decor and thought it was really cool basement place.  Because the restaurant was so empty, I got a lot of staff attention and they chatted with me a lot and took a picture of me with the restaurant in the background.  Not used to having such friendly service in Europe.<br><br>I had a pretty simple meal - a giant glass of lager-y beer, potato soup and mushroom strudels.  If I am remembering correctly, the soup and strudels were both appetizers.  Both soup and strudels were delicious, although I liked the soup the best - it was very hearty and filling.  The strudels, while good, were quite rich so were a little more difficult to eat.  The service was bizarrely slow considering I was one of the few people there and didn&#39;t order anything elaborate.  I would say I was there for at least 45 minutes.<br><br>Really, the four stars are mostly for the ambiance and the location because I really thought the restaurant was beautiful and it was smack dab in the center of my favorite part of the city.  I would definitely recommend it for a tourist.",

It didn&#39;t take long after we ordered the food for the first dishes to arrive (even though the place was packed and we were 6 people). <br><br>The pasta was good and the pizza was good as well.

The only thing is that most tables are not very high and only for 2-3 people so it may not be the best place for large groups. But they also have a couple of big tables.",

"reviewcomment":"Huge restaurant located in Munich&#39;s busy and touristy Maximilianstrasse. We were four people popping in for lunch on a Friday without a reservation just before noon. The cafe in the front opens in the morning but the large dining room opens at noon. After speaking to the friendly hostess, we were seated at a nice window table but she informed us that we only have 1 hour since their lunch reservations are full. Looking around, I was a little skeptical just from the sheer size of the dining room and the number of tables they have. Lo and behold, about 20 minutes later, most of the tables became occupied, by the typical office lunch-goers and some lone diners squeezing in a nice lunch while reading their newspapers. <br><br>There are two huge grills in the center aisle of the main dining room where multiple chefs are busy grilling up various meats and fresh catch of the day. Giant industrial sized vents hanging over the grills ensures all that grilling doesn&#39;t send a whiff of smoke to the rest of the restaurant.<br><br>The daily specials are handwritten on large black chalk boards. My companions selected the lunch special of tagliatelle with steinpilz (stone mushrooms) in a delicious cream sauce. The lunch portions weren&#39;t large, but the cream sauce tasted heavier than it looked. The steinpilz was quite tasty, complimented the pasta very well. I ordered the scaloppine al limone, which was light but tasty. I also got a side of spinach, wasn&#39;t special, I just needed some greens with the meal. I also got a tuna tartar appetizer, served with an ultra light wasabi cream sauce and some sprouts on top...so refreshing and tasty it earned this place a fourth star in my book. <br><br>There was a bit of wait to get our entrees as the restaurant got super crowded around 12:30pm. The friendly waitress apologized for the long wait. We weren&#39;t in a hurry so it didn&#39;t matter much. Ended up staying for nearly two hours and no one ever came for the table. <br><br>TIP: Since this place gets very crowded during the weekdays, if you don&#39;t have a reservation for lunch, just show up at 11:50am and they will seat you right away.",

Everything you want out of your first glass of real German beer. <br>The food was good. With a bit of salt- the way we like it. Not the most amazing German cuisine, but it hit the spot nonetheless. <br>We had a couple more glasses of beer then started singing away with the accordion player. <br>It was awesome.

"reviewcomment":"Came here for breakfast before we hit the stores. We didn&#39;t really look to see what time they opened, but since there were people sitting at 9:40, we assumed they were open. Turns out they don&#39;t open until 10 so we just sat there till then. No big deal though. <br><br>We ordered 2 cappuccinos and my step mom ordered the breakfast platter that came with grapefruit, aloe Vera yogurt, fruit, cheese, and shrimp salad in half an avocado. I ordered the breakfast platter that came with smoked salmon, shrimp salad, cheese, fruit, and a boiled egg. Both came with a basket of freshly sliced bread. <br><br>These portions were huge!! We realized that we could have easily shared one, especially mine!! They were especially generous with the smoked salmon. I couldn&#39;t even touch my fruit at the end of the meal cause I was so full. <br><br>Service was decent <br><br>Great place to come if you&#39;re near the marienplatz! Either for a meal or a coffee and snack! We sat on the side opposite facing the glockenspiel, but it looked lovely!",

"reviewcomment":"Very bummed when friends were in town and the rain kept the biergartens closed. So we decided instead to try the restaurant here proper, which is run by the established Kuffler team. <br><br>Wow, truly a different take than the outdoor biergarten. Inside the candlelight and white tablecloth offered a much more sophisticated atmosphere. The food was great too. Bavarian classics like Schweinebraten are treated with top notch ingredients and a gourmet touch. It&#39;s a great way to introduce picky newbies to the Bayern experience. <br><br>Prices are reasonable for the quality and atmosphere, just don&#39;t expect a carry over (for pricing or quality) from the biergarten grub outside. <br><br>Overall, highly recommended for a special evening or to bring guests.

"reviewcomment":"With a 6.5-hour layover in Munich, I knew I had to get out of the airport even if to just get a small taste of the city.<br><br>My friend (another Jelena!) lives close to the city center and recommended I take the train to Marienplatz so we could grab lunch and walk around a bit. Exactly what I wanted to do before an 11-hour flight back to San Francisco later that afternoon - stretch my legs, eat something better than typical airport fare, and sneak in some sight-seeing.<br><br>Apparently, Sunday isn&#39;t the best day to experience Munich but my pal suggested we check out Der Pschorr as they were open (yay!) and feature a comprehensive menu with plenty of traditional Bavarian fare and Hacker-Pschorr brews. <br><br>The restaurant is rather large and bright, and we were quickly led to an upstairs table with a nice view. We both ordered the spaetzle, which was mixed with melted cheese and crispy onions (check out my photo for a visual of the deliciousness!). And talk about a huge portion - I was able to put a pretty decent dent into my plate, but only because I was especially hungry (I hadn&#39;t eaten anything for almost 18 hours). <br><br>Good value considering the portion size and everything tasted quite fresh... the food wasn&#39;t revolutionary by any means, but it was tasty and it hit the spot. As for the beer - I&#39;ve always been a fan of Hacker-Pschorr Weiss and as one would expect, it tasted even better in its birthplace. <br><br>A lovely lunch that I&#39;d be happy to repeat.",

They also offer mixed drinks which is a change of pace from drinking beer or wine.<br><br>The mojito was the best i ever had. The food was good which helped out their rating because service was slow and they did not have an English menu. However, the names of the dishes are familiar if you have eaten at an Italian or Thai restaurant. Spaghetti carbonara tasted fresh and the pasta was cooked perfectly. The price to portion ratio was reasonable. You&#39;ll be full but you probably won&#39;t end up taking any leftovers back with you.

There is also a small lounge next to the bar, so you can chill out and relax after your fantastic meal with another good drink!<br><br> It&#39;s massive, which helps, with a combination of high tables, soft sofas and outdoor seating. Perfect for people watching, suitable for all ages.<br><br> Payment system is weird if you&#39;ve not been before - on the way in they give you a plastic card.

It is usually quite busy during dinner time. <br><br>The service here is unfortunately inconsistent and it can take ages to get the attention of the waiters. This is probably my only real complaint about the place. Last night it took us over 25 mins to get the bill and had to wait for ages to get drinks and food ordered as well. <br><br>The food here is consistently good. I absolutely love the Ente here. It is cooked to perfection and comes with a rich flavourful gravy. The duck is moist and falls away from the bone and tastes delicious. Similarly the Brotzeit Teller is excellent and comes with a selection of meats and obatzda. The obatzda here is divine and I love it.<br><br>One of the finest Bavarian restaurants in the area and I would happily come back here anyday.

"reviewcomment":"Ort: Cafe Neuhauser<br>Mittwoch, Heilig 3 König 11 Uhr<br><br> Out of Regensburg. Zum ersten Mal haben wir in München bei Freunden übernachtet und sind morgens somit auch mal in München zum Frühstücken gegangen. Schon als wir aus deren Wohnung treten, muss ich 2x überlegen, ob wir auch wirklich in München sind. Die Nymphenburgerstraße ist wie ausgestorben, Geschäfte haben feiertagsbedingt sowieso zu und sogar die Bäckerei an der Ecke ist dunkel. Bei gefühlten -15 °C hoffen wir jetzt, dass eben dieses nahe gelegene Cafe Neuhauser wenigstens geöffnet hat. Bingo. Aber anscheinend ist es auch so ziemlich das einzige, welches offen hat, denn kaum treten wir durch die Tür sehen wir, dass komplett jeder Tisch besetzt ist! Die Kellnerin fragte Haben Sie reserviert? Und sofort fangen meine Ohren wieder zu brennen an, bei dem Gedanken, dass wir gleich wieder in den -15°C kalten Straßen von München wandeln müssen um einen neuen Platz zum Frühstücken zu finden. Doch da kommt er, der Chefkellner, der Retter meiner brennenden Ohren, und offenbart uns, dass an einem 6er Tisch zwar 2 reserviert hätten, aber am anderen Ende ja noch 3 Plätze für uns sind. Hallejulia!<br>Die Preise sind natürlich höher angesetzt, als im ländlichen Regensburg, das billigste Frühstück (Vaduz) kostet ohne Getränk 6,50 EUR, durchschnittlich schlagen die Frühstücks aber mit 10,95 EUR zu Buche, Getränke gibt&#39;s alle ab 3 EUR aufwärts, dafür bekommt man das weichgekochte Extra Ei für nur 90 ct oder 0,3 l kalte Milch für einen Euro. <br>Die Kaffees sind einmalig! Der Milchschaum so cremig-weich und einfach perfekt! <br>Ich entscheide mich für die Billigvariante Vaduz: Müsli mit frischen Früchten, einem weichgekochten Ei, Brotkorb, Nutella, Honig, selbstgemachte Marmelade und Butter, während T. und B. sich für das Frühstück Elisee für 10,95 EUR entscheiden, mit 2 Eiern nach Wahl, Brotkorb, Butter, selbstgem. Marmelade, Honig, Nutella, Käse, Wurst und Streichpastete, zusätzlich 0,1l frischgepressstem O-saft oder Prosecco (nicht frisch gepresst).<br>Mein Ei war perfekt! Ich hätte nie gedacht, dass ausser meinem schwulen Mitbewohner irgendwer auch nur annähernd ein Ei auf die Sekunde genau kochen kann, aber dieser Koch konnte das! Das Müsli mit den frischer Ananas, Trauben, rote Johannisbeeren, Apfel, war gigantisch, sättigend und super lecker. Auch auf T. und B.&#39;s Teller liegen die Wurstscheiben schön gerollt und kreativ angeordnet auf dem Teller (wobei sogar der Teller eine kreative From hat), die Pastete wurde mit einer Spritzpistole wie ein Sahnehäubchen aufgespritzt und ein paar kleine Cracker in Party-Tierchen-Form liegen auch noch dabei. Sowohl eine Augenweide als auch ein Geschmacksfeuerwerk. Nur die selbst gemachten Marmeladen, von denen sind wir alle 3 nicht so begeistert. Sowohl die Rote als auch die Orangene können geschmackstechnisch nicht eindeutig eingeordnet werden und beide sind sehr (wohl nach-weihnachtlich) mit Nelken gewürzt, so dass sie trotz Farbunterschied unglaublich ähnlich schmecken.<br><br> Wünschenswert: Die Marmeladen mit mehr Abwechslung im Geschmack!<br>Bemerkenswert: Dass wir trotz brechender Fülle wahnsinnig schnell unser Frühstück bekamen! Auf der Sitzfläche der Stühle ist ein Sterne-Muster! (Für ein Sternenkind reicht dieses Zeichen um zu Wissen, dass es dort richtig ist!)<br>Preis-Leistungs-Verhältnis: Stimmt bestimmt für Münchner Verhältnisse!",

So I wanted to take a dig at it. Went to this palce one fine day crossing the luitpold park. The place is indeed a villa and looks grand but may be a bit maintanenace would be called for. The whole seating arranegment around the villa was the best part. You can laze around in the garden or prefer sitting on the porch and enjoy your beer. <br><br>On service front they were OK. But I don&#39;t blame them. Completely they are understaffed. My Nurenburger sausages took almost an hour to come and I patiently was enjoying our conversation with my friends, When suddenly a staff aplogises for the delay and offers a completmentary desert of our choice. I mean it was a nice gesture though. On quality of food, I have no reasons to complain. It was nice. <br><br>So, sometimes when you are in the neighbourhood, and want to get cozed in a Villa kind of surrounding then I think you can try this place.",

"reviewcomment":"I had a really enjoyable dinner experience at Tenmaya. I chose it partly because I was in the mood for Japanese, and partly because it was walkable to my hotel and had an English menu online.<br><br>Only complaint - no actual English menu, so when I arrived, I had to do some deciphering.<br><br>Otherwise, a very good meal. The food was freshly made and prepared, well-seasoned but not overly salty. I had gyoza for an appetizer and an excellent seafood ramen for dinner. Both were delicious. The ramen had a nice combo of fish and shellfish, and was a satisfying portion. The other menu options included a wide range of sushi, several kinds of ramen dishes, and many other Japanese standards. I wished I had stayed longer just to try another meal there.<br><br>The staff were very friendly and helpful. My waiter was especially kind in helping me navigate the menu, which she kindly translated for me. She was also the right amount of attentive without being either overbearing or uninterested in me as the customer.<br><br>Overall, I can give Tenmaya a strong recommendation.",

I&#39;ve been here a couple times with a group of friends and the service was great and food was consistently delicious.<br><br>For about 25 Euros, you can get Edamame, a small salad, two sushi rolls (spicy california and Avo-Philly are safe bets) and a beer.",

They have heineken which is quite rare in Munich ( capital of only bavarian beer ). The service is really easy, go to the bar, say hi, order your food from a quite east menu, the dope ones or even more dope ones. Is a must try, i&#39;ve been here 4 times in two weeks and i always loved it. Try the california love one for something cool...",

Quite the contrary, it offers a vast choice of breakfast options, a delicious lunch menu, a full set of options for tea time (finger sandwiches and the previously mentioned scones) and of course tasty dinner card. <br>I really fancy the vintage atmosphere with the old portraits and books, it feels like a set of Downton Abbey.<br>The service also greatly contributes to this nice atmosphere: the waiters are caring and stylish. <br><br>In the end, it doesn&#39;t really matter what daytime you arrive at the Victorian House, it will always accommodate your senses.<br><br>My advice: try the fish and chips of course!<br><br>NB: there is actually 5 different restaurants under this label but our favourite one is the following one.",

"reviewcomment":"What a great find! <br>So glad I stumbled over this little quaint restaurant after I arrived in Munich.<br><br>It was about 1700 and the place was already packed. Glad I could grab a spot at the bar.<br><br>It was new to me to fill out the slip of paper to order, so I accidentally ordered way too much.<br>It said &#34;1€=3 pieces of sushi&#34;, I wrote down 3, because I thought you had to order them one by one, so I actually got 9 pieces. <br>Should&#39;ve know they wouldn&#39;t sell one individual piece of sushi for 0.33 cents!<br><br>Didn&#39;t regret it though since I managed to stuff my face with all that sushi and it was delicious!<br>The fish tasted fresh and the rice was nice and sticky, not clumpy! Presentation was very nice.<br>The Kirin beer was pretty tasty too.<br>Didn&#39;t wait to long on my order either, for the amount of sushi I ordered, they were very quick.<br><br>It was also pretty nice that you could see them make the sushi fresh behind the bar. (with gloves on!)<br><br>I will definitely stop by again and highly recommend this place to anyone who wants to enjoy very high quality sushi on a budget!",

This place is fast food, self-service, so do not expect gourmet food or wonderful service here. For what they are, a quick bite for reasonable money - they are great.",

"reviewcomment":"I went here for lunch today after a day of shopping. Everyone got the lunch buffet, so this review is only based on that since we didn&#39;t try anything from the menu.<br><br>The selection is small, but all of the food is made with high quality ingredients.  There was a few simple sushi rolls, soups, curries, salads, noodles, shrimp chips, and other things as well.  A favorite of mine was the tuna tartare that was presented in a little ball and had a spicy sauce. The deserts were presented nicely; there were various chocolate mouses, pumpkin and coconut flan, and different kinds of exotic fruit, such as dragon fruit and passion fruit. <br><br>The buffet is priced at about €27 per person, which may seem a bit pricey but I thought it was worth it. The service was friendly, but a tad on the slower side. I suggest coming here for a nice yet casual lunch.",

Seriously, if you can find an Italian restaurant in Munich that serves pizza as good as Pasta e Basta for a lower price, then I will personally buy you dinner there. Lucky for me, no such place exists.<br><br>A lot of people say this place caters mainly to students, and I originally agreed with this notion. Now I think that it simply caters to anyone that wants a tasty meal and good service. That&#39;s all anyone is really looking for, right?<br><br>Expect a wide variety of pizza and pastas, with the most expensive dish costing roughly 7 or 8 euro......what?! Does that mean you have enough money left for dessert?! Yes, yes it does. Though this might not be the best Italian food you will ever eat in your entire life, it may well be some of the cheapest. I was here wayyyyy too often last Summer, and something tells me that is going to happen again this year hahah. Definitely a place to try if you haven&#39;t already been! :)",

"reviewcomment":"Let me begin by saying I might be biased because I&#39;m an absolute sucker for anything Art Deco -- and Brasserie Tresznjewski has this style in spades.<br><br>We walked by the other night and the glow of the gold-inlaid interior just sort of beckoned us in. It was like stepping into a scene from &#39;30s Paris. The design is spectacular -- with beautifully selected artwork and architectural details that -- if not true Art Deco relics -- are certainly great replicas.<br><br>Unfortunately we just had dinner, so we didn&#39;t get to dig into the small but well-represented Brasserie menu. We vowed to come back for chow at some point and report on the findings.<br><br>But what we were able to tuck ourselves into were a couple of classic cocktails. <br><br>I had my usual go-to Manhattan on the rocks and my special lady friend went for a Singapore Sling. The Manhattan didn&#39;t blow my socks off, but it was a well-made and generous portion served in a (surprise) beautifully Art Deco-era highball. I appreciated the final touch of an orange rind that really brought the flavors out. <br><br>The Singapore Sling was even better -- not the syrupy sweet drink you&#39;d expect most places, but an expertly balanced cocktail -- not too sweet, not too strong.<br><br>We didn&#39;t have much time to linger, but from first sip, I like what I see and will certainly be back to dabble in this Art Deco dream once again.",

No slap-it-on-the-plate here. The location is amazing; if you can manage to snag a seat on the second floor and front of the building, you have a beautiful view of the Operaplatz glittering in the night. Other rooms are less atmospheric, but still comfy.<br><br>The food is amazing. A large menu of classic Bavarian and Austrian grub, but truly well prepared. I had a Tafelspitz that nearly melted in my mouth. The Schweinesbraten and Schnitzel looked nearly as good. Just one thing: this place is damn expensive. 27 euro for a schnitzel? Yeah, you&#39;re paying for location and the name. Worth it if you&#39;re out for a group of colleagues, but chances are there&#39;s something just as good and a quarter of the price down the street. <br><br>All in all, great gemuetchkeit and delicious food... if you got the bank for it.",

I was here midday and it was packed! We had to wait around for a little bit. There was something for everyone whether you were sitting for a cappuccino &amp; a cake or there for a whole meal.<br><br>Upon entering, you&#39;ll see an enticing case of pastries. As a non-German speaker/ tourist, I was pretty reluctant to ask, but there was charming man, that spoke enough english to help me with my curious sweet tooth. I picked the walnut cake (see pic). It seemed like the popular thing. By the last bites of it, I saw 2-3 others had ordered the same.<br><br>If you want to spruce up your normal coffee routine, get the amaretto latte. It&#39;s a bit sweet, but a treat to top off a meal along with that walnut cake.<br><br>Ok...I think I&#39;ve just convinced myself that I need to go back soon. Walnut cake + amaretto latte. <br><br>One more thing, I think they screen films there at night and/or have live music too. This might be another excuse to go back. They have an extensive wine list available online.<br><br>Too bad my friend moved back to Los Angeles.  :(",

"reviewcomment":"This is a fantastic place and a part of a chain of restaurants quite successful in Europe. I had tried their chain in Paris and in Budapest. I will first talk about its highlight.  <br><br>Moment you enter this place, you are handed a card which becomes your bill of sale... :) So the deal is like this - You get the card from reception. then you choose the dish of your choice, ask the guy handing you the dish to load its cost on the card. and move ahead. its self service. Finish your food and while leaving return the card and pay the amount. Pl remember, not to misplace your card else you will have to pay 50 bucks as fine. also, all cards look same so don&#39;t mix it with others else you will end up paying someone else bill. <br><br>There are multiple counters. Asian, Italian, Bar. I always visit Italian, which is quite good. The best part is that you get your food prepared in front of your eyes. so all the customization you want, you can say right there and they will be happy to oblige.<br><br>Place is quite spacious and hence has enough seating arrangement.  Generally you will see lot of after work meetups on weekdays. Also, apparently I was told by their manager that they often host large gatherings with prior reservation. it certainly, helps better man management and avoids any hassles of wrong billing or wrong orders coming your way. <br><br>Besides all this, you get fantastic food, so my honest recommendation is to just pay a visit. and i&#39;m sure you will love it.",

"reviewcomment":"The city never seizes to amaze me.. This one was slightly hidden in the corner and not on the main street and it always slipped my attention. But voila i visited it yesterday after a lazy stroll with a bunch of friends in marienplatz and we tumbled across this. The place has Old world charm and hence it automatically drew attention and raised expectation for its dining at its finest. The Schubeck name means class, distinction and great service. They do live up to its name indeed, till the last drop. it somehow maintains the fine balance between stylish but not snobbish, fancy but not stuffy, classy but not over priced.. It has plenty of places to sit outside, we had very good attentive service. On the menu you got variety as it offers a range of food/drinks.  Coming to food, they definitely score an A. Enjoyed the delicious Bavarian delicacy which to my finding was a bit lighter than most other Bavarian food I had until now. The service was friendly, attentive and efficient, the food spot on. hardly any delay. Good choice of meals and not that expensive. Tip here is to try the desert variation. They make fresh ice-cream and cakes which are to die for.<br><br>Overall, a nice place, and a sure shot recommendation... :)",

Lots of families but also locals enjoying the nice outside seating. Ice creams are popular here, as well as cakes. They serve a bit of everything (regular meals, milkshakes, beer, pastries...). Maybe a bit pricey but location is worth it, specially with children.",

I&#39;ve been living in Munich for a year and I&#39;ve been on the lookout for a great Cappuccino for a while until I stumbled upon Vits. It&#39;s a great place to sit read have sandwiches and coffee, I love their grilled mozzarella and tomato panini and their lunch Thai chicken curry is absolutely delicious. Love this place, quite spacious and luminous. <br><br>Very friendly staff and very knowledgeable about all things coffee, they roast their own beans and you can buy some too. They even offer several barista training seminars that are on their website. I took the latte art class with Andrew, he&#39;s awesome and a great instructor. I can&#39;t wait to buy a real espresso machine. Awesome cafe!",

"reviewcomment":"Yummmmmmmmmm!!<br><br>This was my second time at Sababa, and I have to say I was not disappointed. The first time I went I had the falafel teller, but this time I tried the shwarma teller. Both plates were really, REALLY tasty. <br><br>Sababa is a hidden gem, that a lot of people seem to know about - because it is pretty much always packed during lunch time. The prices are decent, and the portions are lean towards the large side - therefore it is a pretty good deal for the Viktualienmarkt. Although I don&#39;t remember what the falafel plate cost, the schwarma plate cost 7.90. The plate came with hummus, baba ganoush, salad, various pickled items, delicious pita bread, and a very large portion of the schwarma meat. <br><br>I know some people may think that shwarma meat can look like the indistinguishable parts of the animal. However, this shwarma consisted of large chunks of turkey breast - no mystery meat on this plate! ;)<br><br>I would recommend this place to anyone. In fact, everyone should go check this place out.

"reviewcomment":"Alternative and fun. No reservations and pay by cash only (nearest bank is by Isartor around a 5 minute walk). <br><br>Food is fantastic! Ordered a spicy carrot soup and the shrimp and calamari salad. Food was the best I have had in Munich, very filling and absolutely delicious! It was all too much to finish, the salad would definitely have been enough. My boyfriend had the chicken with chickpeas, sun dried tomatoes and mint and he loved his as well. Both were washed down with beers. <br><br>Dinner was 30€ total for both, very reasonable for the high quality food and way the chicken is sourced (comes from a local person).<br><br>I would most definitely recommend even for non-salad eaters (I almost never order a salad when I eat out). Something there for everyone. Plan to go back again if ever in Munich!",

Its a large building with an open covered terrace for sitting outdoors. The inside is immaculate. There were these huge casks of different beers. The various halls and eating places were divided by archways. The food smelled so good. The atmosphere was great.<br><br>My cousin advised us to get the &#34; Weißbeir mit Weißwürste&#34;.  This was very scrumptious. The beer comes in a huge mug (German style). This size serving used to be half a pfenning (1900&#39;s). When the government tried to raise the price to one whole  pfenning the Barvarians almost rioted. (Some history just so that you know...Germans take their beer seriously.)<br><br>The Weißwürste was very good. I had some German mustard on the side to try with it. We also had the local cheese (obazdn) with pretzels.<br><br>We strolled around Munich for a few hours and then went back for more.<br><br>Y 35/100",

"reviewcomment":"I really didn&#39;t know what to expect when I made my reservation at Lisboa on Saturday night. I had never tried Portuguese food, but everyone said &#34;Well, If you like fish then you&#39;ll probably like it....&#34; (which yes, as a matter of fact I do like fish) so I thought it could make for a nice evening. Indeed it did! Lisboa isn&#39;t that small on the inside, but it seems that way because soooo many tables are crammed inside. My friend and I arrived at 7:00 and only a handful of tables were taken, so we were able to get quite comfortable. Within 30 minutes, the place was completely packed with people, so don&#39;t plan on going without a reservation on a weekend.  I think it would have a much nicer atmosphere if they just took out maybe 4 tables to allow a little more space for people to get cozy.<br><br>The service was fantastic! Our server was so friendly, helped explain a few of the menu items to us (with no attitude at all), made recommendations for what he thought we might like, and paired it with beer and wine for us. Honestly, there were lots of options on the menu, but he made it such a simple task :) <br><br>As for the price, I honestly think it&#39;s Munich standard for quality food. I think we&#39;ve all had at least one experience where we say &#34;Wow, that was delicious, but for 18 euro?! Never again.&#34; I left feeling like the prices were definitely justified by the food.<br><br>My dinner was the grilled salmon steak, topped with goat cheese and a bit of balsamic glaze. The portion was much larger than I expected, and I still finished every bite. The smoky flavor of the salmon paired deliciously with the saltiness of the goat cheese and the sweetness from the glaze.<br><br>I would definitely go there again if I&#39;m craving fish, but I have to just remind myself NOT to book after 7:30 if I want a comfortable seat.",

"reviewcomment":"This is a hidden gem.This is definitely a place where the locals come- it would be impossible to find unless you knew where exactly where it was.  It can be described as french fusion cuisine. We had reservations but we didn&#39;t need them for a weeknight. We were promptly seated and started off with some cocktails. They have an interesting selection, and their drinks are strong! After we ordered our meals we were given a basket of bread and these delicious crackers that were so addicting! Yumm.<br><br>I got the fish croquettes for an appetizer; they were light and airy and came with a salad with a light vinaigrette dressing. It came with a Cajun sauce, which gave it a nice kick. I also tried a bite of the fish soup which was different than I expected because there weren&#39;t chunks, yet it had a great flavor, and I also had a few leaves of the artichoke appetizer which was so simple yet delectable! <br><br>For the main course, I ordered the monk fish medallions which came with a balsamic sauce, potatoes au gratin, and vegetables. WOW. The fish was cooked perfectly, and the sauce was amazing. I was in heaven. Though I didn&#39;t try them, I heard good things of the lamb and the duck. <br><br>We all shared a apple desert, which came out piping hot. It was single slices of apple baked with a almond paste on top and served with a scoop of ice cream. DELISH!<br><br>Ahh, everything was incredible. The service was attentive and very friendly, and the atmosphere was nice and cozy. The prices are a little on the higher end, but SO worth it. I&#39;ve heard that on weekends the atmosphere is better and the waiters are more interactive, but if you do go on a weekend, make a reservation! The restaurant is on the smaller side. 2 thumbs up!!",

On a sunny summer day, the more central biergartens are often crowded to the point of being unpleasant, whereas Nockherberg is usually lively but still has room for us to find a comfortable table. <br><br>For tourists looking for some Munich flavor off the beaten tourist path, I&#39;d easily recommend a stop at Nockherberg.",

"reviewcomment":"Very cool place! Funky 50&#39;s decor and cool art on the walls that you can buy. the place is very small even thought it has two floors - you access the &#34;living room&#34; upstairs by a spiral staircase at the back of the bar. The bartoenders all wear 1950&#39;s Venetian Barista jackets and are very good at what they do. There is an interesting mix of student and bohemian types there enjoying the small (0.25l), inexpensive beer on tap or Astra (a culty beer from Hamburg) and cool types drinking really good cocktails, mixed by real experts. They have a large assortment of gins, which I love! There is alway quite a crowd outside having a smoke late at night and the place is rarely NOT packed late in the evening.",

"reviewcomment":"Awesome spot! When the local old guys are the main patrons, enjoying beers and hearty fare together in the evening, you know it&#39;s the real deal.<br>I had the mixed sausage platter with kraut. Simple and perfect. Each of the 3 sausage types were distinct and I found that, while one was better with the scharf (spicy-ish) mustard, another was best complemented by the typical-Munich sweeter variety. You&#39;ll have to figure out your combinations for yourself.<br>The ladies are busy, and seem gruff. But a good smile and a joke or two go a long way to wind up having a good laugh with the staff...and a free beer if yer a good boy!",

"reviewcomment":"Well I normally would have never got to know this place, but thanks to Yelp, now I know. This place is charming, glamorous and fantabulous. Courtesy a yelp event I happen to stumble across this nice Restaurent. Location wise it&#39;s great as they are stone throw away from the nearest Ubahn, so on this front they get full marks. Coming to ambience first - you can look at pics - they are true testimony of this place. It&#39;s awesome and rightly so charming and mystique. It has a spacious seating arrangement outside. As they are parked in corner they get ample seating arrangement outside. Coming to food, As I have heard of Turkish food I happen to taste it here and I wasn&#39;t disappointed either. On food front I guess every dish was so filling. I couldn&#39;t finish my portion. But the quality of food and variety of dish is awesome. They have a great appetizer collection as well. So keep enough space for the main course. On drinks front though they have a good collection but I got a bit disappointed with the drink I had - Long Island tea. It was a bit sweet. Otherwise I heard others liked their drinks. On service front they were pretty neat - no delays, on time and courteous staff. Expense wise I won&#39;t say it expensive. For a main course and a drink you would end up coughing roughly 20-25 bucks. <br><br>Overall a great experience, a great place And surely a recommendation if you want great Turkish food with great ambience.",

"reviewcomment":"Four years ago I studied abroad in Barcelona. I hadn&#39;t been lucky enough to eat tapas in the same league since that time. That all changed this fateful Easter Sunday. Maybe it was the alignment of the stars, but everything about this meal was perfect. Upon entering the restaurant my eyes needed a moment to adjust to the dim light, so that I could truly appreciate the atmosphere they&#39;ve created in Bodega Dali. The little rooms here and there were charming, each glowing with candlelight and decked out in Dali artwork.<br><br>My friend and I were greeted promptly by a very sweet, soft-spoken server who was potentially a magician. I swear, any time we needed her throughout the evening she would just appear....kinda creepy, but insanely convenient. We settled on four tapas, jamon serrano (delicious spanish ham), patatas bravas (chopped patatas covered in a spicy sauce), pulpo con aioli (octopusssss), and of course we had to try the super standard Spanish tortilla. Everything was delicious in it&#39;s own way. The ham did not disappoint one bit. Full of flavor and a bit salty. Perfection. The patatas bravas there were interesting because the sauce was more tomato-based than any other patatas bravas sauce I had tried before, but it was a welcome change. My God the pulpo con aioli.....if you&#39;re worried that octopus would be too chewy for you, then fear not! It was soooo well cooked, it wasn&#39;t chewy a bit, and it paired really well with the aioli. In my opinion, you shouldn&#39;t have Spanish tapas without having a bit of tortilla, so we did just that. It was light and cooked with thinly sliced potatoes (as opposed to the usual chunks of potatoes) which I thought was a pretty cool twist. I can&#39;t believe only 4 tapas filled us up!! No worries, we had saved just enough space in our belly&#39;s to stuff in one delightfully sinful crema catalana (DO NOT LEAVE BODEGA DALI WITHOUT TRYING IT!) and a glass of sweet sangria. <br><br>I&#39;m drooling just thinking about how great this meal was. I would go back here for dinner tonight if  someone asked me. Seriously, get yourself in gear and make a reservation here ASAP! :)",

I recommend the oriental lamb which not looks only good but is mouth watering, a good piece of lamb with great flavours, all fresh and with a great salad, cooked vegetables, couscous and toasted home made bread.. Servings are large so a starter isn&#39;t really needed. And it&#39;s not very expensive at all. For Munich it is really good especially for what you get.<br><br> Service is good; everyone is really nice in there.<br><br> The décor is very contemporary.<br><br> I recommend this place if you wanna grab a quick meal or hang with friends.",

They also have English menus which was a plus as one of our group did not understand German. <br><br>I had the fresh wrapped spring roll with beef for starter and they were fabulous. Nice spicy beef wrapped in fresh vegetables and wrapped in a nice rice paper roll with a yummy dipping sauce....sher lecker.<br><br>For main I had the Pho Cari - extra Scharf :-) and it was delicious sauce with coconut milk, lots of vegetable and chicken and nice noodles. I also tried some of the other dishes and loved them all. Even the dessert of banana tapioca pudding &amp; banana fritters was great.<br><br>This was the first time I have been to a Vietnamese restaurant in Munich. Having been to hundreds of Vietnamese restaurants across many other countries in the past I would rate this place pretty high for quality, flavour and value for money.  <br><br>Will definitely return here again and again :-))",

"reviewcomment":"Walking down Wörthstraße the other day, I notice the Nomiya has closed.  Bavarian-Japanese cuisine?  Gag me with a spoon.  Decent yakitori, but mediocre seaweed salad, truly abysmal house wine--the excuse? It&#39;s &#34;primitivo&#34;--and service that makes you feel like they are doing you a favour by allowing you inside.  I&#39;ve had very bad experiences at the Nomiya, and felt a tiny twinge of schadenfreude as I walked past.<br><br>EDIT: It turns out that the Nomiya is just temporarily closed, for renovations.  *sigh*",

Standard chairs in the front part of the place, but if you venture a little further back you will find a more comfortable loungi(ish) environment, but you do need to get there early to grab those seats.

"reviewcomment":"I think sometimes Bavarian food has a bad reputation. I frequently hear people say &#34;ohhh but it&#39;s so heavy!&#39; or &#34;I&#39;ll gain 10 kilo if I eat that stuff all time!&#34; I hereby request that we slap all of those people and then drag them to Fraunhofer....because they&#39;ve clearly never been to this little bit of heaven tucked conveniently between the popular Glockenbach, Sendlinger Tor, and Gärtnerplatz areas. <br><br>I LOVED the Bavarian, rustic cabin, classic bierhall feel that Fraunhofer has perfected. The obazda was plentiful and the maßbiers were flowing free. Speaking of the obazda, it is seriously embarassing how fast my friend and I ate it. It was like we were wild dogs or as if we thought the other person would eat it all before we could get the next bite. GANZ GANZ LECKER! <br><br>I mean really there is nothing I can say about this place or the food that hasn&#39;t already been said. It&#39;s great for that bit of nostalgia and gemütlichkeit. Also, they have a small theatre where shows take place! I&#39;m super excited to go see that soon :) I only docked a star because our server seemed like she was half asleep and when we asked a different server for help he was a bit rude. <br><br>Can&#39;t wait to bring some of my friends here! : )",

"reviewcomment":"I recently went to this restaurant for my boyfriend&#39;s birthday. I must say, I was pleasantly surprised. Not only does The Big Easy offer baby back barbecued ribs, but  the barbecue sauce tasted like real (American) barbecue sauce - I think it is important to note that good barbecue sauce is very difficult to find around here.  <br><br>My boyfriend got the Jambalaya which was spicy and delicious, and our friend got a bison burger which was juicy and tender. <br><br>Initially we wanted to come here because they advertised live jazz... however the jazz was just a person singing along with a kareoke tape (or at least that is what it sounded like). Our waiter assured us that the jazz is actually better on Sundays, but we haven&#39;t been back to see if what he said is true. <br><br>The food is a little pricey but the quality is good. The cocktails are delicious, and it looked as though they had a good happy hour deal! I would definitely go back to this place.",

"reviewcomment":"Its a little quick dining place in the middle of the mall.  You place your order at the counter, and then sit down and they either bring you the plate, or, you can wait to claim it.  The seats are first come, first serve, and communal, so plan on sharing a table with someone.<br><br>I had the Pad Thai with shrimp.  The portion is pretty decent, but not very flavorful as the Thai food here in California.  It didn&#39;t have that &#34;tang&#34; or spice that I am used to, but I could add more spices using the chilies on the table.<br><br>Its a decent place for lunch, reasonable in price, especially for Munich.",

If you like spicy they can make it so and also give you plenty of chilly sauce choices you can add to your meal.<br><br>They also serve mango lassi at this place that is divine as is the Ingwer tee (ginger tea)<br><br>I go here quite often and see no reason to change :-)",

We were fortunate enough to have a small table for 2 in the same area as a party of ~10 celebrating a 70th birthday who had hired a guitarist and singer who sounded like Ray Charles. Both the wait staff and the party guests repeatedly asked if the sound was a nuisance, but it made for a lovely and memorable atmosphere. The staff even danced with the party guests! We split a small salad, pizza (Diavola) and lasagna and the food was fantastic. I&#39;ll admit that our server in particular was more interested in dancing and singing than serving but it was such a fun environment that I can&#39;t fault him that. I wish we had a place like this close to our home!",

The shiyo ramen is my personal favorite, but the miso ramen is also excellent. IMHO it&#39;s also a good sign they don&#39;t try to do sushi to lure in more people. They don&#39;t need to; they specialize in ramen and do that very, very well.<br><br>Try the gyoza, they&#39;re so good!<br><br>They also have a nice selection of small plates that aren&#39;t easy to find in most Japanese restaurants, such as ikura (salmon roe) served over warm sticky rice with a sheet of seaweed. It&#39;s sort of like a deconstructed onigiri. <br><br>Small selection of popular Japanese beer too.<br><br>It can get very busy even on weeknights, so be prepared to wait.",

Service was nice, cordial and warm. staff were little wary to speak English, but they dint show any exasperation. they were Cool. We end up laughing most of the times, as for both of us couldn&#39;t understand each other language and were mostly talking in sign language. she was a sweet gal. <br><br>Anyways, the food was not bad. if you are a sucker for well done steak, then don&#39;t forget to mention it, as my other friend had to pay the consequences of not mentioning it. the steak comes with salad with dressing of your choice - american / italian. Also ordered American cheese french fries, which was horrible though... :) but then still i was ok with it. once you done with main course, they give a nice little dessert menu which is in the shape of heart. that was cheeky.. :) price wise moderate. <br><br>Overall, for steaks of course this is by far not the best place in town, as there are really good ones here, but this isn&#39;t too bad either..",

"reviewcomment":"Yum yum yum! I would come here every day if it wouldn&#39;t make me as big as a house!<br><br>The decor on the inside is very cool - rustic looking almost. The prices are right at lunch time, get their lunch time menu, and its under 12 euro for a buger, your choice of bread, your choice of salad or french fries and a drink! <br><br>I&#39;ve never had bad service at this place, and during the day I have yet to have a hard time finding a place to sit. They even have a back patio - albeit, small, but nice. <br><br>If you haven&#39;t experienced this awesome burger joint, check it out!",

"reviewcomment":"So whenever I&#39;m in the mood for a quick burrito or quesadilla, Condesa comes to mind. They are pretty conveniently located, at Münchner Freiheit, and the food is pretty good. I usually get the ground beef in either a burrito or quesadilla. It&#39;s plenty to satisfy me for a meal, but sometimes I add guacamole &amp; chips just because I love them!<br>The place is small and designed for a quick bite, not a long meal with friends. One drawback for those with babies is that to enter you need to go up stairs, which can be challenging with a stroller. Therefore last time I just took mine to go and ate outside on a bench near by. <br><br>I am positive I will be swinging by more often as the weather warms up to take it to go and eat in the Englischergarten.",

"reviewcomment":"Having spent most of my life in Texas, I say this place wouldn&#39;t have lasted a month in any town...except in Germany. It has the hopes of being authentic but when you haven&#39;t had Mexican food in two years, it was pretty damn good! <br>The atmosphere felt like a cozy cantina sans humidity. The bar was complete with Corona, San Miguel, and even tequila with a scorpion. We ordered the table side guacamole. Fresh and creamy but bland. <br>The hubs ordered chicken and beef fajitas. We paid 5€ extra for a second person but it didn&#39;t look like it. Maybe because there were extra tortillas?? Those were store bought...obviously. <br>I ordered the corn fritters and taquitos. The fritters were more like hush puppies with no trace of the chilis that were mentioned in the menu. The sweet chili sauce was good though. The taquitos were missing something that I can&#39;t put my finger on. It came with a side of cheese whiz...I mean cheese dipping sauce. <br>The service was prompt. No waiting even though it was Saturday night. The ambiance was more than we hoped for. It was relaxing. <br>Like I said, it wouldn&#39;t last a day even up against On the Border but compared to the other options 2000 miles away from Tex Mex heaven, this is the place to be.",

It&#39;s a fun place to go for something a little different! <br>It&#39;s worth getting the all you can eat option and taking your time since there are a lot of different meats and flavour combinations to try &amp; it&#39;s only a couple of Euro more expensive.  <br>Every time I&#39;ve been there the waiters have been really nice and helpful and always willing to speak English.  The bartenders are especially nice &amp; happy to make your cocktail super strong if you like!  <br>You basically have to accept that your night out is going to be a little on the expensive side since the cocktails and wines aren&#39;t cheap but I would say they&#39;re definitely worth it. <br>Make sure and reserve ahead of time too since they book up fast and they only run two sittings on weekend nights - although if you want to eat at 5.30pm and be out of there by 7.30pm that&#39;s not so much of a problem!",

"reviewcomment":"Yet another great recommendation compliments of Molly V. (see below!)  She talked about it so much at our office that I just had to try it. I can only give Koreaner 4 stars because the food did not blow my mind, BUT (and this is a very big but) I have never had Korean food before this experience....so I had no previous standard for comparison. That is not to say that Koreaner wasn&#39;t delicious, because it was! However, I need to try more than one Korean dish in my lifetime to know if this place really deserves that 5th star.<br><br>What I can say is this.... what this place lacks in size, it makes up for in its ability to dish out a tasty, spicy meal (I ate the Schweinebauch) in a large portion that will not only fill you up, but make you want to come back and try more of their menu! As for the spicy kick to the dishes....I get that this doesn&#39;t appeal to the tastebuds of some of the locals. Tough, get over it....I love my asian food to make my nose run and my eyes water a little bit. I think it adds to the experience ; ) <br><br>The cost is reasonable too. My meal, including drink, was only 7€.....definitely something I look for in a lunchtime meal (I call it my cost to quality to quantity ratio haha)<br><br>I WILL be back here again....and again....and again",

Wrong!<br><br>Maredo Grill Skewer:<br>Rump steak, onions and peppers served with fries, herb butter and Papa Asada with sour cream. With all these things going on in my plate, how come there was no flavor? I tend to avoid salt but I found myself with the salt shaker in hand.<br><br>Rib-Eye:<br>Very tiny piece of meat. It had no flavor. <br><br>Salad Buffet:<br>This is the only good thing they had going on. This is because you can get your own food without having to wait for your server. The selection of veggies, dressings and toppings were pretty good.<br><br>This place is comparable to Chilli&#39;s or Applebee&#39;s with horrible service and worse food but you pay about 15% more. Our server kept forgetting what we haven&#39;t placed our order, kept forgetting what we ordered and kept forgetting o give us the check. Stay away even if you&#39;re starving to death.",

"reviewcomment":"It&#39;s really a 3.5-star experience, but they definitely deserve more than 3 stars so I bump up.<br><br>We came on a Friday evening, and as expected, the place was packed and lively. The music was a bit loud for conversations, so with not-so-cold weather, we opted to sit outside.<br><br>Service was good. We got our drinks and food within reasonable waiting time (less than 15 minutes or so), and we usually got our requests (silverware, plate, the check) without much hassle.<br><br>We got Bruschetta and Salat Mango for starters, and both were nicely made. I then had Tagliatelle with sockeye salmon, zucchini, and dill cooked in a vodka-based cream sauce. I enjoyed the dish except it was served with sooooo much pasta (more than 0.5 lb/200 g) that I couldn&#39;t finish the pasta. My friends had the Wiener Schnitzel (made of veal) with potato salad/home fries, and while the schnitzel were good, both potato dishes were heavy to eat. Basically, we got served with more food than we could eat, which should be a good thing but not for our figures.<br><br>I would go back there again for the lively ambience and to try the salads (I saw other diners eating them, and they looked good).",

"reviewcomment":"Hipster wieners... by far my favorite type of wiener.<br><br>My girl Mandy L and I decided to dip our sticks into some German wurst after a fortunate sequence of events involving a long cocktail nearby and then seeing a sidewalk sign for vegan wurst in a place that looked about as colorful and cheeky as we were feeling after the aforementioned cocktail... so naturally, we decided to head in. <br><br>Plus, they had a Friday night beer special special that we were mighty interested in. Super clutch in order to keep our buzz going.  <br><br>Inside was packed to the brim with a mix of Deutsch hipsters and yuppies, which I rather enjoyed. It was one of the first places we went to where everyone seemed to be in about our same age range. <br><br>Mandy and I ordered at the counter and split a vegan curry wurst, some chips, and a big-ass beer... that we drank with straws because we were just the right amount of drunk to want to pretend it was a malt shop milkshake. <br><br>They have tongue-in-cheek art and sausage-related sayings on the wall along with a single television that played America&#39;s Funniest Home videos circa 1991. Niiiice. <br><br>Our wurst was pretty darn good for a vegan sausage... just know that brats aren&#39;t served on buns here like in America... which we did not realize until after the fact. I loved the pototoes while my more health conscious dining partner steered clear. <br><br>It wasn&#39;t enough of a meal for 2 people to split (not that it&#39;s intended to be split), but it was a decent-ish snack and I think it all came out to around 12 Euro with the special. Personally, I think I&#39;d have to order two plates of wurst and side for myself in order to get full, but then again, I am an American and I do love me some hearty (and not-heart-healthy) portions.",

You can be happy any time you go there! This was a time ago our very much beloved restaurant for quick decisions to eat out BECAUSE IT´S CHEAP, FAST, GOOD IN TASTE and it even serves BIG PORTIONS!<br>Easy concept, works great. Staff most often is not over the edge friendly, but this is just part of a great deal otherwise! <br>Go there for a cheap and good meal in a nice ambiance! I miss it!",

Went there last Sunday with friends and we will be back for sure.<br>Waiter very nice was able to accomodate our special needs concerning the food.<br>He took care of my wifes glutamate situation and recommended items of the menu which did fit here needs. After I gave him my talk about the stuff I cannot eat e.g. not gluten, no nuts, no milk and eggs f he tweaked some dishes for me the way I was able to enjoy great asian food.<br>I can recommend this restaurant, in the back of the room they have a cozy space where you can relax and hang out. <br><br>Only downside the restaurant is in a tight neighborhood with almost no parking space.<br>We left the car down the road on a Lidl parking lot hoping not to be towed by end of the dinner. Lucky us the car was still there.",

"reviewcomment":"I went there for a Brunch on Sunday and it was so far the best I have experienced in Munich. The place is very comfy if you get one of the table with the couches (that&#39;s what we had XD). The decoration is nice and there is some art on display all around the place , so I suppose it is changing quite often. <br>We had the chance to have a pianist playing right next to us, which was sooo nice. The songs were all lounge jazz, very relaxing and perfect to make you feel good despite a rainy day.<br>The brunch is around 20€, it&#39;s worth it: for that you have a buffet with a large variety of tasty choices (a mix of salty/sweet things, fresh juices/cold drinks). Warm drinks and alcoholic beverages cost extra though.<br>I recommend the pancakes with bacon and eggs of course, but to my surprise the croissants/baguettes were also really nice ! (I&#39;m French and usually disappointed with that kind of food in Germany...maybe I&#39;m just too picky, but this one got my approval :) !).<br>They pay attention to the way how they are displaying the food. For example: the salads are in some little glass jars... so cute.<br>The waiters are also friendly, even if the place is quite crowded due to their reputation. I think they should get some additional staff.<br>Don&#39;t forget to book a table and you are good to go!",

"reviewcomment":"I rarely feel compelled to write a review but this place was just too good not to shower with praise. <br><br>Everything was top notch. Food, service, atmosphere (the only caveat being that it felt like the lighting was a bit harsh, would be nice if they turned down their overhead lights a bit. Very small issue relative to everything else). <br><br>We had the five course tasting menu with a few surprises thrown in + the wine pairings. The menu ran the gamut in preparation and food variety. <br><br>-Started with smoked goose breast and beats. Perfect palette cleanser to start the meal.<br>-squid with ink and fennel salad<br>- an absolutely delish baked cheese called Arunda (from a cow owned by Broeding!) with radioccio and an amazing sauce (my favorite dish of the night). The wine pairing for this dish was incredible. Rarely have I had a wine that felt so perfect for a specific dish. Both the flavors in the wine and the dish were elevated by each other. Magnifique! <br>*Seeing how much we loved this dish the server actually gave us a second helping! That was a first for me. So awesome.<br>- Char with Shitake and eggplant. Another supremely delicious course<br>- Ox sous vide with stuffed zuchinni blossom and red peppers<br>- Pear sorbet<br>- Nougat-Mousse with pears (one of the best desserts I&#39;ve had in recent memory)<br><br>As extraordinary as the food was, the service may have been even better. With each pour of wine, our server (somalier?) told us the story of where the wine came from. It was fun chatting with him. He was very engaged and clearly very passionate about his work but not overbearing. The rest of the service was extremely professional and warm. It hit just the right balance of attentiveness without coddling. <br><br>The bill of just over 200 euros (for 2) felt like a bargain based on the quality of the experience. I couldn&#39;t recommend this place more highly. GO TONIGHT!",

"reviewcomment":"El Gordo Loco now has the honor of being placed on my &#34;Good Mexican Restaurants in Munich&#34; list. <br><br>I went there with a group of 10 on a moderately busy night. There was also another large group, so I wasn&#39;t expecting quick service. However, that wasn&#39;t the case. I was amazed how quickly we received our drinks, appetizers, entrees, rounds of shots, etc. The staff made it look effortless AND still had time to stand around and talk. I don&#39;t know what they&#39;ve figured out when it comes to efficient service, but I wish they would share the secret with other restaurants around the city.<br><br>The drink menu doesn&#39;t include much that you haven&#39;t probably already seen before, but they are still made well and certainly not lacking in the alcohol department. Expect the standard Munich prices here. As for the appetizers, here is where I must dock El Gordo Loco one star. Eight euros for some chips and guacamole dip?....SERIOUSLY?! The price combined with the not-so good chips (they tasted stale in my opinion) is really just not worth it. I also ordered the dates wrapped in bacon(.....don&#39;t judge me...I was super hungry haha). Yet another disappointment. I only received 6 dates on the plate and two of them were TINY. To compensate for the plate being otherwise empty, there is a huge mound of salad in the middle.That&#39;s an okay trade-off right?<br><br>My dinner was the empanadas that are listed in the restaurants &#34;specialties&#34; section of their menu. I hope nobody was watching me eat this, because I probably looked disgusting with how fast I ate it....it was seriously that good. I was almost (key word...ALMOST) embarrassed about how clean my plate was. I thought they tasted authentic, and that&#39;s basically what I want when I&#39;m craving Mexican food.<br><br>Two thumbs up, aside from the appetizer menu that just didn&#39;t really float my boat. Overall, I think you should check it out!",

"reviewcomment":"World-class restaurant with everything you&#39;d expect: high end service, high end prices, and high end ingredients. I had the 5 course tasting menu which was more than enough and they were nice about doing only a few glasses of wine (which were excellently paired) instead of the full wine tasting. <br><br>They are strict about dress code -- they turned away a european couple in front of me who had capri pants on. They did let me in with jeans but I did have a jacket and dress shirt.<br><br>They were great about accommodating food allergies and overall with anything you asked. I&#39;d say the only minor quibble I had if I had to compare them to someplace like Jean George is that when they served the meals, there wasn&#39;t much fanfare. They didn&#39;t have multiple servers unveil/deliver the plates at once and they didn&#39;t talk through what you&#39;re eating. That said, that isn&#39;t a big deal and I still had an amazing time here.",

"reviewcomment":"This food is amazing!! Simply the best Indian food in Munich!<br>____________<br>Update, 1 year later<br><br>I have been out of the city for a year, and since then I have been to Indian restaurants in New York, San Francisco, Paris and other cities. Also have learned to cook Indian food (buying many books and experimenting). My wife and I always search for the best Indian in the city when we travel, and when we came back to Ganga, our minds were blown... again.<br><br>First of all, we are Vegan and were Vegetarian when we first found out about Ganga, so our experiences are without any meat dishes. We tend to notice subtleties in our food as we are both cook ourselves and can pick apart flavors to recreate dishes.<br><br>Ganga has again come through with some amazing dishes. The thing that sets Ganga apart from other Indian restaurants is that the food just tastes fresh. You can discern individual ingredients in the food. The colors are bright and the curry dishes aren&#39;t over cooked. The curry base isn&#39;t thick and bland like it is at other restaurants. Each dish has a UNIQUE flavor, instead of everything tasting similar. The spices are strong and fresh as well. We never leave the place without being absolutely stuffed and happy, that&#39;s for sure.<br><br>As everyone should know, in München, every restaurant is proud of the beer they serve and have logos on the outside just to tell you what they serve. Ganga serves something you don&#39;t see too often in Munich, but it is a Bavarian beer, Kulmbacher. Out favorite by far is the Kapuziner Weißbier, and the Kapuziner Weißbier Dunkel. Such smooth, flavorful beers. Nothing is quite like it at all, very, very good.<br><br>Lastly, the service, is very good. The staff is very friendly and it feels like a family owned operation. At least I know that two of the wait staff are brother and sister. They work quite hard, even when the place is so busy you can&#39;t find a seat. They have always been pleasant to us and they speak English well. Or they will even help us practice our German. <br><br>All in all however, this restaurant is a gem. I feel very lucky to have found it in our travels and will be back every time I am in München.",

I was there on a Saturday night and though it was busy, the staff remained friendly and other guests didn&#39;t seem to mind shuffling around so you could find yourself a nice spot. I couldn&#39;t help but laugh when I turned around and saw a couple (possibly in their late 60&#39;s) both reading their newspapers while gulping down their beers. It just emphasized to me that this really is a place for everyone. The atmosphere is great and I love how the owners have not tried to restore anything. <br><br>I&#39;ll definitely make a stop here for drinks the next time I go out for dinner in the University area : )",

"reviewcomment":"This was the first Indian restaurant I went in Munich. I had no clue where to go and I did not know Yelp at that time, therefore I had to look elsewhere for suggestions of a good Indian restaurant. This is how I ended up landing in GOA.<br><br>They renovated a bit the decor since my first time there. I am glad they did, it was really necessary. It did not look bad before just a bit aged. The place is not huge and there are not that many tables, and some of them are not very well positioned, especially the ones close to the entrance. This can be a bit annoying, when frequency of clients coming in and out is high. Due to the limited number of tables, if you are planning to go there around 8 pm, I strongly recommend making a reservation, as it can get pretty packed in the evening.<br><br>The staff is very cordial but not necessarily friendly. Sometimes they can be a bit unconventional. For instance, once I went there alone and was seating in a small two-person table, they politely asked me to share the table with some other person, who I did not know. I have no problem doing that in a Biergarten, or when the table is bigger, but the food itself was already taking the other half of the table. That seemed a bit over the top at that time.<br><br>As an appetizer, I usually order the &#34;Vegetable Samosa&#34;, which are very seasoned and usually very hot. And I mean not only the spice level. It is better to cut them in half and let them cool down a bit. <br><br>But what they definitely do best is their main dishes, and I really adore their &#34;Subzi Malai Kofta&#34;, the 3 balls are made with a potato-cheese base and with almonds. It is definitely one of the best I had in Munich. For couples or lone rangers, a good compromise are the Thalis both vegetable and non-vegetable ones. Then, you can taste various dishes without ordering too much. And all those dishes and go really well with their Naan bread, which is really good but not the best I had in Munich so far.<br><br>Mango Lassi fans out there, don&#39;t think twice, order the bigger one, you will love it! This is one of the best I had in Munich.<br><br>For the quality and taste of their food, I consider GOA one of the top Indian restaurants here in Munich.",

"reviewcomment":"A friend took me to this place for a tea and it&#39;s all good! <br>I love tea time in general and all the atmosphere that is linked to it. <br>I can say that this place is a peaceful heaven for the 3 times I went there for a tea. The decor is japanese inspired: wood and pale colours. Different kind of tables, seats are available and also a terrace when the weather is nice!<br>My only cold comment would be about the service on the terrace. When it is crowded you may have to go to the counter to order, but in general the waiters are nice.<br><br>Now about the taste experience: I only went there for tea and cakes but I saw some other tables ordering some main dishes. They look very healthy and maybe i will try one the next time.<br><br>Teas are quite expensive, but they have a very nice Matcha that you don&#39;t find everywhere else. Also, I try a green tea and a fruity one: I wasn&#39;t disappointed! It was very good.<br>The cakes are just divine!! Seriously, I didn&#39;t know that vegan cakes could be that good.<br><br>The plus: You can buy some porcelain cups and bags of tea directly there.",

"reviewcomment":"I guess i was unlucky since my wife was in Centro Español two more times and very satisfied. But when I was there the food was quite disappointing, in terms of quality and the way it was cooked. Mussels really without taste and meat plate abs under normal taste. We had though a good wine and antipasto. At the end the dessert was something you can cook quite easily at home (vanilla pudding) for 1/5 of the price. All in all quite disappointing dinner for two for almost 80 euro. I&#39;ll give a last chance, but this time I was really unsatisfied.",

The serving was super generous, although you pay a bit more than you would at neighboring Dean and David&#39;s, it was worth it in my opinion. <br><br>The spices at table were also nice and added a pleasant kick to my curry (even though the menu said it was &#34;scharf&#34;). Apparently german&#39;s have a different tolerance for spicyness. My friend was not too happy when I told him the red pepper sauce was &#34;a little spicy&#34;.<br><br>I think some people next to us had the Pad Thai, which also looked great, something I&#39;m looking forward to trying next time (soon!)",

"reviewcomment":"Beim Sedlmayr am Viktualienmarkt is &#39;just&#39; like any Bavarian beer hall (minus a live band!).<br><br>The food quality is good, simple and tasty. Some populate dishes run out over the course of the evening, but that&#39;s normal. Note also that the menu alternates on specific days. For instance one of my favourites &#39;Spanferkel&#39; is not available on Tuesdays. Luckily the Sweinebraten is also very nice. <br><br>I was really impressed how quickly everything is served, waiting time for the stock dishes is minimal. <br><br>Also impressive was one of the ladies serving us during our second visit. I was in the mood for sauerkraut but my Spanferkl came with a knödl. So I asked if the knödl could be replaced by sauerkraut. No problem. However that would sort of make the side salad superfluous as that was also considered veggies. So the waitress suggested I would replace the knödl with brattkartoffeln and the side salad with the sauerkraut. <br><br>I really love it when people serving in a restaurant think your changes to a dish through, understand what you want and then improve my suggestion. Perfect!<br><br>Like all traditional large Bavarian restaurants, don&#39;t expect a quiet atmosphere. The place is quite lively. Also expect to be seated next to strangers. <br><br>You can pay with cards (EC for certain!)",

But the staff was friendly and we got our orders pretty quick.<br><br>Good longdrinks and not too expensive. Even a few non alcoholic ones. Really good Lemon Squash (5€ and some cents)<br><br>We went here on a Saturday. All burgers from the menu only 7.40€! Had the BBQ Bacon Burger with cheese and fries on the side. Good size and great fries! The mixed salad was pretty good as well, and a lot of it.<br><br>Very noisy and packed but around 11pm it was getting better. I&#39;ll definitely come back again.",

"reviewcomment":"This place is literally one minute from us so it&#39;s a bit strange that over the last three years we&#39;ve only been in for drinks or a quick bite, never for a proper dinner. Until now that is. A timely Yelp-event made us take the leap and have dinner there in the excellent company of a bunch of other Yelpers. Honestly I was a little bit disappointed; I expected more from this restaurant, which clearly has amassed a good reputgation. Having said that, the wines that we tried (a Sauvignon Blanc, a Chardonnay and a Shiraz, all from Israel) were pretty good, and I liked the mixed appetizers a lot. But the main courses were not quite as interesting as I hoped for (a salad with seared tuna for me, and scallops for the wifey). Prices were definitely on the high side. Our neighbor&#39;s Zanderfilet looked very good though and he was very happy with it, nearly as happy as with his dessert. They get three solid stars, but for the price we paid, I had expected another notch of culinary experience. We should be back, considering how close by they are, but this is the slam dunk that never was. Not yet anyway.",

"reviewcomment":"When I am in the area, I will walk completely out of the way just so I can walk past Götterspeise. There is just something about looking at their window displays that makes me happy and say to myself &#34;I want to buy all of it&#34;. I think the shop does a great job capturing that whimsical feeling, and you can tell they really pride themselves on that.<br><br>The inside of the shop, albeit a bit cramped, is just as well-organized and decorated as the windows. Other than perhaps Dallmayr, I think this shop has one of  the best food display//layout/presentation in the city. Okay okay....I get it....nobody cares as much as I do about this, so I&#39;ll move onto the chocolate.<br><br>It&#39;s to die for. That&#39;s all you really need to know. I had a slice of their Banana Chocolate Truffel Torte, and it&#39;s basically. All I could think about the rest of the day. It was that delicious. My friend said her slice of cake was just as yummy, but I wouldn&#39;t know because we refused to share a single bite of our treats hahah. I have nothing but nice things to say about Götterspeise. Really....just go. Like right now. Unless &#34;right now&#34; is Sunday, because they&#39;re closed. AND sit outside and stay a while. The only regret you might have is staying so long that you buy another round of chocolate and cakes.",

Pure Burrito is to burritos as McDonalds is to burgers. You know it&#39;s not the best you can have, but it just tastes soooo good you can&#39;t resist it. <br><br>I would never say Pure Burrito has the best burritos in Munich, because there are plenty of tasty, authentic Mexican ones to be found around town. However, if it&#39;s a Chipotle, Salsalitas, or Qdoba that you crave, then this is as close as you&#39;ll get.    <br><br>Because this is a quick service place, there isn&#39;t too much atmosphere, but you&#39;ll probably be too busy stuffing that burrito in your face to really care hahah. <br><br>I personally really like the food here, and haven&#39;t ever found it particularly dry, but then again....I am NOT judging this against the REAL Mexican offerings in the city, I&#39;m judging it as a fast food style burrito joint (because that&#39;s what it is).

"reviewcomment":"I got to know this restaurant through a recommendation from a friend. She said so many good things about it. Thus, I just had to try it. Compared to the other Indian restaurants I already went in Munich this is one has simple but nice interior, not overwhelming at all.<br><br>I was already two times there. On the first time I had a &#34;Malai Kofta&#34;, which is the first one I always try, given that it is my favorite.  It seems every Indian restaurant has a slightly different recipe for this dish: sometimes it is very spicy, other times not at all; sometimes the croquette balls are made with a cheese base, other times with potato base; sometimes with almonds, other times with cashews. Their version is with a vegetable-potato base with cashews and not so spicy. I found this version very tasty, but I still prefer the ones that are cheese based.<br><br>The second dish I tried was &#34;Chana Masala&#34; which is usually made mostly with chickpeas. But their version is called &#34;Alu Chana Masala&#34; and this actually a mix of chickpeas and potatoes.  I also tasted very good, but I really prefer chickpeas over potatoes.  My next time there I am going to try the &#34;Palak Paneer&#34; (cheese and spinach).<br><br>Since I don&#39;t Like rice so much, I always go for the Naan bread, at least two pieces. Certainly the Naan there is one of the best ones I had here in Munich: reasonable size, not to oily, and very fresh and tasty. In fact, I think that the main reason I really like it there is their Naan. Just delicious!<br><br>Now I really feel like going there again!!!",

From inside just above the door you find a giant cowboy mannequin smoking cigar, which was fun...<br><br>Food was outstanding, service A class. Very friendly staff... Though I went over a weekend, but got relatively good service. Not as super quick, but OK... They dont accept cards, so make sure you got cash.. <br><br>For whiskey aficionados, they have damn neat collection.. I relived mexican days here... will go again for sure.... :)",

"reviewcomment":"This is one of those typical traditional Bavarian restaurants in Munich. It was my first time here. Came on a Friday at around 2 p.m. <br>Place was still packed, had to go to the first floor to get a table.<br>Setting is rustic, which is what you expect. Service is prompt and very friendly.  Atmosphere is very lively and you hear a lot of different languages, which makes this place quite international.<br>Extensive selection of different beers and liquors with the emphasis on Bavaria and Germany.<br>Food selection include all those Bavarian classics which you could imagine.<br>We opted for beef goulash with spatzle, the beef tender, juicy and well seasoned. The other dish we had was baked calfs head with potato and cucumber salad. The meat was very tender, almost melting in your mouth. It was the first time for me but I have to say that I liked it very much and can only recommend it even the dish might sound a little adventurous.<br>All in all, good value for money!

Munich- city of meats and potatoes with all things heavy and meaty.  God~ after all that alcohol in Oktoberfest- I need me some carb and spice! Ramen being one of my loves, this place was a given.<br><br>First off: this place only have 6 tables! Came here for lunch before hitting that crazy Munich&#39;s Oktoberfest festival-best idea ever. Walked in right as they opened their doors at noon. Got seated right next to the window. Yey!  (Got the take out the night before but didn&#39;t get that ramen since it&#39;s hard to eat it in the hotel room)<br><br>Ramen- yummm ramen!  yumm yumm! I don&#39;t know if it was because I have been traveling in Europe for a whole month without Ramen or if it is really that magical. I&#39;ll go with it was that magical! I had their Tonkatsu with a bowl of salmon rice. It was delish! And they gave me peppers. Really spicy peppers. <br><br>So tasty, I went back for dinner the very same night all hungover post-oktoberfest! Dinner wasn&#39;t as lucky. Had to wait 45 minutes for that little table but got seated in the same place. We lost some of our friends in the Oktoberfest and they actually found us here after like 8 hours! Crazy right?  (They totally know my crazy love for Ramen!) Had the same spicy ramne, tonkatsu ramen, rice bowls! <br><br>Service was nice. Only one girl spoke english and she helped us a lot both time. The rest only speak english and german. I would&#39;ve went to the kitchen and pointed out my food if all else fail but  I didn&#39;t have to. Overall, this place was my favorite in Munich. Ramen is kind of like water. You can have it pretty much anytime. At least for me anyway! And this place serve a darn good one for me. <br><br>I&#39;d happily come back on my next Germany trip for a bite or 10 of it :)))",

"reviewcomment":"It has been a while since I wrote my first review and since then, we have become regulars here and, therefore, time for me to update my review.<br><br>As I have discovered in the last few months ordering things that are not popular or unusual from Indian restaurants is, a &#34;hit and miss&#34; and I have stopped trying to order things I ate in India. Maybe it is because of lack of demand and not enough practice making it.<br><br>The dishes like Palak Paneer, Dal Makhani, Chicken Tikka Masala, Lamb Roganjosh and others are always excellent and the naan and rotis are served nice and hot and taste fabulous.<br><br>The service has improved significantly and it has made for a great experience in recent times. We go back here regularly and have enjoyed it each and every time.<br><br>I also discovered they make a proper Indian Chai here that is, spicy, milky, sickly sweet and served super hot....wunderbar :-) took me back to the streets of Mumbai instantly :-))",

"reviewcomment":"After a long hectic schedule ( and a forced hibernation on this forum, owing to occupation hazards), one of the weekends i happen to accost this place with a bunch of good local friends. My first impression was it will be expensive by looking at the attire and grandeur look it possess and the very location of this cafe. But I was wrong, it took me by surprise as i happen to realize it is not at all as expensive as it looks. <br><br>Moving ahead from aesthetics, lets get to the most important ingredient of the review. The eateries. I haven&#39;t seen any place with such a large collection of cakes, pastries and wonderful delicacy which could rejoice your mouth buds. I must say, your sweet buds will thank you a ton for visiting this place. one more thing which striked me was its immaculate, STYLISH presentation which could sweep away the ground beneath your feet if you are an connoisseur of beauty around. you can get your choice of stuff packed in the most amazing away which could work as a fantabulous offering for gifting someone.  <br><br>Its no brainer now, to give a heads up that the place on weekends of course is crowded, normally during afternoons. You might have to stay a while, usually 10 min, to occupy a place. Even though the place is quite big, and has plenty of sitting arrangement, but still I am afraid its crowded. <br><br>Coming to service, you can happily afford to give them a breathing space. The service staff are taxed and extremely busy. And looking at them, honestly you don&#39;t get annoyed but empathize. they are quite generous too...And hence even though service might not be top notch but still there are many other things that make up for it. Not everything comes in one package. <br><br>So in nut shell, a must visit. Take your girlfriend here and she will like you forever.. :)<br>if you single then do visit here with friends on a nice afternoon and enjoy the place.",

"reviewcomment":"This is probably my favourite Irish pub in Munich.  The door into Molly&#39;s isn&#39;t just a door.  It&#39;s a portal to a wonderland of mirth and merriment.<br><br>Molly&#39;s is packed every evening of the week, which should tell you something about a) the loving loyalty of the patrons who come here, and b) the wonderfulness of getting to spend a couple hours here.  Reservations are always recommended<br><br>The food is spot on, and the bangers and mash are the best in Munich.  I&#39;d recommend against the burgers, and would suggest instead going either for any one of the Irish dishes or for one of the curries.  The bacon (for the burgers) should in particular be avoided because it comes out more steamed than fried and is kind of limp and chewy as a result.  The breakfast is REALLY good here, and a perfect way to cure a hangover.<br><br>Needless to say, the whiskey selection here is excellent.  The staff is almost always really friendly and courteous, though there is one girl behind the bar there that I&#39;d rather not be served by, if it can be avoided.  Everyone else is great though, and really make you feel almost like you&#39;re just hanging out in your own living room.<br><br>Actually, that&#39;s just it.  Molly&#39;s is the place you go when you just want to relax and feel as comfortable as if you were in your own living room.  But this living room happens to offer Guinness, food, and whiskey.",

I didn&#39;t think so at all. High end, yes, but Whole Foods is more expensive and not nearly as fun. <br><br>This historic building is overflowing with gorgeous selections of chocolates, cheeses, teas, spices, gourmet oils, kitchenware... I spent about an hour indulging my senses and bought some delightful candies, those cool sugar crystal rocks for coffee, teas, and cheese knives. A busy, bustling vibe and a feast for the senses. Great place to buy gifts to take home. I never even made it upstairs!",

Wasn&#39;t disappointed. Sat next to Lehman, the soccer goalie....didn&#39;t have a clue who he was but my German colleagues pointed this out. Anyway, the place was somewhat full around 8pm when we arrived. By 10pm it was packed. I found the staff to be really nice and attentive. Typical boisterous Greeks but in a good way. Further, I found the food to be very good. It wasn&#39;t gourmet food but very good. Most of us had seafood and one of my colleagues even commented that it was the best calamari that he ever had. I had the swordfish and was quite pleased with the dish. The restaurant has a great (large) outdoor area and a nice interior indoors. I had a good time and and found the best part of this place to be the prices. It was surprisingly fair in regards to status of this place, location and what you get. I&#39;ll probably be back at some point. I&#39;d come more for the food than the crowd though. I&#39;m not into the &#34;see and be seen&#34; crowd and this is definitely a magnet for them.

"reviewcomment":"Well, this review needs special focus, for - a) this review from me is after a long time &amp; b) I want this place to have what it deserves, i.e. every cent and nickel &amp; dime of a 5 star. Also, please note that I am foodie to the core who values ambience and grandeur as much as the quality of the food and service. With all these combinations I can claim without any shadows of doubt that dinner at Atelier was indeed one of the few which has taken my gastric pleasure to orgasmic level...  <br><br>It all started with a fine evening where we wanted to try something special. I had reserved the place and went with a small group. First appearance you see the grandeur of the hotel which is nice and pleasing. There are three restaurants here - (i) Atelier (ii) Garden restaurant and third I don&#39;t remember. We had gone to atelier and is called as Michelin 1 star. The restaurant has a modern vibe, and was empty when we arrived. But we arrived quite early at 6:00 so it was understandable. The first thing that strikes you is their very attentive staff, all to ourselves. Well, you can expect the same in a Michelin restaurant but still it worthy of a note and appreciation.  <br><br>We opted for the 5-course chef menu with wines to match. Though it was a 5-course menu, it went actually an 8-course menu, as we got 3 dishes as complimentary from chef. The combination of dish had varieties from fish, and beef, oyster etc. except chicken. Food for the most creative, innovative, and had interesting combinations and flavors. The wine selections was impressive... international varietals that strongly gelled with the food. A nice touch that I have not seen before....they leave the bottle of the wine being served at the table in case you would like some more.... The highlight of the day was a cheese show. They bought a cart which was full of cheese with various flavor and sauces. At least there were around 12-14 varieties of cheese from very strong to plain with combinatory sauces. Of course they will explain about all the varieties of cheese and while serving they do it intelligently and has to be eaten in clockwise direction starting from 8&#39;O clock, as you go forward you have strong flavors of cheese. <br><br>The whole review will not be complete until we mention Enrico Spannenkrebs and his whole team. The whole team were indeed quite suave, quite generous and helpful. They recommended all the great wines, and also one amongst us was not a beef eater so he got recommended some yummy fish based dish. they all gave adequate explanations about food &amp; wine. <br><br>In the end, once you are done you get a signed copy of the menu they provided us and with wine listing. The dessert were really very innovative and one of the very first of my kinds. On expenses part of course you be ready to loosen the wallet a bit... <br><br>To all, who have a desire to have a special dining on one fine day, I would highly recommend this place",

"reviewcomment":"WOW!<br><br>I found so many pleasant surprises when I finally decided to try my luck with this little gem.  For the longest time had I avoided twinkling my toes up the steps into their little sanctuary of nourishment for two reasons:<br><br>1)  I had incorrectly presumed that being sandwiched between the Universität on one side and the English Garden on the other, that it would be flooded with what we Americans affectionately call &#34;douchebags&#34;, and <br>2)  in my experience, places named after their street address are overpriced and try too hard to make themselves exclusive with little to substantiate.<br><br>My bad.  Apologies extended.<br><br>First, the menu is perfectly within reason for its location in Munich.  To give you an idea, we had two piadini, two bagels, and three Schorle for just under €20.  I glanced at the Tageskarte, and most dishes seemed in the €7-15 range, with tasty options ranging from pasta to pork to vegetarian.<br><br>The design of the place is great too.  There are two rooms, one being somewhat dimly lit, and the other making grand use of its large windows.  I sat in the one with grand windows, which also contained a bar area and a cute little &#34;cafe counter&#34;.<br><br>It took a few moments before I realised my posterior was comfortable esconced on a former foyer-bench, and our table was in fact a repurposed schooldesk.  Upon studying the room more closely, I became more impressed by how well the various collections of furniture had been coordinated and brought to work together:  a cozy couch paired with cinema seating around a massive table; an ornately painted green table whisking one away on its matching chairs to a beach resort atmosphere;  striped textile stools matching in colour to the block designs painted on the neighbouring wall, etcetera...<br><br>The outdoor seating feels like a dockside restaurant/bar/grille, and I look forward to making use of it on a sunny day when I return here.  Even outside, seemingly every type of outdoor seating imaginable has been made available, whether benches, wooden chairs, or even leather/pleather armchairs.  For you nic addicts, smoking is outside.<br><br>The only drawbacks were the really loud music and the distracted service.  I was happy that the music was at least not the radio, but it was so loud that I could barely hear across the table.  Secondly, our waitress was so distracted that she would turn away from the waist for the slightest distraction even while we were actively speaking to her.  Was she awaiting friends, or perhaps a super hot guy who always comes in at that time?  Also, she could have told us the first time that we wanted to pay that one has to go up to the cute little cafe counter, as opposed to just walking away the first two times, leaving us to presume that she would return shortly with the check.  That added about 30 extra minutes to us sitting at our admittedly cozy schooldesk.<br><br>So...now that school is out for the summer, you know where to go.",

Not like typical restaurants, where they defy every conventional logic and try to utilize every inch of space into a meaningful spot for extra bucks (which is not bad, but at times it looses its aesthetics when it gets crowded). So, yeah the place is quite spacious. Apparently also I am being told this is a prefect spot to hang out for football matches which I realized when I saw at least 3 large LCD&#39;s hanging out in three different sections of the restaurant. I was told during champions league and other high octane football matches its jam packed. So thus this place, definately gets additional points for sports lovers like me. <br><br>Coming to food, they are pretty decent. Not so bad, and not so &#39;muaaah&#39; out of the world too... Price front they are not expensive at all. My friends tried various forms of burgers and salads which they liked pretty much. Cant say much about food, as in my first visit I had very little delicacies. <br><br>Overall, A fun place to hangout with a group and specially when you want to watch a match not in your living room. Will surely visit again.",

"reviewcomment":"Bei Mario is one of the oldest (if not the oldest) italian restaurants in Munich and you can see why. <br>Everyone is so friendly and, although it&#39;s a little dim &amp; has very low ceilings in places it&#39;s definitely worth a trip. <br>The food is great and the prices are amazing - at least they are at lunch time (I&#39;ve never actually been in the evening). <br>They do special menus during the day for around €8 you get a salad, pizza/pasta and a desert.  Make sure and check online what day to go though because it&#39;s a specific pizza and pasta each day.  <br>They&#39;re very quick too so it&#39;s a great place to go for a quick work lunch.",

It&#39;s a great chicken dish that allows you to try 3 different marinades. <br>I would have never imagined what Pakistani food tasted like or that I would even like their food, but it&#39;s great. I am a fan!  <br>Deeba is a small restaurant right off the Tram 27 line near the museums. The staff is super friendly and very attentive. They are seamlessly switching between German and English depending the guest.<br><br>If you&#39;re looking for some great Pakistani food or to try something new, I would highly recommend checking Deeba out!  Due to the size of the restaurant I would always call first though to make sure you can get a table!",

"reviewcomment":"Oh. My. GAWWWWWWD!!<br><br>I love this little gem of a restaurant/lounge.  First, they mix some really interesting cocktails, including some with their own homemade liquor!  While I always try to support local cuisine and products, I won&#39;t if it/they don&#39;t taste good.  THESE TASTE GOOD!  Things got a little blurry, so I&#39;m not sure what all I tried.  I will say this:  once I had gotten over my disappointment in the Old Fashioned that they mixed for me (faaar too sweet, too watery, used soda without asking if I preferred soda or water), and started dibbling and dabbling with the pisco and splishing splashing with their home mixes, I was, to quote Olaf from &#34;Frozen&#34;,  a &#34;happy snowman!&#34;<br><br>The music here is great too, which really sets a calming but not sleep-inducing chill ambience.  If you make your reservation early enough, you can take the rear &#34;lounge area&#34; - there is only one booth - for a large gathering of guests, say, for birthday drinks, or a reenactment of &#34;Sex and the City&#34;.<br><br>For food, you&#39;re probably going to be seated on stools at raised tables.  If that doesn&#39;t jiggle your jones, you might want to specify in your reservation that you&#39;d like a normal/low table.<br><br>I&#39;ve mentioned the word &#34;reservation&#34; a couple times now.  This is a hint.  If you would like to patronise this establishment for anything more than early evening drinks, make sure one of the tables has your name on it.  Otherwise, as was my experience, you&#39;ll be giving wistful puppy dog eyes to the next table over as they chow down on amazing smelling grub whilst you pack up your inebriated ass cheeks to go grub somewhere else.<br><br>Best attire for this place is classy casual.  No JV.",

"reviewcomment":"This has gone to the top of my ALL-TIME FAVORITE RESTAURANTS EVER.<br><br>This is a trendy restaurant that is known for their use of interesting (sometimes strange) combination of flavors and foods that come together to make a harmonious and delectable dish. They also have a different menu every night, which is good because it indicates the ingredients are fresh! The atmosphere is very modern and chic, yet the servers wear jeans and a button down shirt with rolled up sleeves. The menu is divided into categories with a few dishes in each. There is an option to have anywhere from 3-7 courses. I decided to go with 4 courses. Since I don&#39;t eat meat, I was apprehensive on what to order. However, they are were very accommodating and told me that whatever I ordered would only contain seafood or vegetables, and in place of the meat would be something different. I wasn&#39;t 100% sure of all of the ingredients being that the menu was in German, but I decided to order the vanilla scallops, eel ravioli, fish with a pineapple and shiitake saute, and chocolate mouse. (Refer to pictures).<br><br>I could go on and on describing the incredible dining experience I had here, but I&#39;ll spare you the pages and pages of detail. All of the courses were perfectly cooked and the flavor combinations went surprisingly well together! One thing I noticed was that they tend to under cook their protein, so if you&#39;re picky about that you might want to tell them how you&#39;d like your meat/seafood to be cooked.<br><br>While the service was friendly, the courses came out very slowly. This isn&#39;t a problem when you&#39;re not in a hurry and want to enjoy each tasting. Just a heads up to expect to be here for at least 2+ hours depending on what you get.<br><br>GO HERE!",

"reviewcomment":"Most days I skip breakfast, but on some very special days (like the ones where I wake up in Germany) I like to really do it up with a monster pretzel, a hot soup, and a giant beer. Just the way Jesus intended breakfast to be.   <br><br>It was 8am, it was 8 degrees, and we had at least 8 more hours to be spent freezing our balls off outside while exploring Munich... It was absolutely a day where that monster pretzel, a hot soup, and giant beer where necessary. <br><br>I walked up to this stand and inquired about their vegetarian soups and happily, they had 5 different meat-less options available right at opening. Yippee!<br><br>I went with their famous ginger carrot soup which was just as flavorful as it was gorgeous. The presentation, especially for coming from what is basically a kiosk, was mighty impressive. So much so that I tacked on a giant pretzel (not made in house, but it made by another vendor in the market) and in the spirit of living in the moment, I threw in a big ass 8am beer as well. I figured that if the soup didn&#39;t keep me warm, the beer would be right there to kick in and get me numb enough to not care.<br><br>The pretzel was as decent as a cold pretzel can be, I guess. I chose to repurpose it by pulling apart bits of it and dropping them in my soup like Bavarian oyster crackers. Which made the whole experience pretty perfect. The soup was outstanding and my meal was enough to completely fill me and my partner up... which was nice because it wasn&#39;t exactly cheap. <br><br>Lastly, one of the best things about this joint (in winter at least) is that they have an indoor and very heated seating area and bar. Clutch in those mega cold Munich winter months.",

"reviewcomment":"Inside is very spacious and the terrace outside is also large. Obviously it&#39;s difficult to find an outside seat when the weather is nice. <br><br>Before I ordered my partner said that the breads/sandwiches/baguettes are usually rather thick and the spread is spread on rather thinly. So that was the mindset before ordering. <br><br>When my 1/2 baguette with tuna salad arrived, it looked like my partner was right. The spread seamed to be spread on like they were running out and had to make it last a few more orders. <br><br>However! The baguette tasted really nice! I squeezed the lemon part out over the spread which gave it a nice sour twang. The amount of bread and spread turned out to be perfect! The salad was very tasty. The small pieces of gherkin were nice. <br><br>The bread was also very nice. <br><br>At first glance the amount of cheese seemed a bit small, but in reality it turned out to be just right. Often you get a &#39;tuna melt&#39; or something similar with just to much cheese on top so the sandwich doesn&#39;t only get very fatty but the tuna taste also gets drowned in the cheese.<br><br>I was trying to compare this baguette with my fav tuna sandwich in Amsterdam, but both are great, simply different. <br><br>The oriental platter was okay, humous was nice but the rest wasn&#39;t to my personal preferences. <br><br>Gärntnerplatz is easily becoming one of my favourite Munich hangouts.",

"reviewcomment":"We happened to see this place on a bike ride through the area and decided to stop for a spot of lunch and I am so glad we did. <br><br>The food here is excellent and the Kellerbier was divine :-)) The falafel for entree was full of flavour and delicious. My kebab main was delicate, tender and full of flavour. The baklava I had for dessert was probably one of the best baklava&#39;s I have ever had and, the coffee was good too.<br><br>All in all a very pleasant experience in nice casual surrounding and very prompt and friendly service with a smile. You could tell most people were locals and knew the staff pretty well.<br><br>Would happily come back here anytime for a meal and, at a minimum come back for more of that heavenly baklava :-)))",

On my second visit I had to try the Cream of Asparagus soup, since &#34;Spargel&#34; was I. Season and it was incredibly good.<br>The atmosphere in the Biergarten is quite pleasant, being that you are outside with no traffic noise.

"reviewcomment":"2.5 stars.<br><br>I was impressed to find out that there was a Chinese hot pot restaurant in Munich (or anywhere else in Germany), so I was pretty excited to check this place out.<br><br>My excitement dropped quickly as soon as we went inside this seemingly huge establishment. Two stories high with really high ceilings and top-to-bottom glass windows, this restaurant is modern but lacks charm (perhaps I expected a more traditional Chinese restaurant setup with its dragon and phoenix wall panel...). The biggest turn-off was the beginning: the service. It was absolute chaos. We had a reservation, and upon arrival, people were waiting, and the manager was frantically running back and forth and somewhat ignored us. When we finally had a chance to tell him we had a reservation, he looked at us in confusion. Luckily, we were only 2 people, so we eventually got a table...only to be kicked off 20 minutes later because the diners next to us told the waiters that they were waiting for 4 more people coming and need more space. Basically, we sat for 20 minutes with no one coming to us, simply watching everyone else around us stuffing their faces with food.<br><br>After that horrendous ordeal (30 minutes after our reservation), we finally got our table. Our server then was nice, and the service was ok. Luckily, the hot pot dinner is self-served, so no need to call the already-chaotic service to get food. We got a beef hot-pot dinner, which came with 2 styles of broth (one spicy and one not), a LOT of raw sliced beef (more than 500 g) for us to cook, and moderate servings of sauces (soy and peanut sauces). The selection of food was decent: a good variety of seafood (shrimps, clams, mussels, squids, crabs), vegetables (mushrooms, tofu, broccoli, etc), and noodles. I mostly ate the seafood, and it was ok-quality. Every diner gets a plate of fruit (oranges and pineapples) after dinner.<br><br>Price is fair enough: 17.80 EUR per person for an all-you-can-eat hot pot buffet. But no ok-quality buffet is going to get me to go back to experience that front service mess again.",

"reviewcomment":"Next time you are near Goetheplatz round lunch time don&#39;t take the easy way and go to the McD. on-site. Better head down Lindwurmstrasse a couple of meters to enjoy a hearty meal to go at this quirky Austrian takeaway. You will get no more than one of the best sandwiches in town! The so called &#34;Grillfleischsandwich&#34; is most likely comparable to a kebab. Plenty of tasty grilled meat, some tomato cubes, a handful of chopped onions and the mega delicious secret sauce sensation &#34;Jahrhundertsauce&#34; &#39;century sauce&#39; !!! This is soul food at its best! And the portion is huge, it will keep you stuffed for hours. The gentleman also sells delicate Salzburger Bosna sausages, those are highly recommended as well. There are two idyllic places nearby where you can enjoy the meaty treats best alongside an ice cold coke on warm summer days: The calming Alter Südfriedhof (Old South Cemetery) and the famous Theresienwiese.",

Both were excellent and the flavours were intense and divine. <br><br>The wine selection was excellent and the wine we chose was exceptionally good and we ended up getting through two bottles of it :-))<br><br>Desserts were a disappointment and that&#39;s a real shame.

"reviewcomment":"It&#39;s not the greatest pizza in Munich (I&#39;ve not yet found that!) but this is a good place to get a quick lunch - a slice of decent pizza.  It&#39;s almost more of a flatbread - thin crust, good texture though, not dry and cracker-like.  Toppings are fresh and well chosen.  <br><br>The order/service process was a little confusing - there may have been table-service but it was not clear.  We just picked out what slice of pizza we wanted at the counter, then the guy popped it in the oven to warm.  Then he motioned us towards the bar to grab a beverage out of the fridge (told us it was self-service) - we had a seat and then he brought us the pizza.  Looks like it&#39;s possible to get it to go too.  <br><br>The whole process was pretty fast (for Munich) and not expensive (pizza slice was maybe €2.70?). We only needed one slice each; if you&#39;re famished you could eat 2 pretty easily.",

"reviewcomment":"Not having a TV and not being German, I had never heard of the TV chef so I was completely unbiased when we arrived at the small restaurant. <br><br>We were pleasantly welcomed and seated. There was a nice selection of welcome drinks, incl three different champagnes (I chose the pink one, which was a bit dryer than I&#39;m used to for pink champagne). Very nice. <br><br>After the first amuse bouche, the chef arrived at our table for two and welcomed us personally. Asked us what kind of menu we were looking forward to. <br><br>We had the 9 course surprise menu (3,5,9 and 12 course menus available). The chef asked us which ingredients he should not use. If during the diner we would think of anything else for him to avoid, just let him know. <br><br>I&#39;m not well versed in the language of wines and didn&#39;t want to drink too much so we opted for a 2 glass wine selection by the house. One glass to complement the first half of our diner and one glass for the second part. <br><br>The wine choice was very nice. A white German wine to go with mainly fish dishes and a bit of poultry. And a nice Austrian red to go with the meat and the other dishes of the second part of our diner. <br><br>Though this wine &#39;option&#39; wasn&#39;t in the menu, it starts with a minimum of three glasses, this is the kind of place where they make you feel that nothing is a bother or a problem. They really want you to get the best experience. <br><br>The diner was pleasantly paced. Never did we have to wait too long for the next dish (we weren&#39;t in a hurry anyway), nor did we ever have to ask for a refill of our sparkling water. <br><br>This is the kind of restaurant that still have enough staff to serve the meals to everyone at a table at the same time.<br><br>After each dish is served you get an explanation of what you see before you. I&#39;ll let the photos I posted speak for themselves. <br><br>The staff was always there but were never a distraction.<br><br>During the presentation of the rather large selection of cheeses (alternative available)  you really notice how well informed the staff is about everything they serve. It&#39;s what you expect but it is still a pleasure to see that the people in a restaurant take the trouble to be good at what they do!<br><br>All in all it was a splendid affair.",

"reviewcomment":"Vapiano: sounds italian, serves italian dishes... but if you want to eat italian better go elsewhere.<br><br>Vapiano looks really nice from outside and from inside, quite luxury in reality. At the entrance you receive a card and everything you take is charged on it, so you can pay at the exit. Even if you take only a coffee at the bar, that what I have done.<br><br>Ok, the espresso was good, however making it is as hard as pushing a button on the coffee machine. But I take advantage of this to see it and I must say, Vapiano is much much much more nearer a fast food than a real restaurant. And looking at their pizza, I&#39;d rather go to eat in a full-american Pizza Hut than there.<br><br>Nothing else to add, I&#39;m really disappointed of so-called restaurants that use a name just to appeal.",

"reviewcomment":"GREAT Scotch selection!!!<br><br>I came here one evening after making last minute plans to meet up for a drink with out-of-town friends.  It was impossible  to get a table in the main room, which was a shame because it looks so nice in there.  Nonetheless, the main room was pretty loud, and all the seating was in regular chairs, so the couches in the hallway, for lack of better description, were an acceptable substitute.<br><br>Indeed, the couch seating is quite comfortable, and although it is technically a hallway - a fact that is occasionally punctuated by a chill breeze from the doorway around the corner and through the curtain during the winter months - also quite pleasantly decorated.  As an added bonus/consolation prize, it also seems quieter than sitting in the main room.<br><br>I was extremely happy with the waiter we had.  He was such a super friendly guy, so helpful, interesting to talk to about architecture and music and travel, and he was able to float among the three languages that my company and I threw at him (German, English, and Dutch).  The proof of his rockstar-ness though, was in his ability to have fun and play with and wait on my friends&#39; two children.  Serious awesome points there.<br><br>But back to the real reason I&#39;m writing this.  This place serves up some legit and interesting cocktails (and has a truly great selection of Scotch whiskeys).  I wouldn&#39;t ask for any of the old classics, meaning a Manhattan or an Old Fashioned, but I was satisfied with my Dirty Old Bastard.  And if you&#39;re looking to settle the score between Oban 14 year and Talisker 10 year, or run a broad comparison of Speysides and Islays, this is the place to do it.<br><br>Next time I go, I&#39;ll have to try something new because, as I may have mentioned, I got a little distracted and focused on the GREAT Scotch selection.<br><br>Quick tip:  The main entrance to this place is on the back terrace.",

"reviewcomment":"When it comes to the K.I.S.S (Keep It Simple, Stupid) method of food delivery, Ruff&#39;s has hit the bullseye on the target. <br><br>The menu gives you 6 burgers to choose from (one of those being a really yummy vegetarian burger) and you can only order either fries or chilli cheese fries.  If you pair that with the fact this place is tiny (seats 5 or 6 comfortably, but maybe a few more if squeezed in), this wouldn&#39;t be the type of place that I would continue to return to. However, that does NOT apply in this case. This is --at the moment-- my favorite grab-n-go joint for a burger.<br><br>The menu may not be the most creative ever, but the meat taste awesome and so does the bread....clearly fresh and prepared in house. I agree with others, the flavor is definitely on par with Burger House. <br><br>The workers have always been super nice to me, regardless of how busy they are. I definitely like the service-oriented vibe here.<br><br>As for location....I wish I could give it 6 stars. During the summer, you could easily take a burger to-go and chill in the English Garden. Basically any time of the year you could grab a great meal before going to the many bars around it. <br><br>The last thing that has earned Ruff&#39;s a 5 star review from me, is it&#39;s consistency. I&#39;ve been here numerous times, and I have not been let down once. I&#39;ve never left dissapointed, and I hope it stays that way!  : )",

For the price you pay I think you get more than what you can expect. quality of service is also great and friendly staff greet you. Got brushed upon with Indian hospitality of force feeding till you have to loosen your belts... :) <br><br>tried variety of chicken dishes - Tikka Masala and lamb, and they both tasted amazing. Dish wasn&#39;t very spicy nor very sweet and hence maintained the right balance. Also try your luck on spinach version of chicken curry which is quite good as well. The vegetarian stuff was also nice. And of course, the mango lassi was too good. Don&#39;t forget to try the desserts here, specially the Gulab Jamun here was mind blowing. <br><br>This place is certainly one among a few places where I would love to take a few friends to try Indian delicacy.

"reviewcomment":"I came here because I was told that this is one of the few places in Munich where one can find southern Indian food.  Well, the restaurant doesn&#39;t specialise in southern Indian food per se, as they offer northern dishes as well, but I still feel like I did something right with my Sunday by coming here.<br><br>I was famished and looking for vegetarian options (part of my recent healthy eating initiative).  The menu here clearly presents not just vegetarian but also vegan options.  <br>I ordered the dal palak and the person I was with had the myore dal.<br><br>At first, I was a little doubtful that I&#39;d leave full.  I&#39;m a guy who usually finishes other&#39;s people&#39;s food, and the bowls they brought out to serve us our dishes and our rice just didn&#39;t cause any &#34;wow&#34; effect in terms of size.  I did indeed deep into the myore dal, but out of lust, not hunger!<br><br>The seasoning was great.  So savory, so complex, each spoonful enticing me on to the next until that cruel moment where I was faced with the choice of 1) licking my bowl clean or 2) abiding by the convention of not licking restaurant bowls clean and accepting the fact that all good things must come to an end.  I ended up deciding somewhere in the middle.<br><br>The prices here are great, and in the end I really appreciate that they bring out a reasonable amount of rice instead of a pile big enough to play hide-and-seek in.  It made me think and wonder how much rice other Indian restaurants end up wasting as a result of extravagance.<br><br>The atmosphere here is super relaxed, and not at all like the fancy dining experiences that most Indian restaurants offer.  I like that.  It means I can enjoy my food at a great price and not have to worry which fork I&#39;m using.  Central location right near Isartor makes this a no-brainer -   I&#39;ll definitely be coming here again!",

There are huge crowds in attendance here but it seems like quite a number of individuals come here to drink and attempt to salsa dance while bumping into others recklessly. There are definitely some great dancers here but far and few in between compared to other places in Munich.

"reviewcomment":"Meat, meat, meat and more meat! <br><br>Zum Goldenen Kalb does not skimp on the beef. Their selection is vast, and if you have a group between 6-10 people you can actually go to the meat fridge and pick out the exact cut you want!<br><br>I went with my company for a department dinner, and I was definitely not disappointed. The dinner started with beef and salmon tartar, then made way for salads (the Caesar salad was pretty darn tasty), and then on to the main course - MEAT! The waiters/waitresses brought out a giant cutting board piled high with all different cuts of beef. All of us at the table saw, agreed, and they took the pile of meat away for carving. <br><br>When they came back with plates of the previously whole cooked cuts, it was time to chow down. However, if you are vegetarian, I have been told they have good vegetarian choices too, a colleague of mine got the risotto, and she could not stop talking about it for days. Another colleague of mine is vegetarian, but will eat fish, and she got lobster (secretly I wished I had been smarter and said I didn&#39;t eat meat either...). <br><br>Anyway, back to the meat, not only did they manage to make the pile of meat on the cutting board into multiple plates of piled-high meat, the sides were equally as impressive and delicious. <br><br>Why is this not a 5 star review? Well, it all comes down to price. Would I go back there again, most definitely. However, I would probably be a month late with paying rent - and I&#39;m sure my landlord wouldn&#39;t appreciate that ;). <br><br>However, Go! If you can afford it, or if someone else is footing the bill, it is definitely worth the experience.",

"reviewcomment":"Last Monday evening I went with a good friend and fellow wine lover to Die Blaue Donau.  Tom greeted us and offered us one of his varied choices of gin roughly 16 if I remember. It is a great way to start the evening by him and it is an evening. He had 2 menus to choose from and depending on your appetite 3, 4, or 5 course menu. We both decided on  the 3 ( steak tartar, pumpkin soup and duck) and were stuffed to the gills upon leaving. The selection of wines are quite fascinating since Tom concentrates on Austrian and never my first on the list but I have to admit I discovered a very nice Sauvignon Blanc that was not tasting of grass. It had a very strong fresh fruit aroma without the smell of a fresh cut lawn. It was a great choice by him. The place was full and the people were happy to spend the night there.",

"reviewcomment":"It is so good when you go to a restaurant and feel right at home. Even though it was a rainy day it was really sunny inside this burger shop. The interior decoration is functional and just about right, in my eyes. Everyone had such a wonderful mood there, it was superb. <br><br>There are so many burger options from which to choose, that I felt a bit lost: so many tasty possibilities. Yummy!!!  They have even the Terminator Burgers, with increasing spice levels: T1, T2, and T3.<br><br>I did ask for some burger consulting, and I was recommended the Indian Dreams Burger. They also have some really big-sized burgers, ranging from 300 until 500 grams. For a moment I thought about ordering a BIG BEN sized Indian Dreams but, since I also wanted to try their Fries, I chose the regular sized one. The taste of this burger was so unique it really justifies its name. The bread was soft and crispy (not the regular burger bun), and the temperature and taste of the meat was just perfect to my taste. It was just too good, I just wanted more!<br><br>(Un)fortunately, after eating my burger, I just wished I had ordered the bigger one, given that it was so delicious. Nevertheless, I was very satisfied with the size of the portion. And the fries were also spectacular: crispy in the outside and soft inside. They have this rustic look and are for sure homemade! <br><br>I asked a bit and then their super friendly staff told me that almost everything there is freshly homemade: bread, burgers, sauces, fries, etc...<br><br>I can only recommend it to all my friends and fellow yelpers to try these very delicious homemade burgers",

But it also feels modern with its stylish light yellow wall and modern photographs.<br><br> Lots of salads and light fare with clear Italian influence, good housewines and coffee. Not a top restaurant - it&#39;s a caffe, remember - but price/quality wise, it deserves my 4 stars.<br><br> But it can get noisy here! There is a bar in the cellar, but I&#39;ve never been.",

"reviewcomment":"Many indian restaurants are predictable; Kerala is not.  South Indian cuisine features none of the dry tandoor crusts; the curries come in abundant heavy, rich sauces.  The Indian crepe Dhosa s a house-kitchen favourite among my Indian friends, and they assure me that the Kerala version is exquisite.  Most of the people who eat here are regulars, a testament to the consistent excellence and distinctive regional approach to Indian food.  Top marks.  I am proud to be Duke of this establishment!",

"reviewcomment":"What a fun dining experience! We came here for a special occasion dinner, and Tramin is a special-occasion kind of place. Tramin is not for the money-conscious (60€/person for the most basic menu), but if one is willing to splurge, then it is worth every penny!<br><br>On a Wednesday night, we wanted to reserve a table online for the upcoming Saturday evening, but we had no available tables for that whole night. However, when we called the restaurant and left a message to reserve, they were nice enough to return our call and managed to get us a table for Friday evening, which we agreed to change from Saturday. Tip: reserve early if you want plans to go as planned.<br><br>The decor is clean, minimal, modern, yet not too spiffy. The service was friendly and was good at recommending wines throughout our meals. But the main specialty of Tramin is the surprise! The only choice we have in our food selection was: a 4-course (for the hungry), 5-course (really hungry), 6-course (starving), or 7-course (famish) menu. The staff also considered dietary restrictions, so no worries for vegetarians (although it would not be practical to dine there...). We were excited to try anything, so we all opted for the 4-course menu with no restriction. Here is what we got (to the best of my recollection):<br><br>Amuse-bouche: Herring served in a sardine can - amusingly funny but clever concept. Very flavorful start.<br>1st appetizer: Saibling (char) served with green asparagus, blood orange, and ginger foam - really clean and refreshing<br>2nd appetizer: &#39;Waller&#39; (European wels catfish) served with peas, champignon cream, and &#39;Bärlauch&#39; (garlic-like) foam - I take the chef likes making foam! Fish was cooked superbly, and the mushroom cream was extraordinary.<br>Main course: Veal tafelspitz (like round steak) and sweetbread served with Pata Negra (Spanish cured ham), sage, and cauliflower -- the veal tafelspitz was juicy and delicious, cooked medium rare. I am not a fan of sweetbread whatsoever, but I ate it without too many unpleasantries.  <br>Dessert: &#39;Valrhona Opalys&#39; (white chocolate) with red currants alongside a chocolate lollipop soaked in a shot of Waldmeister liquor -- innovative, not too heavy to eat, and interesting combination of flavors<br>Bonus dessert: Crunchy cookie shaped like a donut covered in chocolate ganache with passion fruit sauce -- A perfect end to a special meal!<br><br>At the end, we got a revelation of our menu (postcard-sized). Overall, the dishes are innovative but simple -- not too many ingredients, therefore highlighting the few specialities.",

"reviewcomment":"I think my fellow yelpers Bill T. and Dmytro A. have pretty much nailed Burger &amp; Bier on the head....except one minor detail; burgers should NEVER be cooked well done. That is seriously the most blasphemous thing to say to a meat lover. That being said, I still really enjoy coming here. I&#39;ve never made a reservation, but I&#39;ve always been lucky enough to get a spot. Keyword: lucky! Burger &amp; Bier ALWAYS fills up fast in the evenings. <br><br>The service is a bit hit or miss. My waitresses have always been really friendly, but they tend to disappear if you tell them you need a minute to look at the menu. I always forget that long wait for some service when those heavenly angels swoop in and present to me a plate full of fries and happiness on a bun. :)<br><br>My most recent visit I had the Torero burger topped with chorizo sausage and it was a w e s o m e. It was quite the mix of sweet and savory. Yet another meal where I did not share a single bite with my date! To be fair, he had the Mexican burger and loved it so much he didn&#39;t share a bite with me either, so it must have been just as delicious as mine. On another occasion I filled up on beer and parmesan fries, and that was just as enjoyable. Salty fries and beer.....mmm the perfect marriage!<br><br>I really enjoy the atmosphere here. It&#39;s a little dark (not in the scary way, but in the relaxed way) and just calm enough to get you prepared for a night out in the Glockenbach/Fraunhoferstrasse/Gaertnerplatz areas. Also, I almost forgot to mentioned it&#39;s a fairly priced place. Great value for the money, that&#39;s for sure. I&#39;m definitely looking forward to my next round of burgers and beer at Burgers&amp;Bier  :)",

The place is reasonably big and done up in Victorian style with comfortable seating and nice tables. The place has really nice high ceiling and decorated in colonial style. We chose to go there later so that we could stay longer and we sure did :-))<br><br>I had the corned beef hash which came with a hollandaise sauce and the flavours were good. I must admit it was a bit rich for my liking but the flavour was excellent. I also had a cappuccino which was well made. After breakfast we decided to move onto high tea and ordered scones with jam and clotted cream and it was also pretty good. Ok I have had better but, for Munich this is quite good. <br><br>The service was good and the staff were pretty relaxed and we hung around for a good three hours there and chatted and even had a beer later :-))<br><br>The place did get a bit too warm towards the end and we ended up leaving as it was getting a bit too warm. All in all a great experience and I would happily come back here. The place was packed and remained packed throughout the day. A good choice for English breakfast in Munich :-)",

We got a half liter of sangria (delicious and I love that it comes in a half liter!) and then we spent some time considering the menu. They didn&#39;t have an English version, but the German one had all the names of the dishes in Spanish, so we could work through that, sort of. The waitress was also extremely nice and spoke English and offered to help us with the menu.<br><br>Instead we ended up getting the dinner for two, which was amazing. It came with a hot plate and cold plate which altogether had enough food for four people. The cold plate had maybe 10 different dishes, and the hotplate had four (stuff peppers, something deep fried, sardines and potatoes with red sauce). And they were all really good. We could not finish it!<br><br>We read the menu wrong - we thought it was 19 euros for the meal but actually it was 19 euros per person, or per hot/cold. I don&#39;t know. Oh German.<br><br>But, great service, great food, great drink. Thanks!",

"reviewcomment":"A very nice introduction to Bavarian cuisine.<br><br>My two German colleagues chose this restaurant for a local Bavarian meal. It is a cozy restaurant that has a tavern feel. An expansive menu and the portions (if you were able to finish them) would expand your waistline.<br><br>Our dinner featured large cuts of meat (I had the Schweinsbraten which is a pork roast) and the largest Knödel (potato dumpling) that I have ever been served. The highlight of our dinner was the dessert. Kaiserschmarrn (translated as Emperor&#39;s nonsense) is a popular dessert in Austria and Bavaria. Carmelized pancakes with other treats baked inside and served in a warm pan topped with powdered sugar, a fruit compote (I think it was lingonberries) and applesauce on the side. My two local friends said it was one of the best versions they&#39;ve had in Munich. <br><br>It was delicious, but three of us shared the dish and could not manage to finish more than half after our entrees. Certainly something special to share. It also takes a bit of time to prepare, so it is highly recommended you order it along with your main meal.<br><br>Because this restaurant it not in the Altstadt, it wasn&#39;t terribly crowded. It is conveniently located across the street from both a bus and S-bahn stop (Line S17) at Nymphenburg Schloss. So you can have a sweet treat or savory meal before or after visiting the palace.<br><br>The restaurant takes both reservations and credit cards. Service started off well, but did peter off towards the end.",

Most of the dishes we had were delicious but not all of them and the prices are a bit on the high side. Still, I think I can stand by the four stars and so be it.<br>They have a four-course menu with and without matching wines, a three-course monthly menu, and à la carte selections. One of us went with the August menu, the rest of us picked from the à la carte menu. I still haven&#39;t made my mind up over my starter; when you hear crème brulée with berries you will think dessert, but the twist is that the crème brulée contained a hefty dose of goat cheese, which made it more savory than sweet. It was weird and took a bit getting used to, but certainly interesting and quite tasty. The wifey wasn&#39;t too pleased with her gambas while the other guests were happy with theirs. My main course, grey gurnard (a fish going by the name of knorrhane in Swedish and something similar in German) was very nice. The wifey was quite pleased with her veal. For dessert I had a cheese plate that I really liked. The wine the waiter recommended didn&#39;t quite do it for me, a hint of bitterness that didn&#39;t quite fit, but was still a reasonable drink. Service was otherwise pretty good.",

Parking can be a bit challenging, but with public transportation pretty easy to get there, take the underground to station Laimer Platz, then its just a five minutes walk.<br>But now for the restaurant: we went there with our Thai-friends as they wanted to have some asian food again after all that bavarian and german cuisine.<br>Service was very warm and friendly, good that we had reserved a table (as it is a quite small restaurant, maybe 30 seats)<br>We did it the Thai-way: ordered just some 7-8 dishes and shared. all of them were very nice! If you want it a bit more spicy than the european style, just tell them (usually they take one red chilly for the som tum, 3 were good and spicy without killing us :-)<br>Our Thai-friends were more than happy about the food and the service, we as well!

"reviewcomment":"Das Restaurant besuchen wir vor allem wegen der Nähe und dem schönen Ambiente. Elegant und edel statt Mykonos-Kitsch.<br><br> Zum Essen kann ich nur bedingt was sagen, denn wir bestellen immer nur kalte und warme Vorspeisenteller. Die sind wunderbar. Dazu Pita mit Knoblauch. Das liegt daran, dass ich bei Griechen meistens Vorspeisen esse (und Fleisch ist eh nicht meins).<br><br> Hervorragend auch, dass es vorab einen Teller mit wirklich sehr guten grünen und schwarzen Oliven gibt und Brot dazu.<br><br> Der Wein schmeckt uns auch, besser als bei so manchem Standard-Griechen.<br><br> Ich kann das Elia sehr empfehlen. Reservierung abends angeraten, insbesondere Fr/Sa. Yassas!",

It was delicious food with well-balanced flavors served with panache.  The owner did spend quite a bit of time with our table and was a wonderful host. <br><br>I started my meal with a bowl of Dahl -- light, smooth and wonderful. I wanted to have the Lobster Curry but they were out so the owner suggested a special treat with prawns that would be similar. It was quite simply a stunning taste profile -- he explained that they start the dish with an overnight soaking of fenugreek to bring out intense flavor.  I don&#39;t know the name of the dish but it was life changing. The naan was even well flavored. We ended the meal with a mango confection that was light and refreshing. <br><br>If I lived in Munich, this would be MY Indian restaurant.",

WARNING: This is NOT the place to go if you&#39;re looking for a meal that will take under 90 minutes. I was part of a group of 8 and we were here over 4 hours and had a blast. <br><br>When I entered the front door I was a bit surprised to be directed by a friendly man to walk downstairs. Wait.....are you pointing me in the direction of the bathroom? I&#39;m here to eat!!! Indeed, the restaurant IS downstairs. It&#39;s like stepping into a different part of the world. The decor is so authentic and well done. It&#39;s truly impressive to admire. The staff are very relaxed and welcoming here, so naturally they let my friends and I catch up (and fill up one beer and wine a bit) before coming to take our food orders. <br><br>Round One: cold appetizers! Made fresh and tasted about 10 times better than I  could have imagined. My favorite was a red pepper hummus.<br>Round Two: hot appetizers! Yep, just as good as round 1. Try the bread stuffed with lamb. It&#39;s a bit crispy and quite thin so you won&#39;t fill up too much before your main course. <br>Round 3: main courses! ....or maybe I should say Round 3: plates FULL of food that barely got touched because we filled up on appetizers. Seriously, you must pace yourself here. The portions for the entrees are massive. Most of us asked to take our leftovers home because it was simply too yummy to waste. I had lamb over a bit of spicy rice with pine nuts and jogurt.<br>Round 4: the &#34;guilt stage&#34;....yes, that moment of the meal when you realize you just ate more than a family of four. Oh well....time for hookah and entertainment! The belly dancer is wonderful. She was talented and interacted with everyone dining. I hope you&#39;re not shy because she WILL try and pull you on stage to dance with her. My girlfriend&#39;s and I played along and got some great photos out of the experience. If you&#39;re not already exploding from consuming so much, try the Arabic coffee!<br><br>Arabesk might not be for everyone, but it is a unique dining experience that isn&#39;t typical of Munich and it is certainly worth a try! : )",

I had pumpkin soup followed by a steak but that description doesn&#39;t do it justice. A big contributor to our evening was our waiter. Big, smiling knowledgeable and just attentive enough you didn&#39;t feel smothered or ignored. <br><br>One note of caution; make a reservation. We got lucky because it was a random Monday night.

The same 4 varieties of fish will come round eventually amongst lots of chinese fried dishes.<br><br> If you are hungry it can be god value, but if you just want to have a bit of nigiri then you are better off choosing something from the menu.",

"reviewcomment":"my loyal followers should be noticing these two trends by now:<br>1) I love museums.<br>2) I love beer.<br><br>so, here we reach the synthesis of these two! this museum is devoted to two things: the history of brewing beer in Germany, and the legacy of Oktoberfest.<br><br>it&#39;s on a side street, and if you don&#39;t keep your eyes open you may miss it.<br><br>in true German style...there&#39;s a bar here. you can combine your admission ticket with a voucher for a beer and pretzel at the museum bar. just a heads up - the bar opens at 6, when the museum closes. we went earlier in the day, but had we known, we might&#39;ve gone later.<br><br>admission is cheap. standard cost is 4 Euro per person, but it must have been a slow day, as the guy at the entrance said &#34;you look like college students, you get reduced price&#34;...and let D-Block and I in for 4 Euro total. AWESOME!<br><br>you&#39;ll see exhibits about brewing equipment and methods through the ages, posters of Oktoberfest through the years, paintings, photos, and more. I recall seeing a video exhibit or two at some point. overall, it&#39;s kind of static (dioramas, things behind glass) but very informative. and it&#39;s all about beer! lots of really cool drinking vessels are on display.<br><br>it&#39;s fairly small - it&#39;ll take you maybe an hour or so to see everything - but really cool. so take a break from your standard art and science museums to see one devoted to the greatest liquid on Earth!<br><br>PROST!",

"reviewcomment":"On a cold winter night in January I was fortunate enough to be a guest in the cozy and quaint Alm Hütte which is built up in the winter months alongside the Restaurant Gut Nederling.  To say that I was impressed with the whole experience at Gut Nederling would be an understatement.   <br><br>The owners are passionate about their country, their food, and their wines and this comes across in every bite and sip.  They&#39;re happy to share their knowledge in a friendly, inspiring way offering unbeatable service in a cozy, unpretentious setting (the restaurant as well as the hut). <br><br>Local Austrian/Steiermark-ian specialties like pumpkin seed oil in polenta and &#39;käseterrine&#39;, &#39;Käfer&#39; beans (much prettier and tastier than any bug I ever saw or didn&#39;t taste), delicious Saibling fish, and my new favorite dessert, Salzburger Nockerln will rock your world and make you want to hop on the first train to Steiermark.  But wait, you don&#39;t have to!  Just find your way over to Nymphenburg area (just a short walk from Bus 164 via U Bahn Westfriedhof, or park your car there easily as well) and all this Austrian goodness can be yours!",

"reviewcomment":"This place has very good, very authentic Thai cuisine.  Quite reasonably priced.  The wine list is pretty good (I had a South African Sauvignon Blanc by the glass, paired well with the dishes I had).   Service was not great (we sat for almost a half hour, waiting for our friends to arrive, but no one came for us to order drinks while we waited.  The restaurant was NOT busy).<br><br>I think they specialize in fish, although there&#39;s also meat and vegetarian dishes on the menu.  I had a fresh spring roll appetizer (that wasn&#39;t very good), but my dining companions had Thai soups (2 different kinds) and those were very nice.  <br><br>I had calamari in red curry, which was REALLY good.  Calamari is tricky, especially in something like a curry, where it will continue to cook as it sits in the warm sauce, and turn chewy and nasty.  In this dish it was tender and perfectly cooked.  The vegetables were very fresh, and somebody in that kitchen has some remarkable knife skills (the carrot-flower garnish was pretty impressive).  <br><br>For the curry I asked for extra-spicy -- and it was REALLY hot.  (the kind of hot where you can still feel a pleasant gentle burn in your belly quite a while after dinner is done).  it was almost, but not quite, a bit TOO much for me, after six months in Munich and not much spicy food.  So order &#39;extra spicy&#39; judiciously.",

"reviewcomment":"One day, when I get around to creating my toplist for Munich, this will be sitting right at the top for local cuisine.  This place is one of the nicest, most affordable, and most delicious true Bavarian restaurants that Munich has to offer.  As such, this is my go-to joint when I have out-of-town visitors.<br><br>The decor here is absolutely fabulous.  Polished wood and brass, seasonal decorations, and the compulsory Bavarian country flair imbue the restaurant with a mountain hunting lodge atmosphere, but without any of the controversial mounted deer head that could be off-putting whilst one is trying to eat.  The tables are all well-sized, and the room arrangement lends itself to accommodating large groups as well as maintaining small, intimate gatherings.  <br><br>The menu is DE. LI. CIOUS.  It&#39;s a cruel joke of nature that one&#39;s stomach can only fit one, maximum two dinners in one sitting.  I could eat the whole menu here.  In fact, I&#39;m slowly working my way through it.  While vegetarians will have it tough here, the Käsespätzle is one fine example of veg-friendly foods being done better at the Jagschlössl than anywhere else in Munich.  For the standard meat-eater, this is your Bavarian cuisine heaven.  For beginners, I recommend the Schweinshaxen.  For more advanced, the Bergsteiger.  I&#39;ve always enjoyed ordering off the rotating daily menu as well.<br><br>Desserts here need to be served with some sort of weaponry, because you&#39;ll spend as much time fending off invaders as eating your dessert.<br><br>With respect to beer, this is a Hofbräu locale.  Do enquire as to the seasonal brew.  It&#39;s quite likely the latest incarnation of the Zwickl, which is an unfiltered golden goddess in a beer mug that I highly recommend.<br><br>If you happen to be in Munich during the warm months while the Bayern are playing, this place sets up their lovely beer garden with a huge outdoor screen.  Chances are that every bar in the city centre is jam packed, so why not enjoy the game comfortably over a Zwickl with delicious morsels of meat (or veg-friendly fare) under the towering chestnut trees?<br><br>In sum, if you find yourself courting a Bavarian, take her/him here to charm them out of their Hosen.  If you find yourself wondering where to take your out-of-town visitors to show off local culture, skip the Hofbräuhaus in the Altstadt and take them instead on the short tram ride to one of Munich&#39;s greenest neighbourhoods to eat here.  And if you&#39;re a vegetarian who is tired of eating bland Käsespätzle, make the journey to the Jagschlössl for what I am sure must be the best Käsespätzle that Munich has to offer.",

"reviewcomment":"Sitar is across the street from my office in an area with few grab and go options. It&#39;s logical we would eat here often.<br><br>But I don&#39;t return just because it&#39;s logical. I return because it&#39;s good. Coming from London where Indian food can range from curry shop to high class and is on average good, this should speak for something!<br><br>I&#39;ve only ever had various chicken dishes, chickpeas to tikka masala, and enjoyed them all. Lunch is a starter of soup or salad (very small servings) followed by nearly unlimited rice and your entree in a small round tin dish. <br><br>They DO offer takeaway and it&#39;s very fast. The portions for takeaway are very filling.",

"reviewcomment":"This is a neighborhood place for us and we&#39;ve been coming here for a few years now, often several times a month. My boyfriend was born and raised in Bavaria, and this is our favorite Bavarian restaurant in Munich. The current management took over a few years ago and from what I&#39;ve been told made the place much better.<br><br>There is a standard menu with items such as Nurmberger sausages, Brotzeitteller, and several kinds of Schnitzel. There are also daily menus and seasonal menus in addition. There have been Advents-themed menus, Bavarian wild game menus, etc... They mostly use local meats and produce and the food is prepared to a very high standard. There is a lunch menu with items that rotate throughout the week. They also have very good classic Bavarian breakfast items like Weisswurst.<br><br>Cozy ambiance and good service. In the summer there&#39;s also a back garden with a little cottage that has a table for 4 set up. <br><br>Sometimes they have special events ranging from live music to book readings or for major football events, viewings. <br><br>If you&#39;re visiting the city and want well-prepared, authentic Bavarian food, skip the tourist traps and come here. Location is easy to get to on the U2 and still quite central. <br><br>If you come in the evenings, even during the week and are with a group of four or more, a reservation is recommended. It gets quite busy on weekends. <br><br>Typically most of the really high-end Bavarian places are located in countryside inns, but here they manage to retain the quality of food and ambiance within the city.<br><br>There&#39;s also free wi-fi available, but you have to ask a server for the login and password.",

"reviewcomment":"Indian restaurants are a dime a dozen in Munich, but truly authentic ones are not so easy to find. This place is certainly one of the best in the city. <br><br>First, the location is great. In the summer, the outdoor seating is wonderful. The restaurant is in a plaza, so you don&#39;t get as much of the foot traffic walking right next to your table like you would at most restaurants that offer outdoor spots. However, if you must sit inside,you won&#39;t be disappointed either. I found the interior to be quite pleasant, and not too kitschy like many ethnic restaurants can be. Gaststaette Maharani is also right down the road from Cinema Muenchen, so it&#39;s a great start to a night if you want to take in a nice dinner and a movie.<br><br>Then there is the service...it wasn&#39;t sub-par, but it also wasn&#39;t really satisfactory either, hence the 4 stars and not 5. The servers are very nice, but attentiveness is certainly lacking and that&#39;s something I can&#39;t help but notice. I don&#39;t like waiting 15 minutes for my bill when I ask to pay (I asked for it twice too).<br><br>My dinner was seriously one of the most delicious, flavorful, melt-in-your-mouth meals I&#39;ve had in the past year. Thank goodness I went with someone who loves to eat as much as I do, because neither of us could put our forks down. I started off slowly with the freshly (emphasis on the fresh!) cooked Nan bread, but then I proceeded to gorge myself with chicken tikka masala and lamm masala. Neither was a let-down in any way, shape, or form. The meat was so juicy that it took zero effort to chew. It basically just slid down your throat haha. If I could have unhinged my jaw, and just ate the whole plate at once, I would have.....sorry for that visual. As for the spiciness in their dishes, well, I only have two to compare really. <br><br>This isdefinitely  not one of those &#34;ehhh, I&#39;d go there again if someone invited me restaurants&#34;....it&#39;s worthy of anyone&#39;s &#34;Best Indian food in Munich List&#34;.",

Without reservation, we waited less than 5 minutes to be seated.<br><br>The service was quick as the waiter came within 10 minutes of us being seated. The prices were super reasonable for the dishes that we got. We ordered the potato Gnocchoni with mushrooms, truffles, and ricotta cheese served with a truffle-cream sauce and spinach-cheese ravioli also served with truffle and a fried chicken drumstick for 10 EUR each. We were provided with an amuse-bouche (a slice of bread with Bruschetta) before our entrees, and both dishes were decent.<br><br>Definitely a good place to consider around the Rosenheimer Platz area.",

"reviewcomment":"This place was in my bookmark for quite some time. Though I haven&#39;t tried many Japanese restaurants, this certainly was on my list to see the variety. This is in my neighbourhood, so another reason to tumble upon. <br><br>At first the exteriors don&#39;t give the real impression, what&#39;s in inside. From outside, not many people would consider going, unless they have actually been there. Reality is that it is a traditional Japanese Restaurant. The best way to gauge that is by counting how many Japanese guests you would find. For me this is a sure shot way to know you have authentic food here. And we could find quite a few Japanese guests relishing their local flavour here. The menu card is in Japanese and German, so I definitely needed a translation, thanks to my friend who was with me, he did the most of it. In terms of choices, that too like Japanese local choices, this place is gold mine - Plenty of variety and choices. I am not a big Japanese food fan neither have I tried many, so the number of Japanese dish I could knew are very limited. <br><br>I had a three course dinner - with teriyaki, some starter which had crispy chicken and amazing sauce which isn&#39;t traditional mayo but something unique, which I am being told is special to Japenese food. For more details refer to my pictures which I posted. Then I also had octopus starter with salad which was yum. After three course you felt like you have eaten for the next 24 hours. I was full. I was massively impressed! On price front, it wasn&#39;t that expensive and for two it ran around 50-55 bucks. Don&#39;t go by the portion, they look small but they are mighty enough to fill a hungry belly. I am being told Sushi&#39;s here are awesome. I was being told to try &#39;UNAGI&#39;, but unfortunately they dint had that day. But try that if you get a chance. <br><br>On service front, they are quite nice, calm, pleasant and smiling always - true to Japanese culture. Nice bunch of people. Service was slightly slow, but they make all this fresh so its expected and shouldn&#39;t be a reason to comment. <br><br>Having this in the neighbourhood, gives a solid advantage to visit this again; if I crave for something different than the conventional food I eat always. Should visit it for sure.",

"reviewcomment":"I was visiting Munich on business and staying at the Park Inn across the street. I saw that there was a biergarten across the street that served Ayinger beer, a really good German brewery, and decided to stop by for dinner after reading some positive reviews online. Dicke Sophie is a nice place inside, with a biergarten outside with tables. They were busy for dinner and everyone was inside as it had just rained and the tables outside were wet. I tried to order an Ayinger Celebrator Doppelbock without looking at the menu and they didn&#39;t have it, but I had the Dunkel Lager which was a dark lager that was pretty tasty. Then I switched to Ayinger Jahhhundertbier which was lighter, slightly bitter but not like an English or American bitter, just not as sweet as many German beers. I thought it was pretty good and I had never tried this beer, it was a good choice. Both types of beer were 3,50 Euros each for 0.5L. <br><br>For dinner, I chose the most expensive thing on the menu because it wasn&#39;t that much (19 Euros), not even knowing what it was LOL. I knew it was a meat filet with potatoes and artichokes, that it&#39;s. This was off the weekly special menu on the first page. It ended up being kind of like a surf and turf, with a filet of beef, cooked medium, two pieces of medium-sized shrimp, an artichoke heart with like a cream sauce inside, and rectangular slices of fried potatoes. Not a huge portion but all was very tasty. I was pleased with the food and service and would definitely visit again. Keep in mind that they don&#39;t take American credit cards, but they allowed me to leave my ID and go and get cash from the hotel front desk across the street and come back to pay. All in all, it was a good experience and may visit again during my week in Munich.<br><br>Update: visited again and got the roasted pork in brown beer gravy with potato dumplings. It was only like 11 or 12 Euros and one of the best meals I had in Munich. Had another couple of Ayinger Jahrhundertbiers to drink with it. The bartender didn&#39;t speak English but provided me an English menu and referred me to another bartender that did. The people are very nice here and the food is good. I recommend this place and would definitely hang out here again if I&#39;m in this part of Munich (near the Johanneskirche train stop in East Munich).",

"reviewcomment":"Just brought home Gyros wrapped in a Pita bread as take-out. For 5 people. Great! This place is open - though it&#39;s Sunday 1pm.<br>Nice surprise were the couple of fries in the gyros wrap which comes in tightly packed aluminum foil. All in all it looked and smelled rather good. Each pita&#39;s got 2 quartered tomatoes, some raw onions, tsasziki (joghurt sauce w/sliced cucumbers), and gyros meat. I did not ask what kind of meat it was - sorry, forgot to. But I have taken a pic of it. Not being a big meat specialist, I can only say that it was quite grissly and greasy, but typically gyros-spiced, i.e. enjoyable. I would have prefered the pita bread to have been a bit more toasted, so it doesn&#39;t seem so soggy after the 10-minute ride in the car. It broke apart in the middle quite easily.<br>My impression of the restaurant was rather positive. Inviting entrance passage under green arches, parking at the front for about 10 cars decorated with greekesque stone structures, lots of daylight in the entire restaurant by having most of it enclosed by big glass windows. Friendly young, Greek staff. Multilingual and very accomodating.<br>I will come back if I am in the area: at public swimming pool Michaelibad or at the beautiful former Bundesgartenschau Ostpark. About 500m from either one.<br>For pita take-out I will have to find a different place. The meat and lack of fresh herbs is not quite my thing.",

"reviewcomment":"As a standard rule of thumb, I don&#39;t like to go to inexpensive restaurants that combine more than one type of asian cuisine. I don&#39;t know....I kind of just see it as a bit sacreligous. Plus, that usually is an indication that the food is not authentic. However, Sushi Magie does it right!<br><br> During my first 9 months in Munich I was an au pair. That means I earned just a few euros every day. Sushi Magie was one of the only places I could afford to go dine, and I am COMPLETELY okay with that. The thai food is amazing. I am absolutely obsessed with their duck, their yellow curry sauce, basically ALL of their soups, and wait.....I should just say that the whole menu here is delicious. The portions are generous and the price is beyond affordable. I could eat here and leave satisfied for about 12 euro, including tip. Most of the time the sushi is half off or they have some sort of combination special. <br><br>If you&#39;re in a hurry, just grab your food &#34;zum mitnehmen&#34;! You&#39;ll get it even faster, and the portion will not be any smaller. The staff is super friendly too, and that should never be overlooked.<br><br>I only dock a star here because it can be really uncomfortable in here. The place is wayyyy too small for the number of tables inside. Most days this is okay, but go on a weekend, a busy lunch, or any time during the summer, and you&#39;re probably going to have to sit back to back with a stranger.<br><br>I can&#39;t wait to drag some friends here soon! : )",

"reviewcomment":"I have been a little skeptical of Chinese restaurants in Munich.  On principle, if the place offers Sushi, Pho, Chinese Fast Food, Thai, Burmese, etc., in a Germanized conglomeration of &#39;Orientalisch&#39; -- I&#39;m inclined to assume it MUST be pretty bad.  <br><br>We literally stumbled on Chi Hong Kong Cuisine -- it&#39;s on a very small side street close to Gartnerplatz heading toward Isartor.  But we had to try it because it was the first time I could remember seeing straight-up Chinese food in Munich -- and I was so glad we did because it was LOVELY.  To summarize, it&#39;s well-executed Chinese cuisine made with fresh local ingredients from Bavaria (and most likely some key ingredients flown in from Asia).  <br><br>I am a fool for a good dumpling (i LOVE LOVE LOVE wonton soup, even if it can be said to be a bit of a cliche) -- and the dumplings we tried were *awesome*.  The wonton soup -- which I had to order of course -- was amazing:  great broth, crisp-tender totally fresh vegetables, and perfectly delicious little dumplings.  Then we had a duck dish, in a red curry sauce -- seriously, it was some of the best duck I&#39;ve had (and there&#39;s some very good duck to be had in Bavaria).  <br><br>it&#39;s a very tiny place, but great ambience, nicely decorated &amp; very comfortable.  Service is great -- my husband accidentally knocked one chopstick on the floor, and someone appeared IMMEDIATELY with a new pair for him.  <br><br>although it&#39;s not officially a dim sum place (e.g. no carts) -- the food here is equal to some of the best I&#39;ve had in Hong Kong and in San Francisco Chinatown.  I can&#39;t wait to go back.",

"reviewcomment":"Some 10 years ago this was the best pizzeria in Munich for me and I used to be a regular. It was a tiny place with just 5-6 tables, always full and baking great pizzas in the wood-fired oven.<br><br>Then the place expanded, annexing the restaurant around the corner, changed oven, staff and attitude.<br><br>The quality of the pizza suffered, and everything else too. I come back once a year or so now and every time I&#39;m convinced that there&#39;s much better places in Munich if you wanna spend a night out eating Italian.<br><br>The staff aren&#39;t the most friendly and on a weekend night they really try to fill up the place by squeezing customers together. I was also disappointed with my pizza tonight. I ordered a margherita with extra cherry tomatoes. There was basically no cheese on it and there was ONE, no kidding, ONE cherry tomato on it. I guess I even paid 1,29 extra for the extra topping. LOL<br><br>Still, it&#39;s not a catastrophe, and they do have a nice and quiet outdoor space.",

We went with the cordon blue with horseradish sauce, a mixed grill of assorted (and delicious) German animals, and finally a dump truck full of fries on the side. Every bite was sheer bliss.<br><br>The check came to about 30 euros with beers and tip. Excellent value in a very pricey city like Munich. <br><br>If you don&#39;t mind 2000 calorie meals now and then, you will definitely want to check this place out.",

What&#39;s more? It&#39;s one of the very few restaurants open until 3am! You can&#39;t get everything on the menu after midnight but you can order big vietnamese soups up to 3am. They are to-die-for and Canh Chua Do Bien is my favorite of the big soups. To order a soup as a starter, try Canh chua tôm. Both are a little spicy but if you can take it, you&#39;ll thank me for it.<br><br> Last but not least, the service (which may be slow when packed) is very good. The staff is very friendly and you get crab chips/cakes with your drink plus plum wine at the end as a thank you. This is significant because no other vietnamese restaurant I&#39;ve visited in Munich does that. I&#39;ve saved you time by visiting a few and MAI is hands down the best.

"reviewcomment":"We went here with our gastronauten crew and had a table laid for 20 people. The interior is well designed, staff very friendly and food yummy. With that group of people and considering the service for such a big group, hats off. However most of us went for a salad and i didn&#39;t get to hear any complains. Myself got a menu with butternut soup, very nice fish for main and the plate of cheese for dessert. In regards to the apprenticship concept and the quality of food for your money is really good. 5 stars as such a concept can probably not be done any better!",

"reviewcomment":"Perhaps the loveliest of all beer experiences I&#39;ve had so far in Munich...<br><br>Why? <br><br>Because it was outside. In the sunshine. With my gal pal. <br><br>Yes, this past Friday was quite a treat...and after a delightful walk around the grounds of Nymphenburg Palace...we were, of course, parched. We stumbled upon this little cafe and decided to bask in the glow of beer-laden sunshine. <br><br>A bit of help for those not familiar: <br><br>Outdoors: There are two sections divided only by a small path. One side has white tablecloths and is for the inside cafe/table service. If you are looking for a more refined lunch or drinks with someone to wait on you and price tags to match, sit down.  On the other side lies tables without cloths, but instead with lollygaggers enjoying beers, pretzels, desserts and coffees. This is ordered from the outdoor stand just past the seating area. You order at the counter, and bring back to your table to enjoy. It took us approximately 10 minutes to figure out the pecking order. Once we did, we were really quite happy. <br><br>I headed up to the counter and purchased two large beers totaling 8 euros. There are also many fine treats to be had, daily specials, etc. It is very much cafeteria-style but the savings will be plenty compared with the quite fanciful cafe across the small walking path. <br><br>It was a very pleasant experience...and I&#39;m sure in the summer it gets quite busy, but on this wonderfully warm spring day, it really was my own personal beer garden, and perhaps the only one I&#39;ll get to enjoy outdoors during my 5-week stay. C&#39;est la vie, you take &#39;em when you can get them! <br><br>A nice stop over if visiting the park, most definitely.",

We squeezed in to a table for two and the rest of the restaurant was stuffed w/ people on another few tables for either two or four people. You will get the drinks from a cooler, have to open by yourself and grab a glass from the cupboard. The menu offers a few typical choices which come in perfect style and quality. IMHO a very authentic thing. I will definitely go there again, when I&#39;m around.",

The miso soup was also really good and the tapioca pudding for dessert was sickly sweet and divine :-)<br><br>It is very reasonable and is near the university so I assume they cater to the student population and have to be reasonable.

"reviewcomment":"La Bouche is a charming small French Restaurant offering delicious cuisine in Munich; they have a wide selection of dishes offering a gourmet food or a set daily meal. I am not an admirer of Crème brûlée but here it is really delicious. For Munich prices, it not really expensive, starters from EUR3.50 - EUR8.00 / main Dishes from EUR15.50 - EUR19.00 or the daily set menu for a three course is EUR23.95. They use a lot of fresh ingredients and they cook in a way which is unique.<br><br> The food is delicious; the staff are very nice and really helpful.<br><br> I personally don&#39;t like sitting inside as it is really small and very cramped, you&#39;re almost sitting on your neighbours lap. For me personally, it is too close for comfort plus they have no air conditioning therefore it is extremely hot and the heat from the kitchen doesn&#39;t help, there is basically no air flow.<br><br> They offer outdoor seating on the street during hot summer months, so I recommend reserving one of these tables.",

We were introduced to it by friends about 3 months ago and have been back almost in a weekly basis ever since! <br>The owner is the loveliest, friendliest restaurant owner in Munich and will tell you everything you want to know about Vietnam and the food and culture! <br>She is also excellent at giving recommendations and helping you decide what to eat. I have eaten so many different things from the menu and have never been even slightly disappointed! My absolute favorite is the papaya salad as a starter....for me there are no words to describe how tasty it is! One of my all time favorite restaurants in Munich!!!",

"reviewcomment":"I and a friend stumbled upon Warmi while looking for a lunch place. From the outside, it kind of looks like what I imagine a Japanese noodle shop to look like. It has the Japanese illustrations, etc. out front. Inside is same. Also, there were already a number of people there at 11:30 on a Monday. <br><br>The lady who waited on us was, I assume, the owner or wife of the owner. She was very friendly and attentive. Prices were very reasonable and the menu, easy to read and well organized.<br><br>We both ordered soup of various types. My buddy ordered chicken and I a seafood. Both were in a large bowl, really well prepared and just the right temperature for my taste. On the table were a few condiments to &#39;spice up&#39; your food, if you felt the need. <br><br>My buddy just kept saying... &#34;Man, this is great!&#34;. In the end, I think I paid 22 Euros, with a good tip for the two of us. If I&#39;m ever in the area again I&#39;ll definitely go back as I was happily full the rest of the day.",

I have only been here once, for lunch, but I was very happy with my meal (a dish with spinach, egg and some sort of yoghurt), but the fish dish that several others in my party had also looked delicious. They rotate the lunch menu on a daily basis with a couple of options each day, but I think there are also some a la carte options. I&#39;d like to try dinner here some day, until then I definitely see more lunches coming up here.",

It has to be one of the very top places in Munich to get married! Perfect location with large private room, private terrace, access to the playground of the beer garden and surrounded by beautiful woods. Just be aware that for large groups you have to reserve WELL in advance. (For a wedding on the weekend 14 Months MINIMUM) -We got in on a cancellation (we asked 13 months before the date and had to take the date that was avaialble) So plan early! <br>Anyway the coffee, cake, dinner and desert were all excellent and the staff was very professional and helpful. I can highly recommend this as a wedding location!",

The environment was romantic - a little dim, a little warm, and with some drinks, you bet love would be in the air. But there were bigger tables for groups too.<br><br>Service was on par. We were served warm toasty bread with a creamy spread, which was nice (although do Seychellois people eat bread before the main meal?). We ordered the Anse Takamaka (spicy octopus curry) and the Anse L&#39;Amour (seafood curry). The portions were fair (it had better be for the prices of the dishes), and I was pleased that the octopus meat was with substance. However, the curry lacked some flavoring as I was craving for something sweet in it. I never had Seychellois cuisine before, so I cannot speak for its authenticity.<br><br>Ok, so I&#39;m actually more on cloud eight, but I hope my future patronage will bring me there.",

"reviewcomment":"Walking in I was excited to see they have tables where you can sit cross legged on some comfy and cool looking pillows. Sweet! My fiance and friend were not up for this though so next time I will be sure to go with some yoga gurus instead. The atmosphere at the tables was also nice and despite it being a Monday night and seeming slightly off the beaten path, there were a few tables of people coming in and out throughout the meal. Overall the dinner was good, but the salad and mains were nothing really exciting. I need to try some of the other Indian restaurants before I would go back to this place.  Although the 6.50€ lunch might be interesting if i am feeling really ambitious one day. Here is the break down:<br><br>mango lassi: ok but a little on the watery side<br>free papadam and dips: delish! spicy green dip rocked<br>chana chat: thought this was typically a warm dish? disappointed. also no real flavor that told me this was indian. could have been a salad from a health food store.<br>knoblauch naan: i really like this. perfect complimenting taste for dipping. but my fiance was disapointed because it is flat and not a fluffy naan.<br>punjabi murg curry: flavor was ok but chicken was not very tender. we requested EXTRA spicy but this came out more on the average spice level. Not surpirsed since they normally do not think that a white girl like me can handle the heat.

The server were very nice and very helpful. I had peppermint tea with rice noodles and prawns and my friend had the Vietnamese coffee with a small pho and summer rolls. If we were in Munich for longer I&#39;d definitely be inclined to go back. Not too expensive either considering just how delicious it was. Best Vietnamese I&#39;ve had (not that I&#39;m an experienced Vietnamese eater).<br><br>The restaurant itself is adorable. Small and quaint with adorning decorations. At one point I wasn&#39;t fully putting on all of my dressing and the main gentleman behind the counter recommended I use more and reassured me it was a healthy lemon sauce, as if he read I was second guessing it. So I did as he requested and was glad I did so! It was also helpful that they spoke English and had an English menu.",

"reviewcomment":"Damn this one rocks. It&#39;s quite rare to find such a unique and different place in Munich. Man we have a Rock&#39;n&#39;Roll Pizzeria, how cool is that? Ever imagined to sit in a Pizzeria, enjoying a lovely Pizza to the sound of Ozzy and Motörhead? Well here you go! They managed to keep some nice things Italian restaurants  usually have like the charming checkered tablecloths while they ditched the annoying racket most Pizzerias select as their background music. Instead you will hear everything from Punk, through to Alternative, Indie right up to some kick as Metal and bouncing Hard Rock. On weekends a DJ cares for the musical entertainment.<br><br>Ok lets not forget to talk about the main actor here. The Pizzas are juicy and taste just great. I am a Pizza lover and eat lots of &#39;em, so trust me on this ;)<br><br>A cool add-on: They provide you with fantastic chili and garlic oil. Drizzle that all over your Pizza for the real deal. Of course the oils come in Jack Daniels bottles to the table - guess Lemmy would love this place!<br><br>A 5-Star rating goes without saying.",

"reviewcomment":"OldMunich the associating house lies in the heart of Munich, in the proximity of the Stachus. The restaurant offers a old-Bavarian landlord room, a wine tavern and a festival room for 500 persons. From the mechanism a correct table reserved for regulars atmosphere results equal. In the inner court it still another calm beer garden gives, where one can rest prima of the Shoppingstress! <br>From Monday to Saturday at midday always new low-priced courts are offered! The opening times are of: 10:00 -0:00 clock. In the time there is also continuous warm kitchen. In the bill of fare one finds predominantly Bavarian specialities, in addition, the international kitchen is represented. <br>To the meal I can say only one, it was and am super delicious. The portions are more than plentiful and the prices are also absolutely justified for it!!! An example: I ordered myself the swabia pot, of consisting: 3 Medallions with broccoli carrot cauliflower , Käsespätzle and Champignon bulb bacon sauce and for only 13,50EUR. The portion was not to be created. There a portion for two would have been enough! When I was there, was the personnel always endeavors the order fast to take up and also very attentively. <br>Perhaps I had also only luck, which concerns the operation and the noise level, because with me it was simply everything positive and continuous perfect the meal. If it times in Munich are, try out simply even times and form its opinion! I would in-turn again and again there with my friend, after a Shoppingtour! <br>We only omit next time nevertheless the breakfast, so that we also create our portion; -). I assign from there for oldMunich the associating house the full score, whole 5 stars!!! Further so.",

Kalypso virtually transports you to the Greek isles, while at the same time elevating the traditional dishes you think will be the same no matter what greasy spoon you walk into.<br><br>Located on a sleepy little corner in west Schwabing, the inside of this joint is electric. Super cool stylings (whitewashed exposed brick walls, black and white photos of Greek island life, weaved baskets in place of lamp shades) instantly cue you into a totally different mood.<br><br>Just be forewarned, this isn&#39;t a small restaurant by any means (100+ settings?) but it&#39;s a bit tight to pack in all the patrons. So get ready to squeeze and get comfy -- and it&#39;s a must to book ahead.<br><br>Oh, and the food. Amazing. We came in a big group and got a sort of fixed menu, starting with at least a dozen appetizers. Everything from calamari to roasted Aubergine, unique dips and garlicy cuttlefish cutlets. We literally could not fit everything on the table, so had the play a game of Jenga balancing plates on top of each other, on the benches in our hands.<br><br>The main course? Unreal. Fresh salads, whole salt-cured Dorado, humongous prawns, roasted vegetables and a meat plate (Kofte, lamb chops, beef skewers, more). We couldn&#39;t finish it all, not by a long shot. But it was so amazing, we just hung out for an extra hour or so to nibble.<br><br>Service is... well, you have to understand these are passionate Greek folks. They&#39;re not afraid to tell you to squish over to make room for the table next to you or thow a couple &#34;Malaka&#34;s around the room. BUT, when it comes to advising on grub and coming by every half hour or so with a big bottle of Ouzo to share, these guys are spot on. Personally, I find it down to earth and charming; but if you&#39;re more into fine dining, you might be put off.<br><br>Just an amazing place when you want to be transported out of chilly Munich and into the bright lights of Greece. YAMAS!",

The street is fairly quite and you could spend hours watching the world go by.<br><br>The daily lunch menu has a selection of starters, mains and desserts. I had the Orechietti with Salcici sauce and it was excellent.  For dessert I had the semifreddo and it was divine. The rose we had for wine was also delicious :-))<br><br>All in all a great experience albeit the service was a bit slow. I would happily come back here for a lunch or dinner on a warm day :-))",

We had a fantastic dinner, the food was amazing and had a well-balanced, oriental touch to it. The restaurant itself was nicely decorated and had a relaxing touch to it. Walk-Ins are possible, but I would recommend to make a reservation. One star less for: the service that was rather slow and not all too friendly (but also not unfriendly); the kitchen fumes that are somehow nice, but not if your clothes still smell of the food the next morning; the clear fingerprints on the outside of the wineglass when it arrived at the table. <br>Would nevertheless recommend this restaurant and come back.",

A mixed salad of herbs was perfectly cooling and the pair of yogurt and chili vinegar sauces they dropped on the table, put everything right over the top.<br><br>The place is quite small, so definitely get a reservation, but overall Chopan II is definitely worth your time if you&#39;re looking for something a little more exotic than the usual.",

Sushibar definitely falls into the good category. <br><br>Perhaps a bit pricey to some, but in all honestly it was completely worth it. I have never had sushi in Munich that tastes so fresh. That alone was worth 5 stars in my opinion. The variety was outstanding. There is really something on the menu for everyone. I chose one of their Menu options for 22€. With that, you receive 5 different Nigiri and 3 pieces of two different rolls. In addition to that (even though I had a huge lunch) I still ordered an eel roll, which was probably the best eel roll I&#39;ve ever had. <br><br>I had a wonderful server who was attentive, helpful when it came time to choose something from the extensive menu, and quite friendly. Again....all worthy of 5 stars!<br><br>I can&#39;t wait to go back here. Honestly, I may possibly give myself mercury poisioning from all the raw fish I plan on consuming :)<br><br>p.s- This place isn&#39;t that big, so definitely make a reservation a day or two in advance.",

I was squeamish about Italian as we have excellent choices in SF and NYC to compare. I should not have been... This place is as good as any casual place in both places! We started off with Caprese Salad... Fresh buffalo moz with some of the best beefsteak tomatoes with fresh basil and light balsamic dressing. We shared lasagna, spaghetti  Bolognese and Pepperoni (they call it salami) thin crust pizza. Lasagna is the best I have ever had! Thin pasta, fresh sauce.... So good! Spaghetti was al dente with not too much sauce. Pizza was so crisp that only after 10 min of sitting did it start to sag a bit when holding it unsupported from the crust! Very good chianti and local beers... Had  tartafalo and another of their creations and both where so good! Try this place if your e jonesing for Italian/pizza around Marinplaz !",

"reviewcomment":"The interior is very unique. There&#39;s a giant rowing boat with glass on top. It takes up the whole room. A colorful bar and a counter along the window side. It was absolutely not what I&#39;d expected from a restaurant above a public swimming pool, it was way better!!!<br><br>We had two seats at the window with a great view of the outdoor pool. The staff was really nice and the menu was not too overwhelming. They have a few daily specials, mostly meat and fish, inspired by the Greek cuisine.<br><br>We picked a fish platter and the calamaris. The food arrived really fast, even though the place was packed.<br><br>It was really good! Simple, no unnecessary extras. 4 sorts of fish, potatos, salad + a great lemon sauce. The calamaris came also with a potato, some veggies, and a salad.<br><br>The price was great (nearly to cheap). We paid 29€ for drinks and food!!!<br><br>Highly recommend this place!!!!!!!",

"reviewcomment":"München is known for its beer, but did you also know there is a thriving cocktail culture?  My savvy girlfriend found the amazing Lux Bar (attached to the hotel of the same name) and we just had to stop in for a few drinks.<br><br>The bar is intimate with cool, modern decor--a great place for a sexy date!  They have some very skilled bartenders and creative cocktails.  I definitely recommend trying some of their own inventions (unfortunately I don&#39;t have any specific recommendations because I can&#39;t find their menu online).<br><br>Lux is conveniently located near Marienplatz, so it&#39;s easy to get to--and if you&#39;re downtown seeing the sights (or just getting off work) it&#39;s a great place to unwind after a long day.",

"reviewcomment":"This place is outstanding! A bit out of the way to be sure, and if you don&#39;t understand Bavarian, they have an English-language menu. The ambience is what you&#39;d expect for a local village place, but it gets visitors from all over the greater Munich region.<br><br>The food is simple traditional Bavarian fare, and it is excellent! The Schweinshaxn mit Kartoffelknödl und gmischdn Salod (pork shank with potato dumpling and mixed salad) was super-crispy on the outside, tender and delicious inside. The Knödl was the size of a baby&#39;s head, and perfect to soak up the juices from the Haxn! The salad was actually 3 salads in one - green, carrot and sauerkraut. Some very decent beer (Thoma) washes it all down.<br><br>A very enjoyable dining experience, with great food, great service and nice atmosphere - we&#39;ll be returning on our next visit!!",

You will have to make reservations with Ilsa, the owner/chef, who is a sweet soul. She is Austrian, not German, so you will have a chance to sample some truly Austrian deserts...she speaks perfect English ( as with almost all Europeans, especially in Germany, who speak English better than most Americans do) and can explain everything/anything and handle any dietary restriction. She is an EXCELLENT chef...we ate here several times!",

The outside area is quiet (maybe apart from kids playing on the small playground at the far end).<br><br> We were here on a very busy sunday, it was almost completely full - but the service was still reasonably quick and friendly (albeit being a bit stressed).<br><br> The food is good and ok for the price, not the best bavarian place in town but if you are around the area a good place to stop.

"reviewcomment":"We live very close to this place and I have walked by this place a hundred times but, never bothered to try it. Tonight I thought why not ? Although it was not on top of the list of places to try, we thought, ok we have a reservation and, why not just try it. I have to tell you we were so glad we did :-))<br><br>There was nothing about this place that I did not like and, that is quite rare. This place has a nice modern interior and plenty of al fresco seating and tonight, we decided to sit outside and enjoy the summer like weather we are having. <br><br>They have a great wine list with wines from Mediterranean countries like Italy, Greece and others and, wines from France, Spain and many new world wines. The choices are fantastic and the wine I picked for dinner was amazing. The prices are not great but still ok.<br><br>The main act aka food was where this place took it to new heights. The entree of Caramelised Onion Ravioli on grilled mushroom with a balsamic sauce was simply the best pasta dish I have had since arriving in Munich. The flavour was intense and it tasted delicious. For main I had a Dorade (gilt head bream) and I had no idea what this was until I looked up Wikipedia later (it is a Mediterranean fish and the best of the bream family). The fish was cooked to perfection and tasted delicious. The waitress even commented oh how I had picked the fish totally clean ;-)<br><br>Feeling brave after two fabulous courses I thought we should have a crack at dessert. I have been disappointed with desserts in most places but,  the Creme brûlée with a cherry compote was delicious and, the table next to us ordered a Chocolate fondant and it smelt divine, and they said they loved it. <br><br>Finally I have a spot in Munich to go to where the wine and food including dessert is fabulous, service is top notch and very friendly and, the prices are ok. To top it off it is 200m from where we live....priceless :-)<br><br>I really enjoyed this place and nothing about the meal tonight was flawed, which is rare to find in a local cafe / restaurant. The staff even spoke ok English and were extremely accommodating. I am confident I will return here again and again.",

"reviewcomment":"Here is one review on Yelp where I think I can be of some actual service to my fellow Yelpers.  <br><br>And that is to explain the second restaurant that has kinda popped up inside the first. <br><br>Thang Long, is an exquisite Vietmanese restaurant, and has been so for some time.  Fellow Yelper Queen Julie of Kassell described it perfectly, so I needn&#39;t. <br><br>But Thang Long have begun to offer a store-within-a-store.  It&#39;s called Kaiseki, and it refers to a style of Japanese cuisine not often found outside the land of the rising sun.  <br><br>Kaiseki dinners can run to a dozen tiny, exquisite courses--the meals here run to a minimum of seven.  The chef tells a story with his dishes; the changing of the season, love lost or found, tales of generations and families.  They all have their own signature sequence of dishes.  It is precious, time consuming, and even by the standards of Japanese food, mightily expensive.  <br><br>Because the preparation is so intense, chef Nakamura (licensed fugu-slicer!) asks for a reservation by Thursday for a Sunday dinner.  <br><br>My husband is Japanese and fussy about food to boot.  We visited one Sunday, and while we ordered from the Vietnamese menu, we could watch the Kaisekitude at the table next door.  <br><br>Nakamura-san wasn&#39;t justtelling a story, he was writing a three-volume novel with food.  We can attest, he&#39;s the real deal.    But only on Sundays, mind you.",

Tegernseer beer on tap!<br>Interior relatively simple but comfortable nothing special but unpretentious. 3 stars for atmosphere. Service friendly, very attentive but not pushy.

"reviewcomment":"So I would actually choose 2.5 stars for this place. It was Ok, but I&#39;ve had better (in Schwabing).<br><br>Service:<br>I was not so impressed. We reserved for 6 people on a Tuesday night and we ended up arriving 15 minutes early. When we first arrived it took quite some time before anyone came and even tried to seat us (so we were standing at the door for some time). Then, once someone finally helped us they made a table for us rather quickly, which was nice. However, once we were seating it was almost as if they had forgotten about us because no one came to take our drink orders for some time.<br>Once we finally ordered, the food came once again pretty quickly though. However, we had 1 person join us late (while we were eating) and in the end no one came and asked him if he wanted anything so he never ended up even getting something to drink before we left. The one really nice thing I can say about the service is that the waiters were friendly and at the end they brought us a nice mango liquor.<br><br>The food:<br>It&#39;s a little on the pricey side, but for the location still reasonable. Most of the dinners were around 11 -16€. I ordered the Chicken Tikki Masala and garlic naan. I specifically asked for the dinner to be &#34;gar nichts scharf&#34; (not spicy whatsoever). I know this is strange for an Indian restaurant, but I do it all the time at my favorite Indian in Munich and it&#39;s no problem. When my food came, the naan was delicious. The chicken was pretty spicy and I could barely eat it. In fact, I ended up asking then to pack 3/4ths of it to go.<br>Next less-than-satisfactory point: when I got home I realized they literally only packed the chicken, no rice to go with it. :-(  I know this is not a big deal, but it was so spicy I couldn&#39;t eat it without rice and then I had to go out and buy some (we were out in the house) and it would have been so easy for them to have included some, like the rest that they cleared from our table...<br><br>The atmosphere was nice and the restaurant was packed. However, I don&#39;t think this will be on my list of places to go back to anytime soon. I wouldn&#39;t avoid it if someone else wanted to go, but I don&#39;t think I would suggest it either.",

"reviewcomment":"So I am rating Tacos y Tequila with 4 stars because so far in Germany I have not found better Mexican. Coming from the states, I love Mexican food and the American/Mexican cuisine is completely different than the German/Mexican so probably my expectations are just different than if I would have grown up here. <br>I am a HUGE Nacho &amp; tortilla chip fan, but unfortunately in Munich most places feel Tortilla chips should come with some powdery flavor on them that is absolutely appalling - not here. If you love tortilla chips this is the place for you because they have the best in Munich. I also really enjoyed the burritos but I wasn&#39;t a huge fan of the Tacos because I&#39;m not the biggest soft corn tortilla fan. <br>Summary: If you&#39;re in the mood for Mexican and are living in Munich - I would recommend checking out Tacos y Tequila.",

"reviewcomment":"If you crave delicious Vietnamese food, Cyclo is where you want to be. This small restaurant in Maxvorstadt really packs a punch of flavor with their dishes. Reservations are needed, as the restaurant can get quite busy during dinner - so plan ahead!<br><br>I was at dinner with three other people. We all started with summer rolls - which were fresh and came with a delightful dipping sauce. One down side, if I am going to be nit picky, was there were too many noodles in the roll. <br><br>We all moved on to our main courses after the summer roll. I got the Pho, which was full bodied in flavor, and the portion was big! The Pho came with the regular cast of delicious characters, thinly sliced beef, fresh herbs and sprouts. One down side was that my dish came out much later than everyone else&#39;s at the table. My boyfriend got a noodle dish with some type of seasoned beef wrapped in seaweed; this was something I had never seen or had before, and I was pleasantly surprised. <br><br>All in all it was a good experience. I do have to point out that towards the end of the night - when we were finished with our meal - it was relatively difficult to get a waiter&#39;s attention for the check. However, this minor hiccup would not detour me from coming back. Cyclo is a highly recommendable place.",

However, this being Germany I would think it would be anything short of a sin to prepare pork poorly (say that ten times fast!). The rest of the meal - the french fries - were average, but they had a bottle of heinz ketchup at the table so that was a plus :-). It also came with a little salad... Something that is easily forgettable. <br><br>The pizza was good, although after eating half of that monsterous burger I could only eat one slice of pizza. I did take the rest home, and it was good the next day, cold. I wouldnt go back to this place just for their pizza...<br><br>The service was amazing; in comparison to the quality of service at other restaurant/bars. At first I attempted to order in my terrible German... The waiter responded back in perfect English. It made me kind of sad that he didn&#39;t at least appease my attempt to speak German, but later on I was grateful he realized how bad my German language skills are and saved me from continuingto make an ass out of myself. So major kudos to our waiter. <br><br>The atmosphere was low-key that night even though it was fasching that day. They were playing good music, and in general I had a nice time.",

"reviewcomment":"I remember quite late in night, I and my friend were struggling to find a place where we could satiate our hunger. The kind of food fanatic he is - he immediately recommended Garbo and we marched towards this place. It is a typical Italian restaurant, with typical chaos and noise..  Anyhow we went there and I was impressed by the look of it. Quite big and spacious. They have seating arrangement outside, so in warm weather enjoy your meal outside. The only flip side is that as it&#39;s in the by lanes, there is possibility that you might miss it. But not all great places are found with ease... !<br><br>Like any traditional Italian restaurant - has a touch of class, elegancy. High rise tables inside across the bar &amp; kitchen was cool. On food - I am being told they had great Pizzas; But I dint want to have Pizza so I tried the Pastas - Arabiatas. It was fantastic - not so spicy, with loads to cheese (actually too much), perfectly cooked and great sauce. I quite liked it. Then I had this amazing dessert - Affogato. For all those who know what it is - it was amazing. I tried it for the first time and I fell in love with it. If you don&#39;t know, then you definitely ask for it. The menu otherwise is quite extensive with plenty of choices - just dig in what you like. Also, I heard they have great coffees. The service was quite nice - Like a true Italian style - warmth from the heart..  <br><br>Highlight for me was that is actually open until quite late in night around midnight or 1... So a perfect spot of people like me who often are hungry during late night...!!<br><br>The fact that this neighbourhood has got so many choices of amazing restaturents, still doesn&#39;t steal the charm from this place. I will definitely recommend if you are around this place and want to try authentic Italian food.",

"reviewcomment":"this one is a nice little place on the busy leopold str. If you are hungry and wanna try Asian delicacy, then i think this is the place you may want to consider. The place has good varieties of Asian food. The highlight of the restuarent is the 8.80 unlimited buffet, and most people come here for that, to be honest. in the buffet, you get soup, starters and main course and have at least 5-6 options in each. so quite a sumptuous dinner / lunch you can think of. However, quality &amp; quantity are indirectly proportionate, so this applies here as well. the food is ok, but for me it was too greasy, which i dislike. Otherwise i have no complaints from this place. Service is also friendly and cordial. on price front i think they are moderate, if you try al carte.",

"reviewcomment":"Cafe Gratitude is a  lovely place in the heart of Munich, where gratitude is in the air: gratitude for the tasty and healthy natural food, for the talented cook that brings art in preparing the raw food, for the welcoming and friendly employees and for enjoying a wonderful time with friends.<br><br>A small tip: this is not just a cafe or a restaurant, this is a community of raw food fans and of nice people that build up their connections and support each other, meet each other very often and organize diverse events or seminars around the Cafe, just ask about their community as well when you will enjoy your time in the Cafe!  <br><br>I was lucky to meet the inspiring founders of Cafe Gratitude in August at a raw food workshop and from what I know, they planned to come back soon, it&#39;s a workshop worth attending for all those interested in joining the Cafe Gratitude community. Back in August, Cafe Gratitude Munich was just in plan, now it&#39;s a very nice reality and it&#39;s one of the places where I could stay all day long, it&#39;s part of my favourite cosy homey places in Munich. <br><br>I recommend it to everyone, whether you are vegetarian or you are not so much into veggies, just try a few raw food dishes and then you will realize that eating raw is much more tastier than expected when it&#39;s properly prepared like it is in Cafe Gratitude and it&#39;s giving a boost to your energy too!  :) I&#39;ve added already photos of the delicious healthy food that I&#39;ve got there, more to come from my next visit there! :) <br><br>And after you will visit Cafe Gratitude, don&#39;t forget to let us know here on Yelp &#34;What are you grateful for?&#34; ;))",

"reviewcomment":"After having lived in Munich for a year, we finally decided to indulge and check out one of the Michelin starred restaurants in Munich. This one is a two starred restaurant in Munich and, one of two in town with this rating. <br><br>For me the over all experience was more of 3.5 stars than a 4. The reason I have given it four stars is because of the service and the way in which they accommodated us for the evening. <br><br>Service - 5 stars<br>Flexibility of the menu - 5 stars (they made a special vegetarian menu for my wife and catered to her every need) <br>Taste - 3.5 stars<br>Value for money - 2 stars<br>Wow factor - 3 stars<br><br>We have been to Michelin starred restaurants in many countries like USA, Hong Kong, Singapore, Japan, Belgium, France, UK, Spain and now finally Germany. In terms of wow factor this place is ok but nowhere near some of the other places we have been to. <br><br>The first three courses were amazing. The fish was cooked to perfection, the mole sauce with the beef was amazing and flavours were excellent. The next three courses were a bit of a disappointment. <br><br>One of the back three courses was a 40 min poached egg with Perigord truffle and it was a total disappointment. I have made a better 40 min poached egg at home without the fancy equipment :-) the dessert which was a combination of chocolate, avocado and tomato was also a failure in my opinion as the flavours just did not work together. Mixing sweet and savoury is a fine art in my opinion and, it does not take much to get it wrong and, it was evident here with the dessert. <br><br>The wine list is fabulous and the wines we had were excellent. The sommelier was extremely helpful and helped us select some excellent German wines for the evening. The petit fours (a selection of home made chocolate) was also excellent. The petit fours probably saved the evening in my opinion. <br><br>I don&#39;t mind paying for good food but it has to have the wow factor and unfortunately I walked away with mixed opinions. <br><br>The staff here are truly wonderful and, for the service and wine alone I will be back however, given the choice of fabulous restaurants in Munich, I would have to consider carefully if, I would pay for a good experience.  I expect a great experience in places like this and I am afraid it was not so.",

"reviewcomment":"I went here with my fiancee (now wife) the evening of our engagement, and it was amazing! The service ( a family) treated us like kings: They made wonderful wine recommendations, were very attentive, they even brought us over a small dish of chili peppers when we told them how much we miss spicy food now that we live in Germany. A very cozy but hip bar/restaurant, and the tapas were the best I have had outside of Seville. I can definitely recommend the olives, serrano, and the octopus. Good prices, too we ate mexican a few evenings later and came out with a higher bill! <br>Only thumbs up here!",

"reviewcomment":"Somehow this restaurant was overlooked by me and my colleagues for a long time but after we tried it out, many of us are regulars. The food is rarely boring and usually delicious. You get the food fairly quickly and the prices are at the high end of reasonable (around 7€ for a lunch plus drinks, so just over 10€ including a small glass of wine). Sadly I rarely remember the names of the dishes but thankfully I usually have at least one Italian with me who can hypothesize what food we may be getting (some of the names are apparently peculiar even to them). The espresso is ok if you ask for a ristretto, otherwise a bit watery (there are better coffee alternatives in the area). Worth a visit.",

"reviewcomment":"So great! I like to travel light, so when spending 2 weeks in Europe I cut down on my luggage by planning to do laundry half-way through the trip. This place is amazing - great coffee that you can enjoy while your laundry does its thing. And the woman who ran the place (at least when we stopped by) is amazing - we asked if she spoke English and she was like &#34;Oh yeah! And French, Spanish, German, blah blah blah&#34; - she must have known at least a little bit of 10+ languages! Definitely a great place if you&#39;re traveling.

They all wear a big smile and greet with enthusiasm - Italian way. quite spacious. Food no doubt is great, and has a true Italian flavor. During summer has a seating arrangement outside, which on a good weather gets filled easily. often crowded by mostly by nearby neighbors and is a place where you will see many regular faces. whenever, I don&#39;t feel like going far for hitting a restaurant, this place often is the savior. on price front its moderately expensive... if gotta chance, do pay a visit...",

A friend suggested we go here and, whilst I have walked past this place many times, never bothered to try it. He has been a regular here for years and loves it and, I fully understand why :-))<br><br>The food menu is small but has some really nice Austrian specialities. I had the Streier Steak and it was crusted with a KürbiskernePesto which was fabulous and came with a side of homemade chips :-))) I loved the steak and it was cooked to perfection :-)<br><br>For dessert we had the Wiener-Kaiserschmarrn and the Salzburger nockerl and I loved both dishes thoroughly. Cranberries, Currants and nice moist pancake and meringue. Austrians do fabulous desserts and this place is no exception :-))<br><br>I will definitely return for wonderful atmosphere and delicious Austrian fare. At a minimum I know where to come for a dose of Kurbiskernöl and other such wonderful delicacies :-))<br><br>Last but not least they have a decent wine by the glass and some ok wines by the bottle. They have an extensive menu of cocktails and spirits if that is what you fancy.",

The vegetables still had a freshness to them, not the overcooked, mushy kind of minestrone. It seemed like something homemade. Thumbs up to this.<br><br>The interior is what I remember the most. The place is lined with pine from wall to ceiling, there are taper candles lit on every table and the table cloths were a warm reddish color.

"reviewcomment":"Great food, very colorful place, good location.<br><br>I was searching yelp for a good place for breakfast while in Munich, for some reason, all the reviews are in german :) so I decided to add one in english. <br><br>We went there for breakfast and pretty much ordered anything that didn&#39;t had pork, and everything tasted great. The place is in a small but very beautiful shopping area, on the border of old town (couple of minutes away from Marienplatz).  Weather permitting you should try sitting outside or close to the window to enjoy the view. Inside is ok too, too many pillows, but still ok.<br>Not sure why they have an item named &#39;two eggs in glass&#39;, but it&#39;s exactly what it says two poached (or maybe boiled, I am no expert on eggs) eggs in a glass.",

"reviewcomment":"There are many fastfood options along this street, but one of the best is definitely this little pizza place. You can order pizza by the slice or a whole one. The slices are heated up, but if you order a whole pizza it will be made on order. It might not be the best pizza in town, however it is way superior to the burger joint down the street. <br>All pizzas can be ordered to take away, but if you got some time you can sit down inside, if you can get an open spot. I liked the interior design and being able to watch the staff prepare the food. <br>However is is always crowded, therefore a bit hectic and noisy which leaves you with a feeling of being at a fastfood place. And this is what it is in the end. The pizzas may be quite good but not the best, and at least the slices are pre made. The place looks cool but the atmosphere is still a bit bustling. <br>Definitly give it a try if your tummy is growling and you need to grab a fast bite.",

"reviewcomment":"We finally made it to this nearby restaurant that we&#39;ve had our eyes on forever, and it was really nice! My &#34;Ceviche tradicional&#34; starter was top notch, and my wife&#39;s deep fried manioc was nice too. As main course I tried the (vegetarian) Quinua, which was very nice, like a risotto but based on a different grain. My wife&#39;s lamb (Seco de cordero) was tasty, though the rice that came with it was a bit dry. The food was accompanied by a Peruvian Syrah, which was not mindblowing but still a nice drink, and slightly exotic. The décor is nice and the service was fine. An easy four stars; hop on the U2 to Theresienstrasse, walk for less than a minute once you&#39;re on the street, and enjoy!",

One of them is Woerners, a coffee shop in Marienplatz, where I went today.

It cannot be picked up with chopsticks to be eaten.<br><br>The value gets a low rating because my soy sauce dinner was nearly 10 euros. How does steamed veggies, tofu, and rice come out to 10 euros? On top of that, they tried to charge me 1 euro for ordering tap water (leitungwasser). And that&#39;s when I got mad. Because I just ate expensive crap for dinner and you&#39;re trying to fuck me out of another euro bc you filled a glass up with free water? <br><br>Service was nothing to get excited about either. I know going to a restaurant in Munich (maybe all of Germany?) means expecting bad service. I get it. But when the waitress is coughing everywhere all evening behind the counter (including into her hands) then brings food out to the tables - we have a problem. Am I being a paranoid American? Maybe. But I find this unacceptable. If you&#39;re sick, then don&#39;t touch my food please.<br><br>This is the 2nd Vietnamese place I&#39;ve been to in Munich that German Yelpers gave good reviews to but turned out to be garbage. I am starting to have serious doubts about the German palate when it comes to discerning good East and Southeast Asian food from a pile of warmed turds.",

"reviewcomment":"I probably shouldn&#39;t like this currywurst stand as much as I do. It is one of my favorite street foods and this is my go-to place in town. First, there is the convenient location, since the stand is on Bayernstrasse in front of the Hauptbahnhoff (Central Station). And while currywurst stands are a dime a dozen in Munich (it even has its own category on Yelp), this one has a bit more humor and variety than many others I&#39;ve visited.<br><br>What differentiates Esspunkt from other places is the options. In my experience, there is usually just one type of curry served. Period. Esspunkt is all about the options, many of them spicy. And, frankly, they hooked me with their advertising slogan, &#34;Pimp your Currywurst.&#34;<br><br>They offer two types of sausages (red and white) and eight curry options (from their menu):<br><br>1) Easy Curry<br>2) Munich Chili<br>3) Hot &amp; Wild <br>4) Call of Fire<br>5) Extreme Burner<br>6) Way to Hell<br>7) Devil&#39;s Powder<br>8) King of Esspunkt (Final Countdown)<br><br>Prices are reasonable and I also appreciate that the standard offering is a moderate serving of pommes frites (fries), but you can still pay extra for an XXL helping. Really all I want is something a little spicier than the norm and I don&#39;t want to pay 4 Euro for fries, so this works out great for me.<br><br>Even though they are a cart, they have a couple tables out front and a small, enclosed dining area on the side. The guys who work here are adorable, but do note it is a cash only business.",

"reviewcomment":"We tried Der Weichandhof while staying at the nearby Hotel Schleusse, and were lucky enough to be there for their &#34;Vienna night&#34;. Rather than the traditional Bavarian food, they were featuring Vienna cuisine and beer. There was also a three person band performing Austrian songs for the patrons and though they were a bit pushy with their CD sales, it added to the atmosphere. We sat in the immense beer garden which was populated with locals, their dogs, and their kids at the on-premises playground. It made for a very welcoming, authentic feeling.<br><br>Service was very good and attentive. We sat for a few hours enjoying the sights and sounds and had a few rounds of beer and the moment we put an empty glass down, we were asked if we wanted more. The waitresses were all clad in traditional Bavarian drindles which was a bit cheesy but didn&#39;t feel forced.<br><br>I don&#39;t recall the names of what we ordered and the special menu isn&#39;t on their site anymore, but everything was delicious. I got a steak that was covered in crunchy onions and came with some delicious fried potatoes on the side. My wife got the tafelspitz which was covered in fantastic gravy sauce. <br><br>Weichandhof is a wonderful place to spend an afternoon or evening soaking in the atmosphere, some good traditional food, and some delicious beer.",

"reviewcomment":"I have to give a big tip of my hat to this place. In comparison to other Mexican joints in town  *cough cough Milagros cough cough* this one really does live up to its reputation. Though I had never been there before, I decided I wanted to try it for my birthday dinner.....a risky move, but I&#39;m glad I took the risk. <br><br>My friends and I took full advantage of the Happy Hour from 5 to 7pm. Even if the drinks hadn&#39;t been at Happy Hour prices, they still would be worth the money. No skimping on alcohol here! Also, upon being told it was my birthday, the owner (pretty sure his name was Jorge) sent out a round of shots and played not one but TWO birthday songs for me. Jorge really is a nice guy and makes you feel like he appreciates your business.  <br><br>Now on to the food. I had the enchiladas de mole and I must say it was really on point! The mole sauce was out of this world. It was the first time since I moved to Munich that I was able to enjoy great, authentic Mexican. From the chocolate, to the chilis, to the spices....it was like you could taste every separate ingredient in the sauce and it all blended together perfectly. I was so pleased with myself for choosing this dish haha <br><br>There isn&#39;t a question of IF I will eat here again, the only question is WHEN. Two big thumbs from me!",

"reviewcomment":"I like coming here for a quick but relaxing lunch during the workweek.  Friendly service, rotating menu, and decent prices kept me coming here two to five (5!) times a week until I started to pack my own lunch because of work pressures.  Still, I miss my little oasis here and given half an excuse, will find a reason to slip out of work and let my stress and worries melt away here.<br><br>I often decompress here during the midday over a pot of tea.  The tea menu is not particularly extensive, nor are the teas particularly fine, but they are good enough, and always do the trick.<br><br>Table reservations are sometimes an issue, but I have always managed to get a seat, even if the last.  Make sure to arrive earlier during the lunch break, because by the end they start running out of the various daily specials (usually beginning with the cheapest option, the salad).<br><br>By the way, if you ever see Krautwickerl on the daily menu, ORDER IT!  It&#39;s a cabbage roll, and it is yummy in the tummy!",

The drinks arrived right away, the starters after 15 minutes (guess the kitchen just started to operate). More people came to have some drinks, but no one else ordered food. After the waiter (which was by the way very friendly) cleared the dishes from our starters, we waited. And waited, and waited. It took 45 minutes for a Pho (soup) and Veggie Curry to arrive. I know a Pho needs to be cooked for 24 hours but if it&#39;s ready it shouldn&#39;t take 45 minutes to put it in a bowl and serve it.<br><br>The soup was good, not as much as the usual serving at other restaurants, but still good. The curry was very, very spicy. No chance to finish it without the help of a bowl of rice.<br><br>The prices where ok, not cheap, and the staff friendly. But if I&#39;ll come back, I guess it&#39;s only gonna be for drinks...",

The food didn&#39;t blow me away like I&#39;m used to with a really great Lebanese joint. If you&#39;re new to the cuisine, it could be a nice simple introduction. Generally I expect large portion sizes and not stop flavor. It might have been because we came in with the Groupon deal, but I felt we only got a little taste of everything. The usuals were there however, baba ganoush, hummus, falafil, tabouli, etc. <br><br>Good spot for an easy and tasty dinner, but what you get isn&#39;t necessarily worth what you pay.",

"reviewcomment":"Osteria Alpenhof is a great find. a very cool crowd in an up and coming area, both young and old. We&#39;ve eaten there a bunch of times recently and always been happy with the quality of the food. <br><br>A lot of classics, the chef/owner is a German who worked in Rome for a while. The staff is great, friendly and laid back, but very professional. The arugula Salad was large and had a fresh, light, citrus dressing, the antipasti plate was delicious. one of us had a swordfish carpaccio and one of us tried an interesting risotto with cabbage. The Arabbiata was perfectly spicy. Certainly everything was a cut above the usual Italian place in Munich.<br><br>We didn&#39;t try desserts, but had some great wines at very reasonable prices. We have been in once or twice for a drink at their bar and are looking forward to the Terrace in spring. <br><br>There is also a short take out menu we&#39;ve used sometimes later in the evening.<br><br>Definitely recommend this place",

"reviewcomment":"This is a very modern place both in food, food display and in the architecture which I thought was good. I also must state that this was the second day Rilano No.6 was opened so that definitely has an impact on them being up to speed.  Overall the food is very good and presentation was top notch. I wasn&#39;t impressed by the flavor of the mushroom cappuccino (very salty and a strong aftertaste) but the presentation was intriguing. The big hang up here is the service. We were seated at 8:30 and it took an hour before they took our order.  An hour and a half into the service and all we had were drinks. Overall it was a 3 hour service and I&#39;m guessing that they lost a lot of money by not turning it efficiently.  However, there were several empty tables so I don&#39;t think it was a huge need to turn tables very quickly.  We  were not the only people waiting much of the night as most of the tables around us seemed to be having the same issue.  Will most likely not return unless service is vastly improved as it was also quite expensive.  All this despite &#34;DJ Hell is in da house&#34; (a quote from the server).",

"reviewcomment":"Same path, different day. <br><br>I visited Munchen72...this time, they were open! However, my boyfriend was turned off by the smell of burned cheese (hey, its a fondue place), so we skipped elsewhere for dinner after a few drinks. Looks like Munchen72 and I were just not meant to be on this trip, sigh. <br><br>And where was that, you ask? Back to Lago di Garda. And, I&#39;m here to report...even better dinner experience than I had at lunch! <br><br>Our kind (and semi-fluent in english) server equipped us with a nice table in the back, a wonderful bottle of chianti, two mista salads and a fresh basket of bread (much improved over my lunch bread from the week before). <br><br>The best exchange involved &#34;butter.&#34; <br><br>Boyfriend: Do you have any butter? <br>Waiter: ::::confused:::: (even though he speaks english)<br>Boyfriend: :::makes swiping motion over his bread::::<br>Waiter: ::::brings reinforcement::::<br>2nd Waiter: (a bit more fluent): Oh...&#34;butter!&#34; (pronounced: &#34;bew-ter&#34;<br>Waiter: Oh! Betwer! Yes. <br>Boyfriend: Ah, I see. Bewter. Good to know. <br>Waiter: returns with a flourish of shaved butter amidst some greens. Nicely done!<br><br>--<br><br>Ok so after we got some bewter...we dove into the menu. I opted for a daily special, the parpadelle with beef, mushrooms and mozzarella, my boyfriend the spaghetti bolognese. Mine was wonderful, handmade noodles, perfect. I could only finish half due to the large portion...bf polished the whole plate. That&#39;s what a day of being lost in Munich, drinking 4 beers, and not eating all day will do to a man, I suppose. <br><br>We capped the night with 2 complimentary limoncello from our server (thanks!), bid our friends adieu and commented on what a lovely Italian dining experience. <br><br>I liked it better at dinner...a bit dimmer, great food. A meal for two with a bottle of wine was 72 euros. <br><br>Ciao!",

"reviewcomment":"What a gem! Honestly, as I approached this restaurant I sighed and thought to myself  &#34;My goodness, can this place be any more kitschy?&#34; From the red, green, and white lights to the oversized plants in the windows, I was preparing myself for an interesting experience. I really should have taken my Mom&#39;s advice to &#34;never judge a book by it&#39;s cover&#34;.<br><br>The server was very helpful with making suggestions for both entres and wine (although it was hard to find him later on in the meal). Also, I was blown away by how fast we received our food, and thank god because I was s-t-a-r-v-i-n-g!! I had the pasta carbonara and it was hands down, no contest, THE BEST carbonara I&#39;ve had in my life. When I go back here it is going to be really hard for me to ever try anything else on the menu! I was really sad I had to split this dish with my friend since he ordered a pizza and we agreed to share our food. Don&#39;t get my wrong, the pizza was also great.....but that carbonara....my mouth is watering just thinking about it.<br><br>Desert was a bit of a flop. I forget what it was called (super sorry about that people!) but it was basically an Italian version of a flan or creme catalana, but the syrup poured on top of it tasted like maple syrup mixed with water. However, that will NOT keep me away from Ristorante Italy.  <br><br>I went on a Sunday night around 8pm and this charming (again....kitschy but charming nevertheless) was still very busy, and I really think that&#39;s a reflection of how great it is.  : )",

The particular day I went, I got squid with a spicy sauce and veggies. The squid was quite tender and not chewy at all.  The vegetables and other sides did not lack any seasoning.<br><br>Service is very friendly and attentive.Great place to go for a quick meal during your lunch break!",

"reviewcomment":"What a great place. The interior is very nice. Very friendly staff. They take their time to talk to their guests, make suggestions, and are very proud of the food they serve. It&#39;s not a huge restaurant, maybe that&#39;s why it feels even better. You can have your privacy (if you want to).<br><br>The food was excellent. Totally different from other middle eastern kitchens (eg. Persian). We had a starter platter for four. It included their specialty, pickled pumpkins (soooo good), eggplants, fried things (can&#39;t tell what it was), bread, and dips. A great start.<br><br>We then chose four different main courses, chicken, lamb, browned rice, grilled veggies. Everything was prepared from scratch, very fresh, and the meat was grilled to perfection.<br><br>After the main course we were stuffed, but we still had to try the mango dessert. Also very good. Simple, but perfect.<br><br>They have a good selection of tea (made with fresh leaves) and other beverages.<br><br>HIGHLY recommend this place!!!!!",

Die Schlange bildet sich mangels Absperrung oder sonstiger Aufbauten direkt im Bereich des Eingangs, so dass ankommende Gäste sich durchdrängeln müssen, da es recht eng wird.<br><br>Alles in Allem ein gutes Restaurant.",

"reviewcomment":"Love, love, LOVE this place! Stumbled upon it while walking through the gardens off of Dachauerstr this past summer. My boyfriend and I went there with his parents, while they were visiting us, and the food was out of this world delicious. The portions are big enough for two people (if you&#39;re willing to share delicious goodness), the prices are totally reasonable. If I remember correctly for 4 people and 3 entrees it was around 30 euros (incl drinks). Last time I got this special lamb and potato dish. The lamb was cooked perfectly, the potatoes were the right texture and had perfect seasoning; also, I think that it came with a salad as well - which was equally as yummy.<br><br>The second time I went to this restaurant it was PACKED. It was one of the last nice, warm sunny days here in Munich, and the biergarten area of the restaurant was almost packed to the gills - which is a great thing! This time, I ordered the mussels that they had on special, and my boyfriend got the fried calamari salad, which was also on special. The mussels came with the option of two different sauces, one white wine sauce, and one tomato garlic sauce;  I opted for the tomato garlic sauce. When they put the heaping bowl of mussels in front of me my eyes became as big as saucers. This 9 euro dish was HUGE, totally enough for two people, but I don&#39;t like to share my mussels so I gladly devoured the entire thing; even sopping up the sauce with bread at the end. If it were not considered bad manners I probably would have licked the bowl. I LOVE mussels, and it has been very sad for me to live in Munich where the good moderately priced seafood restaurants are far and few between. The mussels were perfectly cooked, absolutely delicious. <br><br>I have to also give my boyfriend&#39;s dish two big thumbs up as well. The fried calamari was perfectly cooked. Sometimes when you get fried calamari it can become chewy... not this time! This portion was also large enough for two people - luckily my boyfriend is much nicer than I am and shared some of his calamari with me :). <br><br>The people are friendly at this establishment, the food is absolutely phenomenal, and the price is right! If you want some good seafood, this is your place; if you want some good Greek food this is your place. <br><br>Yum.",

"reviewcomment":"I was here on business and while I had some spare time I went shopping at the Marienplatz area.  After that, I decided to look around and find somewhere nice to have a sit down diner.  I saw a few places in the square but none were what I was looking for.  So, I decided to look on Yelp.  I saw 2 Italian restaurants and decided on The Charles Restaurant Davvero.  I walked through the park just after sunset which was quite nice.  I later found out the noises I heard in the bushes were rabbits as I felt like I was being followed.  It was mysterious but nice.  <br><br>Anyway, when I arrived, I was greeted very professionally and could tell I was in for a treat.  They took my shopping bags and I sat down for diner.  I ordered the mozzarella and it was delicious.  I order it all around the world and I was not disappointed.  For the main course, I order the ravioli.  When it arrived, I chuckled to myself as there were about 5 small Raviolis.   I know I was not in the US.  But please don&#39;t let that worry you, it was delicious and I wanted to save room for desert anyway which I did.  I ordered the tiramisu.  It was perhaps the best I have ever had.  Lastly, after all was said and done, the brought out some free paste rise and they were wonderful.  <br><br>The service was top notch and I highly recommend this restaurant for anyone looking for a nice relaxing diner.",

"reviewcomment":"&#34;Running Sushi&#34; is a very unfortunate choice of words for the sushi train. I went there with a party of 13 tonight (half kids/adults) and we had a pretty good time. The sushi it self was limited to mackeral and salmon and california derivatives. These came in nigiri, sashimi (never seen sashimi on a buffet) and maki. I found some pretty negative reviews on other sites but I found it to be quite decent for the price. Given that I can drop $200 on a sushi meal in even the modest of locales, the 17 euro dinner wasn&#39;t half bad. The thai choices on the top were half decent as well. I give the food a good, solid three stars, the value stars and the venue another solid three.",

"reviewcomment":"A little so-so on Pimay...<br><br>Unfortunately, we were excited to try Deeba...but found it was closed between lunch and dinner hours. We trekked another few blocks to Pimay, where a sweet lady helped us find some lunch. <br><br>The buffet seemed (italics) like a good option. Quick, relatively easy to figure out what was what, etc. However, it left a bit to be desired. Noodles burned to overcooked in one dish, soupy sauces...things had just been sitting too long. Usually the issue with buffets, eh? Eh. Right. <br><br>The soup available was a Tom Kha...and was served in a crock pot. That makes me nervous, but it tasted pretty good. I&#39;m sure many places make their soups like this, it&#39;s just I never SEE the crockpot...so, you know. You know. <br><br>I had a plate and then decided not to do anymore...it just wasn&#39;t that appealing, though it was filling. The lady who served us was very, very nice and accommodating. <br><br>They do take credit cards. <br><br>3-star reviews are hard to write...so hopefully this was factual enough to let you know the skinny. Try it, but order off the menu so its fresh and life lesson: don&#39;t eat off a lunch buffet at 330pm.",

"reviewcomment":"Have only experienced this joint as an event location, which is ideal. With a decent sized dining room and bar on the ground floor and additional seating in the open balcony, it&#39;s a great location to allow people to mix and mingle.<br><br>The location near Isartor makes it easy to get in and out... always cabs available for late night partying.<br><br>The cuisine is somehow latin, but with a strange Mediterranean flair. The set menu generally includes tapas style Vorspeisen and the main meal is a hearty, but not overly filling, meat-and-potatoes type plate. Perfect to satisfy, but not slow you down for the dancing that is sure to follow.<br><br>Recommended as an event venue; will have to swing by another time to try out the standard fare.",

Its right next to the Germany McDonalds Corprate Headquarters, so they do their best to keep it in tip top shape. I&#39;ve even heard that this McDonalds gets the new stuff first... but don&#39;t quote me on that one. Its very clean, busy on the up hours and pretty calm on the in between ones. It has a very nice drive through, a McCafe (genius), and play place for kids, outside eating area as awell as an upstairs and downstairs, bathrooms (I&#39;m pretty sure they&#39;re free), and that Erdbeer Ritter Sport McFlurry I love. If Your looking for the most presentable and enthralling McDonalds experience this is where to go. That&#39;s why I rated it &#39;&#39;As Good as it Gets&#39;&#39;.",

Be sure to make dinner reservations because the restaurant is usually very busy. If you catch nice weather, they serve outdoors and for sure you will need a reservation to get an outdoor table. The prices are reasonable and the beer is sehr gut. The hotel is fairly convenient to the airport and is close to the train station for easy access to Munich and other locals.

Sometimes the cafe is closed but the ice cream window is open. I got the Kinder pingui again, but in a cone this time. I hate when ice cream places use cheap waffle cones that taste like plastic. Luckily, they don&#39;t do this here. The cone was light and crispy and had a flavor of it&#39;s own. One scoop was the perfect amount for a evening snack.<br><br>Until next time...",

"reviewcomment":"Wow. What a delicious place! One taste of their &#34;pott-kit&#34; and I am instantly hooked. <br><br>Unfortunately or this place, it is closed until January as they are moving locations. I guess this is also extremely unfortunate for their Pavesi Picnic addicts too! <br><br>This place is totally hipster (or at least it was). Low-ish tables, you sit on crates, and it can get really crowded, really fast. However,the wait to order and the wait for your food are totally worth it. Can the people who work there stand to lose their &#34;I&#39;m a hipster, I don&#39;t really care&#34; attitude? Yes. <br><br>If the workers chippered up their attitudes, and the layout was a little better (and maybe it will become better with the new space) this place would have received 5 stars from me. <br><br>They have a TON of vegetarian options, but also don&#39;t make you feel bad if you order something that has meat in it. Also, the portions are HUGE. For 9.90 I got their pott kit, which is some type of curry (your choice of meat or potatoes) a giant salad and a piece of bread. I almost couldn&#39;t finish it, but it was sooooo good that I managed to muster up the space for the whole meal.<br><br>Once this place opens again I will be one of their first customers.",

"reviewcomment":"On my never ending quest to find spicy food, I figured out that the Germanic version of Italian food can be quite spicy!  After a rainy day of exploring Munich and Dachau, I was craving soup and spicy food.  We stumbled upon this place and saw they had a couple kinds of soup, so in we went.  I got the tortellini soup, which tasted like an Italian take on wonton soup.  It had a chicken broth with tons of cheese tortellinis floating around.  For my entree, I had the penne arrabbiata and it was super spicy.  When you order spicy red-sauce dishes in Austria and Germany, they add cut up hot peppers into the sauce!  Why don&#39;t wee do that here?  The peppers add a sweet and spicy element to the dish.  They tasted very similar to hot cherry peppers, but I think they were a diff local pepper.  <br><br>The atmosphere was nice with warm lighting that wasn&#39;t too bright.  It was a little crowded in the walkways but we got a nice table in the corner.  We were seated by a very engaging nice gentlemen, but sadly he wasn&#39;t our server.  Our server was an old guy who moved slow as molasses.  It ended up being fine, but it was far from attentive service.  I really enjoyed the food and thought the prices were appropriate.  Would def eat here again if I return to Munich someday...",

"reviewcomment":"My favorite sushi place in Munich. the restaurant is small and typically Japanese. The staff is very friendly and the prices are totally ok considering the quality of food you get there. <br>It is defiantly worth a visit and I will be a regular whenever I am in Munich.<br>It might not be the right choice for big crowds though, the tables are limited.",

"reviewcomment":"This has been our go-to place for take-out sushi for years. Excellent price/quality ratio for Munich. You can call in your order and have it waiting for you to pick up in 15 to 30 minutes. The miso soup is particularly tasty.<br><br>Eating at the restaurant itself has never really appealed to me - the decor is simple and fast-foody - but it&#39;s a viable option if you&#39;re not in the mood for take-away.",

"reviewcomment":"Self control.....two words that are eliminated from my vocabulary when someone mentions Asahi for lunch. I work dangerously close to this delicious running sushi bar! Even if I pack a lunch or tell myself that I&#39;m not going out to eat with anyone for lunch, if Asahi is an option I will change my mind with little to no convincing. Luckily, it t isn&#39;t bad for my wallet, ringing in at only 11 euro for the buffet plus drink and tip. Ding Ding Ding! We have a winning combination!<br><br>What I like most about Asahi&#39;s lunch is the variety of hot/cold items and vegetarian/non-vegetarian items. Even if you eat here every week, I don&#39;t think you&#39;d get sick of it because it&#39;s not the typical &#34;every roll is a california roll&#34; sushi joint. I&#39;m super excited to give their dinner offering a shot sometime, though it is going to cost more than the 11 euro I&#39;m used to forking out  : )<br><br>Seriously, just writing this review has made me wish my coworkers and I go here this week!  :)<br><br>p.s- there are only maybe 8 or 9 tables around the running sushi, so call when they open that day to reserve a spot (no need to call a day early).",

I cannot believe that I have lived 200m from this place for almost a year and never stopped by :-((( It&#39;s a small restaurant with about 25 seats and it was fully booked. It feels homely and the hosts make you feel like you are a guest at their home. <br><br>The food here is fabulous. The service is fabulous and the atmosphere is unglaublich :-)))) the best experience in Munich by far for me :-))) if you have special requirements let them know beforehand and they will try to cater for it. <br><br>The food is amazing and really well done. I have not been in a restaurant in Munich where I have cleaned the plate as much as I have here. <br><br>The scallops with black truffle and beetroot was out of this world. The lamb main was tender and cooked to perfection. The best lamb I have had in years and the Pannacotta was delicious. They have a nice wine list with an extensive selection of reasonably priced Italian wines with an odd bit of French thrown in. <br><br>The service here is world class and the hosts were extremely accommodating :-)) It&#39;s been around for just over a year and it feels like it&#39;s been here for decades. The host remembered my name and was extremely hospitable :-))) <br><br>This is definitely going to be our regular going forward. Flavours like this is hard to find and the owners are so nice they even cooked a special meal for my wife that was totally vegetarian and just the way she wanted :-)) if that&#39;s not great service I don&#39;t know what is ? <br><br>A true gem in Schwabing :-)))",

One surprise is that they seem to serve really nice salads in the beer garden as well as more usual fair.<br><br> Best of all, my favourite of all Bavarian beers, Konig Ludwig Dunkels is on sale here.<br><br> I&#39;d still go to Franzz in preference to here, but if you&#39;re looking for a nice beer garden in West Munich you could do a lot worse than here.",

Loved the scallops and the white asparagus was in season and delicious. I would definitely go back again. It&#39;s one of those sometimes locations because it&#39;s pretty darned spendy, but worth it every once in a while.",

"reviewcomment":"This is a tiny little place.  You&#39;ll probably want to call ahead and book a table.  Very stylish ambiance, modern and sleek.   Service is OK, not great. <br><br>although pho (hot beef noodle soup) is a classic dish of Vietnam, it is PERFECT on a cold rainy/snowy winter day in Munich.  So far, i have only tried the pho, but it was among the best i&#39;ve had -- perfectly cooked noodles, tender tasty beef slices, flavorful broth (almost delicately spiced), and all kinds of fresh herbs (actually a very interesting variety, much more than I&#39;m used to getting in Vietnamese places in California).    <br><br>The price was a lot higher than you may be used to seeing if you&#39;re used to pho in those hole-in-the-wall Vietnamese pho places in California.  But it&#39;s not unreasonably priced, if you consider  how difficult to get &amp; how expensive the ingredients must be in Munich.    Overall, the total experience is really quite nice. <br><br>(p.s. not sure if there&#39;s an English menu or not).",

They have a changing lunch menu that is reasonably priced - ranging from quiches and escargots to steaks. They have a (barely readabe on the blackboard in the back) but extensive choice of French wines by the glass or by the bottle some of which are quite pricey. My food was excellent - a quiche with just the right texture and a salad. Service is efficient.",

"reviewcomment":"This place is a lot different compared to my first time here in 2011!<br><br>The main reason why I&#39;ve yet to return was  because of the atrocious service my initial visit. I thought the food overshadowed the service so I didn&#39;t mind too much, but my parents refused. However, after 4 years I wanted to go back and see if the food (and service) has gotten better. <br><br>Now, the presence of Asian fusion is noticeable in each dish. Unlike the first visit where it was just modern. So that was an interesting change! <br><br>Each course was tasty. However, my favorite was the angler fish with 2 types of radish salad, green asparagus, sushi ginger. I was a bit disappointed that they would do 2 types of white dish back to back...I would have preferred another protein (or none at all) to contrast. <br><br>3 courses was more than enough for me. My dad opted for 4 courses and he had a veal ravioli with truffle. He said it was quite good, but not sure if it was worth the extra  money for the course of such a small portion. <br><br>A notable improvement though was the service! It was on point! Very attentive and friendly, so thumbs up for that!! <br><br>I recommend trying Shane&#39;s at least once if you can! It&#39;s definitely an interesting culinary experience =)",

"reviewcomment":"I think, I have found my favourite Italian wine bar in Munich. Friends of ours suggested we try this place as, they have walked by it many times and have looked in and said they wanted to try it :-) I am glad they suggested it. It was full on the Friday night and, many of the customers were known to the staff, which is always a good sign.<br><br>The wine list here is excellent and the prices even better. Many of the wines are aged and almost all the wine we had (and we had a lot :-)) was under €30 a bottle which is rare for wines that are up to 10 years old. For this alone I would give the place five stars :-)))<br><br>The food here is also good. Ok, so my steak was a little bit too salty but, it was cooked to perfection. The potatoes were ok and the salad they served with it was divine. We also shared a cheese plate which was really nice, with a spicy jam / sauce, that complemented the cheese beautifully :-))<br><br>The hosts here are wonderful and they made recommendations and took care of our needs and,  of course very Italian. They let us hang around as long as we wanted (and we did) and asked us to come back again, to which we said, of course :-))<br><br>I will definitely be back here to enjoy some wonderful wine and a meal with friends :-))",

"reviewcomment":"As an American, I am always curious to check out what Germans think an American restaurant should be. At Pan Americana, I was pleasantly surprised. Rather than an American restaurant focusing just on the United States, I found the menu to cover ALL of the Americas, hence PAN Americana. <br><br>While some of the dishes were not prepared in the classic sense (Caesar Salad, for example) I found it tasty and well-suited to a German palate. The steaks were all delicious and the cheeseburgers, which the kids ordered, were spot on. <br><br>Being a native of California, I am rather picky about my Mexican food, but I am anxious to go back and try some of their nachos next time I&#39;m in town.",

"reviewcomment":"Recently, we were in the restaurant Landersdorfer &amp; Innerhofer in the Hackengasse in Munich.<br>We had a table reserved via the internet form. In addition to the email confirmation we were called back three days prior the date whether the reservation is still valid from our side and whether the number of people is still correct. Nice service. By the way one should precisely examine in which of the restaurant one has reserved a table on the website! ;-)<br>To go with the car to the restaurant is a game of fortune or you are wasting one. So, don&#39;t bother using the public transport. Unfortunately, all underground stations (Sendlinger Tor, Stachus and Marienplatz) are not really nearby.<br>We were warmly welcomed and due to our early arrival we could choose a table. The furnishing is somewhere between comfortable and slightly rustic.<br>One gets a 4-course surprise menu for a fixed price of round about 60 EUR (excl. beverage). But it is asked whether certain ingredients should be avoided. The menu can also be extended. The waiter/waitress asks during the meal whether another course for some extra money each is wished and of course what it is. The courses sound so good that we extended to the maximum amount of 6 courses. The prices are upmarket, but the food and the really attentive service are really high class and worth the money. Especially, I liked the basil sorbet, so my wife ordered secretly another portion for me. My wife who had birthday was honored with a little something.<br>To summarize: willingly again",

"reviewcomment":"I won&#39;t give it a star actually. Was really disappointed about the service, besides being late and making you wait a lot till they will take the order, the food was poor and chaotically added to the &#34;plate&#34;. The main course was a disaster. Wanted to have pork rolls with Serrano and veggies. 1st the Serrano was awfully salty. 2nd. The pork was raw, is one of the first rules in gastronomy, never leave the pork raw and the 3rd. The veggies (4 slices of potato and 3 slices of carrot, and i am not exaggerating) were cold. I had a few cosmopolitans which none of them tasted the same, one was mega sweet, second medium, 3rd had to send it back twice till i gave up. The barman came to me and started to yell at me or tried to explain me in a rough impolite manner that this is the way you do a cocktail. I am not interesting how is done but how it tastes. Anyway, they brought the second dish way before finishing the first and we had to wait and about 10 minutes with the empty glasses when there was maximum 5 tables in the restaurant to get another round of drinks.  When i was complaining they offered me a schnapps or a drink from the house which i found on the bill lately. Before leaving we asked the bill, they brought it but they never came to collect the money. So we&#39;ve been supposed to leave and let the money on the table. I eat out a lot and truly to say this is by far the worst experience I had in Munich. About the prices is much to expensive for the interior design, ambience, athmosphere and quality. I don&#39;t recommend it at all to anyone. They opened the bar with 1 month before they should have.",

Period. The real italian deal. For that 5 stars review and if possible even more.<br><br>Location accesibility?  5 stars as well, it&#39;s at a walking distance from Central station, offering also a take out service, a serious pizza slice for merely 2-3Euro if you&#39;re on the way. <br><br>Restaurant - Here is where they lose stars in my perspective. They have nice fast service in front at the take away section and also in the restaurant. But the restaurant setting is really too crowded from my point of view. I was once for a dinner with a friend and we stayed at one of the 2 seat tables. It felt crowded, little tables crowded to get as many people in as possible, the waiter was constantly disturbing us to pass and reach the 4 seats places, we were so close to the others that we could basically attend their conversation ...from this point of view, if it&#39;s crowded, I will not  go back there, unless I can enjoy the nice 4 seats places. If it&#39;s crowded, I&#39;d rather take something on the way and eat it into a nice park near by or at home. In a relaxed day it&#39;s totally worth staying .",

There were non-soup lunch specials such as pastas and vegetable dishes, but they were usually already prepared in large batches. They looked unappealing to me as they just laid on the counter cold until they were re-warmed for order. On the other hand, their breads and pastries were always decent.<br><br>Service was fast as I often saw more than 3-4 servers before the counter, anxiously waiting to take their next order.",

"reviewcomment":"I came here for the Yelp Burger event last night, and had a really enjoyable evening. We had a table of ~20 people, half of whom spoke German, half English, and even though there was only one server, the service was pretty darn good - got all my drinks and food reasonably quickly. <br><br>I got the Big Frida Burger. I thought it was tasty (especially the sauce and fries), though I wish I could have gotten it done medium instead of well. The bread (which I&#39;m picky about) seemed homemade, but the moisture from the burger and toppings quickly soaked through. But it was delicious and had a unique chewy texture. <br><br>They have a really good beer selection, and  I had my first Munich Mule there last night, which was also pretty good. <br><br>My whole meal - burger w fries, 2 beers, and a Munich Mule, came to 25 euros, so the prices were definitely reasonable.",

If you are not in the mood for crepes, there is also a good salad menu to choose from. <br><br>The interior is not quite big however this adds to the ambiance of the restaurant. There is also some tables outside if wanted. <br><br>My friends and I had a dinner crepe of spinach, cheese and bacon which was delicious!! For dessert, we had an apple and cinnamon crepe with vanilla ice cream. Yum!! The entire meal with drinks for an individual was under 20€.<br><br>I would definitely recommend this place for a nice drink and dessert!",

"reviewcomment":"This is the most authentic Vietnamese restaurant in Munich (so far).<br><br>We were tipped off to check out this place by a cashier at an Asian market.  He was Vietnamese and lived in Munich- he had credibility, so we had to stake out this place for ourselves. <br><br>The hours are a bit strange. Like some Japanese joints, they close in the middle of the day (closed between 15:00-18:00), and reopen again for dinner. The interior is nothing fancy but that&#39;s the way I like my Vietnamese eateries- no frills, just good food.<br><br>The food: The menu has no Thai influences like most other &#34;Vietnamese&#34;  places here. Typical menu items include pho (noodle soups), bun (rice vermicelli dishes) com (rice dishes) and other staples like spring rolls. The eye catcher on the menu was Banh Xeo, a savory Vietnamese rice flour &amp; coconut-based crepe typically filled with shrimp or pork and sprouts. The only weird thing is that to get this rare dish, you have to order it a day in advance and then pay 10 euros for it. Yikes.<br><br>The pho comes in two sizes, klein for $5.90 (which is not so small) or groß for $7.90 (a normal pho serving) with the side of vegetables including sprouts, Thai basil, cilantro (coriander) and a lime wedge. Upon request, they&#39;ll bring sriracha and hoisin sauce.<br><br>For dessert (or not), order a Cafe Sua Da, a traditional Vietnamese iced coffee. This coffee beverage is only for the coffee strong and not for those that get the caffeine shakes easy. This place serves it up right with sweet condensed milk and crushed ice.<br><br>Hats off to this place for keeping it real. I&#39;ve been here twice and both times the food and service has been great. Nice warm people and good food.",

"reviewcomment":"I was soooo looking forward to this place, I tried it last night and I was soooo disappointed.<br><br>I liked the Barcelona atmosphere, it really feels like you travel through space once you enter the bar.<br><br>I thought it was going to be some sort of tapas bar but it isn&#39;t. You can have some warm sandwiches, some spanish sausages and some cheese but that&#39;s it. Worst of all they only have ONE type of sweet almost undrinkable sparkling wine (rose&#39; or white) and beer. No wine at all! That&#39;s so not like a real Spanish tapas bar where red wine flows in torrents.<br><br>All in all, 4 stars to the place (tiny), the authentic atmosphere and the service. 1 star to food and drinks. That makes an average of 2.5 stars.",
