We waited probably about 25-35 minutes for a table, but it was not a painful wait with the option to go to the bar and chat. It was kind of a longer wait for our food once we ordered, so if you go to eat here, make sure you are not about to eat the ends off of the table/have some time to spend.<br><br>The staff  were very personable and attentive. Great atmosphere, music, countless beers, and hilarious/delicious/metal burgers,",

We came here for my fiance&#39;s birthday dinner, and our great dining experience was unfortunately tainted by an annoying soccer mom who asked us to hurry up our dinner so that her party of 10 (without reservations) could sit down, and then had her teenage daughter ask us again. Un-freaking-believable. <br><br>My friend ended up yelling at the daughter and then told the staff. They were apologetic and a little amused by the entire situation, and in retrospect, so were we. Moral of the story: get there early to snag a table and fend off suburban moms.<br><br>For food, we ordered some chips and salsa for an appetizer. I would pass on these as they are just OK. However, the 2 large pepperoni, garlic, and basil pizzas were just heavenly. I can&#39;t wait to come back to try more pizza combos!",

"reviewcomment":"My friend and I were visiting Chicago for the National Restaurant Show a couple of days ago and decided to try our luck getting a table at The Purple Pig. Being the highest recommended and most reviewed restaurant on Yelp in downtown, we were expecting a long wait. Surprisingly, we showed up for a 12:30 lunch seating and were brought to a table inside right away. <br><br>Only a few minutes into our experience, a waiter came over with a plate of house made veal Mortadella sausage with black kale, fresh chickpeas &amp; preserved cherry tomatoes. We were the lucky winners of a &#34;mistake dish&#34;! What a great start to the meal. <br><br>I had done my research and came up with a list of things to try. We began with the calamari with fregula, radishes, cucumbers, cous cous, &amp; pistachios. Being the least commonly appreciated flavor, we were startled by the bitterness of this dish, but also enjoyed its irregularity. Then came one of my favorites, the salt-roasted beets, whipped goat cheese, &amp; pistachio vinaigrette. Yum yum yum. <br><br>Onto the main part of our meal. We had the pig&#39;s ear with crispy kale, pickled cherry peppers, &amp; fried egg. Although it was not as good as the reviews I read made it out to be, I can now officially saw I have eaten pig&#39;s ear and I&#39;d say that&#39;s pretty cool. Next was the milk braised pork shoulder with mashed potatoes. Oh. my. god. We almost ordered another - IT WAS MELT IN YOUR MOUTH DELICIOUS! <br><br>And finally, for dessert, even though we could barely fit it, we split the peanut butter semi-freddo with goat milk caramel corn and ginger-white chocolate mousse. Usually I am not a huge fan of peanut butter, but the best dessert I have ever had was a semi-freddo and they rarely appear on dessert menus, so it was a &#34;must try&#34;. My friend loved it and the flavors were distinct, not too sweet, and a great combination of milky, sticky, crunchy, and soft. <br><br>We left absolutely stuffed and still had money in our pockets. I will definitely be returning to this restaurant over the summer. I am already craving pork...",

"reviewcomment":"I can&#39;t say enough about this place!  I was tasked with planning a dinner for a large group staying in Chicago for a few days, and found this place through Yelp and other sources.  I was in touch with the restaurant about 2 weeks before our trip to Chicago.  They responded to my reservation request within hours, then assisted me with reserving a table even though I adjusted the number of guests and the time of the reservation in the next couple of days.  <br><br>On the day of our dinner, we definitely misjudged the time it would take to get to the restaurant and ended up about 20 minutes late.  I called from the cab to let them know we were on our way, and again, they were super accommodating and friendly.<br><br>On to the meal - they have three different sangria recipes, plus a sangria of the day.  We ordered the sangria of the day - which was mango - and it was delicious!  And a good value for the cost.  <br><br>But the food...OMG!  I don&#39;t think we had a single item that we didn&#39;t love!  Shrimp, pork, lamb, olives, shredded brussels sprouts, chorizo, jamon iberico, and I could go on and on!  A couple on the other side of the table ordered the paella, and thankfully sent a sample to our side of the table, and it was delicious as well!  There wasn&#39;t a single menu item that we didn&#39;t love, and we actually re-ordered a few of the items because they were so delicious!!  <br><br>We ordered five different desserts to pass around the table - they are all on the smaller side, in line with tapas-style dining, and we had fun taking a bite and passing each one along around the table.  <br><br>Our server, Allison, was amazing and very accommodating for a large group.  She explained the restaurant policies regarding bill splitting up front and allowed us to split the table in two to make it easier to settle up when the meal was over.  <br><br>The restaurant itself is cute and classy with the perfect ambience.  Food arrives quickly thanks to a crew of friendly food runners.  <br><br>I received endless compliments from our group of 15 for a job well done in selecting such a great restaurant for our group.  I would highly recommend this restaurant for anyone that would care to listen to me, and I would definitely return should I be lucky enough to travel to Chicago again in the future!!",

"reviewcomment":"I love pizza, so I was very excited to try a Chicago deep dish pizza. I googled where to go and I found this place . It wasn&#39;t very busy when I went in with my family . We got seated immediately ( even with a party of 10).   We started with an appetizer combo(9$) which went fast, which didn&#39;t feel worth it but we did have 10 people share it . Then we orders 2 large pizzas (17.99 each just cheese .almost 2 dollars per additional topping) . The wait was 30 mins which was understandable since it&#39;s a deep dish and takes long to cook.  <br><br>So worth the wait! We didn&#39;t even finish the pizza( 2 slices left) because we were so full ! I loved the crust, I just wish it had more cheese. I already ordered extra cheese I just wanted more <br><br> Our server was very polite !<br>She was awesome and was quick with everything, she always keep us updated with the pizza time ! One thing I found odd was that she wasn&#39;t in any sort of uniform, so she just looked like a regular guest  in a oversized sweater . <br>Overall I really enjoyed my experience , it was my first time trying any Chicago style deep dish and look forward to comparing different places to find the best one for me",

"reviewcomment":"On a recent visit to Chicago some friends and I were looking for a good spot on a Friday night. Luckily for us, Café Iberico had room to squeeze the 6 of us in. <br>We ordered 1 or 2 dishes each, to share around the table. Wow - everything was delicious, really good portion sizes, and very reasonable prices. The sangria was delectable and refreshing (I actually preferred the white sangria even though I&#39;m a red wine drinker, but both were super tasty). One of my friends is a vegetarian and there were plenty of choices for her too.<br><br>We had: ensalada de pimientos asados (roasted peppers), aceitunas alinadas (marinated olives), Patatas Bravas (roasted spicy potatoes), chicken empanada, queso de cabra (goat cheese and tomato sauce), Paella marinara (seafood paella), a scallop dish that was the special, a grilled chicken dish, calamares a la plancha (octopus), manchego stuffed dates wrapped in prosciutto, and 3 pitchers of sangria. Our total was less than $35 each, including tip, and we were all stuffed! Everything was scrumptious. Definitely get the stuffed dates - so good. <br><br>Highly recommend this place, especially for a group of 5 or more so you can try a bit of everything.",

"reviewcomment":"Prepare to be amazed. I wanted to try this place for a while after hearing how good it was but never made much of an effort because, after all, wings are wings. Right?<br><br>Wrong. These wings are massive, and I don&#39;t mean grown on steroids and hormones. But healthy, meaty wings. Keep in mind 1 wing is considered both the thigh and the breast. <br><br>But can I talk about the sauce for a second? Holy moly. The sauces are to die for. Between 3 of us we tried the Sassy Seole, honey BBQ and medium buffalo. All 3 had more flavor and punch than any other wing sauce I&#39;ve tried before. Either way, you can&#39;t make a wrong decision here but none of the Honey BBQ wings were left at our table. Don&#39;t undermine the spicy. Even the honey BBQ had some spice to it. <br><br>Just enough crisp, plenty of meat and bountiful flavor. What more can I say?<br><br>Seating is family style, sharing tables with strangers and it gets pretty packed. Super friendly wait staff.  I&#39;m eager to go back for more!!",

That said - this is a good spot to bring your date for a tasty dinner, in casual setting.<br><br>Food then? Must say I am not a huge steak eater. That said, I went for Norwegian salmon. It was a huuge portion with very creamy (yet delicious) sauce and mashed potatoes. Presentation, again very casual. Felt like something my mom would have put together a Tuesday night - in a good way.<br><br>Our waiter was good, and as with this whole experience, his service felt very authentic. It&#39;s a BYOB which you can like or not - at this place it works really well and our waiter quickly came out with a cooler to keep our white bottle at good temperature, and gladly gave us an extra set of wine glasses since we had a red bottle too.<br><br>Make sure you don&#39;t eat up everything on your plate cause you will most likely fall asleep - which does not make a good date!",

"reviewcomment":"This is what dining out is all about. From nose to tail, Longman &amp; Eagle is a top-notch dining experience. It may have a Michelin star to its name, sure, but the fine folks at L&amp;E don&#39;t need your fancy white tablecloths, your complex reservation system, or your belief that a shot of whiskey should cost ten-fifty. <br><br>Instead, L&amp;E is a come, wait, eat, enjoy type place. Your meal should amble along. Your conversation should be a focus. Your drinks should be refreshing. And your food should be good, damn good.<br><br>L&amp;E keeps ridiculously long hours, which is a good thing. Coming during peak times (weekend brunch, nightly dinner) will cost you in value money of time. Both the interior and exterior dining areas are small, much more conducive for parties of 2 to 4. Reservations can be made only if you&#39;re staying at L&amp;E&#39;s inn.<br><br>But if you&#39;re faced with a wait, that&#39;s okay. Spend some quality time at the bar instead. L&amp;E is a whiskey/bourbon lover&#39;s paradise. It offers a multitude of shots (size, not consumption time) for a mere three Washington&#39;s. Not that there&#39;s not good stuff, too. Staring at the bar back is enough entertainment for me. L&amp;E also offers cocktails, a plethora of draught, bottle and can craft beers, and a wine list to boot.<br><br>Service is first rate from entry to exit. The hostesses were graciously accommodating as we bounced back between a 2 and 4 table request, the bartender was delightfully cheeky, the waitress was amazing at getting our raucous table through the night.<br><br>But if the rating were solely about the food, L&amp;E would still score a five-star review. L&amp;E may have a Michelin Star to its name, but prices are surprisingly reasonable. If I had to make a comparison, I liken it to the amazing Barley Swine in Austin. Once you get that first dish, you&#39;ll be a believer.<br><br>We splurged on a few appetizers, the highlight being the roasted marrow bones. I&#39;d put L&amp;E&#39;s a cut below Au Cheval, but better than Purple Pig. The bones were smaller than the latters&#39;, but the accompanying bacon shallot jam was divine. Other underrated aspects of the appetizer selection was the chile vinaigrette plus whipped feta combination in the spring melon and cucumber salad, the perfectly fried quail egg atop the ricotta gnuddi, and the exultingly melt-worthy goodness of the cheese gourgeres.<br><br>Honestly, you could make your living on small plates alone. We tried but two main courses, the fried chicken roulade and the famous wild boar sloppy joe. The crispy skin encasing the roulade puts fried chicken joints like Harold&#39;s to shame, not to mention the &#34;High Life&#34; gel that you&#39;d probably drink after eating Harold&#39;s--yes, that&#39;s Miller&#39;s finest. Who needs duck fat fries? L&amp;E&#39;s tribute to McDonald&#39;s past goes beef-fat fries, which are as good as they sound. The sloppy joe is certainly interesting. Paying 15 bones for a sloppy joe is a little like paying 10 bucks for a glorified frito pie at Au Cheval. But take away that percunious mentality and you have a dang fine sloppy joe.<br><br>Longman &amp; Eagle is one of the best meals you&#39;ll have in Chicago. I&#39;m glad to have checked it off my bucket list, and it&#39;s now a worthy addition to my Chicago must list.",

"reviewcomment":"First, we have to thank our friend who gave us a gift certificate for this place as a wedding gift.  Without that, I&#39;m thinking we wouldn&#39;t have come.  But we did, and brought other friends, and had a blast.<br><br>The place is fancy but not over the top.  Downtown Chicago, so of course it&#39;s expensive, and crowded on a Saturday night.  Luckily Sweetie made reservations.<br><br>We were seated right around the time specified, and started right in.  A Yelp check-in yielded a free app, chef&#39;s choice, which turned out to be tempura jalapenos.  Very good, not very spicy.  We ordered some drinks, including a prickly pear cocktail for Sweetie (not bad,) and the day&#39;s special beer, a Japanese witbier (big, share-able bottles, pretty darn good.)<br><br>Let&#39;s see, we had so many things.  Some unagi, very good.  An unagi/foie gras combo, excellent.  Citrus scallops: pretty good, slightly spicy according to some of our group.              Yellowtail, very fresh.  A rainbow roll, one of the table&#39;s favorites.  Also the Tail of Two Tunas (we ended up getting another) and the pork and lobster roll (again, we had to get another- everyone liked this.)  Hm- Red Dragon and Firecracker: decent rolls, but just couldn&#39;t compare to those tuna and bacon rolls.<br><br>We were all stuffed.  Luckily for Sweetie, she stopped eating sushi before the rest of us, and ordered the night&#39;s dessert special: jasmine rice pudding with mango.  She savored it, and let me have a few bites.  Yow!  It was so good.  There was a superfluous crust at the bottom; the creamy rice and fresh mangoes were transcendent.<br><br>I think I stayed stuffed until the next afternoon.  We had a great time.  Great service, nice atmosphere (though it was painfully loud, so loud it was hard to talk till people started clearing out.)",

"reviewcomment":"After doing the tourist thing at the Bean, my travel companion and I were in need of a restaurant, and the closer to Millennium Park the better! I was a bit skeptical that anything of quality could be found so close to such a heavy tourist area, but fortunately The Gage proved to be a delicious destination.<br><br>Our food was great, from the complimentary bread and butter to our entrees. My friend loved her farm chicken and I quickly devoured the aptly named &#34;Diet? What diet?&#34; burger. My only complaint is that the menu can get a bit pricey, but since I was on vacation I imbibed the spirit of my burger by adopting a &#34;Budget? What budget?&#34; attitude and surrendered myself over to the deliciousness that The Gage had to offer.",

It&#39;s my favorite and I am glad they never got rid of it. I also like the mac and cheese as well. <br><br>I wish their was a parking lot but I can&#39;t complain too much about parking.

"reviewcomment":"My girlfriend and I visited last night after hearing about DMK through Diners Drive-ins and Dives. We stopped by on a Saturday evening at about 8:00pm -- the place was rockin. We waited about 20-30 minutes at the bar and then were seated. <br><br>The beer list offers terrific options and the bar serves some nice cocktails. The food was excellent and memorable. I had the #1 burger with cheddar, bacon, and BBQ sauce and my gf had the salmon burger. We shared and both were outstanding. We also enjoyed the salt and pepper fries with tasty spicy house ketchup. <br><br>Price-wise, DMK was moderate. It&#39;s not a cheap meal but not crazy expensive either. Our meal of two burgers, fries, and a round of beer was under $50 with tip. The only downside of the evening was the service, which was a bit slow. We waited for another round of beers for too long, so that&#39;s what keeps this review from being 5 stars.<br><br>We&#39;ll likely return and would definitely recommend DMK Burger Bar to other foodies that love a great burger and a lively ambiance.",

"reviewcomment":"I&#39;ve always avoided the lines by showing up at odd hours.  Yesterday at 4:30 on an early-spring afternoon the slanting sunlight coming through the windows was exquisite (bright in one room, chiaroscuro in another), the drinks were artisanal but too small to have much of an effect (after three expensive cocktails I was feeling pleasantly elevated but not waving my arms around the way people do after my Brat Pack landlords&#39; martinis), and the peanut butter sandwich now has more salad in it (score!) than it did ten years ago. <br><br>Much as I love the overall rhetoric  of Eric H.&#39;s review, and I feel like I&#39;ve been to such places, I didn&#39;t get any sense of pretention here.  The hostess was ridiculously beautiful in a timeless or perhaps early 20th century Parisian way, but was perfectly pleasant and natural; our waiter was cool, and we didn&#39;t look like anyone&#39;s target demographic.  I also love the location--it&#39;s not usual to have a bar/café right on the street in Chicago&#39;s gorgeous boulevard system.  The only conceivable drawback was that the table next to us in the window was a couple of feet closer than optimal, but we weren&#39;t on top of each other or hearing each other&#39;s conversations.  I&#39;m normally a dive bar aficionado but I&#39;m still glad this place exists.",

"reviewcomment":"The Good:<br>Fresh squeezed orange juice! Good coffee. Menu has a sense of humor! (&#34;cereal killers&#34; &#34;sammiches&#34; &#34;taters&#34;) Fresh hashbrowns. Fresh homemade breads, bagels, pastries! Beautiful modern, clean, open dining room with open kitchen so you can watch the cooks! <br><br>The Bad: <br>Expensive prices (cup of fruit was six dollars!!!!!) Heavy food.<br>I don&#39;t usually eat breakfast but if I do, I eat pretty light. Kinda hard to find lighter options on this menu, not many egg-less/meatless options....I love pancakes and French toast but all those options seemed overwhelmingly heavy &amp; complex (but were indeed creative)....so I went with sides (fruit, bagel, hashbrowns)<br><br>The Food: Hashbrowns are freshly grated to order and come automatically with cheese (I got mine without, as a light breakfast eater) -- portion was huuuge and the hashbrowns were for some reason so long I had to twirl them like spaghetti around my fork!  Breakfast was definitely fresh, yummy, and filling. <br><br>The Service: Professional, courteous, efficient, fast, coffee refilled, -- no complaints!<br><br>Overall:<br>Not cheap but hopefully worth it! I like the creativity, freshness and homemadeness. Nice modern restaurant, clean and bustling, pleasant atmosphere, good service, good coffee, good food. Recommended if you want to drop some cash on breakfast! Next time I go I&#39;ll try to be more hungry!",

"reviewcomment":"Oh, Alinea...you were the reason that I decided to go to Chicago for Memorial Day Weekend, and you will be the reason that I decide to go back. You set the bar so high that you made Next Restaurant (from the night before) look like your little brother that tried so hard to live up to expectations but was ultimately outclassed in every way. Every course was executed to perfection. There was no cause for any complaint. <br><br>I waited with excitement and anticipation for every course, and every course was delivered with rich flavors and exquisite presentation. I couldn&#39;t help but peek at all of the diners around us that were further ahead in their meal, waiting for spoilers.<br><br>The standouts were: <br>-lobster with curry, earl grey, and grapefruit<br>-sweetbreads with orange, ginko nut, and cinnamon chopsticks<br>-wagyu beef<br>-lily bulb with rambutan and distillation of caviar lime<br>-duck with foie gras, morel, and dragon&#39;s breath<br>-blueberry with bubblegum, lilac, and sorrel<br><br>I couldn&#39;t choose just a few because all of those courses were incredible. And of course, not to be overshadowed, the green apple balloon and milk chocolate dessert courses were phenomenal. It was especially exciting to have Chef Grant Achatz come over to our table to create our final dessert course. He seemed very focused, and the result was a delicious masterpiece.",

"reviewcomment":"Had dinner at Mercadito a few days ago with a group of 10.  I&#39;m vegan, so I&#39;d been looking at the menu for options and planned to go with the Hongos tacos and ask the waiter if there was cheese or other animal-based ingredients that could be left out.  But, it turned out our host ordered for the entire party.  When I told the waiter what I had planned to order to try to get something vegan, he said he&#39;d just have the chef make me vegan options of the various types of tacos they were preparing for the rest of our group.  It was great!  They made me several different types of vegan tacos, and all were fantastic!  Guac was excellent.  Great margaritas.  Excellent food and excellent service!<br><br>Only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is that it&#39;s very loud.  The place would be well served to work on sound dampening the dining room.  It&#39;s difficult to hold a conversation over the noise.",

Caesar salad is made tableside and is quite possibly the best Caesar I&#39;ve ever had. 40 day aged Ribeye melted in my mouth, basil whipped potatoes were delicious - so great that the server brought us a second order of it complimentary. The carrot pea and turnip side was good and the mushrooms were..well I wouldn&#39;t know because my parents ordered It and I don&#39;t eat such things. <br><br>Four stars only because the ambiance was not as exciting as expected.

Be warned though, their menu is huge, so it might take you a little while to decide on what you want. I highly recommend their Pho for first timers. It&#39;s delicious.

"reviewcomment":"I have been DYING to try this place and LOVED it! My girl friends and I called early to find out the wait time and we came in at 1:30 p.m. (closes at 2) and got a table. They won&#39;t seat you until your whole party arrives. Once seated, our waiter approached us right away. My friends got orange juice and a bloody mary and my coffee in the &#39;Bongo Room&#39; cup was awesome. The service here is incredible- very fast paced. We were asked what we wanted 5 minutes into sitting and we were still looking at our menus but went with the chocolate tower french toast to share between the three of us and between the three of us we could only get through half of it. <br><br>They ran out of the special that included the lobster but we also went late towards ending time. I loved my croissant sandwich. I really loved it- but not everyone would agree for it being their favorite brunch spot. THe quick service and the rush is a little fast paced if you are looking for a more quieter and peaceful type of environment for the brunch but if you have time to wait- go for it! It&#39;s the Bongo Room- everyone has heard of it, so why not try?",

And the bucatini which was eh, ok.  I&#39;m not a fan of the thicker spaghetti pasta.  The Brussel sprout salad was amazing with avocado! The meatballs were ok but I prefer smaller vs large and soggy in the middle.  They were tasty so order them!<br><br>The veal chop was pretty amazing!  Then we had the affogato and hazelnut caramel heaven!  That was delicious!  The affogato- I&#39;d prefer to have got espresso so that if melts the gelato!  Service was great!  Will be back and recommending to others!",

"reviewcomment":"My girlfriend and I decided to eat at Au Cheval for Valentine&#39;s Day. The 2 hour wait was well worth it. I strongly recommend the single cheeseburger with egg and the garlic fries. The way the burger is seasoned and the tenderness of the meat are nothing short of amazing. As I was savoring every bite, I decided there was no other proper way to wash it down than with a beer. The restaurant has a wide variety of beers to satisfy every taste bud. Lastly, the server continued to use formalities with me, even though he knew I was younger - which I thought was commendable.<br><br>If you do not like dimly lit places, this is not the place for you. Also, they do not ask how you would like your burger cooked, so if you like it prepared in a special way you must request while asking.<br><br>10/10, would definitely come here again.",

"reviewcomment":"Okay, so from my last visit here I wasn&#39;t sure I would be back any time soon. Yesterday I decided to celebrate my birthday with a sea food dinner at Shaw&#39;s crab house. And I am so glad I did. We planned ahead and secured 5:45 reservations. What a difference it was from our previous 8 o&#39;clock reservations. The restaurant was not busy at all. We got sat immediately. Our server was the sweetest man there. An older Hispanic gentleman who didn&#39;t cut corners with his service. Which I believe our last server did when she saw my bf and I ; young Mexican couple who superficially doesn&#39;t &#34;fit&#34; in. But anywho we started off with the house special lobster bisque and the appetizer combination which included calamari, mini crab cakes, and French fried shrimp. Everything came out in a timely matter and very hot. Everything was delicious! I was in shock, even the lobster bisque was delicious. The mini crab cakes where so full of fresh crab meat and full of flavor I almost opted for a mini crab cake platter!! <br>For dinner, I ordered the red king crab legs and the 6oz filet mignon. My boyfriend order the lobster tail and 6oz filet mignon. Let me just say everything was absolutely amazing. My crab legs were actually meaty and hot! The filet was cooked perfectly. A beautiful chard outside and perfect pink inside. I cannot say anything bad about my experience. I think my last experience had many factors that contributed to the less than perfect experience. And in my gut I believe it was due to our waitress. Because yesterday&#39;s time there was only made possible by our server, food runner, and busser. Well let&#39;s not forget the delicious food! <br>We didn&#39;t order any dessert but the server overheard my bf say it was my bday and without hesitation he brought to the table a slice of chocolate cake with a candle. :) what a perfect end to a beautiful time out. Thank you. Oh the cake was absolutely deliciously! I would buy it on our next visit",

"reviewcomment":"Fogo is 5 Star outstanding!  The service is phenomenal and so is the food.  As other reviews have posted, don&#39;t fill up too much in the beginning on salad.  They bring mashed potatoes, polenta, and plantains to the table and the meats are all very filling.  All of the meats are fantastic and can be requested to your liking.  If you like a certain cut you can ask for that to be sent to your table.  Medium well?  No problem, just let any of your servers know.  <br><br>For a personal flare you can ask for your favorite condiments.  If you love bbq sauce or chimichuri they`ve got it. Their mixed drinks are also very good.  The cocktails run around $12, but they are heavy handed on the liquor so they are worth it. <br><br>Let them know if you are there for a special. occasion and they will ensure you have a special evening.<br><br>One of my favorite things was that as the menu states, it is a gaucho style restaurant (south American cowboys in the early 1900`s) one of the head servers is dressed like a gaucho with puffy pants and rugged boots.  This place certainly pays attention to details.",

"reviewcomment":"Had a group of 7 guys in town for a bachelor party and we decided on Chicago q.  We figured we&#39;d attempt to be adults and have a nice sit down dinner to start the weekend before all the debauchery of the next 48 hours.  We were looking for a restaurant that was a little more high end, but not getting into Chicago steakhouse prices.  This place was perfect, and will probably be my new go to place to bring people from out of town. <br><br>From the outside, this place looks like an old Southern style home, and seems a little out of place for this neighborhood.  When you walk in, it&#39;s crazy how big the place  is compared to the outside look. To start out, the waiter put bowls of homemade bbq chips on the table along with some sweet pickles.  I don&#39;t usually eat pickles, but paired up with the bbq chips, they were amazing.  For appetizers, we ordered the cheesie hush puppies, which were good, but not amazing.  I&#39;d probably try one of their other apps next time. <br><br>For my entree, I ordered the Q2, pulled pork and a half chicken, with a side of honey butter cornbread.  For $26, the amount of food they give you is crazy.  I had to cut myself off and not finish the whole thing, or I wasn&#39;t going to be able to drink the rest of the night.  Looking around the table, a couple guys ordered various types of ribs, and definitely heard no complaints. <br><br>For 7 guys, our bill came out to about $360 pre tip, which was not bad at all considering we weren&#39;t taking it easy on drinks the whole time we were there.  Definitely worth it for the great atmosphere and food.  Of course, one of the guys wanted to play credit card roulette and have 3 random cards picked pick up the tab, and my lucky card was picked by the waiter....",

Rockit has good happy hour specials if you are fortunate enough to get out of work between 3pm-6pm. <br><br>Had a 6pm reservation Monday evening. The hostess was super friendly and sat us right away. We were thrilled to discover that Monday is half off wine night, so we promptly ordered 2 bottles of Malbec. The service was great, our waiter was friendly, joked around with us, and never left our wine glasses empty (a huge + in my book). I had the goat cheese salad, which was delicious. Apparently they only have the Mac and Cheese burger on Tuesdays at the River North location so the girls were a little bummed but ordered the Farmhouse and the Locavore burgers and said were very good. We all wanted modifications to our meals; our server was super accommodating and didn&#39;t make us feel like we were being obnoxious or  high maintenance. He told us it was no problem and super easy to do! Rockit might be the new hang out for our standing Monday night dinner plans!",

"reviewcomment":"We had a great first experience here. We were excited to finally get to try Geja&#39;s by using a Groupon, and we like to celebrate special occasions at unique places like this. We weren&#39;t disappointed.<br><br>The drive from Lombard, on a Thursday night, was an hour and a half! Yuck. (The drive home was only 40 minutes). We had a 6:00 reservation and were still 4 miles away at that time so we called and were told that they have a policy where they hold a table for 20 minutes but if we weren&#39;t there by then they couldn&#39;t guarantee our reservation and we&#39;d have to see if we could get a table as a walk-in. It made sense but we had never been there and were worried we wouldn&#39;t make it and would have to drive back another time! Fortunately, we made it just in time. We apologized that we were late and explained that it took us longer than we expected and the kind young hostess said &#34;Believe, me, I know.&#34; I think I thought ours was a unique experience but we were seated right by the hostess station and person after person who came to the restaurant said the same thing we did- it made me chuckle.<br><br>Geja&#39;s is almost 49 years old! It&#39;s a small place with many tables. We were surprised that the tables weren&#39;t more private (we&#39;d been to the Melting Pot before where it seems like there were mostly private booths). It&#39;s a beautiful place and I liked all the curly-q&#39;s in the decorations and light covers. The seating is tight and I was very impressed by all the servers and how aware they were when people were walking by to get to the bar or restrooms or to their tables- they were very gracious. <br><br>Our server was Mary and she had such a friendly face and demeanor- we really liked her and she gave us excellent service. <br><br>The Groupon was for two premier dinners which includes the cheese fondue, a small green salad with yummy/tangy dressing, your choice of meat/vegetable fondue, and then chocolate fondue. My husband loved the cheese fondue- it was his favorite part of the whole meal. I don&#39;t care for cheese so I just ate some of the bread (including pretzel bread- yay!), grapes, and apples in the basket. I chose the beef and chicken and my husband got the shrimp and chicken, and I liked how it was divided evenly on each side per person. It comes with 8 sauces and it was hard to remember what they each were but there was a dill, teriyaki, sweet and sour, garlic butter, chipotle, horseradish, and BBQ and something else. The meat also comes with a lot of vegetables like potatoes, onions, peppers, broccoli and mushrooms. The beef tenderloin was my favorite and I loved it with the teriyaki sauce. Both meats were very tender as you cook it yourself. The onions were also surprisingly good. My husband especially enjoyed the mushrooms. Like other people shared, the food kept falling off the skewers into the oil and we had to dig them out but that was part of the fun.<br><br>We had decaf coffee with the chocolate fondue- they brought whipped cream to put in it- WOW- my new favorite thing! The coffee was delicious and went so well with the dessert course. The chocolate fondue was great. Getting to toast our marshmallows in the flame was fun- and they were the best taste of the night- warm roasted gooey marshmallows in chocolate and graham cracker crumbs - yum! There were strawberries, bananas, apples, fresh pineapple, marshmallows, rice kris pie treats, and pound cake. It was all really good but I think I prefer darker chocolate for fondue- it was missing a &#34;bite&#34;, in my opinion. <br><br>The service was great and always right on time- our waters were filled frequently and Mary and the other workers were courteous and helpful.<br><br>There was live guitar music and it was fantastic!!! We regretted not having the chance to tell the musician how much we enjoyed it. It was perfect.<br><br>The women&#39;s restroom (only for one person) was very pretty and quite large, but my husband said the men&#39;s room was quite cramped. The valet service was well worth the $10 (plus tip). <br><br>We appreciated getting to eat at our own pace and thoroughly enjoyed all our food, the ambiance, the excellent service and finally getting to experience such a great restaurant- it felt really special.",

I don&#39;t know how they train their servers, but they always have this perfect presence of being very friendly and extremely efficient, but then they whisk away and are not overbearing at all. It&#39;s hard to describe, but I LOVE it!<br><br>The food is like none other. The only steak I&#39;ve tried is the Filet Mignon.......it literally melts in your mouth. We&#39;ve also tried the ribs, planked whitefish, and salmon sandwich. Each entree and side item that we have tried has been heavenly. We honestly don&#39;t think that Gibson&#39;s prices are disproportionate with the quality and amount of food that you get. The portions are huge.....especially compared to other fine dining establishments. The quality and preparation of the food is on a much higher level than many other fine dining establishments as well. <br><br>For the desserts, I have to start a separate paragraph : ) the desserts are HUMONGOUS and soooo good. Each portion is enough to feed 2-3 people......easy. The cake and pie slices are epic! The price that you pay is the same that you would pay for much smaller portions at most other restaurants. All of their desserts are homemade in the restaurant, from scratch as well......extra yummy!! Also, they are happy to cut the desserts into portions for everyone to share.",

The chicken seemed hotter than usual and was great. The pot stickers are huge and tasty. Service was OK, it&#39;s been better and it&#39;s been worse. We had plenty of food leftover for lunch today.<br><br>I like this location better than the one in Uptown on Broadway, even though it&#39;s further away. There is also a good Chinese bakery a short walk down the plaza.",

As main, we had monkfish and strip loin. <br><br>I would say everything is good but nothing is amazing that make you say: &#34;I want to go back&#34;. The desserts were very disappointing. We both thought that there was too much liquor... <br><br>The service was very good. Our waiter was very nice and she would not go to the table very often but you could clearly see that she was checking on us all the time. <br><br>At the end of the day, would i go back? probably yes, but I would not get any dessert.

"reviewcomment":"I absolutely LOVE 90 Miles and I can&#39;t wait to go again!<br><br>Came here last night with 8 other girl friends, so we had to wait a very long time for our table...even with reservations. That&#39;s really the only reason I took off one star. Over an hour wait! But anyways, onto the good stuff!<br><br>Our waiter was excellent. He had tons of suggestions and knew what you were ordering even if your Spanish wasn&#39;t that great. <br>We got both sangria and mojitos. The mojito mix is so good. Not too strong (unless you make it strong!), minty and refreshing. Our apps &amp; main courses came very quick! Way more quick than I thought having that long of a wait for a table! We ordered Marquitas, empanadas, and croquettas for our apps which were all so amazing. My favorite was the corquettas, tons of flavor! So cheesy and meaty. Really good. I ordered the fried steak sandwhich which was chewy (in a good way!), crispy from the french bread, and super tasty. I had the fries with my sandwhich and they were unreal as well. My friend ordered the seafood special, a little bit of everything. Some mussels, some scallops, calamari, shrimp and more! The sauce it was in was DIVINE. It was a tomato sauce with 90 Miles&#39; hot sauce. I had to break off the bread from my sandwhich just to dip it in the sauce! I could drink it, it was THAT good! Another friend had the shrimp which were super large, juicy, and sauteed perfectly! No matter your tastes or ethnicity, you&#39;re bound to find lots of plates to rave about at 90 Miles. Make a reservation and avoid Friday and Satrday nights if you don&#39;t want to have to yell over one another or wait more than 30+ minutes!",

The good news was were were told it would be 25-30 minutes and it was more like 10 so the staff seems to overestimate the wait time. There is a small bar you can wait at and they have a few beers on tap (nothing special) and some local bottles like Goose Island as well as a wines by the glass list and full bar.<br><br>The food is hearty so order carefully! My wife and I shared a meatball grinder and a pizza pot pie. We were more than full even though we &#34;only&#34; ordered one sandwich and the small pizza pot pie.<br><br>The sandwich was good served on a toasted garlic bread and served with lots of cheese and green peppers on it. Quite messy and tasty.<br><br>The pizza pot pie was very cool and came served in a bowl, flipped upside down by the staff and presented. Very unique and also tasty. <br><br>If you remember nothing else about my review, remember this: CASH ONLY. Yup, had just enough to pay the check and leave a tip. Wow, that was a shocker but I guess if you&#39;re as popular as this place, you can get away with it.<br><br>Next time we go I might be more inclined to share a grinder and that&#39;s it. Two people can leave more than full on one of those bad boys!",

"reviewcomment":"An absolute gem! I&#39;ve never been to Italy but I&#39;m guessing this is how the real thing tastes. The ingredients are really fresh and the pizzas are simple. I cannot decide whether I like the white or red pizza better. <br><br>They only serve wine and some beer. The tartufo (Cocoa covered gelato ball) is excellent as well. The only complain I have is that there is often a wait and the area they ask you to wait in is not adequate for the enormous crowd that gathers inside. Other than that I recommend everyone to try this place at least once.",

"reviewcomment":"I told my brother I&#39;m not leaving Chicago without getting a good set of tacos in my tummy. He told me to hop on the Pink Line and get off 18th street, take a left and walk to Nuevo Leon. I took a right. I knew it was the wrong direction 4 blocks later, when I started walking between a series of boarded up buildings. <br><br>It&#39;s a BYOB restaurant, so you can bring a 6 pack of your favorite cerveza. This BYOB concept is alien to me because in Minnesota, you are not allowed to bring in your own beer/wine. I saved a bunch of money by buying a 6 pack and splitting it with bros. You get more than you pay for at this establishment. Before ordering, they give you a meatball plate, nachos, assortment of pickled veggies with jalapeños, 2 kinds of salsa and a plate of limes. I ordered the Tacos de Sabinas: ribeye steak, grilled onions, tomatoes, jalapeno peppers, refried beans and topped with chihuahua cheese ($8). Delicious! My brother and I caught up and downed 4 beers between the two of us, while casually chomping on nachos and slowly savoring my tacos. No rush. Didn&#39;t feel like we were being rushed out of there.<br><br>My brother says that it&#39;s crazy busy here on the weekends and the line is sometimes half a block long. There are signs everywhere that limit 2 BYOB beers and forbid bringing in coolers. Coolers!? My brother laughed it off and said that people bring coolers here all the time, buy lots of cheap food, and hang out for hours. I believe it.",

"reviewcomment":"We were going out for a movie date on a Saturday night and decided to grab dinner close to the theater first. We figured there would be a dinner/movie crowd so we showed up early. Good thing we did! We had to wait about 45 minutes for a 2-top table. The smell of BBQ lingers in the air around the Regal movie theater and makes your mouth water! <br><br>After waiting patiently, our name was called and we were seated &amp; served fairly quickly. We started with a couple of Whiskey lemonades. He had Jameson and I had Jack. The waitress mixed up our order the second time, but I can&#39;t say that I really minded all that much. We also ordered the Beer Battered Onion Rings. They are hearty, served with a tangy mustard vinegar and a Parmesan garlic sauce. YUM!<br><br>I ordered the shrimp dinner, 1/2 grilled and 1/2 fried (SCORE!), with a side of cole slaw and sweet potato tater tots. Best. Tots. Ever. I would tell you that the ribs were excellent, but he wouldn&#39;t share! They must have been delicious. <br><br>The only reason I gave this place 4 stars and not 5: The long wait to get a table. Our server mixed up the drink orders, our food also took about 40 minutes to get to the table. I wondered if our delay had anything to do with our server screwing up the order of the lady at the table next to us...She ordered grilled shrimp, but received fried shrimp. Mistakes happen, I would undoubtedly let it slide and revisit.",

For $45 we had 9 dishes!  It started w/ churros, monkey bread and French toast.  Mmmm carbs!  Then shrimp, smoked fish quiche, and crab benedict.  At this point I was stuffed but no, there are three more dishes to go!  Chicken &amp; waffle, lobster roll and duck confit chilaquiles.  I didn&#39;t eat the chilaquiles because I don&#39;t eat duck.  The only small miss was the chicken.  It was pretty dry.  Everything else blew our socks off!  So very happy.<br>This place hits it out of the park in every way, every time.<br>I look forward to returning.",

Excellent food, chic ambience, but not too stodgy; and outstanding service......i&#39;ll take it any day!!<br><br>So, we experienced Sable for our latest date night dinner and we loved it. This is a small plate establishment, which I love because I like the option of tasting multiple dishes. We tried the Root Beer glazed Short Rib Sliders, Sweet Corn Creme Brûlée, and the Bourbon Chicken and Waffles.....each of these dishes was outstanding. The short ribs were tender. The chicken wasn&#39;t greasy. With each dish, we were able to taste the flavors of the individual ingredients and the combinations blended together so well. We ordered half-orders of each dish in 3 separate rounds and we were very full at the end of our meal. We&#39;ll definitely add Sable to our &#34;go-to&#34; list!",

"reviewcomment":"Chicago has more than it&#39;s fair share of high end steakhouses, most of which are somewhat formal and quite pricey. If you&#39;re in the mood for steak (or anything else that can be cooked on a grill) and want something a bit more casual (and cheaper) the Weber Grill is a great choice.<br>We went here on a recent vacation with our kids and my parents and everyone enjoyed the place and the food. I had the prime rib, which turned out to be better than expected, and the other steaks we ordered were all very good as well. Perhaps not up there with the higher end places, but it was definitely very good.<br>The atmosphere here is a bit mixed. There&#39;s a row of tables with a view of the kitchen where you can see the gigantic grills they use to cook most of the food. This section is a bit noisier and you can smell the smoke from the kitchen. We had a table in the back, which was a quitter and nicer. Like many places, it can get crowded, so I&#39;m glad we had reservations. Service was great, our waiter was professional and friendly.<br>Overall it&#39;s might still be a tad touristy, but not as bad as your might think. If you&#39;re wearing a suit and tie and looking to impress clients this probably isn&#39;t the right place, but if your in the mood for steak and want to have fun this is a great choice.<br>Five stars might be a bit generous, but I think if you have the right expectations (nicer than Fridays or Outback, less formal and cheaper than Morton&#39;s) this place really delivers.",

"reviewcomment":"I can&#39;t believe it took us six months to walk across the street and try this place! And yes, believe every raving review you read! While the food is simply amazing, it&#39;s the service and hospitality that will win you over. Just remember to reserve in advance, or arrive early, preferably before 7:00pm, on any given weeknight.<br><br>We were promptly seated for our 7:15pm reservations by the evening&#39;s hostess, Tiziana, who introduced us to our waiter for the evening, Michael - we started off with cocktails, simple well drinks of house bourbon and Coke at $8.50, featuring generous pours from the well. <br><br>Our waiter ran through the evening&#39;s specials, asked some questions about our likes and dislikes, and then made some great suggestions. Michael was very knowledgeable about the wine selection, asking us what we preferred - white or red?, heavy or light?- and ended up suggesting a moderately priced ($48) 2011 bottle of blended reds from the Seventy-Five Wine Company called &#34;The Sum&#34;. Not the most expensive, not the cheapest, but he nailed the flavor profile with his earlier description.<br><br>On first impression, the place is a tad loud, so probably not the uber-quiet, hand-holding spot you would select for a romantic dinner with your partner. Traffic constantly whizzes by inside as the wait staff delivers and clears plates, all while efficiently topping off table waters and baskets of bread. It&#39;s also a bit snug inside, with the dining room featuring a handful too many tables - in such proximity, conversations tend to drift from table to table, with the backs of chairs bouncing into each other during the meal. Our service was prompt, but not rushed, as the line continued to form just inside the door and out onto the sidewalk. There is some outdoor dining spots available, but on this early April evening, it was a bit cold, even with the gas heaters fired up.  Some folks saddled up to the small bar, which features only a few stools, and managed to choke traffic racing between the dining room and kitchen. <br><br>We started out with two apps; a half order of Grigliata Mista - a fire-grilled plate of perfectly cooked sea scallops, calamari and shrimp, all drizzled in a balsamic glaze and fruity olive oil. Our other selection, the Carpaccio di Manzo, featured ultra thin -practically see-thru slices- of beef filet, with a light sprinkling of artichoke hearts, arugula and shaved pecorino, all lightly dressed in a mustard aioli. Both were perfectly presented and portioned perfectly for a two-top.<br><br>Just a reminder, the warm apps are all available as &#34;half plates&#34;, same for many of the entrees. And while the entrée portions are HUGE, the appetizers aren&#39;t wanting for much either.<br><br>After seeing the dinner plate-sized veal chop go by a half dozen times, I opted for the &#34;parmigiana-style&#34; version of the Nodino di Vitello ($34) - an amazing pan-fried, on-the-bone, perfectly pounded piece of veal, topped with the house tomato sauce and fresh mozzarella. With a nice side of fresh spaghetti, it was more than I could handle, so half of my portion ended up coming home with me. My wife ordered the Spaghetti Neri al Pesce, a huge portion of squid ink-colored pasta with perfectly seared shrimp, scallops and lump crab in a sage, brandy and rose&#39; cream sauce. Absolutely amazing!<br><br>The dessert offering consisted of small $3.50 servings of various Italian specialties like tiramisu, house-made gelatos, cannoli, flourless chocolate cake...<br><br>Overall, one of our best dining experiences so far in Chicago - amazing Italian fare and top-notch service from a knowledgeable staff. Two plates of apps, two massive entrees, a $48 bottle of wine and a trio of sampler desserts was $155.00 - with enough left over for a meal at home the next evening.",

It&#39;s small, hip comfortable space with a solid crowd waiting to get in but they turn the tables over in good time but without feeling rushed.  Very pleasant staff.<br><br>But...it&#39;s all about the food and these folks did not disappoint.  Wonderful selection of unique sweet and savory dishes and Sunday brunch specials such as Key Lime French toast, Mai Po Benedict, corn cakes etc.  My Tex Mex expert guy said they were the second best corn cakes he ever ate, and he would know.<br><br>My Mai Po Benedict was a perfectly balanced and executed combination of...here we go; Poached Eggs, English Muffin, Homemade Jerk Chicken Sausage Patties, Pineapple Chutney and a Lime-Annatto Hollandaise Sauce with a side of perfectly seared red potato hash browns.  <br><br>The other standout dish and house favorite (which are highlighted on the menu) was the Nuevo Omlette; Tomato, red onion, corn, goat cheese, salsa verde drizzled with sour cream.    <br><br>Over Easy Cafe has been an A+ player in weekend brunch for some time and now I understand why.  I&#39;m a fan. Complimentary coffee outside is both a class act and probably prevents the waiting mob from becoming unruly.",

He started us out with some cheesy bread that came in what i thnk was a cast iron muffin pan. It&#39;s mini so you don&#39;t get a ton like Mom&#39;s Sunday breakfast. Loved the bread that I probably ate too much before actually eating dinner. <br><br>They offered a fresh salad bar and some soups to try but the best part was the meat and fish they serve throughout. We had a table near the kitchen which was surprisingly quiet but lucky for us, we were the first table out of the kitchen so everything we were served was still piping hot. I like trying all the different kinds of meat like the duck, chicken and steak but what&#39;s nice is they also offer you fish if you want something a bit lighter. They have everything that you would want for dinner and more and it&#39;s good for groups too",

"reviewcomment":"Wildberry might be my new go to breakfast spot in Chicago from this point on. They have a huge menu, and a wide array of breakfast items you might not find in other spots.  For one, try one of the skillet dishes.  I had the veggie dish with hash browns on my last visit which was a delicious breakfast.  Other options include Eggs Benedict, Omelets, and Pancakes.  They also have really legit gluten free pancakes and I am not sure I&#39;ve ever had one that tastes like the real thing. Finally what tops this place off for me is that they have a full coffee bar which beats most breakfast spots who merely offer some crappy excuse for coffee.  This place has great cappuccinos, latte&#39;s, etc..  <br><br>The atmosphere is nothing to write home about.  It is like a big diner and might even pass for a Morrison&#39;s, but it is large, comfortable and is in a great location.<br><br>Go early or prepare to wait.",

It is affordable, the food is AMAZING (esp the French toast), the atmosphere is cheery and pleasant, the service is great, and the coffee is genuine coffee shop coffee. What else is there to say?<br><br>Specific recs: very berry French toast, Tour de France, and the margarita frittata",

"reviewcomment":"A very nice Vietnamese/French restaurant if it sounds weird, look the history up.<br><br>So this is a nice upscale place that does say required attire, that may be just for dinner but not 100% sure. They have nice indoor and outdoor seating, we sat indoor since it was beautiful inside.<br><br>We tried two appetizers, the eggrolls and the beignets that were stuffed with shrimp, chicken and vegetables served with a orange ginger dipping sauce that we both excellent appetizers, happy that I got both of them.<br><br>The pho was one of the best that I tasted. They use oxtail based broth which is a nice rich touch. They chop their noodles in half which makes it easier to eat and they use homemade sriracha and hoisin sauce, how great is that? They should sell these sauces since they are so delicious. Very rich broth and lots of flavor.<br><br>For desert I had the banana wonton that is good as it sounds. Such a great desert and didn&#39;t expect anything less from this top notch restaurant.",

The DATE WITH A PIG &amp; A GOAT was SUPER awesome the date marmalade was delish, talk about a meal! <br><br>My daughter couldn&#39;t decide between that and the Guacamole BJ so we shared half of each others . The burgers were fresh tender, juicy and huge!!  I can&#39;t stand places that serve those huge dried out burgers. Oh and btw their beef is natural humanly treated hormone free!!

"reviewcomment":"Great neighborhood place with good food and an awesome drink selection. We went for dinner after a Sunday afternoon fundraiser and were happy to find that when we walked in around 6:00pm, we could still get a table for 6 people. The food was fantastic (I had the grilled cheese and it was phenomenal). Portions (for the sandwiches at least) are just right, not to big, but not too small. I also tried a bite of my friend&#39;s chicken pot pie and it was pretty good.<br><br>The menu is fairly expansive and I will have to go back just to try some other things since it was such a hard decision to make. The burgers looked so good!<br><br>They have both a vegetarian menu and a gluten free menu which is great for my group of friends since my other half is vegetarian and my friend has a gluten intolerance. It is rare that we can find a place that everyone has multiple options so this could become a usual place for us.<br><br>The only critique I have is that they were out of a few of the beers on the beer list that we tried to order. The friends I with are pretty big beer &#34;connoisseurs&#34; so they were quite bummed but other than that, there were no other issues.<br><br>Good food and a good atmosphere for hanging out and catching up with friends.",

Because I&#39;ve been let down so many times. But let me say, if all American restaurants tasted like this, I&#39;m all in.<br><br>Food: fried oysters with polenta (our least favorite, but the polenta was magical), baby beet salad (fresh great quality beats, but the dish is pretty small, especially for 10 dollars)<br><br>Ok here&#39;s what gets the five stars- their chicken thigh special (I NEVER order chicken at restaurants, but oh my god all the components of the dish were fabulous!!!!  Such attention to detail, it was delicious) &amp; the lamb breast (not my favorite cut of lamb but once again all the sauces/garnishes/components were completely amazing) &amp; Amsterdam mussels with truffle fries- my dad said it was the BEST oysters he&#39;s ever had (&amp; he&#39;s definitely an oyster man)<br><br>Panda cotta- definitely extremely yummy but not like &#34;died &amp; went to heaven&#34;<br><br>-food overall: 4.5. Get the entrees! They&#39;re to die for. Get them and split them with everyone.<br><br>-service: 5 (the owner/server was super friendly and sweet, always smiling and extremely attentive; the busser was so sweet and my water was ALWAYS full- which is of the upmost importance)<br><br>-atmosphere: 4.5 (a little too dark, for a meal thaaaat yummy, I&#39;d rather see ;) )",

First off there was a line of course but were pleasantly surprised to get seated right away:) (bonus points for feast!) The interior was cozy and I liked that we got seated next to the windows. The outside seating looked amazing for lunch on a nice day. Now to the food! It was delicious! I got the yogurt parfait type deal with an english muffin and a mimosa. All of it was really good and reasonably priced:) The wait staff was attentive and friendly. <br><br>This is one of my new favorite restaurants and I am excited to go back because there are many food items I want to try:) I will be coming back and recommending to anyone in need of a fantastic lunch place!",

It&#39;s extremely cute, affordable, and has tons of vegetarian options many of which you wouldn&#39;t even know were meatless. Perfect to satisfy your protein cravings without killing your chances at some after dinner dessert. ;-)<br><br>Tis true. You wouldn&#39;t want to go if you were in a time crunch. It&#39;s about the size of a Smart Car, super popular, and they don&#39;t take reservations so you can imagine the wait at times. If you do decide to try your patience in line or grab a drink nearby (which they let you do) the menu is absolutely amazing from start to finish. <br><br>You can share almost everything and I suggest you do. Between the two times I&#39;ve visited I&#39;ve only gotten through about half of the menu but can verify that the trio of salads, sliders, mushroom polenta, veggie burrito, brussels, goat cheese dip, toasted ravioli, and beet salad are all unbelievable. <br><br>They serve beer and wine as well, but drink wise the most buzzworthy option is the freshly squeezed juices. Finish off your meal with one of those and you&#39;ll feel way more amazing that anything you&#39;d have at a steakhouse. <br><br>In short Mana is amazing.",

I saw a Groupon and thought it would great to eat inside the restaurant for a change. <br><br>The restaurant was clean and had a nice ambiance to it. For a Saturday night, it wasn&#39;t too crowded at all. Service was a tad slow because a large party was at the restaurant, but we weren&#39;t in a rush or anything. For appetizers, we decided to get crab rangoon and egg rolls. Then for main courses, we got 3 dishes - Lo Mein, Honey Chicken, and Sesame Beef. Rice comes included also. I enjoyed everything we got and the presentation was surprisingly nice. Three dishes was a little too much for 2 people. I think two mains and two appetizers are plenty enough for the portion sizes they gave. I was so full and we had enough for another meal, so we took it home. <br><br>Friendship Chinese is definitely my go to Chinese restaurant in my neighborhood. I would come back again.",

We got a size small, half was the Lou (vegetarian), the other half was the Malnati Chicago classic. I didn&#39;t like how long it took to make, but man, it was so delicious! I&#39;m happy we ordered the chicken bbq club salad while we waited. Not only was it a filler, but it was a delicious filler! Great flavors.<br><br>The waitress was friendly, helping us out by cutting up the pizza and answering my friend&#39;s question. It turns out that the sausage that Lou&#39;s has both pork and beef (for religious reasons, my friend doesn&#39;t eat beef). That was a bummer, but she still enjoyed the vegetarian slices. <br><br>The lighting was dark, which was a bummer.

It was pretty empty unsurprising given it&#39;s known for the dancing. The empanadas and tacos were small but flavorful and spicy. The pink Cadillac Marg was great. We also had a red sangria which I would pass on next time. <br><br>I&#39;d come back here.",

"reviewcomment":"Great place for happy hour! (HH is Mon-Fri 4p-7p, Sun 3p-9p, Mon-Thurs 9p-10p, Fri-Sat 9p-11p.) The main reason we came here was because I wanted oysters and a variety of small plates. Devon&#39;s seemed to fit the bill nicely!<br><br>Blackberry lemonade martini - Grey goose vodka, chambord, fresh-squeezed lemon juice, pure cane syrup, Prosecco float. We came on a Tues which is $6.50 Handcrafted martinis during HH so I had to try one! Cocktail was light and fruity. I like my drinks stiff so this was much lighter than I&#39;m used to. But it tasted good if you&#39;re in the mood for something on the lighter side.<br><br>Chef&#39;s oysters on the half shell ($1 each HH) - Came with cocktail sauce, a sesame mignonette and tobasco. The oysters were nice and fresh and huge!<br><br>Calamari - Crisp fried with jalapenos and carrots. Free with Yelp check in so remember to check in! Dish is normally $6 during HH and $12 on their bar menu. Calamari was nice and crispy. Came with an aioli and a sesame wasabi sauce. Loved the fried jalapenos for the added spice!<br><br>Roasted duck flatbread ($6 HH) - Italian cheeses, bbq sauce, onion, apple. I typically don&#39;t like sweet and savory but with the duck, this worked. The apple provided a nice tartness in contrast to the sweet bbq sauce and roasted duck!<br><br>Mini new England lobster rolls ($7 HH) - Sweet bun, lobster salad, watercress. This was my least favorite dish. The lobster salad didn&#39;t have much lobster flavor. The celery and corn overpowered the lobster salad. I did like the fries that came with them though. <br><br>Vietnamese style crab spring rolls ($7 HH) - Daikon, avocado, mint, basil, Shiro miso. Also came with seaweed salad. Not much crab taste but I enjoyed the rest of the spring roll. <br><br>Tuna tartare ($7 HH) - Wasabi vinaigrette, sesame crackers. The tuna was actually seared so it wasn&#39;t quite what I was expecting. The cucumber salad gave it a nice crunch, but I think they should have left the tuna completely raw.<br><br>Pink pops martini ($6.50 HH) - X-rated fusion liqueur (premium french vodka, rich blood oranges, brazilian passion fruit, Domaine ste Michelle brut. Another light and refreshing cocktail. And not overly sweet which I liked!<br><br>Our bill was about $60 for everything. Not bad if you considered the amount of food we ordered and the three drinks. The food itself I would probably give 3 stars but since the pricing was great and our server was nice and attentive, I&#39;m rounding it up to 4.",

"reviewcomment":"From the other reviews, I get the sense Jerry&#39;s gets pretty nuts during the evenings and on the weekends and for that I think I&#39;ll avoid this spot at night. But for a midday lunch, it&#39;s a fantastic spot for a tasty and heavy bite to eat.<br><br>Dense, delicious &amp; satisfying are all words I&#39;d use to describe my Cajun Crawfish &amp; Salmon Burger. I chose the pretzel bun (duh) and asked for it to be additionally cajuned up via the &#34;cajun style&#34; $2 upcharge. The added hot sauce wasn&#39;t quite enough for my seasoned taste buds, so I liberally added some of the provided &#34;Chi-Racha&#34; which was really nice. <br><br>The burger was super duper filling. SO much so I pretty much regretted eating the entire thing so quickly. It hit me like a ton of bricks. A solid delicious punch to the gut if you will.<br><br>I went light on the sides with an order of the pickled veggies and the greens &amp; vinaigrette. Neither side really did anything for me, and I was particularly disappointed with the sweet pickling job of the veg. I expected tang and salt, not sugar. I should have asked though, so I&#39;m not docking any points on that.<br><br>My friends both got veggie sandwiches and it&#39;s here where I point out just how fucking huge and incredible the offerings are on the menu. Holy mother of god... it&#39;s almost too hard to pick from such a scatterbrained and expansive menu. But that&#39;s part of the fun if you ask me. So many offerings means repeated visits. Smart move Jerry!<br><br>As for the atmosphere... it&#39;s... quirky? The music was eclectic and at times awful. Service was great, though the restaurant was empty while we were there so there was time to pay attention to our table.<br><br>I&#39;ll be back!",

"reviewcomment":"We ate here last night (March &#39;13) and enjoyed a really wonderful experience.  We had booked a table without knowing much about it beforehand, but were extremely impressed.  Standout appetizers were the tuna tortilla tacos and scallops with soba gnocchi.  My wife had the fluke, and I had what is probably my new favorite meal in the city: the short ribs, speck, and pork belly.  It is everything you could want in a meat dish and more.  We also sampled some of their beautifully constructed desserts, and it&#39;s hard to go wrong with almost any of them.  I will say that the descriptions of dishes can sometimes be easily misinterpreted.  Dishes are often served as 2 or 3 discrete pieces.  For example, the short ribs, speck, and pork belly are not mixed or even touching - each occupies its own space on the plate, which makes for a sort of culinary journey as you progress through various plates.  The desserts are similarly separated.  <br><br>I will also say that our server was exceptional, with excellent knowledge of the menu, deep familiarity with the wine list, and a really friendly attitude.  This is a true fine dining experience, and it was an unexpected pleasure eating there.",

"reviewcomment":"Pristine Decor, Great Italian Hospitality and unmatched deliciousness<br><br>The service itself is worth coming. Greeted by the owner right at the door. The manager and a server walked myself and my friend to our seat outside on the patio. And even moved the heater so that we would be more comfortable. Through out the night we had 4 different people giving us attention making sure we were doing well.<br><br>Started with glasses of Red wine. And appetizers. So fresh. Not too soggy with oil, the sprouts were literally still crisp and fresh. For dinner we wanted to split the Mediterranean bass and the steak. So they brought out 4 plates with it already spit for us.<br><br>Not a carb in sight! (I try to eat low carb). The steak was cooked perfectly. It was moist, had flavor and wasn&#39;t too tough. The bass...... I don&#39;t think the English language has a word that is adequate enough. We ate everything and still had room for dessert!!!! And boy was the creme cake and pudding good. The entire experience was very Italian, and by that I mean that we were there for a couple hours enjoying and biding our time.<br><br>Our glasses never emptied either. (So attentive). <br><br>And that is just the service and food.  But ambiance was even more perfect. We sat at the edge of the patio. Spring is here and everything is blooming and it smelled so fresh and new. The lights and umbrellas and pavement and set up altogether reminded me of Italy. I have been to Italy a couple times and absolutely love it. So I found my little Italy here in Chicago.<br><br>I highly recommend it.",

We had about 6 or 7 courses and they were beautiful and well thought out. <br><br>We are both in the software tech industry so when they sent us a tweet a couple of hours after having left, it made me happy enough to stop what I was doing and write a glowing yelp review :)) definitely check this place out!!",

He made a few drink recommendations before leaving us to peruse the menu and decide on some drinks.<br><br>I started off with the champagne margarita (wonderful combination of two of my favorite drinks!) and my boyfriend ordered one of the more traditional margaritas. Both were delicious. We also decided to try one of their mezcals, which I was surprised to find I loved. <br><br>The waiter explained how their menu works - there are a few a la carte appetizers, but everything else is part of a 3, 5, or 7 course tasting menu. they have their own suggested 7 course menu, but otherwise it&#39;s up to you how you want to structure your dinner.<br><br>We decided that we really wanted about 8 of the dishes on the menu, so he ordered a 3-course and I ordered a 5, knowing we were going to share it all. Everything, and I do mean everything, we had was delicious. I loved that they broke down the menu by tastes and flavors, and we decided to go from lightest to heaviest: herb-marinated panela cheese, Portuguese rock hen, tortita ahogada, street food 1671, lamb in mole calabaza, puerco en clamole, carne asada in mole negro, and finally the cajeta crepe, chocolate and plantain. <br><br>My personal favorites were the panela cheese, which was served in a sauce akin to a creamy pesto with fresh corn tortillas on the side, the puerco en clamole, tender pork shoulder with iberico ham and bread pudding, and the carne asada. I could eat that carne asada every day for the rest of my life and be a very happy camper. I loved the dessert as well, but I must admit I was caught up chatting with the nice couples next to us while I was eating it so I was kind of just sneaking bites in between words. I was more than full by the time we were finished!<br><br>Everything about the experience was perfect. The food, the service, the atmosphere, the drinks. This is definitely a &#34;destination&#34; restaurant, as I don&#39;t think I would ever casually suggest this for an average date night. To be treated to it, however, was absolutely wonderful.",

"reviewcomment":"My wife &amp; I have been coming here for years! It is, by far, the best &amp; our favorite brunch spot in Chicago.<br><br>The menu has something for anyone and everyone. We almost always go breakfast but occasionally dabble in the lunch side of things. There isn&#39;t one thing that we always get, but I would say the Hash, Bread Pudding Pancakes, and Sweet &amp; Savory French Toast are on the top of our list- but literally- you can&#39;t go wrong with anything on the menu.<br><br>Service - on point. Not only is everyone so unbelievably nice, understanding, and accommodating but everything is served timely and as ordered. Everyone there is so genuine and kind.<br><br>AND C&#39;MON, you can purchase almost all of the ingredients plus some other pretty tasty &amp; fresh goods to take home before you close your tab.<br><br>I do have one warning. DO NOT come here if you plan on never returning again, because you will be HOOKED!",

"reviewcomment":"I first heard about Cheesie&#39;s when I was looking for a place to live in Chicago. I was staying at the Hotel across the street and asked for a good place to get a bite to eat. From there I went to Cheesie&#39;s and now I know just about everyone who works there. The bartenders are more like friends especially if they have a little down time to talk. $4 Craft Beers? Hit me again! Everything on tap is $4 except the Root Beer Beer which is completely worth the price. Also Game days are CRAY!<br><br>I read earlier about someone talking poorly about the &#34;Bouncers&#34;. I know the &#34;Bouncers&#34; and they have been nothing but nice to me. They are there because there&#39;s a register for walk ins. Which, more often than not, are not of a legal drinking age. This is to cover the bartenders when the place becomes standing room only. (which is also more often than not) It&#39;s a business and smart businesses make sure they don&#39;t get their liquor license revoked and that their amazing bartenders don&#39;t get jail time n fined because of how instantly slammed they can get. I&#39;ve been there when there were only 5 or 6 people tops talking about how dead it was. 10 minutes later the bar was packed. True story. So yeah, If you&#39;re not old enough to drink your hand is gonna get marked. And yeah.. If you give the &#34;Bouncers&#34; attitude you&#39;re gonna get some in return (which I&#39;m almost positive is what happened)-Welcome to Chicago. And the biggest &#34;Bouncer&#34; there is as chill as they come. <br><br>Everyone there is family, You&#39;re welcome to be as well. I love this place and everyone that works there. <br><br>Keep Calm and Be Cheesie.",

"reviewcomment":"What a gem! My bf and I just stopped by here to grab a bite after shopping and didn&#39;t know anything about the place prior to our visit. Somewhat low-key as you enter in through a narrow hallway. I was very excited to see the unique menu options and to find that this was not a typical diner serving your standard hot dogs. I love sausage so this is definitely the place to go.<br><br>We got the brunch dog, chili cheese dog, and chili cheese fries. I wasn&#39;t too impressed with the chili itself, but it wasn&#39;t bad. It was topped with fresh scallions so that was a nice touch. The brunch dog was very good. The buns on these bad boys were amazing on its own. The sausages itself were very delicious and could taste how artisanal they were. Can tell that each dog was very well thought out. So many places try to be unique with their dishes but it doesn&#39;t work sometimes, but seems like all of their dogs and dishes here are very cohesive. <br><br>Also fun that we got to choose a celebrity on their wall of shame as our table marker. We got Rod Blago. They also have neat condiments like the jalpeno ketchup. Will have to try next time. I also enjoyed the presentation of the food. The dogs and fries came in steep bowl/dishes which definitely matched the gourmet feel of the food and proved to be very useful and effective for this type of messy food. Service was solid and efficient. Prices are fair. <br><br>Excited to come back and try more!",

This house passes the thinness test on all hakao, suemai, and hofun. The only disappointment is the congee or joke with thousand year old eggs. It is definitely not at the level of Big Wong in NYC Chinatown for sure. <br><br>Although they open at 8, the vegetable dishes are available after 10 am. $20 per person, tips included. Not bad but not cheap.",

If a restaurant offers anything in a mason jar, I&#39;m sold.  Everything tastes better out of a mason jar. <br><br>Once we had enjoyed a few cocktails, we were feeling brave and adventurous so we ordered the frog legs. They were served buffalo style with ranch. They were very chewy and quite the experience. Knocked that one off of my bucket list!<br><br>Shout out to our server, Alexa. She was phenomenal.",

"reviewcomment":"I&#39;ve enjoyed Roy&#39;s cuisine at typical places like on Oahu&#39;s Ko&#39;Olina golf course property, or even at Spanish Bay on the Pebble Beach property, but I certainly didn&#39;t expect to enjoy a Roy&#39;s in downtown Chicago!<br><br>It was a very cold, rainy, and blustery night in Chicago a couple years ago.  I was asked to choose a restaurant by some old friends whom I hadn&#39;t seen in a good many years.  When I asked what they were craving, they simple said they did not want the oh-so-typical Chicago Chophouse, and not Redfish nor one of the recent whacky theme restaurants.  I even recommended a great bar and grill where actor, Gary Sinise, once bought me a beer, but they were having none of that.<br><br>After getting shot down on my next recommendation for some good ol&#39; soul food on the Southside, I went with what I know...Asian fusion from Roy&#39;s.<br><br>Everything ordered was a smashing success, even the assorted appetizers; we didn&#39;t even order everyone&#39;s standard calamari.  No need to get into specifics since &#34;everything rocked&#34; is what I heard the most during dessert.<br><br>The service is what I will call &#34;Chicago good&#34; because they were as attentive as a Morton&#39;s, Ruth&#39;s Chris, or even the Chophouse.<br><br>I just love a wonderfully prepared dish drizzled in some miso-infused sauce...don&#39;t you!? How is this place even a chain?  It ain&#39;t Famous Daves...it&#39;s simply Roy&#39;s.  It&#39;s the Ginos East of Hawaii, sitting in Gino&#39;s backyard.<br><br>So glad ya&#39;ll were there when I needed you...mahalo!",

It&#39;s a great place for brunch, and I have not experienced bad customer service described in other reviews (been here at least 5 times now). <br><br>My favorite is the House Made Herb-Crusted Roast Beef (With lettuce, tomato and radish slaw on toasted ciabatta), but I also love ordering from their specials menu (on a chalkboard on the wall right above the cash register). I have yet to venture beyond sandwiches (other than a quinoa salad), so I can&#39;t speak to the rest of the menu. <br><br>I also love the way Milk &amp; Honey is decorated and set-up.

I saw cookies on Pinterest that I wanted to have replicated for a baby shower, so I emailed the photo to a couple of Chicago bakeries, including Alliance. <br><br>They were so quick to respond with a price quote (I emailed with Nora), and when I said that price per cookie was too high for me, they made suggestions about how the design could be tweaked to lower the price. <br><br>When I picked up the cookies (which were ready and waiting when they said they woudl be), I was blown away by how perfect they were! They were somehow even more amazing than the original picture I had sent in. The colors were awesome and the design was flawless. While custom designed cookies are never cheap, I would certainly go back to Alliance for a future order.",

Capitol Grille... they are all phenomenal steakhouses and it is often times difficult to place one over the other.  The meal we had at Mastro&#39;s Chicago just may have beaten them all, however.  Back home in Orange County, CA we&#39;re fortunate enough to have TWO Mastro&#39;s... both outstanding.  Just when I thought it couldn&#39;t get any better, the Chicago Mastro&#39;s reached a new level of excellence.  Must be the proximity to the midwest stockyards because this was quite simply the most fantastic bone-in New York strip I&#39;ve ever had (Mastro&#39;s calls it Kansas City strip).  Mouth watering, cooked to medium-rare perfection with every bite a taste sensation.  Girlfriend&#39;s Filet Mignon was equally over-the-top delicious.<br><br>Girlfriend said her martini was best ever (they shake and pour it table-side and leave the remainder of beverage inside canister for you to pour when ready).  My Bombay Tonic  was also excellent.  Strong and hearty, they leave a personalized sized tonic bottle at your table to use as needed.  <br><br>A freshly baked assortment of warm breads arrives at your table when seated and we split the house salad  Both the breads and salad were a great start to the meal.  Side dishes were delicious as well.  Scalloped potatoes and sautéed mushrooms were the perfect accompaniments to the wonderful steaks.<br><br>All-in-all, one of the best meals ever and well worthy of the five star rating.",

Very dark inside and reminded me of a speakeasy. <br><br>Ordered the filet mignon petite dutchess cut- soooo tender and cooked just right. They give you a mix of spices on the side with a creamy sauce as well, but honestly the steak is so flavorful already that you don&#39;t need it. Sister ordered the classic ribeye chicago cut and I liked hers so much we traded half way. Steak was very juicy and again cooked perfectly with no other sauces or spices needed. My mother ordered the chicken (I know who orders chicken at a steakhouse??), but surprised the roasted chicken was very tender and juicy. <br><br>For sides-Must try the elote style corn- has a cheesy and chili spice taste. The sweet potato side is very large! Loaded baked potato was also very large, but yummy and loaded with ham, cheddar cheese, and sour cream. <br><br>Was too full to try dessert =\ But def would come back.",

This is the first time I couldn&#39;t find parking across the street in their lot because it was finally nice out and Andersonville was packed! <br><br>We started with the amazing tomato bread, which we could not get enough of. I had the house salad that came with my food which was delicious as usual. I then had the gnocchi gorgonzola, which was phenomenal. <br><br>I don&#39;t remember what everyone else had, only that they raved about it and already want to go back!

Once inside you may think the dining room is extremely small, but it wraps way around the corner. Don&#39;t use the size as an excuse to show up right at prime time dinner time, they do fill up quick, so you may want to arrive early or go slightly after the dinner rush. The reason for the number of patrons flocking to this hole in the wall is the all you can eat sushi. The sushi is quite good and the all you can eat is completely worth it if you start with an appetizer and eat at least 3 rolls.",

"reviewcomment":"It was a last minute decision to go to the Rock Bottom Restaurant for lunch before we left the city, and it turned out to be a good decision!<br>We started off with the jalapeno pretzel sticks for an appetizer. These were the star of our lunch. Hand braided pretzels with pieces of jalapeno and cheese throughout served with a jalapeno spinach dip. Absolutely fantastic. If this review was just for the appetizer it would be a 5-star review. Unfortunately I wasn&#39;t as big of a fan of the burger I ordered as I wanted to be. I got the 2:00am burger which comes with bacon, egg and hashbrown, all on a burger. The concept sounded delicious and I had high hopes. The downfall was the use of a hashbrown patty underneath the hamburger patty, it made the bottom half of the burger way too greasy. This burger would be far better by using shredded hashbrowns instead of a McDonald&#39;s type patty.<br>My wife got a chicken sandwich that I tasted and that was very good.<br><br>We&#39;ll definitely be back for that appetizer!",

I did split this with a friend since 3 slices would have been a sugar overload and there was plenty of food to share. <br><br>Only downside -  they didn&#39;t have fresh squeezed orange juice which is one of my favorite things when I go out for brunch.<br><br>I also loved the atmosphere in the restaurant. It was bustling and the servers were nice despite how busy they were. They played an interesting selection of music that was very lively and put you in a good mood! :)",

Plus a separate container of noodles. I didn&#39;t think carry out pho would be good but this was delicious! It was so fresh and clean and satisfying. <br><br>Their iced coffee is excellent as well.

I LOVE the space up here!!!

This cute restaurant, tucked just south of the Paulina L stop is a great place for brunch on the weekends. First off, no matter what you order, get it with a biscuit. You won&#39;t regret indulging on the extra carbs. So crumbly and delicious! Ask for honey to dip it in - must try!<br><br>The first time I went I got the crab cake benedict - delish! Even ordered it the next weekend at a different brunch place that offered the same plate - it wasn&#39;t as good. These crab cakes just melt in your mouth. When I went last weekend I went a little healthier with the spinach omelette. Though I added a pancake, another winner. <br><br>Highly recco wishbone!",

The bi bim bop was a good adaptation on the original. <br><br>The food is amazing, the decor was cool, but to be honest, the service was amazing. I was in town for work and family drove up from Indiana to meet for brunch and the staff were so understanding of and patient with our odd arrivals. They graciously offered to take the suitcases out of the way and they bent over backwards to accommodate my baby nephew. The hostess offered to hold him when he was crying and she played peek-a-boo with him. They are the nicest people.",

Pretty old place, but definitely still upholds class. They don&#39;t need fancy shmancy gimmicks because this place sells quality.<br><br>Their food is good, and I mean fulfilling-ly good. Prices are also fair for the amount of food you get per order. I&#39;ve tried their lamb entree (YUM), fish and chips (best I&#39;ve had), ribs, seafood platter, calamari, and Reuben sandwich. All were pretty good and never have a been dissatisfied.<br><br>I can&#39;t speak for their beer selection as I don&#39;t drink beer... But wine mixed cocktails pretty good- they definitely don&#39;t hold back on their alcohol. <br><br>To make things even better, bar closes at 4a (in downtown?! What?! Crazy) and kitchen @ 2a (shut up and take my money!!!). <br><br>Weekdays or weekends, this place is packed all the time. Better call in to reserve. Unless you&#39;ll be sitting at the bar, then better hope they have a spot left. <br><br>I APPROVE OF THIS PLACE.",

"reviewcomment":"I was scouting out places for a work event and contacted the Wit, since I had heard so many good things about ROOF on the Wit. I received a prompt reply, and was invited to Taste of the Wit, which happens every other Tuesday. We were first taken to State and Lake, where we sampled some appetizers (the pretzels there are amazing!!), including some cheese, prosciutto, and deviled eggs (which is supposed to be really good, but I thought was just alright). They carry Cloudy Bay sauvignon blanc, which is my favorite sauvignon blanc from New Zealand. I had the Hummingbird, which has blackberry preserves-- delicious.<br><br>We were then taken up to ROOF, where we tried the duck fat fries (still a bit soggy), the sushi (which was pretty darn good!), and some pizza. I actually had a chance to try the Pizza Tetto- pizza with pine nuts, mushroom and sausage-- a pretty interesting combo. I just love anything with pine nuts. For cocktails, I tried the skinny model diet-- not my favorite drink. <br><br>I really like the Lounge/Living Room area--- there&#39;s AMAZING views from all around. Also, there are some super soft fuzzy black chairs-- and I love the decor-- houndstooth furniture mixed in with some black couches.I love mixed and matched furniture. But once I walked into the Atrium, I was even more blown away. It was so light and airy, and felt so relaxing. There was even live music on Tuesday night--- a guy playing the guitar who was REALLY good. I could have hung out there for hours, just sipping on cocktails, snacking on sushi, and listening to the singer.<br><br>Then we were taken to a private theater room, where we were served desserts from the Phoenix Room. My colleague was raving about the key lime dessert... there were also macarons, but I would pass on those-- they were a bit dry.<br><br>Overall, I really just like how they had exceptional customer service--- but then again, what else would you expect from an event such as that?",

I capitalize Southern, because I can<br><br>Now that that&#39;s out of the way, I endorse The Southern as one of my favorite eats representing my God-blessed home. Yup. I went there. <br><br>A typical dinner back home consisted of 10-12 friends and family, a huge spread of potluck favorites that each woman in the group claimed to be their &#34;signature dish&#34; (God help us if more than one lady claimed okra as her dish...) and a bar setup that would make Jack Daniels himself cry with joy. <br><br>The Southern embodies all of those qualities in their dining experience. I absolutely adore bringing a big group of friends and sitting at one of their oblong tables and ordering a smorgasbord of small bites and a big plate of shrimp and grits. But first thing&#39;s first, the cocktails. If you&#39;re a tequila kid like me, get the Way South (El Jimador Reposado, Pamplemouse, lemon, Ginger Beer, Old Fashion Bitters). If you&#39;re a gin kid, also like me, get Luke&#39;s Revenge (Nolets Gin, lime, mint, muddled red pepper, celery bitters). And if you&#39;re an adventurer, again, like me, get the Brass Knuckles (Jeppson&#39;s Malort, Luxardo Aperitivo, Tank 7, rosemary syrup, ruby red grapefruit juice). At $10 a piece, the cocktails are slightly on the higher side, but worth the kick in the sobriety they pack. <br><br>On to the food.

"reviewcomment":"We came here for a quick drink originally but saw other reviewer&#39;s comment on the XXX wings. We decided to try it and it became a once-in-a-lifetime experience.<br><br>My friend is a really experienced hot food eater and I&#39;m really bad at handling spicy food. When I first mentioned the name XXX, out server had an instinctive shiver and asked us &#34;are u sure?&#34; Heck yeah!<br><br>When it came up, the wings were dark in color and carries a light vinegar smell. I decided to taste the sauce and licked just a little bit. The initial flavor was mild but it was followed by everlasting intensive mouth burning sense. Just for a tiny bit of sauce, I had to wolf down my Heineken and water.<br><br>Regrouping my courage, I finally manned up and ate my wing as fast as I could. Net result - I had to clean my tears and sneeze in the restroom and keep ice water running through my mouth for a good 20 minutes!<br><br>And to worsen the situation, their kitchen close at 10pm and they were out of veggies. Looking forward for chapter 2 in the restroom next morning. And I will forever understand why our server had that instinctive shiver at the beginning.",

They come with a chaser and a garnish of olive, cheese, and pepperoni. Yum! <br><br>Their arancini benedict is one of my favorite meals. Order it, you won&#39;t be disappointed! Every single time I&#39;ve had it my eggs are cooked perfectly. The combination of the fried rice ball, prosciutto, poached egg, and hollandaise is out of this world!  Plus, the potatoes that come on the side are soooo good! <br><br>Last time we came we had the donuts and now those are going to have to happen every time we go, too! <br><br>The service has always been great. Our food has never been cold. I don&#39;t have anything negative to say about this place, really!",

"reviewcomment":"Anybody that knows me knows that I don&#39;t cross into the north side much. Ironically, most of my friends and even a cousin of mine currently reside there. In the last ten years, I&#39;ve opened my mind to types of food that didn&#39;t involve pepperoni, hot giardiniera (what!),  and celery salt. <br><br>With that being said, I&#39;m kind of like a pioneer to my immediate family. When I suggested to my mother that we go to an Ethiopian restaurant on the way to visit my cousin&#39;s new baby, she looked at me as if I&#39;d grown another head. <br>&#34;Ethi-what?&#34; she said.<br>&#34;Ethiopian...you know, African..on the eastern side. Trust me, it&#39;s amaaaazing.&#34;<br><br>The look on my mother&#39;s face was more than distrustful. To my surprise, she succumbed to the peer pressure from my wife and I. I&#39;ve only tried one Ethiopian restaurant before (it was actually Erirtrean, but cut me a break, they used to be one country,) but I was already in love. We went for lunch time, guaranteeing that there would be plenty of room to eat. After all, I like to keep my elbows out! Enough with the pleasantries, le&#39;s get to it!<br><br>THE GOOD: <br>-The service was awesome. Both servers tended to us as was needed. The young man working there explained everything patiently and with enthusiasm to our party. He was even a good sport to my teasing when I playfully grilled him on who actually made their honey-wine. When the food was brought out, he explained what was what, and made sure that we had everything we needed (napkins, water, honey-wine, injera.) <br>-Fooooood! My mother and I split the &#34;E2,&#34; which is a combo meat dish that has two veggie sides. My Mom was impressed with the mature and complex flavors of all of the dishes. She enjoyed the chicken and lamb portions the best, with the beef taking third place. As was I, she was mesmerized with the concept of injera. <br>- Honey-wine!  The best I&#39;ve had yet! Yes, it&#39;s only the second one I tried, but it was smoooooth and tasty!<br><br>THE BAD: Nothing, although the fatty in me wishes there were bigger portions! It fills you up for sure though.<br><br>THE UGLY: The site of me shoving various dishes in my mouth! um yum!<br><br>I think its safe to say that I&#39;ve converted my mother to having an open mind to trying new foods!<br><br>Hip hip, huzzah!",

Jameson infused soft serve + 4 &#34;drunken donuts&#34; = only $5!<br>The doughnuts are made in-house and are delightfully delicious -- the perfect compliment to their Jameson ice cream.<br><br>2. The PBJ Special: One pizza slice + a 16oz PBR + a shot of Jameson = only $8.50!<br>This deal alone is reason to give The Boiler Room a try. Though the daily pizza specials are hit or miss, the pepperoni and cheese slices are consistently solid. Large, wide yet foldable pizza slices with a thin, crispy crust is their specialty. You won&#39;t find any deep dish here.<br><br>3. CASH ONLY. But no complaints here. If you forgot to stop by the ATM on the way, you&#39;re in luck. There is an ATM on site. Withdrawal money from the ATM and get a FREE shot of Jameson! Just give your waiter your receipt... and make sure to use the ATM INSIDE The Boiler Room.<br><br>4. Have I mentioned the bathrooms, yet? Oh, well, I should. Inspired by the one and only &#34;L&#34; train, it is quite a novelty. Enjoy a nice sit on the toilet while the CTA recording announces your arrival to the Logan Square Blue Line Stop. *insert public transit piss joke here*<br><br>5. Cult films silently play on a projector behind the bar... ya know, films like Top Secret!, the highly underrated film by comedy writer/director duo Jim Abrahams and David Zucker -- the same guys that brought you the more recognizable film Airplane!.<br><br>6. Bring ear plugs. My only complaint is the extremely loud music playing on the back patio. It&#39;s a shame. Their playlist was on point, but the speakers kept interrupting my enjoyable dining experience. I know the trend is to order food then pull out the phone, but I still enjoy a nice conversation over a beer or two.",

High Quality. Low Price.<br><br>New Items do appear on the menu- I love the Jade Buddha appetizer.  Old favorites are reworked.  The spicy Tuna is now SPICY!!<br>The crab ragoon is still the best ever!<br><br>The Online ordering system takes some cash off your order- LOOK INTO IT!!!",

"reviewcomment":"I came here with co-workers for after-work drinks and dinner. Ordered a large thin crust with sausage, onion and mushroom and a small deep dish with spinach and basil. I must say both crusts were amazing... Buttery crispy but with substance. Really hard to describe! Just amazing. The sauce tasted homemade and unadulterated, with a nice pleasing zing. <br><br>As if a perfect crust holding a well-balanced, chunky homemade sauce wasn&#39;t enough, I was further smitten by the generous loads of fresh toppings.<br><br>I usually consider myself a thin crust girl. That&#39;s because I associate deep dish with a ridiculously heavy, gloopy, greasy cheese fest. And the deep dish is nothing like that. Yes, it&#39;s rich, but they&#39;ve successfully created a pie that is also well-balanced in flavor texture and indulgence.  My ability to enjoy wine with it is a reflection of this deep dish&#39;s conservative richness. <br><br>The bar&#39;s offering of Kim Crawford Sav Blanc (my favorite go-to for a crisp, refreshing, uncomplicated white wine) was a pleasant surprise! I enjoyed two glasses :)<br><br>I definitely recommend Pizano&#39;s for your old school Italian, classic pizzeria fix.",

"reviewcomment":"The food is a little pricey, but we had a great experience this past Saturday night with tasty flatbread, a solid burger/fries combo, calamari and mac-and-cheese.  Green/organic/free-range or not, $15 for a plate of mac-and-cheese half the size of the cheaper and much tastier mac-and-cheese at Kuma&#39;s is ridiculous.  But I had to find out for myself, so shame on me there.  $12 for the calamari was also hefty; the calamari was basically Costco fish with incredible homemade seasoning, not bad but not getting that again.<br><br>Cool vibe and a big shout to the hostess for seating my wife and I at a table next to the fireplace for our date night (didn&#39;t even request it, so a happy random accident).  We didn&#39;t stay late enough for the music, but I&#39;m sure to check that out next time.",

"reviewcomment":"Bin 36 is among my favorite restaurants / wine spots in the city. Went here again last night with my girlfriend to celebrate our 1 year anniversary (as our first date was actually here as well).  I think the food selection is wonderful, diverse and great for sharing. A very reasonably priced wine list means that even frugal diners can order an entire bottle.<br><br>A lot of the reviews on here focus on the ambience. Yes, the front restaurant / bar area is brightly lit, but they do dim the lights a bit as night sets in. The back portion of the restaurant has a lower ceiling which brings some intimacy to dinners served back there. I don&#39;t think they&#39;re gunning for the dark, exposed brick wine bar vibe assumed at DOC and Webster Wine Bar. To me, it feels real casual and approachable. The type of place I would come to with friends or my parents without worrying about coming across as too fancy.  I think they&#39;re doing things right.",

"reviewcomment":"I love going out for breakfast on the weekends, but the things that can make it difficult when you&#39;ve got toddler in tow is the long wait times for a table and well, having a toddler in tow. <br><br>Bakin&#39; &amp; Eggs takes reservations.  Reservations for Sunday breakfast? Yes please and thank you!  My original reservations were for 9am but we were running late. I called and apologized and hoped they still had an opening at 930 and I was in luck. And the hostess couldn&#39;t have been any sweeter to move our reservation.<br><br>We arrived right at 930 and were seated immediately. The place was really buzzing with activity. Buzzing? who am I kidding, it was loud in there. Conversations carry, kids are squealing, spoons are getting banged on tables. Just get me my coffee and I&#39;ll be fine.<br><br>And they did bring me coffee right away. Dark, strong, delicious coffee served in a  Chicago Flag mug (you can purchase a set!) Being around so many kids/parents, they must know that caffeine is a mother&#39;s life line sometimes. Anyway, we got down to business and I ordered the junior pancake for the kid and the Bread Pudding French Toast for moi and the bacon flight to share.<br><br>The Bread Pudding French Toast was fantastic. Even though I only ordered half an order, it was still quite a large serving for me. It was custardy and buttery, probably because it&#39;s made from croissants. Yum croissants. The brown sugar creme sauce really complemented it well and I would have loved some of it to take home and pour over ice cream or some other treat. <br><br>The bacon flight was also delicious--a great savory side to the French Toast. I liked them all but The Honey and the Mesquite were my favorites. And a special mention goes to the jalapeno--it packed a nice bit of heat and I&#39;m thinking I&#39;d love it in a BLT!<br><br>My son&#39;s pancake came out in a mickey mouse shape including whipped creme smiley face. He loved it. <br><br>Service was great. I don&#39;t know how they do it; service with a smile in the midst of noise and chaos. (Chaos at the table next to me as the father kept telling his son.  Ok, that&#39;s one....Ok, that&#39;s two....Ok that&#39;s three... whenever the kid acted up.  How many warnings does he get? I wanted to ask)<br><br>By the time we left (purchased some cupcakes for dessert after dinner!) there was a crowd waiting. Groups of adults, strollers, babies in carriers, running kids.

If you walked into Bari your like oh a small Italian grocery store, but then theirs this deli counter in back and there it begins. The line that is. If it&#39;s anywhere near lunch time, there is a line down the aisle of people just waiting to give their order. Wait it out, worth the wait.<br>All one can say about the sandwiches at Bari is Wow! I&#39;m pretty damn sure they don&#39;t make a bad one, and if they did it would still best the hell out of the same sandwich anywhere else. The Italian is great, crusty bread, fresh sliced mortadella and prosciutto, and great gardinera. The meatball is very tasty and unique because it doesn&#39;t have a lot of sauce and the meatballs are soft, so they don&#39;t come shooting out when you take a bite. <br>But after coming here for over a year I discovered the be all end all of Bari sandwiches...their Italian beef! Holy flurking schnit! The twelve inch Italian beef with gardinera will change your life, and fill you up for the remainder of the day. This is one of the best beefs in the city, and I think that&#39;s saying something. It&#39;s super flavorful and really juicy, and for $8 you get a twelve inch piece of heaven.",

"reviewcomment":"I went to Heartland last week after a hiatus of about 7 years and was pleasantly surprised by the experience. The place was empty, which ironically sometimes compromises service, but in this case made for a very (but not overly) attentive waitress. The food was really good and totally affordable. Being someone who basically has to modify ever dish for my weird eating habits I appreciate a restaurant that expects and accepts that of their customers, rather than being put off by it. <br><br>I missed you my friend, and I&#39;ll be back soon.",

Marc (must be a manager) was very personable and assisted us with the menu. <br><br>We ordered the house blend and fries. We all thought the food was exceptional. Juicy burgers and hot fries what more could we ask for?? Dessert of course! We ordered beignets. I&#39;ve had melt in your mouth beignets. These were not like that. No worries. We came for the burgers anyway. So glad we dined here. Our trip to Chicago would not have been complete without it!!",

I don&#39;t know, I didn&#39;t eat it.<br>The sandwiches are bigger then me, which isn&#39;t saying much.  I could barely get through half of a half.  I swear there was a pound of corned beef on that thing.  <br>The corned beef there is really good though, tender, not too fatty.  My Mom swears by the potato pancakes, they were good.  I am just not a fan of them in general.  Oh and if you check in on your Yelp app, you get a FREE potato pancake!<br><br>As an added bonus, they sell lottery tickets there!  I was feeling lucky, since it was my Mom&#39;s Bday and I bought 3 tickets.  One for my Mom, brother and myself....my bro and I didn&#39;t win, but my Mom won $20!!  Bday luck for sure.  Wish I could say that the $20 covered the bill, but no chance.  I wouldn&#39;t say Manny&#39;s is cheap, I think a corned beef sandwich is $12.00.  I will say that is absolutely worth every penny though.

We started with some very fresh, zesty guacamole. The next dish, scallops, were probably the low light of the meal although still good. We then enjoyed the fundido. The fundido came with 3 delicious sauces, the best of which was a spicy cherry mix. <br><br>Overall terrific atmosphere and experience. Would definitely recommend.",

"reviewcomment":"My friends celebrated my birthday here couple of years back. And since then, this place has become one of my favorite spots. I am a vegetarian, so imagine my delight when I found that I can eat any of their burgers with viola.... veg pattie!!! The cold coffee and Oreo cookie shakes are absolutely delicious. I love their vintage style ambience - with walls full of pictures of all the waitresses who have worked there since 1971.<br>Downside: The popularity makes it hard to find a seat sometimes, especially on the weekends for groups of 4 or more.<br>Tip: Oh and you get half off burgers on Mon-Sat after 10 pm.

There were times when I arrived a little too early for pickup when my order wasn&#39;t ready. The owner gave me his seat and brought me a nice warm cup of tea while I waited. They also give you an additional piece a fruit along with your order. These are just great personal touches that really show customer appreciation.<br><br>I have yet to have a bad dish at Simply It. I love their classic Pho and Banh Mi sandwiches. My fiance really enjoys their Shrimp Fried Rice. I recently tried their Tamarind Shrimp Soup and it probably one of the most flavorful soups I have ever had. The Grilled Lemongrass Beef appetizer does not disappoint, either. All in all, a great place to get takeout, but dine in too if you have a chance! I know I will!",

Thankfully the workers were kind and patient because they were struggling to make decisions. After coming back a few times, the waiter was finally able to get our order.<br><br>We started with an order of the agedashi tofu and two rolls. I&#39;ve only had agedashi tofu once before this and it not a good experience. But this one was much better, not mind blowing, but good. The rolls though were amazing. The fish was really fresh and there wasn&#39;t too much rice.<br><br>I got the Spicy Garlic Miso Ramen and asked if it was really spicy to which she responded yes. I really wanted it though so I ordered less spicy. Thank goodness because that spice kick is no joke. But the broth flavor, noodles, meat, everything.. were all just awesome! It was one of the pricier bowls of ramen but pretty worth it I think.",

"reviewcomment":"This place is so cute! My cousin was going to get some takeout so we could stay in. Artopolis was one of the options she listed out for me, and when I checked out the Yelp pictures and reviews I just really wanted to experience it for myself. So we came here for dinner on a Tues night earlier this month, and it was one of the best meals I&#39;ve had recently. Zero complaints. I love the layout, decor, and ambiance. We chose to sit on the upper level by a window - I like that it gave us more privacy in addition to a view. We decided to share the Yuvetsaki and the Chicken Spinach Lasagna. I really, really enjoyed both, especially the Yuvetsaki. Definitely recommended! My cousin told me that they have a great dessert menu as well, so I ordered the berry yogurt mousse and it was the perfect amount of sweet and tart. I ended up finishing it. I don&#39;t remember what my cousin ordered, it might have been the bread pudding, I tried it and it was also really good, but more than a few big bites would have been too much for me.<br><br>I could see this being a great spot for a study session, coffee break, casual date, or as a place to get a cake. Instant love and I hope to make it back sometime.",

"reviewcomment":"I have been coming here for years and I have yet to be disappointed. This is one italian restaurant I love dining at, and it has stayed on my top 3 ever since I started! <br><br>The bread has always been warm and fresh and the food is always on point. A lot of their main menu items stick around - but there are quite a few entrees that switch their ways in and out with the seasons and popularity. There is always a specials menu that changes every night I believe. The cooking here is impeccable and I cannot stress enough that everything here is done really well. <br><br>I&#39;ve never had a bad server experience either, which can be a rare feat for this near-Wrigley location. Everyone I have had has been helpful and excellent at suggestions, accommodations, and wine/drink pairings. <br><br>What sparked my review after all of this time was my reservation around 9pm (we arrived early) and had to leave by 9:30. Our waitress was attentive even though this place was packed (Saturday evening), and everything was brought out super fast, and we were done at 9:24. <br><br>I will say I am REALLY DISAPPOINTED that there is no more peanut butter chocolate tart dessert anymore. I guess they took it off a few months ago. I was seriously devastated - a girl has to have her dessert! I will be writing to hopefully encourage them to bring it back (or give me the recipe!)",

"reviewcomment":"I&#39;ve only lived in Chicago for 7 months and I can&#39;t even count the number of times I have eaten at Taco Joint. This is my go to place for dinner or lunch out and my favorite place to grab some take out or delivery. <br><br>Margaritas are excellent. There are so many different kinds, although I will admit I almost always get the guava marg. I only wish I could get the marg to go when I&#39;m not eating in!<br><br>I made my way through each of the taco options and landed on my standard order: 2 enchilada tacos and 1 fish taco. I would seriously crave this combo. Unfortunately they changed up their menu 2 weeks ago and my beloved enchilada taco is gone. RIP enchilada taco. I&#39;ll just have to try them all out again to find my new order.<br><br>I&#39;ve also gotten various sides and apps: refried beans, rice, flautas. Everything is delicious. <br><br>Service is friendly in house. The restaurant is on the small side, so beware of peak hours cause you can wait. The bar is bright and there is lots of seating. There is a delivery charge, but the goods come quick and they are hot. And you can order online for pick up and delivery.",

"reviewcomment":"I&#39;ve been here twice now. I&#39;m Armenian and I just love the little hints of Armenian food in Naha&#39;s menu. I will say I think it&#39;s a bit overpriced, which is truly the only reason I haven&#39;t been back more. I love that the restaurant has so many windows - what&#39;s the point of dining downtown if you don&#39;t feel like you&#39;re downtown?! <br><br>As for the food, the menu changes, but you can definitely count on taste and creativity on the menu. The Greek salad comes with an Armenian cheese boereg on top (think cheese pastry fattening goodness) so that&#39;s always a nice treat. The chef also makes the ultimate bulgur pilaf. I grew up with some amazing Armenian cooks around, and Naha&#39;s is truly THE BEST bulgur pilaf I&#39;ve ever had: buttery, garlic-y, made the old-fashioned way, according to my parents. Anyway, even if it&#39;s not on the menu (which, come on Naha, it should always be on the menu), ask for it. You&#39;ve got the inside scoop now.",

"reviewcomment":"I&#39;ve always had a love affair with French food. I love it. I can eat it day in and day out. I&#39;m always looking for an authentic experience that isn&#39;t tacky or touristy. Bistro Campagne is it.<br>I&#39;ve been here about 4 times now with my family. First time of course I had to get the onion soup. It was absolutely to die for! Some of the best I&#39;ve had outside of Paris. Next I had the Croque Monsieur, another staple food I ate while in France. It was so good, melt in your mouth. Crispy and just delicious! Every since then I&#39;ve always gotten the Steak Frites because they are THAT good. Just get the hanger steak, it&#39;s perfectly fine. It&#39;s slightly crispy on the edges, a little chewy, succulent, juicy and just so rewarding. The frites are shoestrings that go perfectly well to soak up the steak juices. Not too salty, not too sweet. Heaven! <br>For dessert I&#39;m a fan of the Creme Brulee and the Profiteroles. Can&#39;t go wrong there!! <br>Overall Bistro Campagne is the perfect spot for an authentic, non-stuffy, non-touristy, warm and welcoming stick-to-your-ribs French food. The staff is fantastic, very attentive and knowledgeable. Come a tad later in the evening during winter so the restaurant warms up. We arrived right at 5 and it felt like they just turned on their heaters. We were cold! But even that didn&#39;t stop us from having yet again another wonderful meal!",

The handmade meatball sandwich, outstanding.  The baked pasta and an order of pasta with broccoli. Everything is good at this location plus the staff are super friendly.

"reviewcomment":"Nice people.<br>Nice ambiance.<br>Nice food.<br>I will be back soon.<br><br>I went to this restaurant last night, with a friend, for my birthday.  Last night was my second time there.  The first time I was there, I just had drinks with friends.  I remember the drinks tasting very earthy ( in a good way) and was interested in visiting again for the food. <br><br>I really appreciate the menu here. They have plenty of vegan and vegetarian dishes to choose from.  Since my friend is a vegetarian, this place worked out for the both of us. <br><br>What I ordered:<br><br>~Hummus for the appetizer<br>~Short ribs as my entrée<br>~Tempura banana for my desert<br>~Cola oogave for my beverage<br><br>The hummus were delicious. It was a little different than what I am used to since I normally eat hummus with pita bread but they serve it with fresh veggies which I think is a good idea.  It was refreshing to eat it with veggies especially since it was hot out yesterday.  <br><br>They give you plenty of short ribs which were very tender and delicious, I only wished that the greens were separate from the short ribs instead of smothered with the sauce, there was no color to this dish because of everything being smothered under the dark sauce but like I said, it was tasty, just a little too saucy for me.  The cauliflower gratin that came with it was delicious.<br><br>My desert would have been better if it had more tempura on it. I kind of felt like I was just eating a banana with chocolate.<br><br>My friend ordered the chorizo tacos and a cookie/ice cream desert which she enjoyed but I really can&#39;t speak for her but I do know that we will be back to visit in July for her birthday.<br><br>Overall, I like this restaurant.  The ambiance and the people are nice (although I did not receive my points for making the reservation on Open Table but my friend said it might take 48 hours before it hits).<br><br>Oh, we also ordered the truffled potatoes and I really enjoyed those. Next time I want to try the mussels and the tofu stir fry. And btw, I love the oogave soda!  <br>Their cocktails are delicious but I still had a lot of work to do, so I decided not to order. <br><br>The only thing that was uncomfortable was the air conditioning.  It was below zero in there. Bring a blanket.",

"reviewcomment":"I love Medici.<br><br>They&#39;ve got a huge variety of food for all tastes-- sandwiches, salads, pizzas. And the desserts are also amazing. At this point I think I&#39;ve tried every vegetarian appetizer on their menu--guacamole and chips is probably the best. My current favorite entrée is the Garbage salad with blue cheese. It&#39;s better than you ever thought a salad could be and you will not walk away hungry.<br>The drinks are also great--creative concoctions from the cafe next door, excellent loose-leaf teas from Benjamin Teas, and fabulous shakes, particularly the weekly specials. I feel the pumpkin pie one deserves a special shout-out... although I think they only serve it for part of November.<br>The service can be a little slow, especially at busy times or near closing, but all in all, a great place to grab a bite.",

"reviewcomment":"Our party of 6 wanted to go to Big Star, but we weren&#39;t up for the 3-hour wait, so we went to Las Palmas instead. This was seriously one of THE BEST meals I&#39;ve ever had. We were all so, so pleased with ourselves. There were stupid smiles all around! <br><br>Our table started with margaritas, fresh guacamole and Queso Fundido (sans chorizo for me, because my friends are lovely and super accomodating). The guac was fresh, but I like a little more cilantro and lime myself. No complaints though, as it IS guac which just so happens to be the best food on earth. The Queso Fundido, on the other hand, was an absolutely GLORIOUS blend of melted Chihuahua and goat cheese, with poblano peppers and oregano in the mix. It was gone SO fast, but my mouth will never forget it. It&#39;s a &#34;Must Order.&#34;<br><br>My friend Lynn and I found ourselves drooling over the same entrees, so we decided to split the Enchayotadas:  &#34;Corn tortillas stuffed with grilled chayotes, carrots, portabella mushrooms, and crispy corn chips bathed in a creamy jalapeño-tomatillo salsa topped with melted Chihuahua cheese, crema Mexicana, queso anejo and garlic vinaigrette salad.&#34; RIGHT?! We also shared &#34;The World&#39;s Least-Sad Salad,&#34; a made up award I&#39;m giving to the Ensalada de Alcachofa on account of its arugula, artichoke fritter, almond and manchego cheese mix, which was doused in white truffle oil.<br><br>If someone had murdered me on the street immediately upon exiting the restaurant, I would have died a happy woman. <br><br>My boyfriend had the Lomo de Puerco, or, &#34;Oven roasted pork tenderloin served with bacon and cerveza de Victoria braised brussel sprouts, butternut squash puree. Drizzled with blueberry-habanero compote.&#34; Judging from his face, it looked like that he would easily choose his entree over me if ever put in the position to decide. I probably wouldn&#39;t even blame him.<br><br>We all picked off of each other&#39;s plates and made a lot of &#34;Mmm!&#34; sounds to a Tom Petty, Michael Jackson and Mariachi soundtrack. I wish we could do this meal all over again. It was THAT good.",

I mean really, it doesn&#39;t bet much better than that!! YUM!!!<br><br>My new approach to eating eliminates sugar, carbs and other stuff. My latest meal at Ann Sather included a veggie omelet, that was literally stuffed with veggies!!! Freakin&#39; awesome! I also had a side of bacon, which was yummy... I mean, it&#39;s hard to mess up bacon.<br><br>Service was good. It was Mother&#39;s Day, and neither me nor my partner are mothers, but we got very good service.<br><br>I was very pleased to go to a restaurant known for excess and still find an amazingly healthy option.",

"reviewcomment":"I am a fan. <br><br>Came here for a friend&#39;s birthday. Apparently, this place is based off of a famous bagel deli at Miami University... in Ohio. It&#39;s a magical place where you can put anything you can ever imagine on a bagel (yes, including jalapenos chips &amp; Doritos). AND if your bagel qualifies and is good enough, it is then drawn on a piece of paper, hung on the wall, and all future customers can order your creation. <br><br>This is also a place where they make bacon cookies...<br><br>I had the Messy Katie (order this mostly because of the avocado + turkey + honey mustard combination), and it was heavily recommended by 3 Miami alums. Crunch n&#39; Munch was also a big favorite in our group.<br><br>It looks like they have some dessert bagels too! I will be trying that next time.",

"reviewcomment":"I stopped by on a Saturday night to celebrate a friend&#39;s bachelorhood through Frontier&#39;s full Animal Service. Our group made reservations for the roast Porky Pig (other options include a full boar, goat, lamb or alligator).<br><br>When I came in to the restaurant, I was expecting more of a lodge feel with animal heads lining the walls since the place is famous for serving game meats. Instead, the decor was modern and clean but disappointingly lacking in mounted heads of any kind.<br><br>Since we were doing the full Animal Service, we were seated in the back room where there were three rows of long tables. When they rolled Babe out on a cart, I&#39;ll admit it was a pretty impressive sight to see the entire pig. We were given time to take pictures and meet our dinner before one of the servers began carving Wilbur for us.<br><br>For $550 before tax and tip, you not only get a lot of Hamm (about 20 to 25 pounds worth), you also get a lot of side dishes which include huge servings of Ceaser salad, corn bread, mac and cheese, and vegetable succotash. Initially, all the food tasted great but as plate after plate piled up and our sinuses became packed with pork, it just became overwhelming. We had 10 hungry guys at our table and we still had about half of the food left over which we boxed up and attempted to eat for lunch the next day (This was not the best idea. It&#39;s been a few weeks and everything I eat still tastes like pork).<br><br>That being said, if we had brought twice as many people, it would have been much more manageable. The roast pig was generally good but certain cuts do not taste the best cooked that way (e.g., the ribs were a big letdown) and the two barbeque sauces were nothing too special. However, the meat was very tender and the sides were well made. For those feeling extra adventurous, they also served the eyeballs, brains, cheeks and tongue. Nom nom nom.<br><br>Our server was very helpful and we did not feel rushed out the door even though we lingered for a while. Overall, it was definitely a unique Bachelor Party dinner - I mean, nothing says bachelor like consuming an entire farm animal.<br><br>In conclusion: Gather at least 20 friends to do the full Animal Service and engage Beast Mode.",

Anyway, ended up with the Soprano &amp; Spinaci and both were very good - I haven&#39;t come across a lot of pizza places that offer napoletano style, so this was a nice change of pace... <br><br>Looks like there are quite a few different specials on through the week, so I&#39;ll probably come back at some point.

We&#39;ve also had the Pad See-lew, Pad Thai and Green Curry. All delish!  I tried the sticky rice with mango and while the flavors were good, I wasn&#39;t a huge fan.

"reviewcomment":"First al fresco dining of the summer season, and it was fabulous. This place is located on busy State Street, but there&#39;s actually a decent amount of patio seating.  Our table was right against the building so we had more distance from the sidewalk (a good thing).  <br><br>As soon as we were seated we were given a basket of warm toasty bread, a plate of dipping oil, and glasses with a carafe of water.  Our waitress was really nice and attentive throughout our entire (long) meal.  <br><br>We split two salads: caprese and roasted beets. The caprese was fantasic - thick slices of roasted tomato topped with thick slices of fresh mozzerella + basil and olive oil.  Simple and delicious.  The beet salad was great and pretty too - the beets were dark purple and a lighter pink shade, served with toasted hazelnuts, blue cheese, greens and a light dressing.  <br><br>We opted for the pizza of the month (white &#39;za with goat cheese, sliced asparagus, an egg and truffle oil).  The pizzas are very thin and light and tasty.  The flavor combo on this pizza was so good - I wish I had another right now.",

"reviewcomment":"Happy Mother&#39;s Day dinner surprise reservation!!! I&#39;ve wanted to go to Mexique since our kids ate here pre-Top Chef and once I watched Carlos compete on Top Chef, I really wanted to eat here. Fortunately I got to tell him myself as he visited our table that my expectations were very high for his food and he totally exceeded them!!<br><br>We started with a pitcher of their signature sangria and 3 delightful small plates: ceviche, which was super fresh and sauced perfectly; the tequila braised pork shoulder with an amazing mango habanero couli; the trio of sopes - escargot, plantain &amp; lamb sausage that were slightly tricky to split 4 ways but we managed pretty well. Honestly, every small plate was so uniquely tasty that we all raved about every single bite. <br><br>My entree was the braised pork belly and smoked sea scallops with mole, celery purée &amp; hibiscus glaze. Wow is all I can say! Everything complemented each other and was so expertly prepared it is one of the most perfect dishes it&#39;s ever been my pleasure to eat. <br><br>My family ordered the escolar, the lamb &amp; the whitefish special. All of them were equally enamored with their dinner choices. <br><br>What an amazing restaurant and Carlos is such a talented and personable chef! Totally worth the wait for a reservation.",

"reviewcomment":"Excellent service from Christina. Delicious calamari with an Asian influence. After being fried with a light breading, it seemed they added a drizzle of sesame sauce -just a bit. It was excellent. Also included in the mix were lightly fried red and green bell peppers. Nice touch! <br><br>The shrimp cocktail was good, but nothing noteworthy. <br><br>We dined outside and as the evening rolled on, the air became chilly. Christina had no problem allowing us to make a mid-meal move to a recently vacated table closer to the heat lamps. It was table for four, but we were just two. <br><br>I enjoyed a couple glasses of a light, crisp Sauv Blanc from Marlborough NZ. Tasted his French Chardonnay, which was similarly light and fitting for this meal. Note: I was not a fan of the lipped wine glasses. <br><br>Roasted beet salad was so beautiful! I asked for it to be served on a bed of greens and they happily obliged. The light-handed dressing and large chunks of blue cheese scattered throughout pleased me. It was a large portion and I was happy to bring home leftovers. <br><br>Steak salad with iceberg lettuce cooked medium was made just as ordered. The peppery steak took center stage on this plate and were well-supported by a generous helping of crumbled blue cheese.  Not much else going on with this salad. I would have welcomed the addition of red onion and cherry tomatoes. <br><br>Overall great experience. I will be back!",

"reviewcomment":"Had the tuna poke, what&#39;s my name, midwestern roll, and sampled the scallop and pot river roll.<br><br>First of all, if you want the beautiful sauces that are also quite delicious, you&#39;ll have to pay the $15 price range for that. I picked the what&#39;s my name because of the yelp reviews. Never again. Such an ordinary roll that I could pick up at the super market.<br><br>HOWEVER, this restaurant is still 5 star worthy b/c of the tuna poke (super super fresh and lucious tuna with an avocado fan). Also, the midwestern roll was a lovely surprise-- slightly battered on the outside with tuna. But my friend got the pot river roll and that was the best. Of course, it was also more expensive.<br><br>MAKE SURE you get reservations because this place tends to fill up fast! especially Friday and Saturday nights!!!",

My man and I attempted to soak up some rays in the rear outdoor patio, but it was too packed - and loud - so we retreated back indoors and snagged a table.  <br><br>Beer prices were fair and they had a few Lagunitas as their $4 beer of the month, so that&#39;s what I started with. I ordered the roasted chicken platter that comes with a 1/2 chx, a small piece of cornbread, small side of coleslaw, and your choice of a larger side (I chose mac &amp; cheese). This totally hit the spot. The chicken was very juicy and tender, the mac was creamy and cheesy, and the cornbread was great. <br><br>I&#39;d love to return and get a coveted patio seat next time!",

"reviewcomment":"This place is great. My brother was in town and really wanted some fish and chips, so I took him here-- the other good reviews motivated me, and also it&#39;s walking distance from my apartment. <br><br>Came here on a Sunday when both the Cubs and the Blackhawks were playing, so it was DEAD since there are no TVs. All the better for us to get fast service! Brother got the fish and chips and I decided to try the Trawlerman&#39;s Pie. First of all, I had never heard of a Trawlerman&#39;s Pie, and my only experience with Scottish food was eating a really nasty Shepherd&#39;s Pie in Nanjing, China--- after that, I was like savory pies are NASTY.  Anyway, Sean the bartender recommended the pie since I said I don&#39;t like breaded meat, and was really accommodating by swapping out the green peas for steamed veggies.<br><br>The trawlerman pie didn&#39;t really seem like a pie, it was a little pot of seafood topped with mashed potatoes and cheese---- freaking DE-LISH. <br><br>What I liked best about the place is that the bartender was so helpful in giving me his thoughts on what food he thought would suit my taste, telling us about the history of Scotch, and giving my brother suggestions on what Scotch to order, and just being entertaining and friendly. There&#39;s also a lot of character in the pub-- maybe that&#39;s what other Scottish bars are supposed to look like? I definitely want to go back for a drink here again! I think next time I&#39;ll try the fish po&#39;boy.",

"reviewcomment":"I went Thursday for the first time to Ruth&#39;s Chris Steak House and was handsomely rewarded. It was the most expensive meal I have ever had and will now place such restaurants on my schedule of infrequent visits, I think once a year would be appropriate given my budget.<br><br>I ordered the special of petite fillet steak with shrimp and crab. It was served on what they said was a 500 degree plate and I thought this was a nice touch as I have never before eaten food in a restaurant so hot and ready and it was well worth their effort. The seafood was excellent and the steak was a real treat. They served a sauce on the side that was absolutely heaven with the steak. I have never been so tempted to admit to being overwhelmed by a meal. Well done, folks!<br><br>For desert I had bread pudding with vanilla ice cream and whipped cream on top. It provided just the right completion to a special pleasure. Delicious.<br><br>My waiter&#39;s name, if I recall right, was Mason. Nice job. He knew what he was talking about.<br><br>The surroundings were suitable for an unpretentious solid fare restaurant. There was a lit candle on the table that I thought was unusual in my experience dining out. They had all bases covered.<br><br>Although I would love to return to Ruth&#39;s Chris Steak House my experience also gets me to think now about other restaurants I have had on the too expensive for me list.<br><br>I left feeling very special and my evening left little to spare having started out on such a note.<br><br>My thanks to Ruth&#39;s Chris Steak House for a really worthwhile experience.",

I tried Ethiopian food for the first time about 2 years ago and have been to several spots around the city (usual suspects: Ethiopian Diamond, Demera, etc.) but nothing comes close to Ras Dashen.<br><br>I can&#39;t really handle spicy stuff and so I usually just order the vegetarian sampler, which includes 5 generous vegetarian sides. I can easily split this into two meals. Everything is just perfect--their gomen and qosta is perfectly cooked, their yeqay tikil gomen is addictive, and their tikil gomen alicha is the most comfortable comfort food ever. Oh, and their injera is perfect flavored and cooked--probably why their qategna appetizer is my favorite (can&#39;t get enough injera). Their honey wine is also a fantastic treat.<br><br>Their service is also great--we probably average a meal there every 2 weeks (we live very close) and they are friendly and speedy every time, without fail. Their take-out service is also fast and reliable (and I think they might actually give you larger portions...) Since I love this place so much, I had my birthday dinner there last weekend (15 people) and they were extremely accommodating and dealt with the large group seamlessly. Everyone received exactly what they ordered and enjoyed every minute of it.<br><br>Ras Dashen, never change.",

He is one of the coolest waiter I ever had. Not just because he was fun but also very careful in making sure we were having a good time. For instance (I&#39;m almost embarrassed mentioning this) at a certain point, since I often talk and eat contemporarily, a bite of food went down the wrong pipe and I started choking. Lucas noticed it right away, he came helping me and he made sure everything was ok. Expected you would say.... well it still feels nice!<br>- The food was fresh and very tasty, especially their ceviches!!!!<br>- The selection of margaritas was very interesting and the drinks so well made and refreshing<br><br>For the Cinco the Mayo they opened the back patio, It really felt like summer and the atmosphere was just incredibly festive.<br>This is probably what I liked most, the feeling of happiness and fun spread around...<br><br>You should definitively consider going there if you are around Oak Park.<br>I cannot wait to go again!",

The location is amazing, being surrounded by equally great steak houses and shopping. The interior was stylish and while others have said the crowd was &#34;older&#34;, I personally felt it was simply more professional. <br><br>I was going to have dinner, but ended up mainly having drinks at the bar. The food I did see looked amazing and I regret not eating. It is on the list for the next time I am in town. <br><br>The bar was really chic and the drinks were great. Bartenders were on top of their game and I truly enjoyed the vibe. I&#39;ll 100% go back and eat the next time for sure.",

Greksa, loves Cuban food.  With it being his farewell party, he chose Cafe Laguardia.  I&#39;m glad he did!<br><br>The atmosphere in this restaurant is very energetic, but not crazy.  As soon as you walk in, your eyes dart all across the walls, trying to comprehend the variety of art that has been hung.  It&#39;s a mish mosh of Cuban culture, and definitely sets the mood for your evening.<br><br>The servers we had were very friendly and attentive.  Our table had a number of special orders, and they took care of everything.  The food was great as well.  I, of course, had a Cuban Sandwich.  Ashley ordered chile relanos (I know that&#39;s spelled wrong).  Other friends had fish, fajitas, burritos, etc....and I finished everything they didn&#39;t want.  It was really tasty.  <br><br>This being a Saturday night, there was live music in the bar.  Our dinner ended almost right at the start of the band, so we missed out on the dancing.  This is definitely a place I would like to come back to with another large group of friends/family.<br><br>They would&#39;ve gotten 5 stars, but their BYOB policy is $20/bottle.  4 stars it is :)",

"reviewcomment":"My husband and I recently found ourselves stuck in Chicago for two days after some drama at O&#39;Hare Airport caused us to miss our connecting flight to Las Vegas. Fortunately, we got a room at the Hampton Inn Majestic, and they suggested The Villages as an option for a late evening meal.<br><br>I am used to extensively researching restaurants and hotels before I go on any trip, so I was a bit apprehensive going to a restaurant I knew absolutely nothing about ... and I was pleasantly surprised!<br><br>It&#39;s really a collection of three theme restaurants in one building. La Cantina, Vivere, and the Village. It was close to 10:00 when we got there so the only one open was the one upstairs - The Village.<br><br>The atmosphere is kind of campy, kitschy, Disney-meets-Vegas Italian.  I mean that in a good way. It&#39;s kind of fun. They have transformed that floor into a miniature Italian village with separate &#34;buildings&#34; / dining alcoves, painted the ceiling sky blue, and strung up white Christmas tree lights for ambiance.<br><br>My husband had the pollo rotolini - thin chicken breasts rolled with sausage and prosciutto - and I had the meat ravioli. Both of our meals were absolutely delicious. There was plenty of meat in the ravioli and the pasta sauce was more savory than sweet. It would&#39;ve been nice to have a bit of Parmesan cheese sprinkled on top, but I&#39;m not a fan of those communal containers left on every table and used by people I don&#39;t know. Oh well.<br><br>The service was excellent. The only thing I found kind of odd was the waitstaff used rolling carts to bring the food to the table and to clear dishes after a meal. I&#39;ve never been anywhere that used those carts. Perhaps it&#39;s just a Chicago thing?<br><br>Overall, our first meal in Chicago was very pleasant!",

"reviewcomment":"While I could argue that every city is a brunch city, this seems to echo considerably more true with my time in Chicago than some other places. Everywhere has a brunch, and I&#39;m not upset about it in the slightest. With that, though, comes the difficult task of narrowing a million options each Saturday and Sunday morning. After meeting a new friend days prior, she invited me to join her Saturday morning at a Taste of Heaven, and it definitely was an enjoyable taste.<br><br>I highly recommend this place. It&#39;s small and not trying to be &#34;trendy&#34;, but just good. It has a nice neighborhood vibe, although I lend a lot of that to Andersonville in general. I had the biscuits (cornmeal biscuits, I must add) and gravy and was loving every morsel. I really think everyone should get this dish. :) My friend got the breakfast casserole and it also was pretty awesome looking. The food was spot-on a wonderful brunch and I could see myself making it a regular brunch stop.<br><br>Ps. If you&#39;re going to bring kids, make sure they&#39;re entertained and able to enjoy the quality experience that is A Taste of Heaven. :)",

"reviewcomment":"Stopped through Paramount Room to take a look at their Monda - Wednesday burger lunch special, which was quite the deal - Wagyu beef / brioche bun / lettuce / onion / tomato + a pint of beer for $12! +$1 for cheese (you can get Gruyere, which is impressive) and +2 for fries. All in all, a really solid lunch spot - spoke with the owner &amp; the bartender about the joint, and both were very friendly - everyone is excited about Craft Beer Week!<br><br>Will definitely be back for another lunchtime burger fix and probably a happy hour or two at some point... Good job Paramount Room",

It shouldn&#39;t be this hard to find such a great Mexican restaurant in Chicago but this was worth the wait. Food was perfect. Service was so great. Our waitress was so kind and sweet. The only thing I regret was not leaving room for dessert. They had mango cheesecake tonight and I had to pass since I didn&#39;t come here in sweatpants. Next time you&#39;re craving Mexican, run here!",

"reviewcomment":"Just to add my two cents, I really liked the pizza.  We got a 12&#34; with pepperoni and mushrooms.  The pepperoni was deeelish, as were the mushrooms.  So, I&#39;ve seen some complaints regarding the 1.50 per ingredient.  Yes, if you are not careful, it will be one expensive pizza. On the other hand, they do NOT skimp on the toppings - we got a ton of pep/mush on the entire pizza - making for a really good hearty slice.  As a matter of fact, they were so generous with the toppings I could only finish 2 slices.  We had the rest for dinner later that day - it reheated nicely on a griddle.  <br><br>I saw the mozzarella sticks - I may return one day with a friend just to share an order of those with a beer - they are huge and look yummy!  <br><br>Everyone who helped us was very nice - no complaints there.  The restaurant was very clean and I love the outdoor seating - and also like that we never felt rushed.",

"reviewcomment":"What an immensely enjoyable throwback is this showplace German restaurant.<br><br> Big, open beer hall dining space, almost always crowded during those Thursday, Friday and Saturday nights you and everyone else really wants to be there. A nice sized bar.<br><br> Gody and his house band play hokey German and American standards (HOY HOY HOY! and raindrops falling on your head from the Mellotron) often danced to by incredibly nimble old married couples and respectful grandfathers with dirndl dressed, cherubic blonde granddaughters riding their feet. <br><br> Good sized portions of all the favourite German dishes like sauerbraten and schnitzel remind that one is in a restaurant that has been in business since Lincoln Square was a German-American paradise. Gray green beans, appropriately over-cooked as Mom used to make! Where else? Excellent potato salad, exactly the way it is in my dreams. And hackbraten . . . ahhh . . .Gott im Himmel! Delightful. They provide food for Lincoln Square&#39;s annual Oktoberfest and Maifest, too. The parade passes on Western Avenue visible to the sign on their rear door.<br><br> BEER BEER BEER! Fresh German beers! Stiegl and DAB on tap, Dunkel Weiss. Doppelbock. Maibock (better with Giant Pretzel) All the favourites and FRESH since they serve so much. Even Das Bier Boot (pardon my Germerican), the tall, boot shaped glass that  . . . oh my gosh . . . I have to stop. Ecstasy is overflowing and must . . . have . . . beer. But they&#39;re not open :-(  Scheißenkleister! <br><br>That said, it&#39;s not for everyone.<br><br>~Peter O. and S.",

"reviewcomment":"Had a wonderful date night at Balena. I cannot commend this place enough for their customer service. They go out of their way to make sure you have a special evening while dining there. Our server was excellent and made really good recommendations. We ordered a particular bottle of wine that they didn&#39;t have in stock and the sommelier came by and suggested a similar bottle of wine. <br><br>We started with the Kale Caesar salad which was really good. Then we shared the Spaghetti Cacio e Pepe which tasted like a grown-up&#39;s buttered noodles. It was okay, but I think I&#39;ll try a different pasta next visit. My girlfriend had the whole grilled branzino and the middle portion was de-boned which made it much easier to eat and enjoy. I hand the hanger steak which was also really good. The best course was our dessert, the chocolate and hazelnut crocannte. We don&#39;t usually get dessert, but I am glad we did this time. It was delicious!<br><br>The best part of the night was seeing Derrik Rose dining two tables away. From the look of it, he was really enjoying his meal as well.",

"reviewcomment":"This is really one of my favorite places in the city.  I have never gone for breakfast, only dinner.  The gravlax is like sushi grade salmon (better quality fish than many sushi places and generous portions to boot) served with toast points, diced tomatoes, and onions, dill, and mustard.  I could make a meal out of it alone and be incredibly satisfied.  The crab cakes are steeped in a bisque like sauce. They&#39;re soft but hold together well and not greasy in the least.  The bisque really adds a unique character to their version. It&#39;s a wonderful, creamy flavor with a nice zest -- just enough to enhance the flavor profile of the crab cakes without overpowering the subtle flavors of the crab.<br><br>My favorite entree is far and away the encrusted trout.  A generous sized fish served with a spinach covering in cream sauce.  It is a favorite fish dish in the City.  The potatoes au gratin are a bit unhealthy, but when potatoes taste this good, it&#39;s worth every bite.<br><br>Some of the best onion soup I ever had as well.<br><br>I&#39;ve never had a problem getting a table here.  This place has been around for a pretty long time, and like many established restaurants may be feeling ignored for its lack of newness.  But if you haven&#39;t come by in a while, you may want to rediscover this place.  I have never left here anything less than completely satisfied with my meal, nor has anybody I ever brought.",

"reviewcomment":"My husband and I came for an earlier Sunday dinner and the place was empty. Maybe it was still early.<br><br>We ordered a sangria and piña colada. I didn&#39;t try my husbands sangria but he said it was good. The piña colada was perfect, not too sweet, not too strong. Probably one of the best ones I&#39;ve had.<br><br>We ordered ceviche as an appetizer and it was delicious! It was very fresh and had the perfect taste. Chips and salsa were great, but they only give you a small thing of salsa.<br><br>Our server was Agustin, he was kind and friendly. He wasn&#39;t over bearing, but made sure we were well taken care of. <br><br>I ordered the flautas, which I was not excited about. The flautas are very big and thick. I&#39;m used to smaller, thinner ones, which I love because I think you can enjoy them better. The rice was ok.<br><br>Over all the place is nice and the staff is friendly, I would definitely go back and recommended.",

"reviewcomment":"This was the last restaurant I visited on my business trip to Chicago last weekend, and lemme just say it was the perfect way to end my stay.  I loved everything I ate at Catch 35.  Only problem was getting full too fast.<br><br>Our group shared several appetizers.  I chose to sample the Szechwan Scallops and the Point Judith Calamari.  The best was the scallops.  These were cooked perfectly and had an excellent sauce on the plate.  Someone said it was oyster sauce, but I don&#39;t know for sure.  The calamari was flash fried and came with cocktail and tartar sauces.  I&#39;d never had calamari so no comparison for me, but anything fried and dipped in tartar sauce can&#39;t ever be that bad!<br><br>For my entree,  I went with a couple more appetizers.  I really wanted to try the Oysters Rockefeller and the Maryland Crab Cake.  Both of these were delicious.  I am a beginner oyster eater (always Rockefeller-style, never raw), and they were so great.  Topped with bacon, spinach, cheese and a mornay sauce, there was nothing about it to not like.  Extremely savory.  If you have never tried oysters because of fear - stop with that immediately and get the Oysters Rockefeller.  You will not be sorry.<br><br>The crab cake was a little bit of a looser cake than what you&#39;ve seen before, but I didn&#39;t care one bit.  It was chock-full of crab, and that&#39;s all that matters!  Accompanied by a remoulade, it was comfort seafood at it&#39;s best.  I could&#39;ve eaten another one, but I was trying to pace myself as best I could.  Saving room for dessert is very hard when you&#39;re having an amazing meal.<br><br>My husband got the Alaskan Halibut T-Bone.  He said it was very hearty and good.  The least impressive as far as uniqueness goes, but still delicious and filling.<br><br>Somehow though, we did manage to save room for dessert.  I chose the Taffy Apple Tart, which was topped with a vanilla bean ice cream.  Even though the flavors were rich, I felt this was a perfect end to the meal.  There&#39;s just something about apples and ice cream!  I was unable to finish it, however, because my meal had finally caught up to me.  But I highly recommend it.<br><br>My husband had the Sticky Toffee Pudding Cake, which is one of his favorite desserts.  Any time he sees something like this on the menu, he forgoes his normal chocolate choice.  He&#39;s had some good versions, and this one is no exception.  Very moist with a flavorful butter caramel sauce.  Comforting and warm, just like you&#39;d want it!<br><br>If I lived in Chicago, I&#39;d definitely go back to this restaurant to try something off the entree section.  Unfortunately, I don&#39;t know when I&#39;ll be in Chicago again.  But for others who are local and are looking for good seafood, Catch 35 is a good one.",

"reviewcomment":"Ermagod the loco-jito. A new drink that one of the managers created just yesterday- this Fresno chili, rum, mint leaves drink with passion fruit puree is freaking amazing. I think I just might love it more than that Assault and Pepper drink at HQ, and that is MY drink. Also, tuna tartare? To die for! I don&#39;t even eat tuna tartare usually, raw fish seems slimy and weird to me. But the tuna tartare here is made with cucumber, onions and avocado- amazeballs! I am now a fan of tuna tartare--- or maybe just of the tuna tartar here. <br><br>I like that a lot of their signature cocktails are made with puree-- the Effen Avocado is a refreshing, summery drink that has avocado puree (which I ordered thinking it would be more like an avocado smoothie, so I was a bit disappointed that it wasn&#39;t thicker), the Sex Panther has mango puree, so on and so forth. <br><br>I&#39;m definitely coming back to order another Loco-jito, to try The Master (which I heard is even spicier than the Loco-jito, and to try other menu items.<br><br>I like the decor of this place--- high ceilings, exposed pipes, and just a very trendy vibe. Also, Joe the bartender was so nice and welcome to suggestions, such as me asking for more chili in my loco-jito. <br><br>I originally came to check out the rooftop (which was really nice, too bad it was raining that day), but really like the lounge area too. I&#39;ll have to come back for Happy Hour one day!",

We had no less than four folks attending to our needs. <br><br>The guacamole was fresh and delicious! I&#39;m pretty particular about what I eat and the Chicken &#34;a la Lu Lu&#34; was perfect. With roasted veggies and a side of avocado, it was a perfect, light meal.<br><br>We arrived on Saturday around 6:30. It was not crowded at all. By the time we left, it was packed.<br><br>It was good... No complaints. I wavered between a three and four star review. I think 3 1/2 is most accurate, but since I had to choose and because it was a pleasant experience with great drinks and good food, I went with four stars.",

The table we got was downstairs which was fun because we got to see the whole place. We had a booth and we were surrounded by TVs which was great because we had several sports fans and none of them had to crane their necks because there was a tv in every view. <br><br>Then our server came, Stacy. What can I say about Stacy, other than she was spectacular!!!! She made our group, especially the birthday boy feel special. She was personable, helpful and friendly. At the end of the night the wife of the birthday boy decided she was coming back to have her party in a few weeks. I believe a good time was had by all and Stacy played a big role in that. <br><br>Now on to the fun stuff, drinks and food. I had a Lagerita, totally tasty!! We shared several appetizers but my absolute favorite was the poutine. It was HEAVEN!! I highly recommend it. The beers are reasonably priced and certain sizes of drinks come with a take home cup. (Clever marketing)<br><br>All in all it was great. Why only four stars? The bathroom was kind of a train wreck. :(",

The breakfast potatoes are pretty average brunch food.<br><br>What was great was our server! (Brenda?) Very kind, quick, and attentive. The bussers/food runners were also on point. One of them stopped what he was doing to get us an umbrella. The host was friendly and sat us immediately.",

The line is always out the door but well worth the wait. When I bring these wings to a Super Bowl party, there are never any leftovers and I always buy at least fifty or so. <br><br>I&#39;ve eaten here once. It&#39;s best to bring a large group of 6-10. They have large circular tables with a lazy Susan in the middle, as the dishes are served family style for sharing. Like most others mention though, the rest of the menu is just so so. Five stars for the wings and probably only three stars at best for the rest of the menu. Your best net here is taking some wings to go and adding rice to the wings and sauce. Really a winning combo.",

Our waitress was super friendly and always there when we needed something.<br><br>You really can&#39;t beat the $3 Mimosa and Bellini special either. Their glassware is pretty rad too.<br><br>I was impressed with the food as well. I really wanted to try some of their lunch items, but it was a breakfast kinda day.

"reviewcomment":"I&#39;ve come to Phoenix all my life and always loved coming here to get Dim Sum since I was a little girl.  My favorite part of the experience is the carts which is very hard to find nowadays in Chinatown because everyone switched over to the Dim Sum Menus.  This totally takes away from the fun and is a lot harder not to over order.  I&#39;m a very visual person...if it looks good I want to eat it right then and now! So seeing it on the carts and choosing what you want is my favorite way and I feel the only way you should eat Dim Sum. This being said I&#39;m happy to know that Phoenix is one of the last remaining restaurants to give you a truly authentic Dim Sum experience with the carts!  They also remodeled the restaurant and looks much nicer.  The only thing I could ask for is more carts in the rotation, the old days it was non stop cart madness it has dwindled down a lot since then where you are flagging down carts now.<br><br>Everything tasted good, the staff was friendly and it&#39;s reasonably priced here.  They almost knew what we wanted to eat and brought us these fried chicken wings that were really juicy and crispy and I&#39;m usually not a big fan of plain fried chicken.  The BBQ spare ribs looked amazing and were really yummy and also the deep fried pork bun with sticky rice. <br><br>Towards the end when we were all full to the max, the owners comes around with a tray of buns and says &#34;these are special order BBQ pork buns guaranteed you will like or your money back&#34; SOLD! We all took a bite into these specialty buns and OMG FOODGASM!! They were hot and when you bite down into the buns it&#39;s like this warm crispy buttery sugar crust into the savory and sweet bbq pork! All I have to say is that the best Tip I can give to anyone is to ORDER THESE BUNS! YOUR WELCOME! You can thank me later :P",

We easily could&#39;ve gotten their $43 one and had more than enough.  We added a side of mushrooms and creamed spinach.  That was also too much food. Theb sides really need to be split between 3-4 people.<br><br> Everything was really tasty and the service was great. With our dinner and a bottle of their house wine we got out of there for around $150 after tip and tax. It was easily worth that.",

"reviewcomment":"In a country where burgers are a religion, and that religion is relatively pagan, you&#39;d think that every grill man (or grill woman, ladies!) could prepare a decent burger. But sometimes simplicity is more difficult than complexity. Long-winded way of saying that Hackney&#39;s consistently makes a damned good burger. This time I had the Holy Guacamole burger (usually I&#39;m partial to the Bleu Cheeseburger): juicily medium rare, and it was a delight to try to tame it with two hands to get it into my pie hole. Delicious.<br>     Minus a star for the fries (of the coated variety--hey, let&#39;s let spuds be spuds!) and another for the boneless Buffalo wings: They had a good flavor (though the sauce could have been spicier), but there&#39;s something patently WRONG about a boneless wing--that just won&#39;t fly, in my book. Seemed more like Chicken HackNuggets. <br>     But add back a star because the burger&#39;s that good, and because of the sweet women (and man) who served us. We didn&#39;t get them this time, but the onion rings are delectable, even though they might have to wheel you out on a stretcher, yelling &#34;clear!!!&#34; as they defibrilate you. But each person has to decide what&#39;s worth dying for.",

(Heck, check that.  All flatbreads here).<br>- Burgers<br>- Wine list.  (I don&#39;t care if this isn&#39;t a wine place, I like my wine and I like the wines they have here. :) <br>- Zach - He runs the place.  He&#39;s awesome.  He&#39;s a boss.  He&#39;s kind and increases my frequency here by about 4.5X<br>- Steak tartar - It&#39;s solid, I&#39;d rate an 8 out of 10.  Still boss, but there&#39;s something missing or some ingredient should be taken out for it to be a 10 out of 10.<br>- Deserts - I don&#39;t even like deserts but I find myself getting them here all the time.  They&#39;re good. Try them, don&#39;t use up all your eats on savory.  Sweet here is not to be missed.<br>- Every occasion - Event, date spot, friend spot, late night early night, it&#39;s always purely glorious.",

Topics ranged from Childhood, El Bulli and now Modern Chinese. The changing of menu has certainly drawn many criticism but its important to remember the goal of this place is how they reimagine what xyz would be like in their vision. With that said, it will certainly draw diners to debate was it good and true to form or just hogwash. I have personally been to three menus so far (Kyoto, The Hunt, Chicago Steak) there are some menus that are higher quality than others, but overall the experience is always good. <br><br>I will be back the next time when they announce Next: College Munchies...or something that might strike my fancy ^_^",

"reviewcomment":"Getting a table for dinner in Wicker Park on a Saturday night is basically impossible. Most of the prime restaurants have waits longer than an hour and refuse to take reservations. So what happens when you are very hungry and tired of walking? You become adventurous and pick a random place and cross your fingers.<br><br>I was having dinner with two friends, one of which is the pickiest eater that I have ever met. This is the reason I end up eating burgers and pizza with her so often.  Can&#39;t say I complain.<br><br>We had originally intended to go to Piece Brewery &amp; Pizzeria but the line was absolutely insane.  When we walked by Santullo&#39;s Eatery on North Ave and smelled the delicious aroma of NY-style pizza, I knew it had the potential to be a winner.  And it was.<br><br>I live in Chicago so sometimes I get tired of deep-dish pizza.  I love the appeal of the thin crust, huge slice pizza that my grandparents and I enjoy so much.  They grew up in Brooklyn and they have taught me everything I know about folding the piece in half for easier consumption.  We waited in line to order and could only collectively decide as a group on the cheese pizza.  The college budget doesn&#39;t allow for many toppings..<br><br>The guy at the register said the pizza would be out in about forty minutes but it only took twenty.  Pretty clutch since we were running out of small talk ideas.<br><br>The pizza was HUGE.  I preface this statement that all three of us agree that the pizza looks abnormally larger in the photo due to the camera angle.  The pieces are ginormous but are only moderately filling due to the thinness of the pizza.  The traditional Italian pizza flavors were amazing and the cheese-to-sauce ratio was optimal.  Overall, a fantastic pizza for a great price and minimum wait time.<br><br>I still have yet to try Piece but so far, Santullo&#39;s Eatery is my favorite pizza place in Wicker Park and maybe even Chicago.  A great place to grab some NY-style pizza, catch up with friends and not die in starvation while waiting for a table on Saturday night.",

In my 10+ years of living in the US, Isla is probably the one that hits closest to home.<br><br>Why, you ask? Two words: CRISPY. PATA. I spent many a summers in my parents&#39; hometown of Candelaria, Quezon, where the best Crispy Pata is made (biases aside, really. Foodies can back this up). Trust me, I&#39;ve had my fair share of this delectable fried dish. And let me tell you something: Isla gets it. It&#39;s pretty darn close to what I&#39;m used to back home.<br><br>If you&#39;re smart, you&#39;ll pay Isla a visit, but if you&#39;re smarter, you&#39;ll make reservations. Yes, it gets crowded. Yes, patrons tend to stay longer. But let&#39;s get real here. That&#39;s a tell-tale sign that this place is the real deal.

It was too cold to sit outside yesterday, but with warmer weather you can take advantage of the outdoor patio. Only downfall is it&#39;s on Michigan Avenue and I try to avoid this street at all costs (glazed eye tourists who don&#39;t know how to put one foot in front of the other and walk.....I digress)<br><br>We ordered two items to share. The Santa Fe wrap with tater tots on the side and the margherita  pizza special. I liked the crust of the pizza and you can&#39;t go wrong with tater tots :) The part I was most impressed with was since they knew we were splitting the meal they split it for us and brought out on separate plates, without charging extra I should add.

"reviewcomment":"I was born, raised &amp; grew up in the Midwest.   Lived in Southern Cali for a while &amp; I grew up to be quite the traveler.  I love eating at off the beaten path places.   I&#39;ve been known to find the best sushi in San Antonio because why not?  New York is my favorite city with the best food.   I&#39;m not a huge fan of Chicago but RL is my favorite restaurant in the United States.  <br><br>It has the crisp, classic clean lines of Ralph Lauren&#39;s clothing lines.   The bar, though tiny, provides some of the best drinks you&#39;ll ever sip with friends.   The bartenders are personable, efficient &amp; on many occasions offered a new drink if you weren&#39;t happy with the one you ordered.   You cannot find more impeccable customer service anywhere.   <br><br>Sometimes the wait is long.  Sometimes it&#39;s not.  The patio is great to people watch &amp; enjoy delectable food &amp; drinks with your friends.   The large open dining room is a love affair from days gone by where you can peruse the other customers dining fare while enjoying one of the best black &amp; white photography collection of someone&#39;s life- scattered all over its walls.   You never know who you will be sitting next to.   A family visiting from Sweden?  A professional athlete?  A bridal party enjoying the bride&#39;s last night of being single?   I swear I saw Rob Kardashian there once.   Even if it wasn&#39;t him, retelling our dinner at RL is well remembered.  <br><br>The waiters are professionals you have never seen work with such smooth efficiency.   Often, they have handed me their business cards &amp; told my friends &amp; I to call if we ever needed anything.   We never had to wait for extra butter, water refills, etc.   I&#39;ve eaten here on many, many occasions &amp; will always come back for more.   Even a trip to the ladies room; a small walk down the hall &amp; an elevator ride down a story, is adventurous.   The artwork continues through your walk there &amp; yes, even in the bathrooms.   <br><br>If you ever crave that little piece of New York elegance &amp; vibe, this is the place to go.   Delicious food, great service, awesome artwork, people watching, spacious dining room, fun patio - it&#39;s divine.",

"reviewcomment":"I remember coming to this place back in high school and back then it had one of the biggest &amp; yummiest burritos I ever ate in my life. The thing took 2 days for me to eat and I brought it everywhere (trains, buses, school, etc.) It was a pleasant surprise because the place was a dimly lit (pretty much pitch black) dive with an ancient ATM machine and a few tables in the back. I could never find this place again though! It was straight out of a movie as I kept looking around the area over the years and searching the net, but it was simply gone... <br><br>Here we are about 7 years later and I stumble across an article about burritos in Chicago. I looked at the description of some places and thought this might be the one. To my delight it was! The place has cleaned up (it actually has lights now!), they turned it into a full sit-down restaurant by adding a lot more tables and expanding the place. Although I laughed because that same ancient ATM that I bet hardly anyone uses is still there collecting dust along the back wall. <br><br>They don&#39;t have the ground beef burrito anymore, just carne asada. The cashier was eager to take my order (asking me in both Spanish and English.) I got myself 2 super burritos one lengua (beef tongue), and one lomo (ribeye steak). She took my order down and rang my up for one burrito...which I corrected her for (would I have gotten a 2 for 1 deal if I hadn&#39;t? Dangit!). They took my credit card quick and easy.<br><br>The place was pretty busy, but still had that &#34;divey&#34; atmosphere, but in a good way. I got my burritos in about 10 minutes and was out the door. They&#39;re still huge and the restaurant threw in a ton of green pepper salsa. I dove right into these things once I got home. They were both cooked and prepared well, all the ingredients packed tightly together, nothing was sloppy. The lengua blended perfectly with the cheese, onions, lettuce, tomatoes, sour cream, guacamole, etc. Definitely will have this again on my next trip. The lomo while still good, I think they didn&#39;t make it a super burrito as it was filled with rice or its an entirely different recipe. <br><br>Whatever the case this place is going to be in my stable of restaurants. Right now it&#39;s the best burrito in my area and completely lived up to the taste I had on my mind all these years.",

This &#34;walk in sideways&#34; tiny restaurant makes up for it with fantastic Italian food that will keep you coming back and bring your momma and every family member that comes to town.  It&#39;s cozy and warm with the cutest window tables.  The staff members are very friendly and attentive.<br><br>My favorite is the Linguini Mare Mussels, calamari and shrimp with spicy marinara sauce. The gnocci is awesome and my family members have had everything from chicken &amp; steak to pasta and never once have we been disappointed.  <br><br>My bf and I stopped in for espresso and dessert one night and the chef had concocted a special kind of  &#34;creme brulee&#34;  that defined greatness.  We were treated royally though we didn&#39;t have a full course meal and details like these sets them apart!!<br><br>I highly recommend Angelina&#39;s Ristorante and look forward to making it to brunch some day and find out what all the hype is about ;)",

I am usually pretty skeptical about Irish food, but lady Gregory&#39;s certainly surprised me! <br><br>The menu was diverse, it didn&#39;t seem to be limited to traditionally &#34;Irish&#34; cuisine. I ordered the salmon with champ potatoes &amp; brussel sprouts. It was all delicious! I had to ask what &#34;champ&#34; potatoes were, to find out that they are made with scallions and whole milk. Yummm. <br><br>Pretty cool atmosphere, was very full on Friday night. My one complaint is that the music was quite loud, making the conversation a little difficult. <br><br>I&#39;m not in this area often, but would recommend it to others!",

"reviewcomment":"Amazing! G &amp; G was at the top of our must do list while in Chicago.  The service from JJ was amazing. He had an assistant waiter and altough the place was packed, we were well taken care of.  We had the Chicken Parmesan and the Chicken Marsala.  <br><br>The ambience is dark and makes you feel like you stepped back in time and you&#39;re going to dine with an Italian mobster, (maybe you are?).  I loved it! <br><br>Secondly, the portions are huge! Two people could easily eat one dish, (although, you wouldn&#39;t get the joy out of trying someone else&#39;s food without the commitment).  Plus you get these delicious home fries and fresh bread. So good! The only complaint I had was the house salad just had lettuce, 1 tomato and my dressing...but I wasn&#39;t really there for the salad so I ate it quickly hoping I could just move on the main event. <br><br>For dessert we had the Tuxedo Cheesecake...There&#39;s really nothing to say other than we wished we would have taken a piece to go.",

I loved the soup.  <br><br>Its a great place for a date or with a group of friends. The kids seemed to like it too. <br><br>Service can be iffy - depends on who you get. Some are more attentive than others and sometimes language can be a challenge.<br><br>Food has always been tasty. <br><br>The only challenge can be finding parking - having lived in the area, I know parking can be hit or miss.

I will admit that I am fearful of making the wrong choice and will admit I do at times dread trying new places..I have been burned before by reviews that were WAY off course.....but lemme just say..from me to you...I LOVED IT<br>We arrived approx 8 AM...my son and I had an up and out early ...venture into the city, dig a bit deeper .. discover hidden gems...kinda thing goin on...SO...<br>Upon entry we discovered the place is a quaint diner image comfortableness ....really easy feeling.<br>We were seated immediately at the south west corner booth...great for people watching which never ceases to entertain me.<br>Our server Adrianna was a dream the entire visit...super friendly attentive relaxed and non invasive. <br>I ordered the Spinach /Feta 3 Egg omelette with a smoked Ham slice. Let me PLEASE tell you this Omelette was amazing..no brown dryness but instead moist generously filled greatness. Fresh not over cooked Spinach, wonderful salty melty cubes of good Feta...and the Ham was a meaty portion so I felt the additional cost was worth it...<br><br>NOW..my son..ordered the Traditional Eggs Benedict. This dish was sheer joy visually as well as palette pleasing. From the Hollandaise, obvious homemade..the crisp muffin base, the Real Canadian Bacon ...and thee PERFECT Poached Eggs Wow!!..nice to see this dish done right...that golden yolk cascaded when pierced and that H sauce had the perfect citrus note. Damn they are good here.<br>My meal was accompanied by thick delicately toasted fluffy bread, whipped butter (fresh)..and this amazing orange marmalade.Very tasty.<br><br>All in all a must recommendation from me to those of you searching for a great simple breakfast...good coffee..and also a selection of baked goods we did not indulge in...but maybe next time...<br>THX again to Adrianna...u were a great server and I do so hope to find Biscuits and Gravy on the menu soon as we discussed!!",

"reviewcomment":"Awesome breakfast! They have a giant menu, literally pages long, with everything from sweet and savory crepes, to waffles, to insanely delicious looking fruit salads, and so on. They even have a bar and I noticed an apple mimosa that caught my eye. I fully intend to try it next time. <br><br>Yelpers raved about the crepes so I already knew that&#39;s what I would be ordering. Good luck deciding which one because they all sound wonderful. I picked one called the Tempting Trio, made with strawberries, bananas, and nutella. It was the size of my head and under $6. I think I was able to eat a quarter of it before calling quits. You can&#39;t beat that much delicious for such a small amount. Would be a great place to share food with friends and try a little of everything without breaking the bank. <br><br>I also ordered a sugar free vanilla latte that was creamy and fabulous. You would never guess it was sugar free. This is one of the coolest breakfast spots I&#39;ve been to in the city. The inside is welcoming, and you leave in a high of sugar and caffeine. Is there any better way to start the morning?",

You&#39;re better than that and they are much better than that! <br><br>Try any dish in the main section (authentic dishes) of the menu and you will not be disappointed.",

"reviewcomment":"had dinner last thursday evening - first time since the revamp.  we use to be regulars at the pump room for dancing and cocktailing, more so than dining, for probably over the past 20 years.  i was pleasantly surprised by the interior design and completely loving the light installations - simply marvelous.  we had a 6:30 reservation and by about 8:30 or so the lights are dimmed so low it is hard to see.  a bit too extreme.  <br><br>service was ok - not good to great.  for one of a number of instances, we ordered a second round of single glasses of pinot noir, prior to our entrees, yet we did not receive the glasses until we had completed our entrees and were moving to dessert.  the waiter offered no &#34;recovery&#34; - did not apologize and did not pick up the inappropriately timed glasses of wine.  he went on like nothing was wrong even though we made mention, he did not react.  <br><br>the food however was very good and out shown the service and poor lighting.  the guacamole, flatbreads, calamari, tuna tartare are fabulous starters with excellent presentations.  our entrees as well were delicious:  lamb, salmon, chicken, special fish - again all excellent with very nice presentations.  our sides were satisfactory:  creamy mashed and french fried potatoes.  <br><br>The birthday girl had carrot cake for dessert and ate the whole piece!  She said it was very good and again the presentation was a winner.<br><br>For the culinary experience a 5, for decor a 4, ambiance a 3 and service a 3 has me averaging my stars to a 4.  expensive but good.  i would go back and hope the service improves.",

You can bring it over to Glascott&#39;s to eat while watching a sports game, or you can bring drinks from Glascott&#39;s over here nice set up.<br><br>We ordered the kalamata chicken which came with salad, bread, and fries. The chicken was perfectly broiled and very well seasoned. It was sitting on top of thick steak fries which were marinating in all of the lemon citrus. Yummmmm.

This in particular was recommended to me by a regular and I wasn&#39;t disappointed. <br><br>First of all, I was already excited because brunch is my favorite meal. The menu was traditional enough (all the omelets, pancakes, etc. that you&#39;d expect) but had creative twists. My eggs benedict were wonderful and perfectly portioned.

"reviewcomment":"I made a big mistake when I went to Old Town Social. I took a cursory glance at the menu before ordering sweet potato fries with a double of the balvenie, totally ignoring the fact that there was a BACKSIDE of the menu with all their cheese and charcuterie options, a separate menu with specials, and list of signature cocktails/beers. I ended up ordering the cheese curds as well (live to eat, right?) and never looked back.<br><br>Everything was delicious. I would definitely not have been sad even if I didn&#39;t get the cheese curds, as the sweet potato fries were great-- minimally greasy and the super smooth guacamole went along perfectly. But those cheese curds... yum. Definitely not like the mozzarella sticks &#34;cheese curd&#34; you get at some places.<br><br>They have big TVs playing the game which disappear into the bar after the game ended. The lights also dim post game, which provides a nice ambiance to chat.",

It is always busy - dates think I picked a great spot.<br>2. It&#39;s BYOB.  So I can drink lots of wine while I eat the yummy food.<br>3. The portions are HUGE.  For the price you pay, it is lunch or dinner for two days.<br>4. It is dimly lit.  I really really hate commercial lighting while I eat.  Plus, in that light I pass as attractive.<br>5. It&#39;s &#34;tucked away&#34;.  If you&#39;ve never been here, you&#39;d probably never even knew it existed.  Again, dates think I picked a great spot.<br>6. The tables are close together.  It feels very European.  European restaurant choice = I&#39;m cultured.  Dates love that.<br>7. There is bread, oil, and spices to eat while you wait for the food.<br>8. Service is super fast.  Even the most eloquent of dishes come out of the kitchen rapidly.<br>9. Amazingly friendly wait staff.<br>10. Great prices, great atmosphere, romantic if on a date - intimate if with friends.<br><br>I could go on and on about this place.  I like to order the pasta based dishes, because the pasta is so delicious.  At this point, I&#39;ve tried pretty much everything on the menu - can say that the chicken parm  is definitely my favourite.<br><br>The other thing I like is that my date always kisses me after we leave this place.  That is kinda hot.<br><br>If you too would liked to get kissed after a date - make a reservation at Caro Mio.  OR take me.  I usually put out.",

"reviewcomment":"BRUNCHED AS FUCK <br><br>this dark gem was something I stumbled upon after once again being let down by the sketchville murder bathrooms of Discount Mega Mall across the street. I&#39;ve never been to this place but had heard it&#39;s a best bar that has some neat food. WELL GUESS THE FUCK WHAT!?!? This place carried the best Chicken and Waffles I&#39;ve ever even laid my eyes on AND YOU KNOW I WAS BONED UP FROM THE FLOOR UP ON THIS ONE!!! My lady and I were greeted with &#34;seat yourself&#34; which I&#39;m such a sucker for. Sitting in a large booth enough room for 3 or 4 Big Mac Bradley&#39;s to sit in. I had this Southern Belle come up to our table and just BLAST US WITH THE REALITY OF OUR OPTIONS! And I tell you what, this place has options. BUT IT WAS DECIDED! CHIX WITH DIX WAS WHAT I WANTED and it BLEW ME AWAY! The food in itself could kill the 15 year old virgin wanna be Tom Delong in all of us and the service COULD MOW DOWN AN ENTIRE LINE OF SELF CONSCIOUS FAN GIRLS WAITING FOR THE ONE DIRECTION SIGNING WITH AN AK-47 of southern charm! I not only want to take future Craigslist casual encounters here, but also my grandparents! NOW YOU TELL ME A PLACE THAT DOES BOTH OF THOSE FOR YOU! I&#39;m excited to return for some drinks but I will continue to pursue their food with the animosity of an elk consumed by chronic wasting disease!",

"reviewcomment":"I really love this restaurant, the decoration is not like the traditional japanese restaurant, and they have a open kitchen in the center that you can see everything making by the chef. I went there with my friend, and the restaurant is busy, though we walk in around 8:30pm, there are only a few tables are avaliable, thanks we didn&#39;t need to wait for a long time to get a table at that time. <br>Since it was really busy, we couldn&#39;t find our waiter when we were ready to order (our waiter approach the table fast which is good), but I think it&#39;s reasonable, later when the a few tables left, our waiter and busers come back to check the tables more often, but he really make sure that every single dishes come to the table is good, which I think it&#39;s good. The buser who delivered the food to our table gave us a short introduciton of the dish.<br>Food are delicious!!! We ordered 3 appertizers, the beef tataki in cold and the scallop in hot are wonderful!! We also order the sashimi chef seletion, fish are fresh and taste well. And the wild mushroom with rice which is in the pot, we saw that most ot tables ordered too, smells and taste very good, and it&#39;s with some basil and sauce. For the dessert, we ordered two dessert, one is good and the other is beautiful, I prefer the green tea one...lol.... but I forgot the full name...<br>In conclusion, both service and food are good, probably we ordered the right things to try? Anyway, I would like to come back again :)",

Not only were we greeted right away but also got a table. <br>Usually most restaurants are in a hurry as they are getting ready to close. But Greg, our server treated us the same as if we were their first customers in the door. He made sure we had enough to drink and if we needed anything else to let him know. <br>Always a great place to eat anytime of the day!",

"reviewcomment":"Cafe El Tapatio is a neighborhood spot for me. I&#39;m lucky that way. I like that it&#39;s not a taco stand, nor is it a noisy chain. It&#39;s a cute, small, authentic joint with really fresh ingredients. When was the last time you went to a Mexican restaurant and were served field greens instead of iceberg? See what I mean? I&#39;m one lucky girll!<br><br>The chips are good as is the salsa. I dig the rice too. And I&#39;m picky about rice. I recommend their plantain enchiladas with mole. I like their shredded chicken enchiladas too. I&#39;ve not spotted any fatty dark meat hidden in them, which can be a real turn off. I will have to try their fish tacos sometime soon! Their red sauce is a bit sweet for me but it doesn&#39;t stop me from ordering them. <br><br>While it&#39;s a popular place, I&#39;ve yet to see a line. They have a good patio so pile your pals in the car and head to Lakeview for some solid Mexican food.",

"reviewcomment":"My boyfriend and I got a Groupon for Stanleys. The first time we tried to use it, we were basically turned away because the bar had converted into a Blackhawks hub. We went back - made sure no Chicago sports teams were playing - and had an amazing dinner in the dining area (which is separated from the bar).<br>Monday&#39;s special is build-your-own burgers, an option which a lot of the other diners seemed to go for. However, since neither of us eat burgers, it didn&#39;t appeal to us - even though they offer turkey burger and chicken breast as alternate options. My boyfriend got a triple decker grilled cheese (which in my opinion looked pretty pedestrian, but which he enjoyed). I got the mac and cheese appetizer (which was enormous and delicious) and the pulled pork sandwich, which came with an apple slaw. The pulled pork was enormous and really really good - the best I&#39;ve had outside of Memphis. *Disclaimer - we ordered this much food because we were trying to use a $30 Groupon*<br>The meal ended up coming to 30.77 with tax (we got a beer to push it over the edge) so we got amazing value (even if we hadn&#39;t used a groupon) for the meal. We ended up taking the mac and cheese to go since it was too much to eat there.<br>Would definitely recommend for families or couples. If you are alone or want a more casual experience, the bar is nice as well. The lighting was great - not too dim, not too bright - and it was quiet enough that we could have a nice conversation.",

"reviewcomment":"Ok, so we were actually headed to Nomi in the Park Hyatt, but after driving by Ditka&#39;s, we couldn&#39;t pass it up for our 1 night in Chicago.<br><br>I had the Prime NY Strip, and it was pretty good. Not Mastro&#39;s good, but still pretty good. Cooked to the right temp (med rare +), with good flavor. Iceberg wedge was cold and crisp. Cheesecake again paled in comparison to Mastro&#39;s, but still good.<br><br>But, the real surprise was the ambiance. Sports memorabilia tastefully decorates the interior, avoiding turning it into a sports bar. A great Sinatra/Johnny Cash/Elvis lounge singer with a great sense of humor really completed the picture. It was fun.<br><br>Come here for the total experience - not to mention that you can&#39;t pass up Iron Mike&#39;s place when in Chicago, can you?",

"reviewcomment":"Jane&#39;s is a super cute and quaint restaurant that&#39;s perfect for a girls night out session. I&#39;ve tried a couple of dishes here and my favorite is the Housemade Quinoa Vegetable Garden Burger with sauteed mushrooms. Yea I know what you&#39;re thinking - quinoa vegetable burger?? I was surprised myself but for a vegetarian burger, this is hands down the best. Tasty and fresh, no guilt whatsoever and unlike any other burger you&#39;ve ever eaten. Jane&#39;s is also known for their corn chowder but it&#39;s not my favorite. It was too milky and the consistency wasn&#39;t thick enough for me. For dessert I highly recommend the Apple Oatmeal Crisp and Creme Brulee. <br><br>I also know that they switch out menu items based on seasons so the desserts may or may not be on the menu when you get there. Also, be sure to call and make a reservation so you don&#39;t have to wait. They are quite busy on Fridays and weekends.",

"reviewcomment":"I have to admit, a name that says &#34;Go 4 Food&#34; sounds kind of cheesy and made me think this place would just be another Americanized Asian food joint.  When I finally got down here this weekend, I soon discovered this was not some crappy, cheesy Americanized joint, although they do indeed serve that crap if you order it.  I almost felt like I was going to puke looking at the orange chicken crap the people at the table next to us ordered, along with the other Americanized crap dishes they got.  Ugh!  If you go to Chinatown do not order crap like Orange Chicken, Mongolian beef, sweet and sour chicken, blah that is Americanized crap you can get at any shitty Asian food place in a strip mall.<br>When we went here, we had three dishes, one of them was the main reason I came here which is their crispy chicken.  I saw a photo on here and fell in love with the looks of it.   The crispy chicken was the number 1 lure that drew me to come here, I just had a good feeling about it.<br>When we arrived, we looked inside and I saw no seating in this very small restaurant.  I said forget it let&#39;s go elsewhere, because I did not feel like waiting, my brother said no let&#39;s try it, so I agreed.  When we entered we were greeted within seconds and we were led down a flight of stairs, oh my I had no idea there was a lower level!  The downstairs area was a boring tiny banquet looking area with a TV.  It was pretty stuffy down there too.  The waiter was extremely friendly and began to describe in details some of the specials, and exactly the spices used to make the items and how it is cooked, it made me drool hearing the descriptions, so we ended up ordering two of those dishes, well played waiter!  We ordered the &#34;tacos&#34; which I can&#39;t remember the exact name, but I provided a pic so you can just show the staff what I am talking about, they can ID pics, they IDed my crispy chicken by pic.  We also ordered the French Style Beef Terderloin, and of course a whole crispy chicken (which is usually served as a half order).<br>We first got the French Style Beef Terderloin, and it was amazing, the meat was so tender and delicious and it was served with onions and two halves of tomatoes.  Next came the tacos and I can say is, holy flavor explosion!!!  The contents was small strips of meat mixed in with vegetables and spices, and it packed a huge flavor punch.  The waiter told us we were getting 4 tacos, well I did not expect 4 soft pouches that you can load a huge serving of the filling.  The pouches were soft, fresh and delicious and were able to hold alot of filling.  I was on cloud 9 with this dish because of the combination of the delicious soft &#34;taco&#34; pouches and the amazing filling.  I very very highly recommend you order this, trust me it&#39;s damn good!<br>Last we had the crispy chicken which tasted just like how I imagined, crispy goodness, and they had to fry it while cooking.  <br>I highly recommend this place, the food is really damn good and they really try to please their customers!",

"reviewcomment":"First off...if you&#39;re here to complain about the pricing take a seat.  You&#39;re in River North/Near North...wh You&#39;re going to a club that happens to serve food (delicious food).  Its going to be pricey, most establishments in this category are in this neighborhood.  If you didn&#39;t know that going into it, or couldn&#39;t tell this by how the place looks, that&#39;s your fault for being ignorant on the places you choose to try out.  Maybe try and do a little research if you really have no clue as to what you&#39;re getting into. All pricing is available on their website, try downloading the menu...<br><br>Anyways, its a really cool place.  Speakeasy themed.  HUGE place and they have a great stage/entertainment area. They have a larger dining room and a &#34;Library&#34; with cushy booths and couches to spend the night drinking.  They music could be quieter in the Library and dining room, at the very least during dinner hours. It does make conversation a little labor intensive. <br><br>The food is delicious!  This is not your &#34;burger and fries&#34; joint, it has some things on the menu that aren&#39;t common in what you might eat on a daily basis, but it&#39;s definitely delicious and worth a try.  They encourage sharing among the table, as thats how things are plated.  Food also comes out as it is prepared, rather than as a whole table all at once. Although you can order as individuals, I would recommend sharing a few plates among the table. If you order as individual meals, don&#39;t expect everything to come out all at once.<br><br>Give it a try.  Its a great place.  The selection they have of food and booze is great and the atmosphere is great fun!<br><br>Also, ask for Kyle as a server!  Super incredibly knowledgeable and LOTS of fun. Makes the experience well worth it!",

"reviewcomment":"Shocker! I went here for a bachelorette party! When I went on a Friday night around 10pm, it was all women in attendance throughout the Kit Kat Lounge. This is a place bachelorette parties, birthday parties and just groups of women in general come to let loose. <br><br>With our package, we got a tray full of delicious desserts plus 2 drinks each. The dessert tray was comprised of cupcakes, pies &amp; cake slices and rest assured we devoured it all. They have more martini options than I think I&#39;ve ever seen in my life. A lot of them were really creative and cool. The Lady Gaga comes with a glowstick! It really doesn&#39;t get better than that for a bunch of drunken bachelorette party girls. There&#39;s also a Reese&#39;s Peanut Butter Cup martini with a little peanut butter cup in it. They know what girls like!<br><br>The performers are divine! Seriously they get their groove on and are fabulous at involving the audience. Bring your dollah bills y&#39;all and show your gratitude for the hardworking ladies! My only gripe was we were there for three performances (they happened on the hour for about 15 minutes) and it was the same lady for all 3 performances. I would have liked to see a bit more variety.<br><br>Some kind of strange porn or something is playing on the walls throughout. All the servers were very nice and super quick, plus accommodating in letting us switch tables. <br><br>Pro-Tip: You want a seat in the front half of the lounge, that&#39;s where all the action goes down.",

"reviewcomment":"My favorite sandwich shop in the Loop. I like to take my sandwich to go over to Millennium park to enjoy and get out of the office for a little while. I love the Blue Pig and Fig and the Sinfully Healthy sandwiches. I&#39;ve also had their catering- Salad as well as cheese spread, and it is fantastic. We order it when we have clients in that we are trying to impress. <br><br>I recommend calling your order in ahead of time- (312) 658-1250 and it will be ready to pickup as soon as you get there. Pay when you pick it by going to the register closer to the windows and you can get in/out in 5 minutes. You can call in anything from one sandwich orders to a large catering bill. <br><br>Don&#39;t forget to grab a  sample of the garlic olives, it&#39;s no wonder they let you sample them for free, they are so good you won&#39;t be able to help yourself from buying a whole pound.",

"reviewcomment":"I came to Silver Cloud last week for trivia and had a great experience.<br><br>Their Thursday night special is an $8 beer flight. I was really glad I ordered it and got to sample some beers that I normally would not have ordered or tried. It was also an awesome value for the price, I&#39;d highly recommend taking advantage of it if you like beer and are here on a Thursday.<br><br>I was not super hungry but wanted to try something on their menu (everything looked great) so I splurged and went with the Frito Pie. It was delicious and I really enjoyed their chili.<br><br>The ambiance and service at Silver Cloud also have to be mentioned. It is the perfect combination of bar and restaurant and I felt at home as soon as I walked in. It&#39;s a cozy place but the tables are spread far enough apart where you don&#39;t feel to cramped. Our waitress (wish I could get her name) was also stellar and took great care of us. <br><br>Definitely a fan of Silver Cloud and hope to be back soon.",

"reviewcomment":"First off, I&#39;m a Sushi SNOB and have eaten at so many sushi spots. KYOTO...IS....are you listening?? Kyoto is the BEST place in ILLINOIS for Sushi. Point blank. I have never had sushi as close to the freshness and deliciousness as Kyoto offers.<br><br>I went for my first time a few years ago with a current BF and we had a Groupon. We walked in and they just opened so it wasn&#39;t busy. They suggested we sit by the sushi bar since it was out first time there. Now I&#39;m a chef so I heard there were two brothers who make these creations. Carlo and Melvin were making sushi right in front of us...what a great time. They were sooo sweet and gave us some free tastings of a few rolls since they heard it was our first time there. I think we tried the Spicy Snowball, Dynamite, Eight Ball, and something else. We were ALREADy impressed. <br><br>Though we love sushi I have a small stomach. But we loooove Spicy and had our sights on the Spicy Boat. Spicy Boat ($65) includes: Fireball, Spicy Tuna Tataki, Fiesta, Spicy Shrimp Tempura, Dynamite, Spicy Cruinchy Salmon. We get this EVERY TIME. This review would be a million paragraphs if I described each roll. Just say I have never had a roll where I could taste EVERY SINGLE ingredient in EVERY roll. I was just blown away. The flavors pop in your mouth, fish is so fresh, and it&#39;s actually spicy (I&#39;m also a spice freak). I got a piece of Sake, Maguro, Super White Tuna, and Tako Nigiri. All fresh and delicious. We were going to order an appetizer but were told we were ordering a lot. They are always right. I got 2-3 pieces of Nigiri and the Boat and I ususally bring 8-15 pieces home, And man-o-man the sushi the next day tatses like you just got in fresh (shows that they use great fish).<br><br>I am DYING to try the Creamy Roll Since I looove Avocado but am alwayts stuck with the Spicy Boat. But sometime soon. The place is a little expensive yes...but I go 2-3 times a year and indulge in every piece of sushi when I&#39;m eating. The atmosphere is relaxed, the staff is great. They even gave us a free Creme Brulee for my mom&#39;s birthday when she came in from NY for her birthday. Sooo sweet :)<br><br>Period; if you want the best and the freshest sushi EVER...go to Kyoto. You will NOT regret it.",

"reviewcomment":"Was in Chicago for a week with my daughter and she decided she wanted to try a different pizza restaurant every day.  Not the healthiest week, but a lot of walking and we were on vacation....lucked into flo and santos when we were walking toward the end of the day and we found them on yelp a few blocks away.  Unusual dual specialties of pierogi and pizza, but we love both so we ordered the pierogi sampler and a pizza.  Fantastic pierogi and maybe even better thin crust pizza!  I had a couple<br>Local beers--skipped the vodka flight, but they have an impressive array of the spirit.<br><br>The final endorsement:  my daughter a few days later asked to go back rather than adding another pizza restaurant to her quest.  The thin crust was not what I would normally expect in Chicago, but our favorite of the five restaurants we had pizza from that week.<br><br>Great atmosphere, great food (only had the pierogi and pizza, though).  Have recommended to a few other groups visiting Chicago and all have loved it.  Definitely a neighborhood restaurant worth visiting!",

The atmosphere is warm, the service is great and the food is fantastic.  Plus it&#39;s a BYOB.  I&#39;m glad I tried this Andersonville gem.",

"reviewcomment":"Once upon a time, hubby and I ate out like it was nobody&#39;s business. We were real professional eaters. Then one day he decided he wanted to &#39;help people&#39; and so he quit his lucrative job in management consulting and enrolled in medical school. Whaaa?!? Yeah, this was the worst thing that ever happened to my stomach and to our travel life! Living on one pay check, we cut back seriously. <br><br>2 yrs later I got promoted at work! And then turned 30! So BellyQ was the first place I wanted to take my paycheck to and live it up like we used to. We ordered off the menu like it was 2012. The server had to tell us it was too much and we really should take some items off. If he only knew us back in the day... <br><br>Sad to say that we ate like n00bs. It was shameful. We got so full off the appetizers we took back a doggie back that fed us for dinner the next night. We were so full we couldn&#39;t even have our typical 2nd dinner before bed.  But...happy to report that everything was aaaamazing! <br><br>My favorite starter was the chilled soba noodles. Not what I was expecting. The soba noodles were kind of tangy, woozy in the sauce? The shrimp was cooked so well! And you just can&#39;t go wrong with garlicky eggplant!<br><br>I also loved the chickpea hush puppies. I popped those suckers into our toaster the next morning. The sauce had solidified like butter, I liked it even better! I saved the rest for some naan for later!<br><br>I liked the braised rib pancake, but what really stood out was the braised rib. I wish I could just have a bowl full of braised rib + rice + kimchi. I could eat that every day for the rest of my life.  <br><br>For the main course we got the tea smoked duck and the wagyu short ribs. I love anything tea smoked. The duck had the essence of orange that gave it a tangy flavor to the meat and the chinese broccoli. They put something on the chinese broccoli. Idk what. But I loved it. Next time I&#39;m going to ask for a full order of that broccoli. Wagyu short ribs were solid. melt in your mouth. sweet. salty. grilled. <br><br>None of the dishes at BellyQ or UrbanBelly are straight forward. They&#39;re very thoughtful and different. It&#39;s like the grad school of food. There are times when it went over my head (tongue). But then the more you think about it the more it makes sense, the more you want. Then you get mad at your prior education, what was everyone teaching me before?!?",

"reviewcomment":"The host seating us was a bit out there.  I&#39;m guessing because its Good Friday, so some folks likely wont be out to eat/drink like a typical Friday factored into the reason for the host acting as weird as he did.  The host was aloof and kind of disinterested.  First he told me and a friend he had a table, then he said 30 minute wait a minute later, then 15 minute wait a minute after.  After about 5 minutes and confusion/guessing what he was going to tell us next, we finally got seated.<br><br>From then on, it was excellence.  My friend got the fish and chips and me the Irish breakfast plate.  Excellent black pudding, better than most Irish/English breakfasts at other restaurants I&#39;ve sampled.  Great beer and great food prices for a restaurant in a trendy area, though plenty of foot traffic inside.  Comes with the territory though.<br><br>Will definitely be back.",

I loved the large bites of the tofu tempura.   <br><br>We split four rolls that were all quite good, but by far my favorite was the Fire Cracker - shrimp, eel, cucumber, avocado, cream cheese, spicy tobiko, jalapeno - rolled an deep fried.  So good!  I could have eaten the entire thing myself. <br><br>Prices are fair, portions are average/generous, and it&#39;s just always good.  See ya soon Oysy!",

The different flavors are delicious and I loved the queso fresco in the soup. It&#39;s not a creamy soup, which i thought was nice and made it lighter. <br><br>The Italian sausage flatbread was also delicious. The ingredients are very fresh. It&#39;s definitely big enough to order for your own entree or you could share it with a group. <br><br>I was stuffed when I was finished! The only thing was that our waiter was not very outgoing, but other than that I was satisfied.",

Who doesn&#39;t like to dance along with Soultrain?!?<br>I have also been here for lunch on a summer day and dined in the front on I guess you would say patio, I say front sidewalk lol. Food was good but service was a bit slow. So slow that we nearly just walked away because we were waiting forever but you know what Rodan, I still got a love for you.

The vibe is perfect for a girls night out or romantic with your hunny, or even just a place to grab a drink with a friend. Regardless, the cute waiters always make you feel comfortable and welcome.<br><br>The menu is superb as well, haven&#39;t eaten anything that wasn&#39;t perfect:<br>* Arancini (amazing!)<br>* Herb and Artichoke Pizza (so fresh)<br>* Crispy Brussel Sprouts (maybe my favorite)<br>* Wild Mushroom Risotto (so good)<br>* Roasted Cauliflower Garganelli (very light)<br>* Tuscan Mac and Cheese (love the cheese and it&#39;s just the right amount)<br>* Peanut Butter pie (slice of heaven and I don&#39;t even like PB that much)<br>* Chocolate cake (so yummy)<br><br>And their martini&#39;s come with a sidecar which is not just super cute but really makes the $12 price more than worth it!<br><br>Going to make this my go-to spot during the summer when their sidewalk opens up.",

"reviewcomment":"Three words &#34;worth the attitude&#34; its very hard to choose a first yelp review but I probably wouldn&#39;t think twice about picking Schwa.. Now I know, people will tell you that the service can be hit or miss and they will cancel on you randomly, its a pain to get a reservation etc. Etc.  But who hasn&#39;t gone through worse for some good food, and to add to that they have a great story (look it up). Anyways, went here with my significant other on our second  anniversary and am so glad that we called on a whim the night before and got a reservation for the next day. <br>The restaurant is BYOB (bonus) we decided to ask for recommendations by email and they responded. After eating there I suggest wine a nice chardonnay and maybe a French Red or Russian valley pinot noir-nothing too heavy. <br>The place is a bit hard to find and you will definitely feel like you&#39;re in the wrong place but don&#39;t worry... Walk in. When we came in one of the servers asked if we needed anything and one look at our bottle of Jameson( for the kitchen) and he knew we belonged. Its a pretty small restaurant about 8 tables just enough to have a conversation with your neighbor  but not too crowded that you can&#39;t enjoy your meal. <br>And now the creme de LA creme the FOOD... Very rarely are there tastings menus that we have liked everything - this was one of those nights! Every course was well thought out elegantly played and the progression was just right.  Some of the memorable dishes of the night for me the Thai soup course the dr. Pepper dessert and the of course the quail egg ravioli. They may seem casual but know this these guys are extremely talented chefs. Probably one of the best meals in Chicago.",

"reviewcomment":"Let me start by saying that I HATE sandwiches. I always think there&#39;s too much bread, not enough flavor, too much meat, I don&#39;t like eating with my hands, and overall I never think the idea of eating a sandwich is appetizing. Last time I decided to order sandwiches for the office, I got some brie and duck breast sandwiches.... and I don&#39;t think people responded well-- I honestly think they would have rather had Jimmy John&#39;s or Potbelly&#39;s-- which again is the type of sandwiches I don&#39;t want to eat. <br><br>So I decided to give it another try and ordered some Hannah&#39;s Bretzel--- and it was a hit. We actually ran out of food and I had to get some pizza from a nearby restaurant to feed the monsters. The bretzel is soooo damn good. That is a type of bread that I enjoy eating. One of my directors was raving about Sergio&#39;s Special-- which is pretty good, I have to admit. <br><br>I only wish I had the chance to try one of each sandwich I ordered--- too many options. Only thing is these sandwiches are a bit on the pricier side... and the portions are smaller than you would expect from other sandwich shops.<br><br>Also, not so impressed with the desserts there. I would definitely get more bretzel sandwiches though! Who doesn&#39;t like pretzel bread?",

During happy hour, the appetizers are all $5, so all told, our food only rang up to like $15.<br><br>Of course, we made up the difference by getting a ton of beer--and they have a decent beer menu. It&#39;s not the best I&#39;ve ever seen, but I was able to try some beers I hadn&#39;t had before (in particular, the Innis and Gunn oak-aged was pretty tasty).<br><br>The thing I liked the best about Fado, though, is the ambience.

"reviewcomment":"The place is tucked away on w. Chicago ave <br>So when you walk in, you feel like you&#39;ve found the hidden gem where everyone gets there fix for good Japanese (influenced) cuisine. The place was packed on a night where most restaurants in the neighborhood were dead (Tuesday). And we knew because we visited 3 others restaurants that night. <br><br>We had a bottle of DY 50, a junmai daiginjo (I believe). I&#39;ve enjoyed it before so I wasn&#39;t disappointed. <br><br>Next the uni shooters. Heaven. From start to finish, it&#39;s a wonderful experience. They didn&#39;t get tuna that day so we missed out on the toro tartar bites but I will just have to go back for that. <br><br>I ordered the tonkotsu ramen and my friend the arami ramen. The arami ramen was nice. It had beef and pork belly and the broth was light, yet with a good meaty flavor. However, the tonkotsu stole the show. Talk about umami. Savory with so much flavor and the right amount of salt. The noodles were great. Good &#34;spring&#34; to them and the broth clung to them nicely. I felt guilty because I didn&#39;t completely finish it. Though we did have appetizers at a different restaurant so I was already half full. Next time, I will devour it. <br><br>Service was great. Minus a little mishap from the busser who knocked over some of my sake while filling my glass of water. But not a big deal. Server was friendly and explained everything as she dropped the food and stopped by just enough. And our water glasses never got empty. <br><br>Decor is great. Simple, cozy, almost like an urban den (whatever that means). <br><br>I totally understand why it was so full on a cold Tuesday night.",

My main rolls are spicy tuna and Alaskan salmon. I order these rolls at almost every sushi place I eat. I also order miso soup at almost every place I go. <br>The rolls were perfect. Fresh, sweet, perfectly sized and they give you 8 rolls instead of 6!  I ordered them during lunch so they were 1/2 the price. <br>Miso was good but nothing extraordinary. Portion size was slightly larger than average for takeout and I also got 10% off when ordering online as a first time customer. Seriously so convenient, so good.",

The clear favorite was the gnocchi, which was phenomenal followed by the scallops that were perfectly cooked with a nice sear on the surface. <br><br>The drink list was also interesting, yet a little on the sweet side. The wine list was pretty good as well. The desserts on the other hand was a little underwhelming in contrast to the food we had before the chocolate dessert that we had. <br><br>Nonetheless, I believe I would return again with a group of friends, but I would not order the dessert.",

"reviewcomment":"Upscale Italian in Andersonville. Anteprima is just a few miles from where I live, and I have been meaning to check it out for ages based on recommendations from friends and neighbors. We sat down around 6pm last Friday night and started out with some cocktails, which were delicious but not very strong and on the pricey side at $12 each. The three of us shared two appetizers that were on the specials list, chicken livers and fava beans. Very good but skimpy on the quantity for the price. For our main dishes we ordered the &#34;large&#34; portions of the mushroom gnocchi (average), the ricotta and pea ravioli (delicious) and the orecchiette with lamb sausage (delicious). The &#34;large&#34; portions were just about right for an average appetite, which is nice, because I tend to overeat if it&#39;s in front of me. The bread and breadsticks served were high quality. Service was professional, helpful and friendly.<br><br>I really hated to complain a bit about the prices because I&#39;m sure the quality is top notch, and the dining experience is really enjoyable. In reality, I think if the prices were lower it would be close to impossible to get a table here. We will come back, maybe skip the cocktails and go out to Hopleaf before or after (or both!). We got free parking a couple blocks away on a side street.",

Yes, I stand by my statement above. <br><br>Before I even get to the food, the two waiters here were a complete joy. They joked around with us, delivered the food quickly, and didn&#39;t even have to write our orders down. Yes, I tipped extra. <br><br>Grub:<br>Ernesto&#39;s Chilaquiles ($8.95).

"reviewcomment":"How in the hell did I live in walking distance of this place for 4 years and never been inside???<br><br>I was invited here by a friend yesterday that told me the place was a great option for pizza and beer. I like thin crust and good beer so I was like hell yeah. This place is great as you have to go downstairs as everyone has mentioned to a dungeon like atmosphere. It is very dim lit and has a nice, but romantic charm to it.<br>Due to it being Tuesday, they were having a half off bottle of wine special. Beer took a backseat as my dining companion beat me there and already ordered a bottle of pinot noir which was very good.<br><br>We got to choose our own table as it was a pretty light crowd at first...the place definitely filled up after we got our seats. We decided we wanted more than one flavor so we went with a half &amp; half pizza. We decided on the Painful (spicy pepperoni purple onion, fresh jalapeno, garlic, tomato sauce and mozzarella) and the Sweet Heat (chicken breast, bacon, diced jalapeno, smoked gouda, bbq-tomato sauce and mozzarella). The Sweet Heat was a good balance of sweet &amp; spicy while the Painful was slightly spicy...we enjoyed both!<br><br>I look forward to returning here to sample more pizza and to try the beer list.",

"reviewcomment":"I&#39;ve been to the Chicago Chop House twice now while visiting from out of town and have had excellent meals and service both times. I selected the restaurant for my three friends so they would get an excellent dining experience and they were not disappointed. Our server and sommelier were very personable and attentive.<br><br>I had the Grand Cut (about 12 oz) filet and it was cooked to perfection. The meat was tender and practically melted in my mouth. <br><br>The ambience of the place is lively, with the best dining experience on the third floor where the quarters are a little more intimate than the open second floor.<br><br>Make reservations when you can, otherwise you might have to wait a long time to get a seat. You will pay a premium for the food, but it&#39;s a slightly better value than Morton&#39;s and you will have a more pleasurable dining experience eating in a piece of history that survived the Great Chicago Fire of 1871.",

If you get the food hot it&#39;s awesome, if you get it lukewarm(which is 50/50 from them) its below average..So I&#39;m always in a constant battle with hunger on where to order from since the temperature of your food is up in the air..<br><br>However, the last time I ordered from them it was great, sausage and green peppers is the way to go, BBQ chicken pizza is not..

He was attentive and personable, the perfect combination. All I can hope for is that there is a little consistency on the part of the staff at Broadway Cellars and then I could give it a perfect review!<br><br>Do yourself a favor and make a reservation for Brunch... hope that everybody is in a good mood when you go!",

And boy was I happy that I did so. <br><br>I came for dinner and was on a low carb kick so I tried their tandoori pesh kash appetizer as a meal and it was perfect. None of the meat items were dry, though tandoori chicken sometimes can be, and their variety was excellent. I did not miss the rice and naan at all, though I remember their naan being quite good and it is usually my favorite thing to order at an Indian restaurant. My dinner companion had a great experience as well. The service was polite and attentive and the decor was comfortable and beautiful. And they passed my biggest test of strong flavored places: I did not smell of Indian food afterwards! Bravo Indian Garden, I will be back again and again and again...",

"reviewcomment":"Nestled in between Le Peep and Panera is this  gem of a Southern restaurant.  My friend recommended this place since she lives in Evanston.  A small band of us decided to head over here and give this place a try.  It&#39;s a quaint little restaurant, that has a nice country feel to it. <br><br>My eyes zoomed immediately to the fried chicken. A part of me did want to try the country steak, luckily someone else ordered it and I was able to have a taste.  We started off with the hush puppies, and it was damn delicious!  I was salivating with anticipation for my fried chicken...and finally the moment of truth.<br><br>This is the quintessential fried chicken. The crunch of the first bite. The flavor, and the tender white meat. This was an absolutely awesome fried chicken.  This place gets 5 stars from me just from the first bite alone.  I also got to sample the Country steak, and it was also worthy of praise.<br><br>I love going to places like this. I am sure glad my friend recommended. I feel like I owe her some money, just for telling about this place. It was that damn good. Head on over <br>and get you grub-a-dub on!!!",

"reviewcomment":"Yum! There are only two reasons Havana doesn&#39;t get 5 stars from me. 1st is their house mojito and second was my dessert. That aside I immensely enjoyed my meal here tonight. I ordered the Ropa Vieja which is shredded flank steak cooked in garlic, bell peppers, and other spices. I don&#39;t care for bell peppers so I was a little skeptical but you can&#39;t taste them at all. It&#39;s simply super tender and incredibly flavorful beef. It came with white rice, black beans, and sweet plantains. I could eat this meal everyday and never get tired of it.<br><br>We started with their house mojitos and they were too bitter for me. That&#39;s usually my favorite drink, but they were so sour one sip made both my husband and I pucker our lips. Maybe try a flavored kind there. Those might be less harsh. <br><br>There was a free dessert yelp check in offer and the only thing we both agreed on from being stuffed was the strawberries in cream. I don&#39;t know what they make the cream out of but when I took a bite all I tasted was rancid milk. Almost like when you smell spoiled mayo. My husband ate the whole thing and enjoyed it so maybe something in my palate just wasn&#39;t playing nice tonight. Either way you need to eat here. The food was delicious",

"reviewcomment":"Pretty good for cheap Chinese takeout, which Chicago is sorely lacking. I got the sesame chicken, which was plentiful for the price and tasty. <br><br>My complaint though is that they charged $1.50 extra for asking for white and brown rice, even though I said I wanted only a little of each. The rice, like from most cheap Chinese takeouts, was of very low quality, and I ended up throwing most of it away. Annoying when I had to pay extra for it.",

Service is pretty good but on the night we went they apparently had a couple large groups and they admitted they were very slow getting food out as a result. It was nice of them to let us know/admit it ahead of us saying something but wasn&#39;t too great when they brought our food out piecemeal over a span of 5-10 mins.<br><br>All in all though a pretty good place that I would come back to. Had a nice bar area with TVs. Could go for a nice dinner or a bit more of a casual one.",

I&#39;m talking about tender that you don&#39;t often find with any cut of beef but a filet mignon. Good flavor, but it needed some more.  I was really looking for that flavor experience instead, the sausage just overwhelmed it.<br>Now, you can&#39;t have a great sandwich without great bread, and they have it.<br>So as I make my round of great Italian beef places, look for my reviews elsewhere.<br>50+ years an Italian beef aficionado.",

"reviewcomment":"I have lived down the street from The Chicago Firehouse for several years now and always meant to take a trip there, and I am happy I finally did, it is a wonderful space. I, myself, am I firefighter, which makes it even more odd (in my eyes) that I never made it to the restaurant. <br><br>Walking in was really neat for me, because you can still sort of tell where everything had been when the place was used as a firehouse many years ago. I spent the first half hour looking up and around, pointing things out to my fiancee about the house and where things would have been and where the guys would have lived and what not. I felt like a fake tour guide, talking about a place, that really, I knew absolutely nothing about. I was just talking about what I imagined it would have been like. Long story short, I loved the feel of the place and the decor! (Including the old school tin ceiling).<br><br>I can&#39;t remember what my fiancée ate, but I know I had steak. You don&#39;t go to a place that is know for it&#39;s steak and don&#39;t get the steak! It was pretty good. I&#39;m a medium rare guy, but I would say the steak was definitely more medium to medium-well than anything, which dried it out a little bit and made it slightly tougher to chew. It&#39;s the only reason I took off a star. I&#39;m sure that it doesn&#39;t happen often that a steak is slightly overcooked, I was just one of the unlucky few!<br><br>I really enjoyed our server, I can&#39;t remember her name off the top of my head, I just remember her having COMPLETE knowledge of the menu and a wonderful personality. There wasn&#39;t a time she came to the table and didn&#39;t leave us giggling about something, she was just about as nice as a server could be.<br><br>All in all, go here, it&#39;s a great place with a great history!",

First stopping at the Chicago Ave location. Picking up a Potato and Leek. Then went to the Broadway shop and got the Thick &amp; Rich bacon and potato and of course the White Cheddar and Broc. Got home and made my own blend. All I can say is, why didn&#39;t I get 2 of each?!?! If you&#39;re visiting or live here and haven&#39;t been I highly recommend you go. Whenever we have company in from out of town, first stop is Soupbox and second is Montis! You guys make this soup guy very happy!!! Thanks again for the years of getting me through illnesses, cold days, and just plain hunger!!<br><br>Oh and IMHO you have to try, when they have it, Cream of Asparagus, broccoli, white cheddar and the thick and rich potato! <br><br>#NomNomNomNomNom",

"reviewcomment":"I saw Thao Nguyen perform here on a Friday night.  It&#39;s definItely a plus that you get reserved seats and can arrive early to settle in and eat/drink.  Parking is tough to find directly in front but there are plenty of spaces if you don&#39;t mind walking. As for the space itself, it&#39;s great for a restaurant and OK for a show.  I had a seat in back, and couldn&#39;t decide if it was better or worse than being inches from the stage, since they didn&#39;t seem the most comfortable.  Thao herself mentioned that she would have shaved her legs if she knew people would be sitting that close!  <br><br>The staff was friendly and had some good food and wine recommendations.  The prices were what you&#39;d expect: kind of high, but the quality of the food and drink are high so you don&#39;t mind so much.  All in all, I liked it!",

"reviewcomment":"Highly recommended, with caveats. Anyway, onto my (currently quite current!) review.<br><br>Yesterday as King Joffrey had a piece of his wedding pie, he lamented that it was quite dry. Well clearly that pie was not from the Westeros version of Pleasant House (probably owned by Hot Pie, Arya&#39;s baker friend). Anyway, then he drank some wine and stuff hit the fan.<br><br>Pleasant House is a simple spot that does a couple things and does them well. Those things are savory meat (or mushroom/kale) pies with delicious buttery crusts. They also have some fries, gravy/cheese/meat fries, scotch eggs, and peas. Those are all good, but the star is the pies. If you don&#39;t like pies, you probably don&#39;t want to go here. They have some special nights, like burger or fish fry. And while those are good, they are not significantly better than what you could get elsewhere. <br><br>(rant begins)<br>Despite what everyone who lives in Chicago says about it, Chicago is a lacking food city, especially given its size. Most things you can get here (aside from deep dish), are equal or better elsewhere. The vaunted italian beef looks like soggy garbage next to a good cheesesteak. Occasionally you will hear some person talk about some trip somewhere and how they found some little shop somewhere that sold the most amazing little whatevers. Inclusion in these stories is what Chicago lacks. (rant ends)<br><br>Pleasant House smashes this glass ceiling (I guess it&#39;s a glass house) with savory pies. Bravo.<br><br>My only complaint is that one pie is not enough for me, and two seems gluttonous. Lately I&#39;ve been fixing this by getting the deluxe fries as well, but I wish they had a bigger pie. Potbelly&#39;s used to have this problem too, but then they introduced the Large size. I suspect a larger pie would have different ratios of things, and that is why they don&#39;t do it.",

Our waitress was extremely knowledgeable and knew just what to suggest and what to pair with our entrees and drinks.<br><br>We started with the calamari and spicy mayo which was fantastic. I never like the squid-y looking ones so was happy there were some of the regular circular ones to choose from. The spicy mayo really hit the spot on this.<br><br>I tried a bowl of their red pepper soup which sadly wasn&#39;t that great, was super oily and I couldn&#39;t even eat all of it because I had to keep wiping the oil off my mouth. It was tasty but really, lay off that oil!<br><br>For my entrée I had crusted halibut which I believe was a special, boy was it amazing! Brought me right back to my honeymoon in Hawaii with how fresh that fish was. I couldn&#39;t stop eating it. Both my husband and our friend ordered a filet which looked so tasty and I don&#39;t even eat meat! We ordered a side of asparagus and a side of au gratin potatoes. Amazing, amazing. Shout out to our waitress for recommending those as sides to perfect our meal.<br><br>Once our waitress learned we were celebrating our friend&#39;s birthday she brought out a chocolate mousse with a candle in it for him, so cute and thoughtful. We also ordered the carrot cake which was out of this world.<br><br>Going to miss this place and hope its replacement keeps the staff on board.",

"reviewcomment":"The food is a solid 4 stars but the service elevates it to a 5. <br><br>I&#39;ve been here a few times with my parents and I really enjoyed the atmosphere and dining experience. It&#39;s definitely old school, dim lighting, vineyard theme in one room, there&#39;s even intimate seating tucked away for a private romantic date. <br><br>The three of us recently dined here for my husband&#39;s birthday. I made reservations for a Thursday night, 7pm, but I don&#39;t think it was necessary. It was busy, but we could have easily just walked in and probably been seated relatively quickly. The clientele is mixed. There&#39;s definitely an older crowd, but the night we dined there was some young families with kids, some young couples and some gals enjoying Girls Night Out. <br><br>The menu is pretty big; lots of appetizers to choose from. There&#39;s pasta, steak, seafood and a nice sized wine list as well. Most of the entrees come with soup, salad, pasta or potato. So between that and the complementary pizza bread and Italian bread that&#39;s brought to the table, one could eat really well AND have leftovers like we did. <br><br>For appetizers my husband chose the escargot. It was OK, it could have used more garlic and the escargot were definitely more earthy than what I&#39;ve had before but it was still good. <br><br>The soup--minestrone was also just OK, but it&#39;s served piping hot and that&#39;s something I will always appreciate. Salad--eh, it&#39;s Iceberg lettuce with thousand island...yeah, had to go thousand island in this old school joint. <br><br>Steak--very good. I asked for Medium and it was prepared to a perfect medium. There was a bit of over-char on one part of the steak, but otherwise a very solid, tasty cut. <br>Pasta--Spaghetti with Meat Sauce.  I love it. It&#39;s simple, and they don&#39;t skimp on the meat. Nice flavor.<br><br>Service was excellent. She was very friendly and anticipated our needs. Always available. She was really sweet. <br><br>We were lucky to have the strolling stings playing music when we visited. A violinist and a guitar. They stopped by our table, not to play something romantic, but to play Old McDonald and Twinkle Twinkle for our 2 year old.  Guess us parents get overlooked for serenades now. I kid, I kid. It was so nice of them to stop by and my son loved the attention and even sang along a bit. <br><br>Don&#39;t forget dessert! The Tiramisu for home was delicious too.",

"reviewcomment":"I&#39;m between 3 and 4 stars for this one, but if I go back it will definitely be for more of a restaurant experience in which case this place is definitely a 4 star experience. I like being in the Southport area in general. It never feels overcrowded and there is plenty to do on that little strip between Roscoe and Irving Park. <br><br>I went to Mystic Celt to meet some friends for drinks. They were doing Corona buckets, so we jumped on that deal. I ordered some wings and my roommates got some sandwiches. The drink service was prompt, but the food came out really slowly (we thought they forgot about us for a while there). When the food did come out, it was hot and I really enjoyed my wings. They had some nice heat and were a good size. <br><br>The inside was really nice and the there were TVs for those who wanted them by the bar and then the rest felt more like a restaurant. We only went to share a few drinks, but sitting at a table it definitely felt like our time was limited. Service was pretty slow, too, so that was too bad. We liked our food enough to try it again for a meal next time. I think that&#39;s definitely the better choice seeing we liked the atmosphere for that reason even more. <br><br>There&#39;s rarely a line at the women&#39;s bathroom and the menu has a good variety of options as well as a clear theme--quality is consistent. We&#39;re excited to try it again.",

"reviewcomment":"If you are anywhere near Perry&#39;s, you owe it to yourself to go.  I recommend arriving around 11:30 since by noon the line is out the door.<br><br>My first time I got a triple decker, the Ormand Street Special.  It must have been a solid five inches high, too much to even get my mouth around it!  The roast beef was close to rare but thin sliced so the texture was really good, while the corned beef was perfectly seasoned.  Both meats were juicy and inviting, the cole slaw has a nice crunch with barely a hint of mayo, and the russian dressing really caps it off.  Half of it would be enough to call an overindulgence, but I let my taste buds overrule my stomach and tried to finish the whole thing.  About 80% through I gave up for fear of getting sick.<br><br>On my second trip I had the brisket sandwich, which was incredible.  Such slow cooked flavor, onions falling apart within, wow.  I also got the chili, which is the best I&#39;ve ever had in my whole life.  Thick, sweet, meaty, and just a hint of heat.  They might put brown sugar or molasses in it, it had a hint of really rich baked bean flavor.<br><br>Unless you&#39;re starving I suggest getting a half sandwich combo, or you can go for The Wimpy, a sane sized sandwich that will leave you satisfied but not having to loosen your belt.<br><br>I highly recommend a root beer float, the ice cream is great and the soda they use, Dr. Brown&#39;s, is delicious.  They even give you the can with about half left so you can add it as you like.<br><br>The guy running the place couldn&#39;t be friendlier, in a nice to see you again way, not a creepy no one should be that happy way.  Just don&#39;t incur his wrath by violating the cell phone ban, that siren is loud and annoying.<br><br>Between the meat quality, the chili and the portion to price ratio, Perry&#39;s Deli is bucket list good.",

"reviewcomment":"First off, the customer service was really good. I tried this place yesterday, for the first time. We had a reservation of 7 people for 730 and they immediately sat us once we got there, no wait. Being a BYOB we brought wine bottles and the server always made sure to open any bottle we needed. We also brought in a cake, for a birthday celebration, and they had no problem storing it in the back. We didn&#39;t wait long for our orders to be taken.<br><br>We had the ceviche mixto and the pulpo in olive dressing for appetizers and they both were AMAZING! I had the pollo Saltado, which was really good. Everyone else in my group loved their dishes as well. The portions were good and big, we all had leftovers. After they brought the cake out with candles and extra plates. <br><br>Overall it was a great first experience, and we will definitely be coming back. <br><br>On a side note their green salsa is by far the most amazing salsa I have had in a restaurant.",

"reviewcomment":"My friends treated me here for my birthday dinner.  Stepping into Carriage House was like stepping into a restaurant back in my home state of North Carolina, or in any place in the South for that matter.  I haven&#39;t been to Charleston, but I imagine it&#39;d have a similar feel as this.  It has a warm, inviting feeling to it, like you are visiting someone&#39;s kitchen and eating at their dinner table.  I love how you can see into the kitchen.  I love the cast iron skillets and green dutch oven pots displayed in the back.<br><br>The menu is very family style friendly.  I liked how there are both &#34;Traditional&#34; and &#34;Reimagined&#34; entrees so we were choose a little bit from each side.  We started with the skillet cornbread and fried chicken thigh.  Disappointed it was a singular thigh, we ended up ordering a second one.  The cornbread was just so-so.  I liked the fried green tomatoes and the pork shoulder.  I had given up dessert for Lent, but my friends loved the apple donuts with the caramel dipping sauce.  One practically liked the plate clean.<br><br>All the servers were friendly and service was prompt.  Nice place for a group of 4 to have dinner and catch up.  Made me a little homesick.",

"reviewcomment":"I wanted to try this place for quite awhile, and we finally did with a group of our friends. We already had dinner, so we came here to socialize with wine and cheese. I read from reviews here that we must  make reservations to come since they get busy on the weekend, so we did..but we strolled in around 930pm so it wasn&#39;t that busy at that time. <br><br>Almost each one of my friend ordered a flight of wine. I had the Tour de France with couple others. My husband ordered the Firearm. Another friend ordered the Cheese Friendly. And another friend ordered the Sparkle one..so we each almost tried out every flight on the menu..except for the Wonderland one or something that starts with the letter W. My flight was decent. I&#39;m not a big wine drinker at all, but my flight had a mix of white and red wine which I enjoyed. My husband&#39;s Firearm was all red. It was on the heavier red side. He thought his was okay. He is much a bigger wine drinker than most of us. Almost each one of us have a favorite and had a non-favorite. We also ordered cheese - had a midwest tour and another one that I forgot the name. Also ordered 3 types of meats.. proscuitto was our favorite! <br><br>We stayed way past the time the restaurant closed and they didn&#39;t kick us out. We really appreciate that. They close at 11pm, but we were there til 12am without knowing the time. We had a really good time. The atmosphere was really nice.. Definitely a michelin rated place. Definitely will come back. We all had a great time..staff was very friendly and helpful!",

Anastasia was on her own in the dining room with a handful of other tables and she was great. There was no shortage of coffee, nor glasses left empty. She was a genial hostess, which made my morning a little more pleasant.<br>Pancakes were awesome-you need to get the sweet lady special! Two eggs, meat, and a fruit pancake...the banana was too good. I thought I would miss hashbrowns, but my table of construction workers couldn&#39;t finish their meals with all the food.<br>Eggs over easy were almost cooked perfectly for my taste. One yolk broke on the griddle, but somehow the cook managed to salvage a little of the yellow inky goodness.<br>Nice that it&#39;s right off of the intersection with California, there&#39;s a small parking lot, and they pay street parking if it&#39;s full. I could easily see myself (if I took the Blue Line @ California) phoning ahead for a sandwich and coffee before getting on the eL.",

"reviewcomment":"L2O is the real deal.  A monument to fine seafood eating.  The decor evokes the pinnacle of Los Angeles mid century modern design.  It is a quiet, minimalist elegance.  You may look around, half expecting to see Don Draper; if you do not, take on the role for the evening, with my blessings.<br><br>The cuisine here is impeccable.  We selected the four course prix-fixe and were not disappointed.  These dishes were predominantly avant garde in presentation, either deconstructed or elegantly over-constructed, but always delicious.<br><br>We began with foie gras and tuna tartare.  The foie gras was in torchon form, and assembled as a brick, with layers of haricot verts, fois gras, and salad, sprinkled with truffle.  It was delicious.  The tuna tartare was sliced so thin as to be gelatinous, and melted in your mouth.  It was the finest tartare we had savored, and one of the highlights of the meal.<br><br>I followed that with langoustine; Kelly had the Dover sole.  Both of these dishes were also bricked out, and elegantly constructed like architecture.  The langoustine had a creamy milky flavor and the sole was rich and buttery.<br><br>For the main course, I had the lobster, Kelly had the ribeye.  These dishes were more traditionally presented.  The ribeye was a juicy red rare, full of concentrated flavor, and the lobster was rich, buttery, and decadently delicious.<br><br>For dessert we both went with the chocolate cremeux.  The dish was delicious, of the finest chocolate.  Like many five star restaurants, desserts are an indulgence of the kitchen.  We also received a massive selection of petit fours, elegantly placed on a multi-tiered platform, as though they had all competed in an Olympian chocolate competition for our pleasure.<br><br>What was lovely about eating here was that there was so much food, and yet you left satisfied but not stuffed.  This was true even including two amuse bouches prior to our first course.<br><br>For drinks, we started with a delicious rose bubbly, and then a bottle of Chateauneuf-du-Pape, a late nineties vintage from Clos du Mont Olivet.  It was a superb wine, and in fact the sommelier had only received 3 bottles at an auction; we arrived just in time for the last bottle.  So we had something you, dear reader, may never have.  In the wine&#39;s stead I can only send you my sincere, sincere apologies, for the wine was transcendent.  <br><br>We finished off the dinner with coffee and some bourbon.  Service was excellent throughout, but we noticed that the room did not hold down sound as well as it might.  When we arrived the restaurant was quiet and subdued, but when we left, crowds were gathering, and a large party was seated in a &#34;semi-private&#34; dining space (emphasis on the &#34;semi&#34;).  While not obnoxiously loud, we were surprised at the amount of ambient noise they generated.  <br><br>But in the end, that is a minor quibble.  We would definitely consider L2o an excellent option to celebrate a special occasion.",

"reviewcomment":"I went here to dinner with my wife on a Friday night. We frequently come to this gem. We did not have reservations so we sat at the bar. I was thankful to get in because you need to call a few days before to get on the weekend roll. <br><br>We sat. I started with an old fashion and my wife had a glass of champaign. Friday is 1 oyster night ... So we also had some oysters to start... The oysters were very fresh and delicious ... We then ordered our main course ... I had the braised lamb shoulder and my wife had the roasted chicken. My dish was awesome but the roasted chicken was delicious ... Closed off the night with some ice cream and desert wine. The professionals that work there are phenomenal people too... This place is like a little vacation getaway with great food. I totally recommend it...",

"reviewcomment":"It&#39;s past mid-April and finally it&#39;s warm enough to sit outside for patio-seating!  It was warm enough this weekend to downgrade from my winter coat, but it was really the time of year when Chicagoans are still confused as to what to wear.  With Chicago weather fluctuating from snow to 40s to finally 60s... IT WAS ABOUT TIME to brunch outdoors in the lovely Lincoln Park!<br><br>Dunlays had a great selection of brunch items, and their weekend brunch runs Saturdays and Sundays from 10am - 3pm.  I had no idea that Dunlays had such a lovely brunch menu.  It&#39;s on the corner of Wrightwood and Clark, semi-busy, but the outdoor seating area is on the quieter street (Wrightwood) but you can still people watch, but you&#39;re not directly next to traffic.<br><br>The area was roomy, comfortable and the servers were attentive and nice.  I brought my dog, who hung out under our seats and table, and one of the servers even went to get a treat to give to my pup.  Really sweet of her.<br><br>Anyways, between four people, here is what we ordered:<br>1) Housemade Monkey Bread <br>2) Strange Daze Omlette <br>3) Oatmeal Pancakes with Maple Butter<br>4)  Corned Beef Hash<br><br>TWO out of the FOUR dishes = phenom:<br>The Housemade Monkey Bread itself gets 5 stars.  Imagine a warm, golden (duo of) gooey &amp; crusty cake that is smothered in rich frosting.. a bazillion times better than Cinnabon.  And I already love Cinnabon that much!<br><br>The Corned Beef Hash was also great (5 stars).  It was the essence of a &#34;meat and potatoes&#34; dish, with chunks of hearty corned beef.. and NOT the canned kind!  The pepper sauce had a kick and just the right amount of spiciness.  Both these dishes were served on iron skillets that came out piping hot, so I think it&#39;s safe to say anything that is served in their skillets is most likely going to be phenomenally delicious.<br><br>The Strange Daze Omlette was standard (it came with a side of hash browns) and the Oatmeal Pancakes were standard as well.  All portions are large enough to be shareable.  And their coffee is intelligentsia.<br><br>Now that the weather is warming up... head on out to as many outdoor brunch places as possible!  Especially Dunlays on Clark for mid-day brunch bliss and next time I&#39;ll order a bloody mary.",

"reviewcomment":"This is hands down some of the best Lebanese food I&#39;ve ever had. I&#39;ve been coming to Maza for several years now, starting when it was at the old location on Lincoln. The food is consistent and fails to disappoint! I&#39;ve tried many menu items and would highly recommend the hummus, fattoush, baba ghannouj... And the kellaya, chicken brochettes, mixed grill kabob, and couscous. Oh, and the seafood grill is great too. IMO, you can&#39;t go wrong with the food here. If you&#39;re lucky, maybe you&#39;ll get some delish, complimentary baklava at the meal&#39;s end. The prices are reasonable especially with a groupon or similar deal.<br><br>As for the location/ service, I have to admit I preferred their old space better. However, I have had no issues with the owner. He runs essentially a one-man operation as far as being the host, waiter, and clearing the tables. He&#39;s not in-your-face friendly, and while this could possibly be misconstrued as being abrasive, I think it&#39;s just his personality. He has been nothing but polite, accommodating, and pleasant when I&#39;ve dined at Maza and really takes pride (rightfully so) in his Lebanese cuisine.",

"reviewcomment":"Tiztal Cafe is by far my favorite brunch place in the city. I know that&#39;s a tall order considering the number of brunch places that the city has to offer, but they just do it for me. I pretty much get the same thing every time I go. I get the veggie omelet and the vampiro juice. Then I convince whoever I&#39;m there with to get the oatmeal shake because I don&#39;t want to be the guy that orders 3 drinks (I also order coffee). <br><br>I couldn&#39;t pick which item I like the most because they&#39;re all honestly that amazing. I really like my juice, but the potatoes at Tiztal are better than anything I&#39;ve had at any other restaurant. Then of course there&#39;s the oatmeal shake. It&#39;s truly a must try item. You won&#39;t be disappointed. <br><br>With all of those positive features, I will say that this restaurant isn&#39;t quite perfect. Their downfall that the service is a bit rough at times. Everyone is always friendly and helpful, but not always that attentive. It sometimes gets a little annoying, but I promise that the food will make up for it.<br><br>FYI: If you want excellent service ask for Melissa!",

"reviewcomment":"The infamous Al&#39;s Italian Beef.<br><br>If you don&#39;t know, now you know. A piece of bread able to withstand a mound full of beef soaked in it&#39;s own beef juices, topped off with hot or sweet peppers to cut through the fat, and the whole sandwich is literally &#34;dipped&#34; into the au jus (if you order it this way - I recommend you do). If you like anything related to a French dip sandwich, this place will blow your mind. And taste buds.<br><br>Obviously Man v. Food brought me here, but the history of Chicago&#39;s Italian beef speaks for itself. There&#39;s no doubt that this staple is the forefront of this city. Surprisingly the bread does not get soggy - just make sure to eat the masterpiece immediately.<br><br>Make sure to stop by Mario&#39;s Italian lemonade right across the street for a refreshing dessert. A meal for a beast and dessert for a sweet tooth - all on a budget.",

"reviewcomment":"We had the Family Menu for 2 Person. We are from Germany and had many Greek dinner before, so we know what expected us. <br><br>The gyros was very good and the tzatziki with the pink fish paste was the best appetizer. The salat was okay, but the feta and the olives in it where the best. For main dish we got moussaka, pastitio, lamp and stuffed whine leafs (don&#39;t know the English word for it, yet). It was so delicious and could be enough for a whole day. For dessert we got baklava and galaktoboureko - as we expected it was delicious, too.<br><br>The person who works there are very nice. <br><br>It was the best Greek dinner we had and if you know what European food is, especially Greek food is, there is nothing to complain. So I don&#39;t understand why this restaurant only got 3.5 avg.<br><br>The price of the family menu is unbeaten, if you compare how much you get. So 24$ per person is not much.....",

"reviewcomment":"I loved the experience of dining at Club Lucky.  I went there on Valentine&#39;s Day, so obviously it was bustling. Still, we got greeted quickly by a maitre&#39;d, who suggested we have a cocktail at the bar while we waited for our table (we were about 15 minutes early).  I had a well-made Manhattan and took in the happy scene.  The old-fashioned feel, the great smells, the cheerful bartenders. <br><br>Then we were lead to our table, in the dining room that was crowded but not cramped. We shared a Caprese salad, which was delicious (even though it&#39;s hard to find acceptable tomatoes in February in Chicago).  For my entree, I had homemade tortellini, filled with chicken and herbs, finished with peas, pinenuts, and vodka sauce.  Delicious!  <br><br>Our waitress, Samantha, was cheerful and didn&#39;t make us feel rushed at all, even though it was obviously a busy night. (And it took us a while to get through our bottle of wine.)  <br><br>Prices are on par with similar Italian restaurants in the city ... pastas in the $10 to $18 range, second courses are $18 to $35.  <br><br>The menu features relatively basic Italian fare -- nothing shi-shi or over the top, but the food is made well.  I would definitely go back soon to try another entree and enjoy the atmosphere.",

We got there in the middle of a shift change so it took a little bit for us to get a menu, but once we did, service was excellent. The server was very friendly, the food was delicious (between me and my husband, we ordered chili nachos, a portabello mushroom sandwich, and a teriyaki chicken sandwich), and the drink menu was great, too (do order a Mocha Martini!).

But the burger was delish. I&#39;m not sure it makes up for it but oh well. The fries are big and they are good as well. <br>The price is pretty close to any sit down establishment in the area though. Hell it&#39;s kind of a good deal really since across the street at Perez tacos they charge $17 yes $17 for three chicken tacos.

My wife and I stopped by for dinner on Friday night after work and it was an enjoyable experience, however, it was not remarkable. FYI, it was 6:45 on Friday night and we had a reservation, but it was unnecessary. <br><br>I had the BLT with the potato and leek soup and my wife had the chicken thigh. The BLT was solid and the soup was average. My wife&#39;s chicken thigh was superb, I would highly recommend it. We had the &#34;wild&#34; beer flight which was a mix of sours and lambics. The entire draft selection was in this category of very unique stuff, I&#39;m not sure I had tasted a quarter of the beers on draft which is extremely unusual. <br><br>The only downside was that there were not a lot of &#34;normal&#34; beers on tap which I believe was only temporary for a tasting event they had this week.<br><br>Overall good experience, the kitchen is open pretty late so probably one of your better options for late night food and drinks on Division.",

"reviewcomment":"If your looking for something low key, romantic, good price point, and accepts walk ins....this is your place. I&#39;ve  been here quite a few times using a Groupon. You can normally find a groupon around $30 for a dinner for two which includes: 2 drinks, 2 appetizers, 2 entrees, and 1 dessert. The food is excellent and I would recommend trying the Lomo Saltado. It&#39;s a chicken dish with hand cut fries and amazing burst of flavor. <br><br>The decor of this place is cute. You can either sit at a table or a romantic booth like setting with bead curtains. The service was excellent and I will definitely be going back.",

"reviewcomment":"My wife and I are glad we discovered this place. It&#39;s a hidden gem with great food, friendly &amp; knowledgeable staff and a great atmosphere.<br><br>The night began with us being seated in a cabana at the back garden area. The night was cold, but the garden was sealed &amp; heated very well. The cabana was also in front of a cute little water fountain, so all ingredients of a romantic night began when our wine flights arrived. <br><br>The food here is very good. Though these are &#34;small plates&#34;, the portions are generous. We had the duck confit and mussles, plus a cheese plate with some cured meat and pate. All very good stuff to go with wine. And oh, try their chocolate mousse and sorbets, it&#39;s a great way to end the night. A recommendation we have is to have more cushions available in the cabana so people could sit back and relax a bit more.<br><br>All single guys should take note that this is a great place for a date. Ask for a cabana to set the mood for a romantic night.",

Asked waiter for a different sauce and he brought a good horse radish-based one.<br><br>Orange chicken- very good. Chicken seemed good quality, brown rice was good.<br><br>Yellow Thai curry with chicken- good taste but was very salty which sort of ruined it for me.<br><br>The Lowdown: unique twist on Chinese and Thai food.

"reviewcomment":"Overall, I wouldn&#39;t come back to Square Bar unless I was already in the neighborhood - but it is a solid choice. Stumbled in here with a date after Kumas on a weeknight and the place was empty. One weekday drinker was finishing up his longneck bottle and was out the door before we had our drinks. My date was floored to find the 2013 BCS Coffee and their beer list was pretty solid all around. Our bartender was nice, and it was a chill place to grab a few drinks.<br><br>Our bartender (who is a manager there, sorry I don&#39;t remember your name!) was very nice, and had no problem kicking out/calling the cops on the stoned-crazy guy after he tried to kiss my date and told me that &#34;my cunt didn&#39;t smell like rainbows.&#34; That lost a 1/2 point there... but hey, that&#39;s the neighborhood. A couple came in a little later for dinner, and the food looked pretty tasty. Nothing special, but I might check it out if Kuma&#39;s was slammed.",

"reviewcomment":"I met a friend here for brunch while visiting DePaul last month, and feel sure that the wonderful brunch I found at Nookies Too is part of why I chose to move to Chicago in the fall. <br><br>The brunch menu was huge, and all of the options looked equally fantastic.  I was starving when I arrived, but there was simply no way to peruse the menu is less than 15 minutes. I found the prices surprisingly low for the items offered, and coffee and water were on the table in minutes despite the crowd.<br><br>I finally settled on a salmon scramble with hash browns, and was not disappointed. The servings were enormous, and everything was delicious, even down to the orange slice used as garnish on my plate. The food tasted fresh, and made with care even though the place was packed.  I especially appreciated the texture of the eggs--no instant eggs in a carton here. The hash browns are made from real potatoes, not that frozen Sysco crap! The coffee could be a little better, but it&#39;s a tad better than the diner &#34;water dressed in brown&#34; you&#39;d get at IHOP. <br><br>It was very crowded on Sunday, but my friend and I had no problem carrying on a conversation amid the hustle and bustle, nor did we have to wait long for anything. The service was punctual and friendly, without veering into the overly attentive. Coat racks were conveniently located to avoid that squished-in-at-your-table feeling, tables were just far enough apart to allow personal communications, and the bathrooms were clean. <br><br>I will be back! My plan is to try every item on the brunch menu before earning my PhD.",

"reviewcomment":"Scofflaw might be the best no wait option for brunch in Brogan Square. With the long lines in front of Lula and Revolution, or if you are just sick of going to brunch at Longman for the 99th time, try Scofflaw. They open at noon on the weekends and there is NO wait. At all. <br><br>Same cocktails and regular menu with a couple brunchier food items and cocktails in addition. So you can get your eggs and potatoes and mimosas if you want, or you can stick to their amazing burger or try some of the more adventurous entrees like the arancini with squid ink. And at $8 for all entrees, super inexpensive. <br><br>Service has consistently been amazing at Scofflaw from the day they opened until today. Really, some of the best service of all time in Brogan Square. Your certificate is in route to you via pedicab.  <br><br>Bro Factor: A 2 on a scale of one to five. Most of the bros who come here are on a date and therefore on their best behavior.<br><br>Bro name: Ska-Flaw",

"reviewcomment":"I remember the great old days when Tiny Lounge was on Addison... and was thrilled when I heard it was set to re-open. I&#39;ve also waited a solid 5 years to write my review, mainly because I didn&#39;t want anyone else to know about this &#34;secret&#34; spot. But since they finally decided to put a sign up outside, I guess I cannot wait any longer. <br><br>The short version: this place is fantastic. Even better than before because you can eat food. Tiny Lounge does a fantastic job of bringing together some delicious drinks with some great &#34;fancy&#34; bar food. <br><br>Do yourself a favor and bring a first (or second, third, etc..) date here - and she&#39;ll always be impressed with the spot. And most likely will not have heard of it. <br><br>The only downside - some of the great bartenders from the original Tiny Lounge that came back when it re-opened have since moved on... But the drinks are still fantastic.",

"reviewcomment":"Came here for lunch around 2pm after a family outing to the Lincoln Park Zoo.  We all enjoyed the fare and the ambience -- the place was mostly empty, but the Beatles were playing and the decor was an interesting mix of rustic wood and Banksy-esque paintings. <br><br>I ordered a black coffee and the biscuits and gravy.  The coffee actually turned out to be an Americano but was decent (nice flavor if not very strong).  The biscuits and gravy were classy comfort food, tastefully presented and with a bit of kick. The portions were generous but not outrageous.<br><br>Everyone else enjoyed their meals. The braised goat chilaquiles were a hit with a family friend who&#39;s actually from Mexico, so they must have been good.  The eggs (my sister got scrambled, my mother fried) are also great, apparently, and the grilled toast comes with an amazing homemade blackberry jam.  My father ordered the ploughman&#39;s platter (bacon, eggs, chorizo, toast) and thought everything was very good except for the chorizo, which was only passable.<br><br>Our waitress was very attentive, and there was very little wait for the food.<br><br>My only complaint is that some dishes were overpriced, most notably the $7 fruit salad.  Still, I&#39;ll certainly be back if I&#39;m ever in the neighborhood.",

Inspiration Kitchen&#39;s mission is to help individuals affected by poverty by providing social services such as food service training. <br><br>We arrived around 1:00pm on a Sunday. Every table was occupied! I was afraid we were not going to get seating, but luckily there was not much of wait. The host was very accommodating and our server was very attentive and friendly. <br><br>We came pretty late, so a few of the things were already off the menu.I ordered the ham, spinach and swiss omelette with greek yogurt. The omelette was delicious, not too salty. The greek yogurt, amazing! It came drizzled with this strawberry sauce on top. It almost tasted like ice cream! My friends got the french toast and really liked it as well. <br><br>I would love to check out the Garfield Park location next!",

Needless to say we got quick service and our food was delivered quickly too.<br><br>Started with the orange/coconut poptart this time (I liked the goat cheese cinnamon roll better) and then ordered the Market Quiche which this time around was onion, tomato and I can&#39;t remember what else. So good though, and always very fluffy and fresh tasting. My husband ordered the Salmon BLT on a pretzel roll which while it looked small, the salmon was a good sized piece and very well cooked.<br><br>Servers are always so nice here, will need to come and try lunch next time.",

I&#39;ve visited several times now, and I&#39;ve never been disappointed, despite never having had the pizza. I think my favorite part is the creativity of the drink menu. I&#39;ve stayed for HOURS here and never had a problem with service or feeling rushed. In fact, I&#39;ve met friends for appetizers and segued into dinner, totaling 4 hours in the place, with no problem. The wait staff have always been congenial and expedient. In fact, I left a post card for my roommate on my first trip and someone made sure it got posted, so it made it home a day after I did. <br><br>I have nothing but fond things to say about Exchequer.

"reviewcomment":"Disclaimer: I am a breakfast person. I am predisposed to like any place that provides me with pancakes, eggs, waffles, etc., particularly if they have interesting combinations to them.<br><br>That said, I thoroughly enjoyed this place. It wasn&#39;t just standard buttermilk pancakes with maple syrup fare; they have created some very interesting, ever changing combinations that would make it nearly impossible to get sick of this place.<br><br>The pancake flight is a stroke of genius - 4 small portions of different types of pancakes, which change weekly. I&#39;ve monitored the weekly pancake flights online for awhile now, and they always sound delectable, so of course, that&#39;s what I got. I commented to my dining companion that no matter how many times I came here, I don&#39;t know how I&#39;d ever be able to stray from the pancake flight because having FOUR different types of interesting pancake combinations as opposed to picking one thing off the menu will always seem like the better option to me. That kind of sucks because some of the standard menu options - the cinnamon roll pancakes, the chai tea french toast - sound delicious too! Even the omelets and the multiple variations on eggs benedict sounded tasty. My carnivorous (not typically a breakfast person) boyfriend found the steak and eggs benedict to be one of the best breakfast dishes he&#39;s ever tried. I may just make a breakfast person out of him yet.<br><br>The frushi, while clever, is a bit of a gimmick, though. There were certain pieces that I thought were absolutely delicious while others were really just cut-up fruit. Overall, probably not worth the price you&#39;re paying, but they&#39;re cute.<br><br>Orange also has make your own juice options. They have various bases and add-ins as well as recommended combinations, and you can create some delectable masterpieces that you&#39;d maybe never find in a store.<br><br>I would definitely come back to Orange, and I&#39;d probably continue coming to this specific location too. Street parking was a breeze, and I read on Yelp that the wait at the other location can be long, but we came to this location on a Saturday at 11 a.m., and there were plenty of open tables. Service was good too. Definite must try for breakfast peeps in Chicago.",

"reviewcomment":"Wow.<br><br>Food: Awesome. <br>Service: Impeccable. <br>Drinks: Delicious. <br>Ambiance: Classy but unpretentious. <br>Concept: Beautiful. <br>Menu: Seasonal with emphasis on local produce and preservation (pickled everything -- and charcuterie!)<br><br>We were staying at the trendy, colorful, modern, eclectic, classy Lincoln hotel and went to dinner downstairs at the Perennial Virant. The chef is Paul Virant, and &#34;perennial&#34; refers to the seasonally changing menu.<br><br>We sat at the bar at what turned out to be a slow weekday night, which turned out to be awesome for us. <br>An in-training bartender named Drew originally started serving us, but when we started asking questions about liqueurs in the cocktails, as he tried to explain them, the more experienced Wesley jumped in and poured us little tastes -- a taste is worth a thousand words. From there, Wesley took over, answering our questions about their homemade pickles and charcuterie, and what farm they get their local produce from --- an indoor greenhouse in a huge warehouse in Chicago ran by at-risk youth.  He was personable, knowledgeable, and damn can he shake a drink. He&#39;s an awesome bartender and he knew everything about the food as well! Best service ever, thanks Wesley, you made our night!!!<br><br>The Good: <br>Everything! Food! Service! Drinks! Ambiance! Seasonal menu! Homemade pickles! Local vegetables! They have beer, they have cocktails, they have beer cocktails! All their creative and unique drinks were tasty -- and we tried a few ;) ALL our food was delicious and amazing. Awesome professional yet personable service from our hilarious &amp; knowledgeable bartender Wesley. We&#39;d go back constantly if we lived in Chicago! I loved the ambiance -- the restaurant was clean and modern, classy but unpretentious. There were even couches (classy ones obviously) in one corner. One of those places you feel cool just sitting there.  <br><br>The Bad: <br>the fact that we don&#39;t live in Chicago and can&#39;t go here all the time!<br><br>The Food: <br>Everything was incredible from salads to homemade chocolate chip cookies. Worst thing (and it&#39;s not that bad) was the homemade gnocchi dish, which was tasty but just super heavy for spring. When we ordered it, Wesley suggested another, lighter dish, so we got them both -- and he was very right! Perfect service -- instead of saying &#34;oh that&#39;s not that good&#34; or &#34;get this instead&#34; (or nothing at all) when he knew one dish was better than the one we ordered, he just offered a relevant opinion, and we ended up getting both dishes and really appreciating his input!<br><br>The Service: <br>Amazing, awesome, honest, hilarious, fun and professional service from our Chicago-native bartender Wesley. At one point he said &#34;there&#39;s a red Power Ranger running down the street -- just so we all saw that&#34; -- we turned around and there was in fact a guy in a red Power Ranger outfit (uniform?) running down the street. A special moment. The memories we made.<br><br>Overall: <br>Amazing, wonderful, unforgettable experience! So much fun, so many tasty drinks, so many delicious seasonal local fresh dishes!<br><br>Pro tip: (applies to most restaurants but especially Perennial) Instead of sitting at a table, ordering entrees and leaving, sit at the bar -- you can usually order food there, and it&#39;s way more fun, relaxed and interactive. Get appetizers, share them, talk to the bartender, ask questions, taste stuff, enjoy yourself! And if you&#39;re at Perennial -- cross your fingers Wesley&#39;s working!",

"reviewcomment":"Solid 4 stars for this place. Came here randomly one night with the gf after our original plans fell through. Pretty lucky choice. First walked in and thought the place was empty. No one inside, and then no one in the front either. Then we saw the back patio and wow, really nice. Lights and decorations make it have a really good atmosphere. Especially once they add flowers. Be aware though, the sun went down and it got pretty cold pretty fast. May not be the case in the summer but bring a sweater just in case. They do provide blankets which is a nice touch.<br><br>And now down to the food. First we started with the bruschetta appetizer. Our 5 choices, in order of my opinion of most to least favorite, were napoli, roma, proscutto cristina and piemonte. I&#39;m looking at a not updated menu online, so the cristina here says raspberry but ours was strawberry, but anyway that was my 2nd to last favorite.<br><br>Then for the main course, I ordered risotto alla pescatora (seafood place) and it was pretty good. A bunch of mussels and clams but only 2 scallops and 2 shrimps though. The rice thing it was over was pretty good. I didn&#39;t really like the mussels though since it seemed like there was no seasoning or flavor and it was just steamed. But hey, maybe that&#39;s how they intended it though. All that for about $17 so yeah. The gf got the Pera which is the pear ravioli and that was pretty good. Good flavor, though it was just 6 ravioli&#39;s for about $16 so money wise, that would not be a good filler dish.<br><br>For dessert we had a trio of something that I can&#39;t remember the name of, but there were 3 small cups of it. One was caramel, the other was chocolate, and the last was berries. That was pretty good, just pretty small. But i mean this is more of a quality over quantity place. One thing that bugged me though is that there was only one waitress for the whole back patio and there was just a lot of waiting. Was probably there an extra 30-40 minutes that we needed to be which would have been fine if it didn&#39;t get so cold.",

"reviewcomment":"I&#39;ve been to Pint 5 or 6 times and always find myself having a good time there. The drinks are relatively cheap compared to other bars in the neighborhood, and the food is pretty standard. Lots of food options, even as a vegetarian.<br><br>The service can be a little hit or miss (for which I deducted one star), but that&#39;s bound to happen in crowded bars in trendy neighborhoods on the weekends. It&#39;s hard for those ladies to keep up sometimes!<br><br>The complaint that I&#39;ve seen in a lot of these reviews is the small size of the balcony, which I&#39;ll grant. But that being said, there&#39;s so much seating and standing room in the whole rest of the bar that that really isn&#39;t a huge factor. The bar is easy to get to and the bathrooms are pretty centrally located. There are TVs throughout so you can catch whatever game you&#39;re looking to see.<br><br>Overall it&#39;s a pretty good place if you&#39;re not looking for anything too fancy.

"reviewcomment":"I was taken here to get a bite out of Chicago&#39;s deep dish pizza. Granted, I had other places in mind to try out the deep dish pizza in town, but unfortunately because of the weather, it was kind of hard to navigate and my friend suggested I come here.<br><br>Upon arriving, it had been apparent that there was a special going on for the thin crust pizzas. I saw thin crust pizzas everywhere, as a matter of fact, and not one deep dish. That was enough to get me worried, but my friend insisted that it was good. And upon getting the deep dish pizza, I have to say that he was pretty darn right.<br><br>Now, regarding deep dish pizza, I&#39;m well aware of the rivalries and how there&#39;s plenty of naysayers on who serves the best dish. But frankly, a pizza is a pizza as long as they get the crust right. People complain about New York pizzas outside of New York and Italian pizzas outside of Italy... and why? Because of the crust, my friend. The cheese and sauce can be pretty much replicated anywhere and they&#39;re hard to mess up. But the crust, my friend? That&#39;s a whole different animal.<br><br>That being said, D&#39;Agostino&#39;s deep dish pizza crust tasted just like what Chicago should taste like - buttery, fluffy, and crispy - a mixture with cheese and sauce that melts savorily in the mouth. And having gone to a popular and overhyped restaurant not too far away that bears my name in Italian (I&#39;ve been forsaken!), I can say that this is a good find.<br><br>While I won&#39;t say that this is the best in town (I had bookmarked too many pizza places to try out in Chicago that I can&#39;t overlook them), I must say that they did give a yummy fix.

"reviewcomment":"Place was getting busy on Saturday evening but luckily we snagged a seat outside, as there were reserved parties inside. We were seated and were told that our waiter would be with us shortly. It took awhile and my bf and I were going to wait another 2 minutes before we just got up and left. Our waiter did come and he executed great service from that point on. He asked if this was our first time there and since it was, he explained the menu and some of their items.<br><br>We got the jerk ribs (4 pieces) to start and they were to die for. Perfect spices with a kick and meaty falling off the bones ribs. Must try.<br><br>I had the jerk chicken and I was very satisfied. The half was only $2 more than the quarter chicken, which was what I opted for. Again, perfectly jerk seasoned and chicken was very moist and tender. The plantains were perfectly lightly fried and delicious. I wasn&#39;t impressed with the rice and beans, but not the end of the world. The accompanied hard bread with sauce was also splendid. My bf got the beef stew and while not bad, he agreed that there are definite other winners at this place.<br><br>We mentioned to our waiter that we were in a hurry and he was very helpful and prompt in serving us. A little pricy but definitely coming back to get my jerk chicken fix. Also nice that they have a good vegetarian section.",

The customer service is nice and they put care into the food and packaging, too (if you get delivery).<br><br>I have eaten here three days in a row. I ate the spicy tuna maki, sweet potato tempura maki and thai tea. I love thai tea and the one here is perfect. I just love the food here. The waiters are okay (sitting around, talking in Chinese about some useless matter and when you motion them for help they act like you were interrupting such an important conversation; and another one didn&#39;t give me my change), but I guess I can overlook that because the food is so good.<br><br>When I ordered my food for takeout, the sushi was packaged below the soy sauce which was in little cups in a tied plastic wrap. The thai tea was put in a rice box so that it wouldn&#39;t spill. I will eat here again. The location is also nice, you can people watch if you get close to the window.",

Not to mention, the roasted garlic they give you with the butter and bread is such a nice small touch that makes them different and delicious!

"reviewcomment":"Ah spring. Was Tennyson right? &#34;In the spring a young man&#39;s fancy lightly turns to thoughts of love.&#34; Maybe, but with el mercurio at forty-odd degrees, I think it was la bailarina de flamenco whose fancy dancing attracted my fancying. Excellent band, but that was just the icing on the...well, the caramel on the flan. <br>     Excellent meal. I&#39;d been here a few times many moons ago, even though its a neighborhood place for me. Those times it was solid, tonight the food soared. While I would have liked a date with the bailarina, the bacon-wrapped dates might have been just as sweet. Especially outstanding were the chicken brochette with chorizo and cumin sauce, the lamb with portabello mushrooms, the grilled beef with blue cheese, garlic potato salad, patatas bravas... and the bananas with caramel (courtesy of checking in with Yelp). <br>     The paella was good, but nothing to write home about, although we had someone with shellfish allergies at they table and they were willing to add chicken and chorizo to the vegetarian paella, which was an added plus. <br>     I&#39;ve always loved Cafe Iberico, but tonight Tapas Valencia was equally good, if not better--definitely more convenient; since they took reservations. <br>     Friendly, capable service as well. I&#39;m not a wine connoisseur, but we had a wonderful vino rioja at a reasonable price. <br>     I was between 4 and 5 stars, but those light thoughts of young love should not be ignored.",

"reviewcomment":"Out of all the restaurants that I know of in downtown and the loop- the Russian Tea Time is what I would consider the best date restaurant- ever.  It is a world of difference between stepping from busy Chicago sidewalks and into Russian Tea Time.  It is a romantic shelter in a literal storm of the Windy City.  <br><br>To me, this is an easy jaunt towards or from the Art Inst.  <br>Menu that I suggest:<br>Raisin Scones with homemade whipping cream and marmalade<br>Pozharski croquette mini sandwich, honey mustard sauce<br>Potato piroshky bite<br>White Peony<br>&#34;Bai Mudan.&#34; Non-rolled, brown leaves and down covered buds yield a light yellow liquor and subtle, characteristically nutty flavor...<br>It is way different from what I would be able to cook and more importantly - I would be able to talk and say something favorable about the true taste and richness.  I know lower class Russians do not eat like this but it is what it is... It is here in an upscale version and I take full advantage of great restaurants like this whenever I have the chance.   <br><br>Great to share for a small bite or a full out meal and then order a great entrée.  Easy to share, wonderful  to feel a moment together.  <br><br>On dates- I would suggest staying away from the alcohol.  You do not want to be seen as a lightweight at a Russian bar- no sir.  <br><br>I for one would never dine here alone- I would pretend to be writing a boring spy novel of Russians meeting Russians in order to take over the 2nd largest city of Polish speaking people in the world for their own- even before all of this stuff about Crimea and Ukraine.    <br><br>Afterwards if the taste is still too strong for you. Don&#39;t just go out for the next meal at McD.  Go for a nice hot black coffee- no starbucks frill drink, just a black maybe strong Kona coffee to clean and cleanse your pallet.  2 reasons- A coffee will keep the date going strong and upbeat if the date is going well- and B  another reason to going to another restaurant later on the date.<br><br>I will continue to fondly remember this place and hope to visit soon again because of fond memories.",

"reviewcomment":"If you&#39;re looking for something new, you really should try the Alhambra Palace.  The décor is interesting and inviting, and gives a sense that you&#39;re doing something special, so I would think this restaurant would be a great place for groups. <br><br>I was there on a Sunday night when a swing band (Starfall Orchestra) was playing. Not gonna lie, it was noisy. If you want a quiet place for dinner, this isn&#39;t it. The atmosphere was fun, festive, and entertaining. <br><br>The food was delicious, prompt, and attractively presented. Our server was very attentive.  At the end of the evening, my dinner (the lamb tagine) got thrown away instead of placed in a take-home container.  When I told my waiter, he quickly placed an order for a whole new lamb tajine, had it boxed up for me, and sent us on our way.  I didn&#39;t have to complain at all, he took care of it after just a quick request.  To me, this is awesome service! <br><br>The valet parking was a little weird.  We paid the valet upon arriving at the restaurant and then were asked to pay again when we left.  This was a little awkward, but eventually sorted itself out.  <br><br>I will definitely go back to the Alhambra Palace and when I do, I&#39;ll be looking forward to a delicious meal and a fun evening. I hear they have belly dancing classes on Wednesdays...<br><br>One beer + one entrée = $33.50 before tip",

"reviewcomment":"Pretty similar to the other ROCKs in LP. Mostly from my other review:<br>&#34;Overall: Rocks is a surprisingly great bar to grab a great burger, or any food option, and enjoy some good drinks.<br><br>The good: Fantastic burgers. Quality tasting meat and a lot of unique options. Huge menu with a ton of other great looking options as well. Apps, sandwiches, soups, salads, entrees, etc. Also a great beer selection and great daily specials. Pretty average prices.<br><br>The bad: The place was really loud (and crowded), so it was hard to talk at times. But hey, it&#39;s a bar, so cmon. <br><br>Atmosphere: 7/10<br>Service: 8/10<br>Food: 8/10&#34;",

We were seated downstairs which has a very cool vibe (sports on TVs, good music playing, and great decor). <br><br>We were able to be seated pretty quickly despite the amount of people that showed up around the time we walked in. <br><br>The food was absolutely delicious. Very big portion sizes so splitting would be a great option. I got the hashes (chicken, asparagus, two eggs, etc). The potatoes in it were so good and the chicken had so much flavor. It came in a big skillet like pan which had great presentation. Everyone else at the table that ordered something did not have one complaint about their food. <br><br>We also tried their bloody Mary&#39;s. They were just the right kind of spicy (I like spicy bloody Mary&#39;s so if too much bothers you, you might not enjoy them). They came with olives stuffed with jalapeños as well as sweet pickle, and a green bean. <br><br>I highly recommend this place!",

"reviewcomment":"A very solid breakfast here! Quiche of the day was excellent (with big chunks of bacon - so fear not, non-vegans, at least I&#39;m assuming it was not vegan bacon?), bottomless coffee was truly refilled often and my friends also gave high praise for their food - both veg and non-veg. I&#39;m planning to return next time I&#39;m in Humboldt Park. It&#39;s in a great location to wander around the park after eating, too.<br><br>As commenting on the service seems to be a trend in Flying Saucer&#39;s Yelp reviews, I&#39;ll add my opinion. It wasn&#39;t warm/fuzzy restaurant service, but it really wasn&#39;t bad and was almost entirely good. It reminded me of what you get in countries where the waitstaff doesn&#39;t have to pretend to like you for a good tip, although definitely on the quality end of that. They got our orders quickly and were pretty friendly. Definitely none of the issues from other reviews.<br><br>The only part that was a little frustrating was the aggressive push to turn-over tables, even with the restaurant not full and nobody waiting. I can see where they&#39;re coming from on this, since it sounds like typically they are very busy on weekends and nobody wants a table sitting there not spending money, but they were definitely slow enough today that they could have been a little more diplomatic. Maybe we were headed into iced-tea ladies who lunch territory in their eyes...<br><br>Anyway, overall - recommeded!",

The host was very professional, even though we were confused walking in...we must have been the first of the night. Our waiter was very sweet and there were several busboys walking around like hawks, making sure our waters never reached the bottom of our glasses and that everything was perfect. (Note, only men work here...interesting?) <br><br>We asked a few questions about the menu and my question led to a free order of tzaziki- my absolute must have at a Greek place. My roommates, both non-fans of tzaziki thought it was delicious! The bread, though, the complimentary LOAVES of bread (two kinds) were, maybe, my favorite part. We even asked for a second basket. The freshest, best bread I&#39;ve had all my (American) life and I&#39;m German. That means a lot. <br><br>Did I mention the decor? GORGEOUS. Huge. Seating everywhere and impeccable. Outdoor, indoor, waterfalls, granite counter tops. Top to bottom amazing. It was like being in a different world. 5 stars, no doubt.",

The ambiance was neat, black and white perfect for those &#39;first dates&#39; or a fine dining experience with Sushi with out it being over the pocket expensive. With an extensive sushi roll menu with specialities, we started with the calamari. <br><br>Calamari and me are not best friends, but I couldn&#39;t help it, it was delicious. Crispy and not too oily, I couldn&#39;t help to take bite after bite. It was a large entree, so it&#39;s perfect to start off by sharing. We then got a few rolls and I don&#39;t remember what they are ever called, but you can&#39;t go wrong. I like spice, but it was the perfect hint of spice in each roll we ordered as &#39;spicy&#39;. It wasn&#39;t overbearing, and you can taste each ingredient on it&#39;s own. The service was great- enough servers going around and the ambiance was turning chatty. <br><br>This is perfect for families because it&#39;s between a budget sushi restaurant and a fine dining one, just a family one with accommodations for kids. It&#39;s in a perfect location of Lakeview and must be a town favorite for sushi. I believe with a yelp check in you get something out of it too!",

"reviewcomment":"In an area of town where seemingly every other storefront is a Mexican restaurant, one has to be good to compete.  And Tecalitlan (don&#39;t ask me how to pronounce it) is great.  First, it is less divey than most of its competition, with a spacious dining room and bar that is relatively comfortable to sit in.  I&#39;ve never had trouble getting seated immediately (and in the summer, they have a few outdoor tables on the sidewalk overlooking Chicago Ave.)  <br><br>Secondly, the margaritas are tasty and they have a good selection of Mexican beer as well.  Thirdly, the food is affordably priced and awesome! I almost always get the same thing -- the two tostada dinner, one chicken, one vegetarian.  <br><br>The chicken is shredded and moist with just the right amount of spice, and they don&#39;t skimp on the avocado.  It is a TON of food, but I like the variety! Rice and beans are well done as well, and the service is speedy.   I&#39;ve had their breakfast dishes as well (Huevos Mexicana), which is also solid. They do offer carry out, which takes about 10 minutes.  <br><br>This is my go-to place if I have a rare weekday lunch break in Chicago and I can sit down and read for a while, enjoying a high-calorie but delicious Mexican meal.",

I loved the feel of the place! The music was awesome, lots of bright colors to make it festive, and the hostess was very friendly!<br><br>As I started to look through the menu I was a little nervous because I&#39;m used to taquerias where everything is $5-10, but I said whatever and just hoped for the best. We were immediately given tortilla chips and salsa. Instead of jalapeños and carrots they give habanero peppers and onions. I was not prepared! Haha. The peppers were fiery hot, but nonetheless good. <br><br>After searching for a little while I decided to order the  &#34;Combinacion Puebla&#34; and &#34;Tamalitos&#34; for an appetizer. One word.....AMAZING!!!! The food was awesomely delicious. The mole tasted authentic and the Chile relleno was excellent! The tamales weren&#39;t dry, and everything meshed together perfectly. The wait staff was very attentive and helpful. Spanish isn&#39;t necessary but it&#39;s always fun to use! I&#39;ll definitely be back",

"reviewcomment":"Let&#39;s double down on the fried chicken reviews, shall we? I just posted one for Chicago-famous Harold&#39;s, so why not another for the commonly known preeminent chicken and waffle house of Chicagoland?<br><br>Unfortunately for this place, like Harold&#39;s, I grade on a Houston curve. And I&#39;ve not had better chicken and waffles than at the Breakfast Klub, a Houston institution. But let&#39;s talk Chicago. The place is in the corner office of a small strip with some apartments atop, in a not un-quaint part of Chicago&#39;s south side. The brownstone architecture around the neighborhood is, in fact, rather nifty. Additionally, this restaurant&#39;s proximity to Cellular Field, with not much else nearby besides chain food, makes it a particularly good pre-game stop if you&#39;re going to a Sox game.<br><br>But it&#39;s all about the food, and Chicago&#39;s Home has good, but not great, chicken and waffles. Like Harold&#39;s, this location suffers from the absurdly small chicken. A quarter meal with a waffle sets you back above a Hamilton; there&#39;s no reason to be stingy with the bird for those prices. Unlike Harold&#39;s, the chicken here is decently good with a nice flavor--think mild at Church&#39;s or Popeyes.<br><br>The waffle is wholly disappointing. it&#39;s soft and soggy, like an Eggo waffle that&#39;s been exposed to too much frostbite and can&#39;t shed the water weight in the toaster. The waffle requires copious dunking in the syrup, a big no-no.<br><br>Beyond the chicken and waffles, Chicago&#39;s Home has an extensive menu, and we helped ourselves to some red beans and rice and greens as sides, both tasty. I&#39;d been particularly craving red beans and rice, after having gone on multiple diatribes about how impossible it is to find proper cajun food in Chicago (and no, Heaven on Seven does not count). So just having a red beans and rice option was good enough for me to like it.<br><br>There&#39;s some complaints about the wait time, but we came entirely off-peak and had no issues with service or wait. The place is clean, there&#39;s street and lot parking, and the food is good, if not spectacular.",

"reviewcomment":"I came here today with a friend who was visiting Chicago, and I was just blown away by how delicious the food was! The ambience and atmosphere was great--perfect for catching up with your girlfriend/sharing an intimate meal with your date. It was a nice, cosy place that wasn&#39;t too loud, but at the same time not deathly quiet.<br>We ordered the fried stuffed avocado with spicy tuna etc. and it WAS NOTHING SHORT OF AMAZING. The spicy, soft tuna complemented the crispy texture of the fried avocado really, really well. <br>Aside from that we also ordered Ocean Drive sushi--it was literally a platter of different kinds of seafood sushi rolls (like a drive...) and it was sublime. One reservation I have about this dish, though, is that the rolls were slightly too large and were a mouthful to chew on.<br>Waiters were friendly, attentive, and our orders arrived quickly.<br><br>All in all a satisfying experience!",

"reviewcomment":"&#34;Wholly&#34; cow.... YES.  Mexican food done right!<br><br>The vibes, colors and flavors of this place are fantastic.  I never really thought of Lincolnwood as a town with a thriving food scene, but after having dinner here, I couldn&#39;t be more wrong.<br><br>I&#39;ve always driven past this place on Touhy and seen Wholly Frijoles from afar.  (In the summer, they have a lovely, decorative outdoor patio area for diners to enjoy the sun).  Their name would pop out at me from a large green sign and I&#39;d wonder what went on behind those doors/windows along a strip mall.  I can&#39;t even say &#34;Wholly Frijoles&#34; without smiling :) i.e. a good sign.<br><br>If this place could represent Lincolnwood, it would constitute an establishment worth visiting all on its own.  They don&#39;t take reservations here, but you can call ahead (on the same day you&#39;re planning to dine) to be put on the &#34;waiting list.&#34;  You will only be seated if your entire party is present, but there are plenty of chairs in a petite waiting area.<br><br>On a Friday evening for last minute dinner plans, I called to be put on a waiting list at 6:40pm and was seated by 7:05pm.  The greeter asked our party of three if we wouldn&#39;t mind sitting at a big round table, because the smaller tables were all taken at the moment.  Hungry and eyeing the plates heavy with delicious food being whipped around us towards other tables, we opted to be seated immediately... we couldn&#39;t wait to eat.<br><br>Three ladies around a huge circular table... no problemo.  The more room to set down our food... haha.  Between the three of us, we ordered:<br><br>APPETIZER:<br>-guacamole (sliced jalapenos on the side)... $7.25<br>-steak tacos (3) with a side of tortilla soup... $9.50<br><br>MAIN COURSES: **Apologies, I don&#39;t have all the exact names**<br>-Bistec dish (steak marinated in Corona beer and lime)<br>-Chicken<br>-Breaded Shrimp<br><br>The main dishes were around $18.00 per head and they came with your choice of tortilla soup or salad and a side of beans.  Based on the reviews, the soup seemed like the favorite.  Expecting it to be like chili, I was surprised that it was more like a lime-infused tomato soup, with fried tabs of tortilla adorning the cup with a drizzle of sour cream.<br><br>I ordered the first course (the bistec) and had it cooked medium-rare.  It came out tender, succelent, the sauce was rich and flavorful (with a strong hint of beer) and I felt like it had been marinated forever, allowing all the flavors to seep in.  It came with two kinds slices of grilled squash (jicamba?) and a type of mashed potato with an orangey hue (sweet potato?).<br><br>Sorry my descriptions are so vague... guess I was too busy enjoying the food!  I tried a little bit of the other courses and they were great, and I was wowed by the plating and presentation.  The atmosphere was lively and festive, the decor was colorful and the service was warm.  There was no room for dessert.<br><br>**Heads up** They do not split the bill for individuals.  Our server was attentive, friendly and all the staff handled a bustling Friday evening very well.  It&#39;s BYOB... and it&#39;s the kind of place where the server would bring over say... a gigantic, glowing dish of fried iced cream and a neighboring table would look over, all want it, and engage in friendly conversation, joking about their jealousy.<br><br>Next time, I&#39;ll be adamant... and save room for dessert.",

"reviewcomment":"SPICE UP MY LIFE<br><br>We recently got back from Asia and decided we needed more Indian food in our life. We ate at an Indian restaurant in Bali that burned us but in a good way and we were now seeking that kind of heat in Chicago.<br><br>Chicago has a great corridor of authentic Indian restaurants on Devon Ave. The problem is deciding which one to go to. My wife and I ended up here.  I am so happy we did!<br><br>When we walked in my wife wanted to carry our food out.  I totally understood why because this place looked aged.  In fact, it looks a little scary but I was not going to let the appearance change my mind. I wanted authentic. I did not want a fancy white table cloth place.<br><br>The lady at the front counter was really nice and patient with us. There is a giant board of food with names and pictures. I realized that the board has the same dish but served three different ways. <br><br>1) You can get it as a build your own sandwich. Served on a fancy metal prison tray. That scared my wife but I thought it looked cool. <br>2) You can get a giant bowl of it. And add on 2 bread or one rice for a $1.<br>3) You can get it all mixed with rice.<br><br>Once I realized the dishes then the giant menu board seemed to get smaller to me. I was not really looking for what to order but how I wanted to eat it. Since we were going family style we went for option #2. On a side note, I made up the 1-2-3 ordering process so do not walk in here expecting to see that. You are going to have to still point at the board and pick your dish.<br><br>We decided to go with Butter Chicken and Chili Chicken. Both were amazing. We also added on one plate of rice and 2 bread. We asked for the Naan but were told that they were out of it. We then asked the lady behind the counter what her favorite was and she said the Paratha. Guess what? That is our new favorite now. I will never ever want Naan again. The dishes also came with a bowl of sour cream and raw white onions. We were using the Paratha and making our own sandwiches. It was so messy with delicious juices running down our hands. If this could be food porn, then it was. Every bite was better then the next.<br><br>The butter chicken was so yummy. We came home and started looking up recipes. Yes we are going to try this at home one day soon. The sauce for the butter chicken was just decadent. I wanted a spoon to start eating it like soup.<br><br>The chili chicken was fantastic. I pointed out to my wife that the spices in this dish were similar to the Colonel&#39;s Secret Recipe for Original Chicken at KFC. She agreed and is forcing me to mention this in a review. Now I must be honest I haven&#39;t had KFC in over 10 years but those original spices stick with you. I am now thinking the Colonel went to Indian and stole this recipe. Yes I am stating that here and for the record. I must say I mean no disrespect to the Chili Chicken here because it is 10 times better then any fasts food chicken at KFC. Next time you are here I want you to think about this before you bite in and then shoot me a note if you agree or disagree.<br><br>We also mixed our chickens with the rice too. So we had the best of all worlds. Sandwiches and rice bowls plus some samosas on the side. This was a feast for lunch.<br><br>Our quick lunch excursion took us 2.5 hours roundtrip back to downtown Chicago. Here is the sad thing. As I was driving down Roosevelt Road at Halsted I noticed they had a second location at UIC. What? We could have been here in 5 minutes. I am not reviewing that location yet. That will be for another time. But this is a much cleaner version of the original. Personally I think you have to go to the original to experience it all.<br><br>On a funny note my wife thought we ate at a different restaurant on Devon. She had a fancy place all marked. So when we walked in here she was in total shock because the photos of the place did not even match. I did not find that out until a week later. We had such a funny laugh when we realized we might have eaten at the wrong place but I love food stories like that because it seems more interesting. Plus it makes for a great story!<br><br>If your looking for delicious Indian food that isn&#39;t going to cost you a lot of money then this is your place. I highly recommend the Butter Chicken and the Chili Chicken. All dishes are under $4.99 and you can add rice or 2 bread for only a $1. Samosas were only .50 cents and came in beef or potato. Go potato! I really did not care for the beef. Our whole lunch was $14 and we even had leftovers to bring home. <br><br>We are so happy we found this place. It is open 24/7. The interior is not very fancy, so don&#39;t expect very much. But I promise you the food is amazing.",

"reviewcomment":"Always a great place from our arrival to our departure the host greeted us promptly,the waitress was great (redhead I think) from Chicago but lived in Pittsburgh ,food was amazing as the Clark street location your water glass was never empty and the manager walked to every table n asked if everything was ok . And yes it was A OK!<br>It was so busy, guessing it was a hockeygame since almost everyone had a team jersey or jacket on, but even with all those people everyone still did an amazing <br>Job. The olive oil was infused with herbs and went perfect with the perfectly warmed bread, the chicken paradelle was outstanding n came with Vesuvio potatoes <br>Which were done to perfection, I almost<br>Licked the plate.if you are I&#39;m chicago and want to have great dining experience then this is the place you want!!",

"reviewcomment":"I went to Fleming&#39;s this evening for there &#34;5 for $6 til 7&#34; happy hour. Like always they didn&#39;t disappoint. The bar area is first come first serve and you seat yourself. We sat in the back booth and let the ordering begin.What a bargain it is because the food and drinks are top notch. We ordered 6 Blueberry Lemon Drop Martini&#39;s (Yum), Cedar Roasted Mushroom and Artichoke Flatbread (Delicious), Shrimp, Brie platter, and a Bacon Burger with fries. Can you believe for the 3 of us our bill only amounted to $23 a person for all that food?!?!?<br><br>The service is excellent.Our waitress wasn&#39;t overbearing, but would check on us. The noise level is perfect and we were able to enjoy our 3 hour conversation without feeling rushed. The owner (I presume he was the owner) was great and he came over to check on us as well.This is an awesome place to catch up, share some laughs, and eat/drink wonderful food.<br><br>The only possible con is there are only about 3 TVs. I know for happy hour some people find that a big requirement to see them everywhere. Doesn&#39;t bother me one bit though. Last, but not least I gotta mention the chocolate mints they have when you come in. I have like 5 in my purse there so good.  I can&#39;t wait to come back here and try there dinner menu.",

"reviewcomment":"I can&#39;t speak on how McGee&#39;s is normally but I can speak on the 25th annual  Headsucker Crawfish Boil. <br><br>I had never truly tasted fresh Crawfish and with a price of only 20 dollars in advance you were able to be apart of the crawfish madness.<br><br>I was disappointed that our friend came and she wasn&#39;t able too get in because they had sold out.  I know for next year get my ticket early and have my tail at the door when they first open.<br><br>We got there about 12:30 and it was a whirlwind of crawfish madness, but not in a bad way.  I was a bit overwhelmed at first because of the amount of people that were in the place.  The line twisted and turned around the bar like a large anaconda snake and I swear I thought they weren&#39;t going to have any more Crawfish by the time we got up to the grill but they had plenty.<br><br>The Crawfish was boiled with corn and potatoes, but the corn was pretty spicy and the potato was still hard that was my only negative about the food at the boil.<br><br>They also had Red beans and Rice, Gumbo and I want to say Jambalaya.  My favorite was the Gumbo it was that ooo ooo we good and I definitely had my fill of that dish.<br><br>Since it was so packed we went outside and sat on the side of the restaurant and we found out later that the reason they call the event Headsucker is because you pull the crawfish apart suck out the juice from the head and eat the bottom like a lobster.  I just couldn&#39;t do it though it had some yellow stuff in the head which we read was the best part of the crawfish and it was completely safe to eat.  Maybe I will try it next year baby steps is all I can say.<br><br>After we finished our healthy serving of crawfish we went in for round two and the good thing was the line wasn&#39;t as long but the place was still packed.  When we were about to head back out there was this guy standing at the door letting us know we could not leave back out with our crawfish, now IDK y and I didn&#39;t ask we just headed to the back in hopes of finding a table.  This is when I&#39;m glad I&#39;m tall because I had to walk with my red container over my head and since we couldn&#39;t find a table we went to the bar and that ended up being the best non seats in the place.<br><br>The drinks were kind of pricey and for 10 dollars I want more than a half of a plastic cup of liquor and the rest ice...ijs.<br><br>Now, why am I glad we were forced to go back because the crowd was awesome and fun singing the old school as well as the new school songs.  People were buying us rounds of beer and not looking for nothing.  It felt like back in the day when people were just friendly and that&#39;s the feel I got from this event.<br><br>They also had a live band but we never really made it into the room to enjoy their music.<br><br>The bathrooms were horrid though but I will say that if you only have two stalls and hundreds of women idk how you could keep up and keep it clean but after all the Bud Light I had to go no matter what I may have done if we weren&#39;t at this event.<br><br>I have seen other Crawfish Boils in the city for triple the amount of this one and when I see the photos they don&#39;t come close to McGee&#39;s Headsucker Crawfish Boil.<br><br>This is the event to be at because the food was great, the people were friendly and music made you want to dance.<br><br>If you missed it this year make sure you try and make it next year but just remember get your ticket early and get to the place early to avoid some of the crawfish madness.<br><br>SN: Yelp was also there representing and I was glad to be an Elite because we got an amazing towel.  Fun Times!!!<br><br>Enjoy!",

"reviewcomment":"ZABIHA HALAL! Yay! I had dinner here on a Sunday night at about 9:30PM. The place was packed! It was a good sign as it was our first time here and we were worried if it would be good lol. There is a parking lot in the front which is awesomeeee. And the restaurant is separated into a dining area and one side is like the kitchen, right when u enter. The decor is simple - there are large, beautiful pictures of different structures in the Middle East. Looks stunning. Lots of space for people sit. <br><br>Ok food was awesome. I would recommend the Middle Eastern fare over the American burgers etc. Those were good...but not amazing. We got a small bowl of salad and another plate of olives and beets when we sat down. My husband and i shared an entree and had a cheeseburger and a hamburger. The entree was their combination (shish taouk, kefta kabob and shish kabob) ... O.M.G. The shish taouk is grilled chicken breast marinated in spices and it was SO GOOD - moist &amp; smokey. The shish kabob was epic too...cooked perfectly! We did not order the rice for anything...just had fries...but next time we go, will definitely try their rice.<br><br>One thing that was kind of annoying - we initially wanted to order gyros, but they were out. But...i mean we were there on a Sunday night half an hour before closing. I don&#39;t blame them. The service was prompt and polite...made up for it :)",

Dishes are in good size with fair price. <br>It almost becomes the official restaurant when we order for a group.<br><br>Try all these:<br>- Appetizers: the chicken stick and the eel seaweed salad <br>- The saute lamb (I think they only have one lamb dish so you won&#39;t miss it, it&#39;s very delicious)<br>- Crispy Tofu With Spicy Salt &amp; Pepper <br>- Bacon &amp; Mushroom In Creamy White Sauce Spaghetti<br>- Pork Chop baked rice (tomato or curry sauce) <br>- One vege dish <br><br>All above will be enough for 6-8 people.<br>For the drink, order Jasmine milk tea or Almond milk tea (That&#39;s what i get every time)<br>Their teas are all good.",

"reviewcomment":"I love THEORY!! :) This is my go to happy hour spot and I take everyone here. Every day of the week there are specials (even the weekends). The service is great, the location is great, and the owner is definitely great. Such a friendly young guy that goes around and greets all of the patrons. Once me and my girls came in here and his friends were sitting at one of the table. He made them move so we could sit down. Another time my friends and I came after work to celebrate my friends new job and he gave us all free shots....see a trend. The owner is great, so it makes the establishment great. <br><br>I would definitely recommend the steak quesadillas. I get them every time I come here. Recently I went away from my normal drink and tried the Salted Carmeltini....delicious! Another plus is the music and it&#39;s definitely a great place to watch a game. Sometimes I have spent 4+ hours here in one visit.",

"reviewcomment":"Ok. So 24/7 Mexican places tend to have...second-rate reputations. Arturo&#39;s however, I find to exceed those reputations.<br><br>The first thing to note is the bang for your buck. Portions are generous, bottomless chips and salsa with your meal, the drinks (from Horchata to Margaritas) are very large as well as delicious. I should warn you thought that this can go both ways, one drink and you will probably need to call a cab. One pitcher and you better be more than two people splitting.<br><br>Now the food. I&#39;ve tried plenty of things here, but what keeps me coming back is the Al Pastor, this place has some of the better Al Pastor that I have had in Chicago. The only place that clearly tops it is in LA... not exactly within reach on a late night around town. The taco dinner and burrito dinner are the go to options for me, although I make my girlfriend order the Tampiqueña only so I can consume half of the gargantuan plate after finishing my own. They sometimes tend to overcook the steak though, so if you&#39;re not a fan of shoe-leather steak, let them now! The dinner comes well equipped, with a few sides, it&#39;s delicious and filling.<br><br>Now the service. This is were I take away a star. There is one server here, Marta, that will take care of you like you were her child. If it were up to her I would have to roll myself out of this place every time, she knows what I want before I want it and brings plenty of it. She&#39;s polite and friendly. Some of the other staff can be really off-putting. They don&#39;t greet you, or even acknowledge you until they are ready to take your order.  It happens even when it&#39;s not busy, which is what is annoying. If I am the only table in there say hi! If you are swarmed I totally understand. <br><br>Ultimately, this colorfully decorated place is worth the visit if you ever need some hangover food. God knows there is nothing better for hangover food than Mexican, and this place will spare you the trouble of visiting something like Flash Taco! <br>Not that you have to be drunk to enjoy the meal though",

With the name *Lucky Platter* i was expecting an Asian joint....u know like Poo Poo Platter but this one is **LUCKY*** =] <br><br>So this place looks like a mom and pop place...it was cute. When I entered it was PACKED! I mean I was worried I wasn&#39;t going to be able to have time to eat here.... but magically, we got sat very quickly!!<br><br>The waiter came very quickly, and i picked the Mexican Omelet.... and I mean, I love Omelets so I expect them to be the same everywhere else.... but MAN OH MAN!!! This omelet was INSANELY GOOD!!!!!!!! The chorizo with the black beans and cheese with AVOCADO for a filling was orgasmic!!!<br><br>My classmate had the Florentine Benedict, and I tried a bite for curiosity...and OMG ALSO AMAZING!!!!!!!!! it was different! Poached egg, with spinach, ham, and instead of toasted bread, it was TOASTED CORN BREAD!!! SOOO FREAKING DELICIOUS!!!<br><br>I definitely recommend this place... its super far from where i live but if i am ever in the area, I know where I will go EAT!!",

They tease you with their two-tierced version of this mouth orgy by offering the version pictured with this review for $25 and Lord knows how much bigger this thing&#39;d get at the $48 price. <br><br>Reckon -that- biggie-d up size platter of goodness would be selected for very serious occasions, like actually achieving world peace or owning a damn pair of earbuds that don&#39;t whorishly snake around every single thing it shouldn&#39;t.

"reviewcomment":"Whoever came up with the idea for this place is getting lots of kudos from me! <br><br>This is a Mediterranean place where you order style + meat (think Chipotle, but with falafels in bowls/pitas/etc.). Then imagine instead of telling someone what you want, you just walk down a buffet style line and pile on as much hummus, chick peas, salad, etc as you want. It&#39;s really a great deal -- really getting your bang for the buck. <br><br>Friend and I wandered for about 30 minutes near Lincoln Park &amp; Lakeview hoping to try something new. We chose here because we are both pretty health conscious, and it&#39;s an inexpensive and healthy choice for us!",

Gawk at all the cock!  Originally, I was not going to go because during the first e-mail, it mentioned it was the Barleycorn on Kenzie, but when I found it out it was Wrigleyville, I wanted to shoot myself.  UGH!  But in the end it was all worth it.  Collin, our bartender, gave Beth, myself, and Morgen free drinks.  And did I mention he was adorable too?  I met these lovely couple and it just turned out to be a blast..minus the TRAGIC people whom should have stayed fully clothed...<br><br>Coming here was a special occasion. Would I come here again?  Not for Wrigleyville as it is more of a &#34;college&#34; feel...and unless everyone is going to be in their underwear like Minibar, I think you can pass, especially if you like diversity.<br><br>Environment: This place is not as nice on the one on Kenzie.  Perhaps they wanted that more &#34;dive&#34; look, but I do like the fact how the bottom is more for a drink spot whereas the top floor was more for dancing.  And it was very spacious indeed.  I did not feel claustrophobic for a second.  So much space, I was able to do spread eagles!<br><br>Employees: The bussers were very attentive and once the drinks were down, they were gone soon after.  They wanted that place to be top-notch looking.  Collin.  Cute, 24....:D  with a very nice smile.  More to that he was attentive and quick with the customers.  Two thumbs up.<br><br>Drinks: <br>Vodka Soda: More vodka, less soda..that&#39;s how I like it.  Strong!  YUM! 5/5<br>Long Island Iced Tea: More liquor than anything.  That is how I like it.  More alcohol equals more dancing!  Drop it lowww!!!! 5/5<br><br>Cost: The whole time I was there, it was only 5 bucks.  I cannot complain!  Liquor + men - clothes but undies.  Successful event!",

Really glad we opted for just 2 cheeses vs. the platter with all cheeses - it would have been huge!  That would be great for a party of 4 or more.  I got the scallops as an entree, and was not blown away, but my partner in cheese crime got the farro vegetable bowl and enjoyed it.  We will certainly be back for wine and cheese (the other apps we saw coming out all looked very nice as well) and I loved the bar seating so much, I might purposefully go without a reservation!",

"reviewcomment":"I&#39;m really surprised to see all the negative reviews, Fornello hit the spot for us.<br><br>We came in late on a Saturday and were probably 1 of 5 tables occupied at about 9pm. The décor of the restaurant was new-looking and accommodating, unlike some very similar places that are dated and cram all diners together like sardines, despite serving the same type of cuisine. The 80&#39;s-sounding Italian music was fitting at first, but after about an hour, we grew a bit tired of it.<br><br>Nick, our server, was probably the best waiter I&#39;ve had in months. He was friendly, knowledgeable, funny, and went out of his way to get us what we wanted and make our experience great, even at a seemingly unwelcoming time of 9pm. Questions were answered in great detail, recommendations given, check-ups regular, and yet it didn&#39;t seem like he was hovering or rushing us in the least bit. <br><br>The bread with red sauce and cheese was surprisingly tasty, even after I had my doubts that there was no traditional olive oil to be found on the table.<br><br>We started with bruschetta, and did pay the upcharge for added prosciutto, which was worth it, and I highly recommend it.<br><br>Next, salads all around. 2 Caesars and one caprese, which were all monstrous, we probably should have just gotten 2 total salads for our group of 3. The Caesars were delicious, not under or over dressed, complete with what tasted like homemade croutons and fresh parm shavings. The caprese was simple, yet good. I have a weak spot for fresh and thick mozzarella cheese, commonly found in caprese. <br><br>Next, I ordered a drink. Can&#39;t recall the name, but it was of the martini/cocktail variety that I believe contained gin, berries, mint and chocolate, but it tasted similar to a sweet coconut. This was just fair, and I&#39;m not sure it was quite worth the $10+ I paid for it. Probably should have gotten some vino instead. <br><br>Even after bruschetta and salad, we ordered our own entrees. The veal marsala was pretty good and very tender, sauce was even better. My friend&#39;s Brick chicken was also a pleasant surprise. He opted to pay over $25 for the whole bird, and planned on taking some home. The sauce was quite flavorful, and the chicken cooked perfectly, and seasoned well with a crispy outside and tender inside. Our waiter kindly bagged up the rest at the end of the meal, gave him specific reheating instructions, and even had the chef cook up a special batch of extra sauce at no cost! Awesome. Lastly, I opted for one of the signature/special dishes which was stuffed gnocchi. I get this at most Italian places, its one of my favorite dishes whether it be cheese or potato stuffed or with pesto/other sauce. Fornello&#39;s stuffed gnocchi contained asiago cheese and was topped with a brandy butter sauce. I opted to add grilled chicken as well, which was a pretty good decision, otherwise my entire entrée would have been a bit mushy in consistency. The gnocchi were cooked perfectly, and the sauce had some great bite to it. The fusion of asiago and brandy with the grilled chicken was a great combination. The sauce did seem a bit powerful at times, but nothing that warranted a complaint or negative feedback.<br><br>After we had finished gorging, a friend opted for a bizarre 10pm cup of coffee. I know this probably isn&#39;t the most crucial item to judge at Fornello, but he reported that the coffee was terrible, and didn&#39;t finish it. Maybe that&#39;s what you get for ordering coffee at 10pm at an Italian restaurant, maybe you other yelpers should avoid the coffee altogether? I&#39;m not exactly sure. <br><br>Now for the bill. We discussed with Nick how we wanted the bill split up, and he made sure it was correct before bringing it. Most hasty servers aren&#39;t this careful, and the level of communication was very assuring, making the financial aspect of our meal painless, despite our confusing splits.<br><br>Overall, I give Fornello 4 solid stars. The service stood out the most to us and I wish Nick could be my server at every restaurant I go to. The food was tasty, but just a tad bit pricey, and the drink also didn&#39;t impress me with a sticker price of over $10. These are the primary reasons for subtracting a star, along with the fact that I seldom give 5 star ratings, as the experience has to be textbook perfect to deserve a perfect rating. This is a solid neighborhood Italian place that shouldn&#39;t disappoint you, and I&#39;m sure we will be in again.",

"reviewcomment":"Went back to Benny&#39;s on Tuesday after a visit last year.  Have been testing all of the top 32 Chicago steak houses and Benny&#39;s was unintentionally the first one I had visited, so wanted to go back now that I had a chance to experience many of the others.  I had remembered it as quite good but the memory was not as powerful as some of the other great steak houses.<br><br>Turns out that Benny&#39;s is clearly top-5 and can compete for #1.  Was with some friends and had an incredible appetizer, their maple cured bacon.  I have had the bacon appetizer at some other steak houses, can&#39;t really miss on it, but this was probably the best.  The bacon, better described as pork belly, was fantastic.  We were four people and could not finish it, and believe me all of  us have big appetites.  We also had a salmon tartare appetizer with 5 types of caviar that was great.<br><br>My entree was the natural prime bone-in NY strip.  I normally go ribeye but a review in Chicago mag prompted me to go crazy and try this.  I was expecting to be disappointed but it was fantastic.  Cooked exactly as i requested, very flavorful but also perfectly tender, almost ribeye-esque.  It comes with a sauce, which was okay but don&#39;t know why you ever would use a steak sauce with a great steak.<br><br>The sides were awesome, or 2/3 were.  My strongest memory of the my first trip to Benny&#39;s was the blue cheese potato croquettes and they did not disappoint.  If you like blue cheese, these are awesome.  I also loved the crisp kale.  No idea what to expect and tried it just to find out.  May have been my favorite part of the meal.  It had a nice citrus flavor and was almost like potato chips.  The one disappointment was the truffle fries.  The fries were not particularly crispy (which is normally how I like them) and even the truffle flavor was not that powerful.<br><br>We had two desserts and I don&#39;t consider myself that qualified to comment on them, as I am not a big dessert guy.  Everyone loved the huge piece of carrot cake, and the icing was fantastic.  Also, an interesting decomposed smore as a cheesecake entree.<br><br>Overall, a fantastic meal and solid contender for best steak house in Chicago.",

"reviewcomment":"I super love this place.<br><br>Let&#39;s start with the food. It was amazing, honestly. I had a Groupon with three other people so we tried a little bit of everything. We all shared the:<br><br>Buffalo chips: buffalo sauce, two types of cheese, and ranch dressing. What&#39;s not to love? They do come out on bbq chips- like Lay&#39;s bbq chips- so that was a little weird but it was still good. Also super huge portion.<br><br>Rib tips: I&#39;m usually not a rip tip fan but these were done very well. Everyone else agreed.<br><br>Pulled pork: this is my favorite thing here. I think it is done so well- possibly the best pulled pork I&#39;ve ever had.<br><br>Hot beef sirloin sandwich: Holy cow was this amazing. It&#39;s topped with buffalo sauce, cheddar, and onions. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever seen an item like this at a bbq place and I loved it.<br><br>Sides: tater tots, coleslaw, baked beans, and roasted potatoes: All great, again. The most surprising were the roasted potatoes, actually. Wasn&#39;t plain like I expected.<br><br>Add in that it&#39;s BYOB? Awesome. Back patio? Great. I also really like the open kitchen vibe and how everything is just kind of there. The bathroom is also super clean, which is always a plus.",

"reviewcomment":"I came here for what I always get - The Mother Clucker with extra Tequila-Lime Sauce. It has been a long, long time since I have had it. It was just the same as I last ate it. Nothing has changed, except the presentation. Before, the burrito was sliced in half and served as is. Now, each half is propped on its end so all the juices and sauces stay within the burrito.<br><br>This burrito is for protein lovers - nothing but pure protein deliciousness. The Tequila-Lime Marinated Grilled Chicken Breast was moist and tender. The burnt edges give it a nice crunch and flavor. The Tequila-Lime Sauce is sweet with a slight tang. The onions and cilantro were fresh. The onions gave it a nice texture contrast from the chicken breast. While being oversized can be good and satisfying, it can bad. Near the end of finishing up the burrito, it gets a little boring because of the same taste and textural consistencies of the burrito fillings.<br><br>Overall, I love this massive burrito and it is not expensive for this amount of flavorful meat. I love with extra Tequila-Lime sauce. It gets messy as you eat closer to the ends because the burrito halves were propped on its ends. The only exception when dining at Carbón is that I would definitely get the Stelote if the steak was freshly grilled and the burrito was made right off the grill. Definitely get The Mother Clucker or the Stelote if it&#39;s right off the grill. Hopefully, you can finish it in one sitting.",

However, I did think $10 for a bowl of French onion was kinda pricey. <br><br>I had the hanger steak &amp; swapped out the spinach for brussels sprouts. Steak was tender &amp; cooked perfectly. The fries were for the most part delicious. Though there were a few that had been cut too thick so they weren&#39;t cooked through. <br><br>Friend had the lamb bolognese which they described as good but could have used a bit more spice too it.  <br><br>Overall a good little neighborhood cafe!",

Your sauce is a little too watery and the other places don&#39;t put enough in their pizzas. But Pequod knows how to do it right.<br><br>The ingredients? All taste fresh and seasoned perfectly. The meatballs and sausages are to die for and all the veggies are portioned out into the right amount so that no one takes over the entire taste of the pizza.<br><br>I hope we can still be friends.

"reviewcomment":"South Water Kitchen is flying way under the radar. This hidden gem is tucked in Hotel Monaco (also recommended) in the Loop, so it&#39;s possible it&#39;s obscured by tourists and business folk. Well, I happen to be one of those business folks who lunches there periodically, and like others have said, it&#39;s a great spot for a classy work meal. I&#39;ve also been for dinner a handful of times, particularly my parents are in town (they love it too!). <br><br>Every time I&#39;ve visited, lunch or dinner, I&#39;ve had a great meal. Most recently, I enjoyed the scallops and I always get the deviled eggs. The deviled eggs are aMAHzing (in my Penny from Happy Endings voice), but I think they changed the recipe or preparation or something. Previously they have been fluffier...can I call an egg fluffy? Anyway, I just did. This past time the eggs were a little more subdued. But no matter what vivid adjective I use to describe these delectable deviled eggs, they&#39;re still delicious and I will get them time and time again!<br><br>I&#39;ve been to a lot of restaurants in Chicago, but this is one I always come back to. There&#39;s nothing flashy or super trendy about it, but I know I&#39;ll always get a great meal and great service at South Water Kitchen.",

"reviewcomment":"As is my tradition, I am writing a long overdue review after being a customer at this place for years.  <br><br>Simply put, Laschet&#39;s is the best German restaurant in Chicago from an all-around standpoint (food quality, service, atmosphere, breadth of items on the menu, and beer selection).  Unlike many of the old standby German places in Chicago (Zum Deutchen Eck, Golden Ox, Schuliens, etc) Laschet&#39;s has survived the times with their mission in tact, thanks to relatively new owners  Matt and Mannie Lodge (Hey, they&#39;ve owned it since 2007, but the place has been here since 1971!).  <br><br>There are specialties that other places might excel at (Schnitzel at Resis, Goulash at Mirabell, Rouladen at Edelweiss, etc.), but Laschet&#39;s has an all-around menu and everything is done very nicely. The new owners have helped to liven up the interior and add a sidewalk cafe, and they very kindly have my favorite, their EXCELLENT Chicken Paprikash available for carry out more nights than the menu lets on.  (I hope I haven&#39;t ruined my chances of getting it on Thursday nights for carry out now that I&#39;ve let the secret out!).<br><br>Whether you are dining in, waiting for carry out, or just hanging out with the regulars at the bar to catch the Cubs/Hawks/Bulls/Bears games, what you immediately notice is the warm friendly atmosphere.  And if you scan the place, you will notice that everyone has a smile on their face because they are enjoying themselves.  <br><br>Thank you Matt and Mannie for NOT turning Laschet&#39;s into yet another meaningless faux Irish Pub!<br><br>Danke, Laschet&#39;s! Sie sind so sehr gut!",

"reviewcomment":"This particular locale is the best the E&amp;C chain has to offer in the Chicago area, both for ambiance, service and food. From what I remember of my excitement of being at E&amp;C on Temple Bar in Dublin as a 10 year old tourist, the Adams Street E&amp;C is very similar. While the name is kitschy and seemingly British or Irish, the local Dubliners seemed to think they were dining in an American pub, not the other way around. While many dishes are characteristic to Great Britain, they&#39;re often served more American in style and taste. That said, I enjoy both sides of the Atlantic for what E&amp;C is: a pub with some good food and good beer, with a few less common options not seen often in the Chicago area. <br><br>The fish and chips were quite tasty, with a good sized piece of fish covering the entire plate and an ample portion of fresh made fries. My friend ordered the lamb burger on a gluten-free bun (which she said was one of the best she&#39;s ever had) and the other, the chicken fingers. We polished off our meals and beer on special and were quite happy with our choices. My gluten-free/celiac friend ordered a gluten-free alcohol cider that she loved.<br><br>What was memorable was our helpful server. One of my friends has to eat gluten free, and our server was so helpful with that, going back to the kitchen a few times to ask if certain items were gluten free. It helped that E&amp;C serves gluten free bread and rolls on all their menu items that are served with/on bread.",

"reviewcomment":"I&#39;ve gone by High Dive a million times and went to many of the surrounding bars however I finally got to stop in last night. It wasn&#39;t very busy at all with just some random people at the bar and a couple tables in the side room full. They had some good music playing and sports going on their televisions. My friend and I planned to go in as they were having a special Half Acre pairing going on Sunday thru Thursday this week. <br><br>I got there before my buddy and bellied up to the bar. I  was pleasantly surprised by their craft beer selection but they had a great draft menu, as well, ranging from $5.50-$8 for the brews. They also had Lagunitas IPA on tap special for the night for just $4! Not bad at all. They seem to have specials every night on drinks then food specials Tuesday-Thursday. 35 cent wings on Tuesdays! I started my night with a $6 Jinx Proof from Three Floyds.<br><br>Both bartenders I had that night were super friendly, on top of things and just overall really knowledgeable about the drinks. I was slightly sad that for the special Half Acre pairing they didn&#39;t yet have the collab beer with Three Floyds in yet (SheWolf) wah wah. However, the pairings were an amazing value. They were all priced at $13 which including a full meal and a pint. Heyoka was paired with a Pimento grilled cheese, Alpenglow black IPA with some kind of steak sandwich and  Pony Pils was paired with Fish &amp; Chips. I went with the Fish &amp; Chips which was made with mahi mahi, perfectly crisp battering over three large strips. They came with a not-the-norm tartar sauce but I&#39;m totally blanking on what special ingredient was in it. It was awesome though! The dish also came with sweet potato chips which were a bit salty but I really enjoyed them. The portion was so huge that I brought home leftovers!<br><br>My final drink of the night was a 2023m2 which I had never had before or even seen on a menu! It looks to be a pretty rare one and was $7.50 for the pint...not bad at all for a more exclusive beer.<br><br>I&#39;d like to see what High Dive has on their normal menu, but I&#39;m also really hoping they add the mahi mahi &amp; chips to their normal menu.

"reviewcomment":"I have had an incredibly stressful year. I was on the verge of tears from frustration, stress and anxiety and then my friend and I decided to get Persian food. I suggested Pars Cove, since it was a Persian restaurant i hadn&#39;t been to and looked cute enough when I passed by it. <br><br>We had the best lady-friend date I have ever had. When I walked in, I was really amused by how cute the restaurant was. I really liked the ambience. I was excited to see my friend and talk about crap, and the waitress came by a few times asking if we were ready to order. The menu was limited, but we ended up just getting two entrees even though they had some sort of special. Basically two entrees, desserts, an appetizer and a pitcher of Sangria for $60 or something super cheap. I ordered the Beef Sultani and my friend got the vegetarian plate with fesenjan sauce. A server dropped off an appetizer sampler plate, and said that it was on the house. I was shocked! I also felt bad, because I&#39;m a horrible Persian. I don&#39;t like most of the traditional Persian meals/foods/etc. However, since it was free, I felt obligated to at least dip some bread into the options. It was a nice serving of hummus, Salad Shirazi with some feta crumbles, Salad Olivieh (potato salad), Tapenade (some olive thing), and something with eggplants and grape leaves. The bread was very good and I was surprised how much I liked the grape leaves dish. <br><br>I got a plain salad, and my friend got the lentil soup. Those were fine. Our main entrees were good. My sultani wasn&#39;t exactly to my liking, it tasted more like generic middle eastern kabob than the Persian seasoning that I&#39;m accustomed to. I believe the kabob already had a nice dosing of sumac, and our table didn&#39;t have any sumac, salt or pepper on the table. It would&#39;ve been nice, but definitely not necessary. The rice was less than I expected as well... only because most Persian restaurants give you about half a plate of rice. I&#39;m sure if I asked for more rice, I would&#39;ve gotten some. It was nice that they gave like a scoop of white Persian rice and a scoop of Baghali rice (dill rice with lima beans), and both were very good. I asked for some parsley, and the got a few sprigs as well as a little cup of mush-e khiar (cucumber yogurt). It was all really good and almost too much. <br><br>After our meal, we got free dessert! It was a scoop of vanilla ice cream, with honey and I think sour cherry preserves on top with a little zulbia on top. So much food already, I ate as much as I could but I was stuffed. When our bill came, it was only $30 some dollars and we got free red roses. We made sure to tip as if we were charged for each dish we received for free and the service was so good, it was well deserved. They rewarded our &#39;generous&#39; tip with free cups of tea. <br><br>I&#39;m surprised to see that some people have different experience than us, but overall I cannot wait to go back to this location. The service was extraordinarily better than any Persian restaurant I&#39;ve ever gone to. Most of the other Chicago Persian restaurants have great food, but their service is just meh. Also, the rose is definitely a nice touch and makes me feel appreciated as a customer.",

"reviewcomment":"I came here lured and intrigued by the dim sum Sunday brunch.<br>I have to say that this a much better dim sum than the one tried in Chinatown, which was just awful and definitely not my thing.<br>The dim sum bunch at Koi has definitely some tasty items such as the shrimp cakes and spinach wraps. The great thing that these are small bites and that you can try a lot of items on the menu. The Jasmine tea is just delicious and bottomless mimosas are great as well. <br>I think my favorite items on the dim sum menu were the sweets, they are really tasty and unique and I don&#39;t know any place that offers them.<br>The service on Sunday is little rushed, there was one waiter that really stood out, and he rolled with the dim sum cart and explained everything in great detail and what he had. The other dim sum cart driver was not that great. The waiter was kind a non- existent, I am not sure what he was doing but he was not by my table. The one dim sum cart guy was like my waiter eventhough it was obvious it was not his job. I hope that he is compensated for his hard work because he really became my server.<br>Overall, I would recommend this dim sum Sunday brunch experience it is a lot of fun and there are some great finds.....its like a dim sum scavenger hunt.",

"reviewcomment":"we had such a great dinner here. We failed to make a reservation (first mistake) so we had a pretty nice little wait in the &#34;bar&#34; area. They are BYOB so the bar is just for waiting. Luckily we had a couple of bottles of wine so they gave us glasses and we got the party started. Waiting isn&#39;t so bad with a glass of wine in hand. Once we got seated they apologized again for the wait and we ordered a couple of appetizers (ceviche and Papa a la Huancaina) and both were so delicious! We also loved the dipping sauce they put on the table for the bread (so much that it pretty much ended up on everything)<br>We shared a few entrees so I can definitely speak to the ceviche, the tilapia and the chicken dishes and say that all are fantastic. <br><br>Great food combined with great service = a great evening. go!",

The place is dimly lit, narrow, has no tables (only a long bar along the side wall with stools) and has a chalk wall full of customers&#39; doodles. Walk along the barstools to the way back and you&#39;ll be greeted at the register by the most helpful, laidback dudes. Look at their menu and you&#39;re like, &#34;What? This all sounds like gourmet pizza!&#34; Eat the pizza and you&#39;ll be sold by the crispy, almost-tastes-like-it-was-fried-by-the-cheese-­grease crust. <br><br>My party of four ordered a large Patate e Rosmarino pizza, it was delicious and huge. (We took home about a quarter of the pizza and snacked on it all night). The wait time for a pizza made from scratch was pretty reasonable, and actually a lot faster than I anticipated.

I had been to the Elly&#39;s location in Norridge before and remembered good things about it so I thought it would be a good place to satisfy my hunger.<br>The food- I had a build your own skillet (chorizo, chihuahua cheese, avocado and sour cream), the portions were HUGE(took half of it to-go). The pancakes were <a href='/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbomb.com&amp;s=bb4f996415a9c2f21137e27cfb68f439a48cec2652b53e9b50dd7e766dbe177e' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>bomb.com</a>, I scarfed those bad boys down in about 2 mins. The orange juice was delicious. The hash browns in my skillet could have been cooked a little longer.<br>The service- Service is a huge thing for me, the slightest mistake/hint of attitude really ruins the whole visit for me. Our server was good at first, was a little rude during the time he took our orders because midway he stopped and turned to other guests.. never came back during our meal until we were done,(although, maybe he saw me demolish the pancakes and thought she is not one to be bothered..) the seating is a bit weird.

"reviewcomment":"I love this place and have had nearly everything on the menu. A great spot, sort of hidden among the warehouses of the meatpacking district, but that makes it all the better. I honestly have not found a sandwich I have enjoyed better in all of Chicago. Whether the gyro, the Italian sausage, the pork belly, or the special of the day, the quality is ALWAYS top notch. My boyfriend and I go there regularly and the menu changes frequently, so there is usually something new to try. The environment is slightly chaotic during busy times and everyone shares a table, but that all contributes to the charm. There is also outside seating which we prefer in the summer.<br><br>In regards to the deli/butcher section, it is very expensive. $20 for a marinated chicken breast! But they do have some things you will have trouble finding elsewhere such as boudin noir, and various pates. Additionally, they have fresh eggs, chicken and beef and veggie broths, and lots of fresh bread.<br><br>I highly recommend this place to everyone.",

Great place to have an awkward conversation about breaking up, coming out of the closet, or going back into the closet after breaking up.<br><br>Hot towels upon entrance. Very classy and effective if you don&#39;t know where your date&#39;s hands have been (perhaps more so if you do!). In this weather I wish they had a full body version.<br><br>Super attentive service. The waitstaff are friendly and helpful with menu item choices. <br><br>The drink service is superb! <br><br>The dirty and regular &#39;sake-tini&#39; pack more punch than a Bruce Lee movie (or Bruce Leroy if you catch the above reference). Honestly you&#39;d have to go to boystown to find a cock-tail pairing this good (sake, cucumber and kettle one vodka - the dirty version uses unfiltered sake).  [Also, if you don&#39;t mind radiating fellow humans and killing tens of thousands of civilians - you can request the nagasaki-tini version - I hear Truman loved it.] <br><br>But we&#39;re talking about food! <br><br>Sushi Must Tries include:<br>Summer Roll<br>Tuna Kamikaze Maki<br>Spider Roll<br><br>Noodle Must Tries include:<br>Thai Ocean Noodle (have never seen anywhere else)<br>Nabeyaki Udon<br><br>Lastly - though not exactly &#39;cheap&#39; the sushi chef combos aren&#39;t too expensive and when I&#39;ve ordered have never disappointed. Considering that half the reviews include disclaimers involving Groupon, TravelZoo, or some other deal site - you can&#39;t go wrong going this route especially when you&#39;re getting it for less than retail.",

I don&#39;t realize there were three locations but this one in La Grange is situated in a nice area where you can park right next door, eat, and go for a short walk across the street and get yourself some froyo.<br><br>We ordered the full slab of ribs and second meat with two sides, which is a good deal for two people to split. The ribs had that perfect pink smoke ring, and we had the brisket which was juicy, not dried out. This came with q-pops which had a soft but firm texture with the corn. Sides are not very large (about the size of your palm) but you realize that the meat is the real star here.<br><br>Each table has an assortment of sauces for you to dip your food into, and I fell for the sweet Memphis sauce. It gave everything a nice layer of smooth sweetness to accentuate the smoke flavor. I found myself dipping the q-pops and corn bread into it too!<br><br>Definitely a place I would come to again.",

I have eaten in before and it&#39;s byob, but it&#39;s kind of small/crowded and I honestly just want the pizza so I pick up. Their pizza is fast, wood-fired and affordable. Their vegetable soup is delicious too. The only reason I don&#39;t give this place 4 stars is because of the service. They are never friendly and I dread calling them to place my order b/c I feel like I&#39;m bothering them. <br><br>MUST TRIES:<br>- Their bruschetta (with feta and tomatoes....never had bruschetta like this and it&#39;s amazing)<br>- Spinacchi pizza - their spinach and garlic pizza is what I crave all day every day!",

"reviewcomment":"This place is pretty good. I got the Tirokafteri  (red hot peppers blended with fet cheese) and the Garides Scharas (Five char-grilled jumbo shrimp marinated in olive oil). The Tirokafteri was alright. It wasn&#39;t what I was expecting. It looked like ice cream, but it was a spread that you put on bread (definitely get the pita). It was pretty good nonetheless, just very rich and hearty. The shrimp was great! I loved it! It was cooked to perfection. I didn&#39;t get the rice that comes with it, so I got a side of green beans instead (which were your typical cooked beans). I think I would get the potatoes next time.  <br><br>I would come back for the atmosphere and the entrees. The staff was friendly. Maybe too friendly since they would come over and check every 5 minutes, but that was fine. :-) They were nice. The setting is very great for a casual night out/date/outing with friends. I felt as though I entered a different country. <br><br>I would come back.",

"reviewcomment":"This little Chinese restaurant excites me like no other in Washington DC.  After moved to DC I was very disappointed at the Chinatown&#39;s ethnic Chinese food. I thought I will check out the Chicago Chinatown to see if there is anything authentic.  The Chinatown here is spread out, not as much as LA, but was not compact like in London, England.  I was looking for another restaurant following Yelp&#39;s review.  I stumble on this one on the way.  I looked inside, it was full at just 6 pm.  The food on people&#39;s table looks like real Cantonese food from Hong Kong and not American Chop Suey.  So I changed venue for dinner.  It is a small place, had a seating about 50, if there is no table, you have to wait standing by the door.  You also have to put your name on a clipboard on the left near the door, so when there is a table free, the service staff will call your name.  <br><br>Boy! The food was just like what you would find a little tiny restro in Hong Kong or Guangzhou or the Chinatown in London.  I had Fried Smelt Fish with Spicy Salt &amp; Pepper, Beef Ribs in Honey &amp; Black Pepper Sauce, Choy Sum with Garlic and White Rice, a Buddha Beer, tea.  The price was so good that I could eat there every day.  <br><br>I want to relocate this restaurant to DC so I could eat there all the time.",

This place doesn&#39;t get ahead of itself.<br><br>So far I&#39;ve smashed an extra large ribtip combo and put it to rest with a friend. Its a generous size with tips, links, fries, and bread. Specifically enough to feed about 4 people but there&#39;s no judging on Yelp. All of it was damn good including the cole slaw and baked beans we had as extras. I&#39;ve looked for a go to bbq joint in the city for a while and it&#39;s safe to say I found it. The menu will be cruised through real soon.<br><br>Truth is is that this place is pretty divey looking and thats definitely not a make or break with me because thats usually where some good food comes from. But some more truth is that the workers are pretty unprofessional. There was literally a shouting match between the workers and no attentiveness. They were also pretty much running out of everything on a Friday night, 7pm. The wait on a rack was 45 min. <br><br>My advice would be to call in no matter if you want to dine-in or not.",

The food was pretty authentic too, but you have to ask for it, say that you want it drier, or smokier, and the chef is happy to oblige. The lady who handled our table was extremely friendly and very helpful, when they didn&#39;t have dessert, they offered us almond cookies for free instead as well as kept the green tea going. <br><br>We had the Yen&#39;s garlic beef, the crab Rangoon and the moo shu chicken. I wasn&#39;t a fan of the plum sauce that comes with the chicken, but everything else was really good. We also tried the healthy chicken stir fry and that was amazing. We asked for the beef to be made Mongolian style- more dry and smoky- nad they were happy to oblige. The lady even made our wraps for us at the table- super nice of her! Everything was well seasoned and flavored. And 30 bucks for 3 people (no booze) is a steal. Thanks Yen, I&#39;ll be back!",

The are also consistently good like the food quality doesnt fall off... to be fair I dont change up my order too much.<br><br>I mean I&#39;ve tried Panang Curry from other places when i&#39;m like... too lazy to get up and go across the street and I want something delivered, but i&#39;m too embaressed to have someone deliver food across the street so i try another places Tofu panang and it&#39;s soupy, not the perfectly balanced spicy&#39;savory/sweet like at Spoon Thai, the tofu isnt awesome and delicious like at Spoon Thai...they dont have the awesome vegetables and special touches with presentation that Spoon Thai has..... I think I had one other place ever that did this dish ALMOST as good as Spoon Thai but it still wasnt as good as Spoon Thai and also I forget which place it was. So. That place is dead to me. <br><br>If you&#39;re looking for a good Panang give this place a shot. The Red and Yellow curries are also delicious. The tofu is done right here and tastes really yummy and not gross. I love Spoon Thai. Very good crab rangoon here too.

The portions are huge, the prices are more than fair (they always have coupons on Groupon, <a href='/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FRestaurant.com&amp;s=0aab4cbd731f3d3b0d1453050d3abc56a8c80bd214e25469c7555b750dca8a51' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>Restaurant.com</a>, etc!), the food is better than great, and the ambiance is the most comforting blend of classy-casual around.<br><br>The fried chicken is the best I&#39;ve ever had. And I&#39;m from the South, y&#39;all! :-) They have live jazz some nights, and there is often a long line. Weeknights and Saturday morning brunch usually means that you can walk in and take a seat right away.<br><br>Get the Saint your first time and then branch out from there. Everything is wonderful (except the biscuit - do not order the biscuit), but you have to start with the classic. The dinner options are great and the red beans and rice is SO wonderful. <br><br>I have taken dozens of friends here when they come to visit, and everyone loves it and agrees that it is some of the best food they have ever had. Please go, and enjoy!<br><br>P.S. They also deliver, but I think you need to go in your first time. The atmosphere is cool and the food tastes considerably better fresh.",

If you like double-fried chicken, I highly suggest stopping here. I was disappointed they didn&#39;t have much in the way of beers on tap, just two choices that were both hoppy. They have Bang Bang pie shop pies, but the day I was there they only had cheesecake, which seemed too heavy and rich after having a bunch of fried food. The chairs inside were super uncomfortable, especially since I sat there for a while waiting for the chicken to arrive. <br><br>I might go back on a nice day to enjoy their outside area. Overall it was a great experience, but probably not worth having to wait for a table if I had gone later in the evening.",

"reviewcomment":"Taxim has quickly become one of our favorite places to visit.  We have come here with a party of 2 and with a party of 12.  We have been dressed up and we have been wearing hoodies.  The overall decor is nice and the light fixtures are stunning.   Every time we visit, we have experienced very good service.  We are unfamiliar with Greek wine, but our servers always offer samples to assure we are happy with the wine we order (much appreciated). <br><br>My favorite dish from the &#34;Salads and Vegetables&#34; section of the menu is the Fakés Kas. Fróssos - lentils with house made feta and a balsamic reduction.  The acidity of the vinegar balances the lentils perfectly, and the feta is unbelievable.  <br><br>In the small plates section, you must try the fried cauliflower with capers and the wood grilled octopus with fennel.  The octopus is charred nicely and I love the crispy ends.  If you&#39;re being adventurous, get the ouzo (an anis flavored apertif) that is paired with the octopus.  <br><br>For entrees, you cannot go wrong with either of the lamb dishes**.  The duck gyro is also delicious, but it is a bit underwhelming in comparison to the ridiculously good lamb dishes.  <br><br>Overall, if you&#39;re looking to have a wonderful and authentic Greek/Mediterranean experience, Taxim is your place.  If you&#39;ve been on the fence about visiting Taxim or simply haven&#39;t gotten around to it yet, Taxim should shoot to the top of your list.<br><br>**I was watching TV the other day and my Tivo changed the channel to record an old episode of Iron Chef.  The Chef of Taxim, David Schneider, was the challenger at kitchen stadium!  I know, I know, it&#39;s old news, but I thought it was cool.  The secret ingredient was lamb, and the judges went nuts over his main entree.  This chef knows lamb.",

You&#39;ll notice the different spelling and style, but the food very much speaks for itself.  Do go here, whether you are a vegetarian or not. The food is excellent and does have spice.<br><br>Details wise: the Bhindi (Okra) Massala was awesome, and had a great spice kick to it. I also suggest getting a chaat, as those are very unique. Anyone who hasn&#39;t had that style of indian cuisine will likely enjoy that. Also the naan is excellent, although I couldn&#39;t detect much of a kick in the spicy naan that was offered.<br><br>It&#39;s also really busy and space is a bit crammed, so that may take away from the experience a little.

"reviewcomment":"I&#39;ve lived in the area for a few years and decided to finally check the place out since there was a Groupon for it. Agami looked like it would be an expensive place, so I&#39;ve always avoided it. The interior was really nice. I was actually surprised at how nice and spacious it was...it seems like a restaurant you&#39;d find downtown. My dining partner and I were seated at a booth in front of the sushi bar and noise levels were at a minimum. <br><br>We ordered a shrimp shumai appetizer and 4 rolls. The shrimp shumai was decent, but 4 shumais for $7 is kind of ridiculous. You&#39;ll get better tasting ones for almost half the price at Furama. The sushi rolls were pretty good, but again on the pricey side...good thing we had that Groupon! What was a bit annoying was the amount of ginger and wasabi that came with the rolls, it seemed like they were there for decorative purposes. We asked for more and the waitress came back with generous portions. <br><br>Overall a good experience, but I&#39;m still thinking if I would come back without a Groupon.",

"reviewcomment":"It doesn&#39;t get any better than this for a quick lunch in the Loop. Came here for lunch with my friend and we both ordered  shrimp tortas. My friend wanted hers with no cheese. When I went up to get out food, the chef told us that they accidentally made two with cheese, and that he needed to make a new one without cheese. I didn&#39;t really care about waiting at all, at least he caught it before she ate it. But then he asked if I wanted him to wrap one up to go home, and gave us some guac and chips to snack on while my friend was waiting. Superb service for a restaurant in a food court! Now on to the actual food itself. <br><br>The tortas were amazing-- I think I may have liked these better than the couple of ones I tried at Xoco-- crunchy on the outside from being grilled and soft and delicious on the inside. There was plenty of shrimp and avocado in the sandwich too. Definitely will go back. My coworkers are hooked too- one said it was the best meal he&#39;s ever had downtown. Again, not bad for a restaurant in a Macy&#39;s food court. Oh yeah, the guac isn&#39;t bad either.",

"reviewcomment":"It was expensive, but the food was excellent. <br><br>The gimmick is the Mike&#39;s Special. Tell your server some ingredients that you like and  don&#39;t like, and Mike will whip up (an allegedly) one-of-a-kind maki for your table with some unusual ingredients. We went for this option and were served a generously sized smoky, salty roll with shiitake mushrooms, avocado, white tuna and truffle oil. Pretty cool and definitely unique. <br><br>We also ordered some nigiri, which is where I feel like Mike really justified his fairly steep prices. The fish was excellent and (in addition to all of the standards) they had my favorites: raw scallop and uni. Both were awesome and were pretty generous servings. <br><br>It&#39;s BYOB and street parking is available on the block.<br><br>I&#39;m adding &#34;eat at Tanoshii all the time&#34; to my list of &#34;things to do when I have more money.&#34; (My favorite thing to daydream about).",

"reviewcomment":"We just had Connie&#39;s cater our wedding on May 16, 2014 at the Wilder Mansion in Elmhurst. It was amazing! The table cloths were beautiful, the food was so good and best of all the Connie&#39;s catering staff knocked it out of the park! Julio was a dream to work with! He was so attentive to all of our questions, needs and requests!!<br><br>Food:  We had filet mignon with red wine reduction, lasagna, potatoes and vegetables. The hors d&#39;oeuvres were caprese skewers and lampchop lollipops. Everything tasted fresh and wonderful. I loved the filet especially.<br><br>Service: Amazing! Julio brought my plate to the table so I wouldn&#39;t get it on my dress and then were able to mingle more with our guests. The servers were more than attentive and so polite. Everything was magnificent!<br><br>Bar: The bar was great! I heard nothing but wonderful things about the service. <br><br>Everyone at my wedding was so impressed and I am a long time customer. I used to go to Connie&#39;s on Archer as a kid and will continue to go and enjoy the pizza! I will  use Connie&#39;s catering again! Thank you so much again for making our day!",

If you want some delicious, authentic Thai instead of that Joy&#39;s Noodles crap, you&#39;ve come to the right place, my friend.<br><br>Their beef panang curry is bar none. I tried Rosded&#39;s version, because everyone raves about them, but was sorely disappointed. Not even close! Siam&#39;s Thai iced tea is the best too. It&#39;s not super sweet or eerily colored like many other Thai places.<br><br>Here&#39;s the bucket list: green curry pork, basil duck, nam tok with sticky rice, papaya salad, thai chicken wings and chicken pad ka prao topped with fried egg. I almost forgot the beef pad kee mao. In your face, bland pad whatever!<br><br>When I came for thai soup when I was sick, the nice lady who runs the place gave me a cup of jasmine tea on the house. Their delivery guy is pretty cool, and the food always arrived hot. I gave him all the CDs I didn&#39;t want to drag along during my move. <br><br>Maybe they will deliver all the way to the edge of Ukrainian Village sometime. No dice? &#39;Dis ain&#39;t ova!",

"reviewcomment":"We came here Friday night to sit outside and enjoy some dinner and it was great. We had to wait a bit for a table, but no biggie as we scored two seats at the bar. They have a nice beer list, but I of course, stuck with white wine. My BF had a dark IPA that he liked out of a cask. Our waiter outside was great - he could have been someone off of Portlandia. <br><br>We started with the hummus and it was awesome! I was not expecting this. It was topped with cilantro, black beans and jalapeno&#39;s. I want to try making that at home. For our dinner, we split the fish tacos and it was perfect for the two of us. We each got a taco and it came with black beans and chips n salsa. They were delish. <br><br>I would definitely come back here again - especially to sit outside in the little patio area.",

"reviewcomment":"We tried the Winter 2014 All-Day Pass (blue line) which essentially is the whole tasting menu. It lasted for more than 4 hours and consisted of 20 mini courses, each reflecting the history of Chicago. I absolutely love the theme, and it brought a level of intellectual depth to the food tasting experience that a nerd like me loved. The screens up above wrapping around the interior of the restaurant were also playing images from Chicago history. The waiters were all very professional and knowledgeable, and it was impressive how they were able to talk and do their food preparation magic at the same time. For each course, they would bring out a little truck or some kind of display that would then serve the food.<br><br>The food itself was a bit above average, but nothing spectacular. I would say that the little bites of food was more interesting than tasty. The presentation definitely excelled above all else. It was an experience - not a fantastic taste-bud experience per se, but a dining experience. That said, my favorites of the night was the venison and the wagyu beef, which were very good.<br><br>The only two things I would say were negatives were: the waiters were a bit snobbish and rolled their eyes at us more than once, and when I requested a cocktail that was &#34;light, strong, tequila based, and not too sweet,&#34; the guy brought out a .... *drum roll* tequila sunrise. Tequila with orange juice. Hmm, not super creative there huh? Well, for a michelin restaurant and a hefty price tag, I would expect the sommelier to use a bit more imagination in the cocktail, at least as much as was put into the courses themselves.<br><br>At the end of the night, we got to take away the menus, and also a little gift bag with some popcorn, which was a nice gesture. I really liked how the meal ended - on these peppermint chocolate ice cream balls - that was super refreshing and really cleansed the palate. Would I back again? Maybe. They do switch up their tasting menus every season. But I wouldn&#39;t expect some culinary feat, just a long and enjoyable experience, almost like theater.",

They were good and the apparent manager made good on the Philly once I told him. Who woulda guessed they had Philly fries on the menu. Great service and no extra charge for my communication problem. <br><br>Way to go. I&#39;m coming back!",

"reviewcomment":"What a gem! A solid brunch spot with an abundance of choices, you honestly can&#39;t go wrong. Bring your vegetarian friends! Bring your vegan friends! Bring your hungover friends! Bring your kids! This place accommodates all. <br><br>The place is always packed when I go for brunch on the weekends, yet somehow they manage to seat me within 15 minutes of walking in each time I&#39;ve gone.  So far, I&#39;ve had The Lady Marmalade, Pollo Loco, and their steak omelette. Everything was wonderful, but I think they do Mexican breakfast items particularly well. Their house potatoes are exploding with flavor and taste great alone or accompanying any item on the menu. <br><br>Service was friendly and prompt. They look like they are having a good time, and that&#39;s always fun to see. <br><br>Honestly, the only problem is that everything sounds good and it is much too hard to choose only one item. The only way to solve this problem is for me to go back until I&#39;ve tried everything! Challenge happily accepted.",

It was byob so we stopped at half acre brewing on our way to this and scored some beverages. <br><br>In short this class was good. Our instructor/owner was very knowledgeable about his version of BBQ-low and slow,sauce on the side. He explained how to cook a brisket, pulled pork, pork ribs,corn bread, and Mac n cheese.  Just after each explanation, he gave us samples. And these were not little samples but decent sized portions. <br><br>Each items was tender,juicy, and delicious.  My favorite was the brisket but each was outstanding.  We got three separate sauces on the side to take home.  An excellent time.",

"reviewcomment":"My boyfriend and I came to Cooper&#39;s last Sunday to grab a bite to eat with another couple.  I wasn&#39;t super excited since I was tired and not the biggest BBQ fan, but this place suprised me in a good way.<br><br>We were only one of 3 tables seated, and the place was very cute and relaxed.  I didn&#39;t even realize that we stayed a little past closing since nobody rushed or pressured us; it wasn&#39;t until they turned off the lights after we walked out that I realized and felt bad.  Great service overall.<br><br>The beer list was absolutely huge.  They have Alpha King which is one of my personal faves.  Having been to a Cubs game earlier in the day, my boyfriend and I weren&#39;t starving so we shared the Pesto Chicken Panini with a side salad (yes, I got salad on his plate and he actually ate it).  The panini wasn&#39;t what I was expecting and was actually like Chicken Salad with pesto instead of (or in additional to) mayo.  It was so delicious.  I would definitely get it again, but am also wanting to try other menu items including the disco fries &amp; pizza.<br><br>This isn&#39;t exaclty in my neighborhood, but with easy street parking on Belmont, I will deifnitely be back.  If my second expierence is as good as the first, I can definitely forsee an increase to a 5 star rating!",

There were some screens still showing some sports so it was good for those not participating in trivia.<br><br>The specials are good and cheap.<br><br>The only downside is the food.

"reviewcomment":"We love the Portage!  We go 3-4 times a year, and it&#39;s always a great meal and a good time. Quay is a consummate host, he always greets us warmly and goes out of his way to make sure we are comfortable. The rest of the staff is equally friendly and welcoming, even the bus staff remember us and say hello. <br><br>We&#39;ve loved The Portage since before the Check Please! episode, and since it seems like that publicity is drawing a sightly wider audience I want to address some of the issues raised in the other reviews. It&#39;s true that on the whole The Portage&#39;s portions are not on the scale of the giant servings of, say your average corporate restaurant. OTOH, this evening my husband had the pork shank, which was a pound of pork, a generous helping of delicious polenta (and hubby isn&#39;t a huge polenta fan usually, but he ate it all up) . We shared two appetizers (the tuna tartare and the bacon wrapped dates, both awesome) , he had the pork and I had the brisket, also delicious, and we each had a dessert (he loves their not-sticky-sweet cobblers--tonight&#39;s was cherry, I had the greek yogurt cheesecake which was to die for). We are both feeling very well fed. I would suggest that if you feel like you need large amounts of food you order the larger servings--your server can recommend, or head around the corner to Leadbelly&#39;s for giant burgers and fries. There&#39;s a place for appropriate-sized portions of carefully prepared food. The Portage does this excellently. <br><br>Another thing The Portage&#39;s chef does excellently is fatty meats. I realize that a good pork belly or short rib or brisket isn&#39;t everybody&#39;s  thing, but if you like a nice marbled cut of meat The Portage does them tender, seasoned amazingly and paired with other flavor-enhancing sides, like the pickled shaved asparagus and jus-soaking rice cake I had with my brisket this evening. Yum. <br><br>Yes. sometimes the service is a little slow, like it might be if you were dining at a friend&#39;s house and they got caught up in conversation and laid out the appetizers a few minutes late. We&#39;ve never had truly bad service, and the friendliness and attentiveness of the staff more than makes up for a little slow timing once in a while. I&#39;m the sort of person who doesn&#39;t mind lingering over my drink a little longer while my appetizer is prepared, or while I finish my wine at the end of the meal before the check comes. I will say that on the occasions we have had to rush off to a movie or something, making that clear to the staff has expedited things for us. <br><br>Please come out to our neck of the woods and check out The Portage. It&#39;s a great combo of fine dining, great drinks and food, and one of the friendliest owners and staff I can think of.",

My Italian husband suggested we order delivery from here, and considering we live on the street behind them, I was quite amused by his laziness. <br><br>We ordered the hummus (the best I&#39;ve ever had), a selection of bread pies (they are small, so you can order three and share), and the classic Shawerma sandwich. Our order came within 25 minutes and the delivery person was incredibly sweet. Everything was so delicious! I loved every single item we ordered.

"reviewcomment":"During my 5-night stay at theWit, I ate at State &amp; Lake for several meals.  My experiences there include a good mix of time frames and busyness, so I feel pretty comfortable in saying that I have a good reading of the place overall.  I enjoyed each meal and had wonderful service as well.  Two of my favorite dishes are the chicken &amp; waffles and butcher burger w/ fries.  <br><br>A couple servers who stand out are Paige and Luiz (sp?).  They were very friendly and attentive.  The manager was genuinely welcoming and was very attentive to the servers as well as guests.  One morning, I witnessed a patron approach the manager with a (ridiculous) complaint/suggestion and he handled it very professionally.  I was cringing inwardly at what the patron was saying; but the manager did a great job at listening and then appeasing him.  I&#39;ve never worked in the food service industry, but I definitely appreciate the hard work that these people put in.  <br><br>Whether you&#39;re a guest at theWit or not, I highly recommend you visit State &amp; Lake.<br><br>TL;DR Great food / Excellent staff.  Go there.",

"reviewcomment":"I remember when I was a kid and there were a few mom and pop places in the Loop. They are mainly gone. That is sad as you know what you are getting at Jmmy John&#39;s, but it means a lack of diversity in food. I mean how can there be that many Subways in the Loop? <br><br>That said, this has become my favorite place to eat in the Loop. I mean I love this place! I have never had anything that I did not like. <br><br>I am very big on the Shish ka bab sandwich now. I prefer the lamb. It is not made in advance, there is about a 7 minute wait. Isn&#39;t it great to wait for something that is being made and not microwaved! Okay, I have had it with the tomatoes and cucumbers which is great, but one day they put roasted peppers on it and it was just incredible!<br><br>I just noticed they have sugar free Baclava, can that even exist?<br><br>Seriously, it&#39;s less than eating at the wretched Panda Express or Mc Donalds and I suspect this may even be healthy!",

"reviewcomment":"Oh my goodness gracious! Filippo&#39;s has some legit Italian food. My friend and I went for dinner last weej, semi-randomly, and were surprised at how fabulous the food was! It&#39;s a bit pricey but rest assured the prices are completely justified by fresh ingredients and truly mouth watering dishes.<br><br>The meal starts with complimentary bread and olive oil, yum! In addition complimentary eggplant. Both of these starters are amazing and it&#39;s a nice touch from the restaurant. <br><br>Portobella Alla Griglia $13 - Divine appetizer to get our meal going. I have a slight obsession with mushrooms and particularly portobellas. This mushroom was grilled well, sitting atop a bed of spinach with a yummy sauce.<br>Fettuccine Bis $18 - What struck out to me instantly with this dish was how creamy it was and how fresh all the vegetables both looked &amp; tasted. It was chocked full of mushrooms, peas &amp; broccoli, as well as ham. I don&#39;t know if they handmake their noodles but they sure tasted like they were. I had already eaten so much at this point I could only have a few bites before nearing explosion. I was able to take this to go &amp; enjoy the next day. I highly recommend this dish!<br>Flourless Chocolate Espresso Torte - Even though I was near a dying point in my fullness level, there&#39;s always room for dessert right!? Especially if it&#39;s chocolate. The flourless torte was so indulgent and rich, with just the right kick of espresso to amp up the chocolate. Loved it!<br><br>My only fault is it was so cold inside. The restaurant got pretty full at dinner but even with all those people I was absolutely freezing. Br!",

The naan is amazing. Lamb vandaloo is like a lamb stew with some curry with rice and it is delicious.

If you are OK with that, the place is a gold mine for the beer lover with a great tap selection and an expertly curated and properly stored bottle list that will have something for all tastes in beer. Well, perhaps excepting Bud Light drinkers. :)<br><br>The staff are knowledgable and really enjoy talking beer and metal. We were well looked after and had a great time. I can&#39;t comment on the food as their kitchen was closed, but I was only there for the beers anyway!<br><br>My only criticism is that they put all the tap beers on a blackboard as you walk in, and there are no printed beer lists for the tap selection. This is easily solved by snapping a quick photo as you pass the board. Voila! Instant beer list. :)<br><br>Check the place out for sure.",

"reviewcomment":"Union Pizzeria a SOLID choice for an Artisan style Pizza OR for smaller artisan dishes. Union also has awesome drink choices and is one of the few places you can leave the barkeep to make you a cocktail to his or her preference, if of course cocktails are your thing. <br><br>The ambiance is very nice too. The space is very open yet there is sound absorbent material so it doesn&#39;t get overly loud. There is plenty of comfortable seating at tables, couches, or at the bar. <br><br>The only reason Union doesn&#39;t get 5 stars from me is the lack of &#39;filling&#39; cuisine options and relatively expensive prices for the cuisine itself.",

Fresh fruits and veggies, meats, rice and noodles and all the little extras to bring your bowl to life just the way you want it. <br><br>The bar is stocked with some good beers and drinks even though I stick to water and fountain drinks usually through dinner. <br><br>The one thing I can recommend is the chocolate storm dessert. It&#39;s your well known hot brownie and ice cream but I love it even though I&#39;m not the biggest sweet tooth person. <br><br>FT is a dining experience overall. Good for first dates I would say since its interactive and can be playful. Fairly priced and AYCE is the cherry on the top. <br><br>I would&#39;ve given out 5 stars had I not tried breakfast. It is good but I&#39;m more of a traditional breakfast diner. I associate FT with Asian flavored cuisine but just wanted to try the morning experience and it just didn&#39;t fare the same. But still a go to staple on those nights where everyones food choice is &#34;I don&#39;t know&#34;.",

I was skeptical about the freshness of the dim sum since it was after the lunch rush, but all the dishes came out fresh and great! Also, flavors were delicious as well. <br><br>I loved the: shrimp toast, har gow (shrimp dumplings), quail egg shu mai (never seen that before), chicken feet, turnip, turnip cake, beef tripe, shrimp rice rolls, and egg custard. We also ordered pork pan fried lo mien and that was great as well. They have a side menu of noodle dishes and I think Vietnamese dishes too. <br><br>Service was prompt/friendly and the free parking is definitely an added plus. I will definitely be returning for dim sum instead of trekking down to Chinatown! Great place to take friends/fam too.",

My favorite thing on their menu is seriously their chicken fingers and honey mustard.. perfectly breaded, not crunchy/hard, just YUM. So good! They also have drink/food specials every day that are worth the trip alone. <br><br>I will say that my experience of their servers has not always been the best - they tend to be slow on the uptake and disappear for lengthy amounts of time. It almost makes me want to leave 3 stars instead of 4.. but I&#39;ll give it another visit before I penalize on that.<br><br>Final Verdict:<br><br>If I&#39;m at work and we want to go to a bar and sit outside to eat - O&#39;Donovan&#39;s is always our first choice!",

Not only was the service quick and friendly, but very attentive to the children as well. She made sure the kids got the food so my friend and I could talk. <br>I am not usually a fan of &#34;pea anything&#34; but their split pea soup changed my mind! It was so delicious I could of had a second cup but I had also ordered a pulled pork sandwich with sweet potato fries. All of which is to die for!! The fries were cooked perfectly!! And the sandwich had the right amount of BBQ sauce so I could still eat the sandwich whole and not make a total mess of myself.<br>I haven&#39;t had the opportunity to go down for brunch yet, but I have only heard good things and can&#39;t wait to make the trip!!<br>Make sure of you get a chance to get down to Edgewater you definitely need to hit Nookies for a meal!!!",

Instantly you feel welcome when you come in.<br>Remember that friend from middle or high school who had a parent that was a great cook, so you always finagled an invitation to dinner? That parent works here (or a reasonable facsimile). The food is delicious, nothing disappoints. I am partial to the Chicken Fricassee and the Shrimp Capri. My son likes the chicken fingers (and he&#39;s a connoisseur, as you might guess) but I&#39;ve tried them and they are fresh and tasty. <br>Take a buddy, take the family to La Villa; you will have a great time!",

Everything can be extreme (salty, tangy, sweet), but it works so well in your mouth you want to keep eating. <br><br>Ask for the Thai special menus if you are adventurous, we often just order on that menus since I can get other stuff somewhere else. Our favorites are the tripe salad (not on menu it&#39;s a special that is taped on a wall there), thai bamboo with ground meat (not the curry, but the one on the special menu), and the Phrik King with crispy pork. The larb is delicious as well, and if they ask how spicy I&#39;d advise to say mild. I&#39;m pretty decent with spicy food and I&#39;m pretty sure by the end of the meal my tongue was a little numb. <br><br>Service has been good, very nice servers. The place is simple and clean.

Food was good and cheap but choices overwhelm at first. <br><br>I had a traditional stir fry with noodles and chicken, adding in vegetables, but unfortunately I didn&#39;t add in enough food. Make sure to full your bowl completely, because all the cooks do is fry it all up and serve it too you.",

"reviewcomment":"Papa joked with me and said that he gives free Spanish lessons on Fridays and Saturdays. I called on a Thursday and he said that the lesson he gave me when I ordered my jibaritos was a bonus. He jovially told me the Spanish words for the food I ordered. LOVED IT.<br><br>And then when I went to pick up my order I asked the nice lady at the counter about the friendly man who helped me on the phone. She pointed to the guy eating dinner behind me. At first I thought she was joking but no! He said he was Papa and that the woman at the counter was his sister. The other guy sitting with him was his son and the girl waiting tables was his daughter! I was like, &#34;Hold up! Is there anyone in here who isn&#39;t related to you?!&#34; Afterall, the place was teeny tiny and was kinda full...<br><br>Anyway, the food was scrumptious! M even said that it was better than my previous go-to Puerto Rican place (Borinquen on California). Later, she even asked me to pick it up for seconds! That&#39;s how yummy it was.<br><br>We absolutely loved our jibaritos with white cheese (we had a choice of white or orange and Papa said white was better). We also got Puerto Rican rice (Papa taught me the proper name for it but I forgot) and sweet plantains (again, I&#39;m letting him down).<br><br>This is my only complaint (and it&#39;s more about jibaritos in general and not this restaurant): jibaritos give me ungodly heartburn! They give M heartburn too! And we never get heartburn from anything else! I don&#39;t know what it is about jibaritos but it&#39;s the indulgence that hurts!",

When I called to make a reservation, we asked for two seats at the bar and the staff was ok with it.  Sitting at the bar is a lot more fun anyway.<br><br>The mussels were fantastic. They come in a flavorful curry broth that we didn&#39;t want to send back after the mussels were finished. We instead asked for bread to dip into the curry. <br><br>I had the sea bass which was cooked perfectly.",

"reviewcomment":"It&#39;s wild to me how many Michelin rated restaurants are now available in Skokie, IL!  Which should mean that it&#39;s wise for you to bookmark these places and create a chance to stop by while it&#39;s still hot shit.  And let&#39;s remember a very important detail here.. parking is regulated by Skokie meters which still accept nickels and dimes to purchase time.  Unlike Chicago&#39;s costly and unwise choice of using LAZ parking.<br><br>In the realm of Mediterranean &amp; Middle eastern cuisine, if that is of interest, this is a worthy venture.  If having a chance to stop in during a weekday, I insist trying their lunch special.  Get the plate with succulent chicken kabobs, Afghan rice and grilled veggies.  It&#39;s a grand feast that won&#39;t break the bank.  The Afghan rice is Basmati rice topped with caramelized carrot strips and raisins.  The colors will entice you and the taste will leave you wanting.  Another entree served with Afghan rice is the Kabuli Palau where the tasteful addition to the wonderful rice are tender morsels of braised lamb shank.  Very tasty.  Whenever I go back, it&#39;s my usual choice.  The food is very good and there aren&#39;t many items that would turn you off to Afghan cuisine.  Instead, perhaps turn you on to trying other Middle Eastern cuisines.<br><br>Service is alright.  Depending on whom is serving that day, you&#39;ll typically get a good, warm welcome and exit greeting.  Some servers fill the space with small talk and recommendations and others are shyer about it.  Check out the two hundred plus photos to get a feel for the place.  Quaint &amp; cozy to suit a date night or entertaining of a group.  Don&#39;t wait.",

Someone is gonna take 5 minutes on your order, and make the shit out of your coffee as if its the last cup they will ever make. If you can&#39;t tell the difference between coffee quality, then you should probably save $2 bucks by getting it at starbucks..or even $3 if you go to a gas station.<br><br>I am yet to experience staff unfriendliness mentioned in some reviews. Since I am a clean cut guy in his mid-thirties, wearing a North Face jacket on my way to the gym, I expect to be exactly the target for these rude hipster baristas.

Lighting is dim, tables are far apart in the dining room so you can have a private conversation without the table next to you hearing your every word, and the design of the place is very authentic.<br><br>We started out with a fantastic sausage and polenta appetizer, followed by the delicious stuffed chicken for an entree. For dessert we had caramel sponge cake which was deeelish! Service was also wonderful. We had two girls waiting on our table and they couldn&#39;t have been sweeter. I had read on Yelp there were some issues using a voucher but they hardly blinked when it was time to pay the bill. So no issues there. I will definitely be back again!",

"reviewcomment":"If someone says &#34;sushi&#34; and the first thing that comes to your mind is &#34;California roll&#34;, I am not sure if I should tell you to run to Kai Zan or avoid it like the plague. There is a lot more to sushi/Japanese food than the Americanized cream cheese and/or mayonnaise concoctions. If you are open-minded, Kai Zan is the place for you. If not (or, just not so much), you can still find plenty to eat here, but I think you&#39;d be missing out.  At the very least, I think everyone should come here and try at least one thing out of the box. You owe it to yourself.<br><br>As such, I tried a few things outside my normal Japanese wheelhouse (wheelpagoda?), and was glad I did - not just in that I had some semblance of an adventurous spirit, but because it was all really good. For some normalcy, my DC and I had a flaming tuna roll, and eel/cucumber roll, tamago, shishito peppers, and mussels. Exploration involved hamachi collar, oyster and uni shooters (not entirely weird I know, but I&#39;d never had either, and these had quail eggs in them - definitely not your normal shooters), and seared tongue. Yeah, I ate a cow&#39;s tongue. Never saw that one coming. DC told me it has the taste/texture of pot roast. DC was correct. Still...I can&#39;t believe what I put in my mouth. That&#39;s what *she* said. Oh, how I miss Michael Scott. At least when &#34;The Office&#34; was funny.<br><br>Remember - you owe it to yourself.",

You have to call and ask for it or else you will be waiting or be seated inside. I don&#39;t think a lot of ppl want to be seated inside when it&#39;s super nice out!  <br><br>Most of the servers and bartenders are good and attentive, some needs some polishing but overall pretty good.  Last time I sat at the outdoor bar and they had a little bee problem.

"reviewcomment":"A friend suggested that we have a drink at Embeya while waiting for a table for Avec, but we ended up just eating here since we got hungry, and it was not disappointing. We started off with two cocktails, which were 12 each. We got the Ao Dai (Novo Fogo aged cachaca, papaya cordial, peyschaud&#39;s bitters) and the Duke of Earl (Atlantico Reservation rum, tawny port, earl grey tea). I preferred the Duke of Earl. It actually really tasted like tea, but was not a weak drink!<br><br>For food, we got one cold, one hot, and one main dish. For the cold dish, we got the Young Mango (11), which was basically shaved thin slices of green mango with 4 pieces of cured bass, fiddlehead, mint, and Turkish lemon. It was light and refreshing. For the hot dish, we go the Grilled Quail (14) which was great. It was basted in honey and had a nice BBQ-ed taste to it. It came with a bunch of spices that we squeezed lime into to make a savory sauce. The meat was very tender and flavorful. For the main dish, we got the Rabbit Leg (29), which was my favorite part of our dinner experience. It came with fresh garbanzo, charred chipollini onions, and cumin. The sauce was so good that we didn&#39;t leave any in the dish. We literally ate it with a spoon...... The rabbit meat fell off the bone so easily and we didn&#39;t even need to use our knives. It was a generous hunk of meat, and the flavor was excellent. I would highly recommend it, especially if you have never tried rabbit before. Finally, for dessert, we got the Tofu Almond Custard (7) which came with preserved huckleberries and candied ginger. This is the only thing I would not recommend. I don&#39;t think it is worth the price, and you can get better at Dim Sum restaurants in Chinatown for a lot less.<br><br>Overall, a great restaurant. Service was slow, but friendly. They were really packed so we didn&#39;t expect to be taken care of that quickly at the bar, where we sat.",

If you&#39;re going in the morning, there&#39;s NO NEED to get your bagel toasted! It&#39;s fresh and warm and crunch and toasting it ruins the fresh texture. Trust me. I usually go with just light butter, or maybe one egg if I&#39;m feeling hungry.

"reviewcomment":"Oiistar. I pasted it once randomly one night and could not tell what it was, but I told myself &#34;that looks like a pretty cool place. I&#39;ll stop by next time&#34;. Next thing you know, my friend is taking me to this place he claims is popular for ramen, and BAM, right in front of me was Oiistar. The only thing that could pop up in my mind at the moment was &#34;man, I have a knack for stumbling onto trendy foodie places.&#34;<br><br>So we went in for lunch, and fortunately, it was on a slower side of business, so there was plenty of places to sit. We sat right up close to the chef. Looking at the menu, I can definitely see how this place is popular. The menu consisted of different type of buns, each with a gourmet-like twist. Right in the middle is a decent selection of ramen, some I believe have hints of Korean flavors while others are Japanese-American fusions. Right below are some interesting appetizers, with a few that seems more like Asian-European fusion. I went for the traditional pork belly bun, shared a plate of duxelle with my friend, and wrapped it up with the pozolmen ramen. The pork bun was great, with a nice tender texture topped with their signature sweet glaze. Though I have to admit, the duxelle was the center of my attention. Originally, it reminded me of an arancini (just a fancier version topped with caviar). But once I took a bite into it...man, it sure is not an arancini. The siracha-mayo mixed with avocado puree added a nice, subtle refreshing kick to the mushroom-pork belly stuffing. Very welled seasoned and perfectly cooked, with the outer layer being the main crispy texture needed to match the tenderness of the meat. Definitely worth it. Finally, onto the main dish. The soup was full of flavor and spicy. There was a good amount of ramen and meat, making it a perfect portion after our apps. But ironically, nothing too memorable about the ramen. It was great ramen, and it reminded me a bit of home cooking, but perhaps the exotic duxelle overshadow the ramen for me. Regardless, it was still one hell of a ramen dish.<br><br>Overall, a great place with some great asian fusion dishes. The ramen is obviously what they are popular for, but if you get a chance (and have some extra cash) try sharing some of the smaller plates. I think that the smaller plates are where you will be able to see more of their artistic culinary skills. Do I recommend this place? I think my writing speaks for itself.",

I have found many chain restaurants at most airports operate like an island with little connection to other stores. <br><br>Even if there is a long line they move fast. The employees are super efficient and generally have a smile and friendly disposition. It also helps to know what you want BEFORE you get to the order spot. If you want one of their shakes or malts you order that before you start your sandwich order. This helps the malt to be ready when your sandwich is and gets you on the way faster. <br><br>I almost always get the wreck sandwich on a wheat roll, a chocolate malt, and a bag of chocolate chip oatmeal cookies. This runs about $13 with tax and seems fairly reasonable considering food in airports is more expensive and the service here exceeds most other shops at Midway. <br><br>On occasion I&#39;ve had breakfast here and it&#39;s truly a gem considering some of the other breakfast options at Midway. There is a ham, egg, mushroom, and cheese sandwich that is super good. I wish they offered breakfast sandwiches later in the day too but I guess to remain efficient they have to limit it to mornings. <br><br>I&#39;ve not had any of the salads here so I can&#39;t really comment on those but sometimes I&#39;ve had the tomato soup and it&#39;s thick and rich. <br><br>If you&#39;ve never had Potbelly before they have a spot on their website for new customers and understanding the menu and fast ordering process. You won&#39;t be disappointed here.",

Basil/mozzarella, arugula, tomato and proscuitto. and of course extra virgin olive oil.<br><br>The heartsmart is nice if you are vegetarian. Also had the italian wrap - i think it was sopressata but i forget - with arugula and balsamic.<br><br>To top it off - probably one of the best canolis i&#39;ve had.<br><br>andddd, they deliver. which is a huge +.",

"reviewcomment":"I had heard plenty about Kan Zaman and when I had the chance to come check it out for myself I jumped. What I found was an incredibly welcoming establishment with great Mediterranean food and a fun vibe.<br><br>Packing a few bottles of wine to take advantage of the BYOB special I was surprised to see many open tables when we came in at 7:30 on a recent weekend. That quickly changed as the place filled up within a matter of 15 minutes. Judging by the large groups that came in, this is a perfect spot to bring friends together for a fun night.<br><br>The menu is large and features the tried and true staples you would expect including hummus dishes, pita, salads, falafel and shwarma meats. Starting with the vegetarian sample we were impressed by the flavors and volume we received.  Dinner followed with their Kafta kabob (a tasty blend of meats) and more falafel, both of which we delicious and left plenty of leftovers for lunch the next day.<br><br>Besides the food, the entertainment really sold the experience for me. Just as we were paying the bill our friendly waiter told us there was a surprise coming soon and we should drink our wine slowly so we didn&#39;t miss it. To our surprise the lights were soon turned off and a belly dancer entered the room complete with a headdress covered in flaming candles. The dancer proceeded to grab random people form tables to join her for a few minutes and the entire restaurant got in on the fun. <br><br>With the surprise entertainment, ability to bring your preferred drink (with only a $3 corking fee) and solid food I would love to come back here sometime soon.",

I guess I did, and I am glad.<br><br>It&#39;s a very nice, small, privately owned restaurant where it seems to be run by the family with the owners on the floor and the kids in the kitchen. It was clean, the owners provided excellent customer service and the food came fast and furious.<br><br>I had the Thai salad with peanut sauce and an order of fresh spring roll. They were both delicious, and hands down one of the best Thai food I have had. Did I mention their prices are extremely affordable? <br><br>If you are not looking for a fancy ambiance, but love good food, give it a whirl, you won&#39;t regret.",

Since my last review (and prior to that), we&#39;ve been here more than 6 or 7 times with and without a Groupon, and with just ourselves or large groups...we love it every time. <br><br>Please note that they have changed their wine selection - what you see on the wall (priced from $12 - $15) seems to no longer be their core wine list and they will provide you with an updated physical list...obviously a little pricier. <br><br>This time we tried the Black widow (soft shell crab, cucumber, topped w/ torched spicy tuna, spicy sauce&amp; yakiniku sauce). If you don&#39;t like a lot of yakiniku sauce on your sushi, this is a very happy medium. <br><br>The Snap Dragon was great if you like spicy sushi...you definitely get a burst of jalapeno flavor in each bite. <br><br>Service is still great, as is the crab rangoon...but I&#39;ve never met a crab rangoon I didn&#39;t like.",

Tandoori was okay but the curry is really where they shine. Keep in mind this is purely on what&#39;s available here in the States. Also, their naan has always been fresh, so that&#39;s a big plus for me.<br><br>The prices might seem a little high for some, not for me personally, but if you have a Wild card or come here during a celebration/holiday of some sort, you&#39;ll more often then not receive a discount of 10-15%.

Summer hours here are a bit later during the week, but they still close early on Fridays, perhaps to rest up for the weekend crowd.<br><br>The kids plates are a decent value - my kid likes the mac and cheese.

"reviewcomment":"My girlfriend and I came here last night for our anniversary and had such a great night. We got to sit at the chefs table and watch everything get prepared, which was awesome. Chef Zoe and the other chefs were really friendly and it was fun to watch them make the food. <br>The food was fucking delicious. Our favorite dishes were the little salmon rolls, which came with delicious soy sauce glaze stuff, the bruschetta with cheese and fava beans (we kept saying NO BEAN LEFT BEHIND because they were so tasty), the tuna tartare, which came with this crazy delicious avocado cream that I want to put on everything I eat forever, and the grilled octopus, which was the best, most tender,<br>flavorful octopus I&#39;ve ever tasted in my life, and I used to live in coastal Spain. <br>The service was so, so good. Kat and Michelle were so funny and nice and we&#39;re really helpful at picking out our drinks, all of which were straight up delicious, particularly Las palabras, a mezcal cocktail. They were all really smooth and yummy and the perfect amount of booze and miraculously did not give me a monster hangover today. <br>I can&#39;t wait to come back and eat/drink a thousand more things.",

"reviewcomment":"Finally found some authentic italian food in Chicago! Having recently moved back to Chicago I have desperately been looking and this is the place.<br><br>It feels like you are eating at someone&#39;s house for Sunday dinner. We went on a Saturday night and had reservations for 6:00. When we got there it was half capacity with mainly an older crowd.<br><br>The servers were amazing, so friendly and just all around made you feel at home. Food came out fast after placing the order.<br><br>THE FOOD! They give you focaccia bread to start which is so good and the keep it coming if you finish it. I started with the bolognese and my wife had the pear salad. Both were awesome, especially the bolognese. My wife had the chicken for her main and it was extremely good, crispy skin and tender chicken inside. I had the spare ribs with risotto, again amazing. Fall of the bone meat.<br><br>If I have any complaints it would be this. The atmosphere is a little quiet I&#39;d say. Mainly older people, still a good vibe though. The other thing I would warn people who are unfamiliar with italian cuisine is that the pastas are meant to be a first course and they are small, so most likely you will get a pasta and a main. It will run you about $35-$50 for both.<br><br>Food: 5<br>Service: 5 (but i&#39;d give it at 10)<br>Atmosphere: 4<br>Value: 4.5<br><br>Will be returning.",

"reviewcomment":"Cozy Noodles is a nice, homey, affordable sit-in restaurant. I highly recommend their Pad Thai (which is my favorite Thai dish anyways). Their crispy Pad Thai was much more crispy than I expected, so I think that I prefer the regular more. The crispy Pad Thai is definitely still worth it for those who like super crunchy dishes, though. <br><br>The chicken satay is a good appetizer with yummy sauce. The tom yum soup is also very good. I highly recommend their Crispy Cod Fish with any type of curry or without any at all. It is a good amount of fish for the amount of money paid, and it is pretty good! I got it with green curry, and I can attest to the quality of the curries that they have at this restaurant.<br><br>The servers are kind and there are candles at every table, giving the place a nice atmosphere. It is clean and comfortable inside. It&#39;s a perfect place to hang out with a small or large group of people, or just a meal for two.",

"reviewcomment":"It&#39;s a good thing I chose this place! It&#39;s in a community with a bunch of other Vietnamese, Chinese and Thai restaurants. My family went to Chicago, so my dad decided to drop us off at this Asian American enclave called Argyle.<br><br>I literally chose this place out of the blues, out of the randoms after my mom gave me $20 to go around, shop and eat. Sooooo....I just walked into this restaurant, because it had lots of customers. <br><br>So how about it? The food is awesome. I had their beef flank soup (I believe the name was Pho nam or something) with thick rice noodles, I had forgotten the name of the food, Vietnamese names are hard to remember. The soup was giant, but I somehow finished it. The soup is very flavorful too, I was expecting some overrated flavorless soup, but no - the Pho soups from here are very different. Their soups are about $6.50-$7.50, and their other dishes such as fried or marinated ones are about $9.50 at average.<br><br>I also had an appetizer of vegetable egg rolls (since I don&#39;t eat pork), two pieces is $2.50 and four pieces are $4.50. I had their two-piece egg rolls and they were good and to say the least &#34;authentic&#34;. They really did give their egg rolls that Southeast Asian twist, I know this because I am from Southeast Asia and Southeast Asian style egg and spring rolls, whether it be Thai, Vietnamese, Indonesian or Filipino are very distinct from Chinese ones especially with the wrappers they use.",

"reviewcomment":"This is a two part review. The first is about the food itself. The second pertains to an incident that happened and how they handled it.<br><br>1. We visit Panang once or twice a month when we want solid Thai food. It is inexpensive, yummy, and plentiful. No, it is not authentic as other places, but it is a great go-to. It&#39;s BYOB and the service is always prompt and friendly.<br><br>2. Now, here is what really made me write this review. On St. Patty&#39;s Day, we stopped in here after a long day of &#34;celebrating&#34;. To make a long story short, my friend lost her engagement ring. We didn&#39;t notice until we got back to our apartment after dinner. We called all the place we had visited that day, but no luck. Panang was the last place we called. Sure enough, one of the waitresses found it while she was sweeping the floor!<br><br>They allowed us to come back that night (even though they were closed) and retrieve the engagement ring. <br><br>Now, they could have lied and kept it and made a pretty penny. However, they were honest and happy to return it to us. Although I am not positive, I can assume this would not be the case at every restaurant out there.<br><br>We have always thought highly of the service at Panang. However, this elevated it even more!",

We got there sort of on the early side on a Saturday night, but it soon filled up, so reservations for prime time slots might be a good idea.<br><br>Food was delicious: French onion soup was awesome; roast duck was perfect, salads creative and tasty, and crepes a la mode sinful.  Wine list awesome.  Service will impress: personable, attentive. and very responsive.  The owner, Kiki himself, stopped by to say hello and helped make this a great find for us!  Valet parking guys are very cool and will take good care of you. <br><br>Oh, reserving that last star for our next visit here, but I&#39;m pretty sure it is coming soon!",

"reviewcomment":"I was looking for a place with a nice view to have dinner in Chicago. The restaurant is located right on the Chicago River. It offers an outside patio that is a must on a beautiful day. The beer/wine menu and dinner menu is small but has all the favorites you&#39;d expect at a gastro pub. <br>We started our dinner with their well known Popcorn made with bacon jalapeño and honey. What an amazing combination! It was spicy, sinful and sweet. I ordered the Short Ribs that was served with rapini and a baked potato. It was tasty but not spectacular. My date had the Steak and Frites which looked amazing. She loved the dish. <br>Overall a good restaurant with amazing views, all priced reasonably. It&#39;s a great date place on a beautiful day or just a place to hang out with friends located near the Magnificent Mile. I&#39;ll be back even if it&#39;s just for popcorn and beer.",

"reviewcomment":"Let&#39;s end 2013 on a high note, shall we? Yuki Hana is my favorite sushi restaurant in Chicago. Bold statement? Sure. I don&#39;t sling around the F word often, and when I do, I mean it dagnabit. <br><br>First, Yuki has $3 dine-in happy hour everything from 12-7pm. Maki, sashimi, nigiri, appetizers, soups, and drinks. We&#39;re talking white tuna rolls, salmon rolls, tempura sweet potato, the works. To top it off, it&#39;s quality sushi that even my sushi snob friends enjoy eating. Carry-out happy hour brings the total to $4/each, and delivery is $5/each. But really, $5 for an 8 piece roll of quality sushi is still a huge bargain. They have a really large selection of choices as well, which is great for large groups that even consist of vegetarians. <br><br>Here are my favorites:<br>Chi Town Heat <br>Broken Mountain<br>White Men Can&#39;t Jump<br>Chicago Fire<br>312<br><br>Second, they have a full dinner menu with Japanese noodle and rice dishes. There are often Groupons or <a href='/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FRestaurant.com&amp;s=0aab4cbd731f3d3b0d1453050d3abc56a8c80bd214e25469c7555b750dca8a51' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>Restaurant.com</a> deals you can buy to try on the entrees, which I do recommend at least once. They have a much larger sushi menu and all the rolls are named after movies. The Point Break Roll (red snapper, avocado, cucumber and sweet carrot with eel sauce, crumbs and torched spicy scallop) is my favorite. <br><br>Third, the staff is so nice. I&#39;ve been coming here most Friday nights for years now, and no matter who is taking my order, I always have a pleasant experience. The dining room is clean and inviting, the decor is forever changing, and the restrooms are always kept nicely. If you&#39;re doing HH, make sure to leave a bigger tip. Just because the prices are slashed, doesn&#39;t mean the service is. <br><br>Know before you go:<br>-Happy Hour is 12-7 and not a minute later- it&#39;s also cash only.<br>-They have an ATM<br>-$5 corkage fee (or buy a bottle from them for $12)<br>-They have a variety of saki also available during HH for $5<br>-They now have a sushi roll on the HH menu made with siracha, jalepeno, and ghost pepper, the hottest pepper in the world. For $5, it&#39;s worth the one time Anthony Bourdain-style experience. The staff don&#39;t judge you when you spit it out and ask to be hosed down when your mouth is quite literally on fire.",

He was knowledgeable able to make suggestions and modifications for us etc.<br><br>I can&#39;t think of anything to complain about and the food was really good both times.  I&#39;ll certainly be back.",

"reviewcomment":"My husband and I went to Barn &amp; Company for the first time last night and had a great experience. Though I was sure it wouldn&#39;t be necessary, I made a reservation on OpenTable and asked for a well-lit table. It wasn&#39;t very crowded when we arrived, and the servers seated us in a nice, very well-lit booth that was tucked away behind the bar. This was, I think, key to our enjoyment, as the place filled up very quickly and we were away from the crowd and the noise.<br><br>The beer selection is very good, and the service was prompt. It was the first hot day of the year, and our server kept our water glasses full.<br><br>Gary, the resident Barbecue Life Coach, approached our table when we were perusing the menu and recommended the duck legs, which were a special that evening. My husband had them, and I had the half chicken. Both were delicious, and the sauces were very tasty. We shared a side of mac and cheese, which was also very good. <br><br>Our check, which included two beers and a cocktail in addition to our food, came to $60. Not bad! We&#39;ll definitely be back.",

Cream cheese, spicy tuna, cucumber, avocado, and unagi sauce covered with tempura crumb. I am drooling just thinking about it! Their bowls are also surprisingly good.<br><br>I also love that this is a local business that you can tell is invested in every customer that comes in. Over the years I&#39;ve gotten to know the staff and it feels nice that when I come in with friends we are always greeted with warm smiles and genuinely friendly staff.<br><br>The only thing I will warn is that being a small, family run business this is the type of restaurant you go to to relax and enjoy company while waiting for your food. If you are in a rush or on a tight schedule, you may want to order ahead for carry out.",

It was all super fresh. The knife work was incredible. <br><br>They also have a huge menu for non-sushi eaters. Lots of different types of katsu and udon.<br><br>I wish I had found this place earlier! It has the &#34;I want to be a regular&#34; type vibe.

Hubs and I shared a sushi bowl and veggie tacos (very vegetarian friendly)- both were spectacular and mega fresh - and was the perfect amount of food for two reasonably hungry people.  The folks who (I think) own it were working the counter and were very pleasant and helped us decide on what to get.  Really good selection of bottled beverages to accompany, and have black and brown rice options for all meals.  The spicy sauce they have on the tables packs the perfect spice for my taste (not to hot, but hot enough and very flavorful).  I really like the decor and simplicity of the layout as well, very comfortable casual dining. (Cafeteria style -you order at the counter and find a seat and they bring your food to you).  <br><br>The best part - everything was really healthy, and there was no guilt after &#34;indulging&#34; in a wonderful meal!!  We can&#39;t wait to go back!!",

"reviewcomment":"Finding good brick-oven pizza is a priority for me, so when my now-wife introduced me to Serio&#39;s, I knew that I found my brick-oven pizza spot in Chicago. In my opinion, great pizza starts with great crust, and when Serio&#39;s pizza is fresh out of the oven, the crust is perfectly crisp on the outside and warm on the inside. The spinach pie is one of my favorites, sausage and peppers is good, and the chef&#39;s specials are often the way to go.<br><br>A GREAT beer list. Good beers on tap, and a fairly long list of bottled beers, including a nice selection of Belgian and Belgian-style beers. <br><br>If you like meatball subs, Serio&#39;s offering is solid. I also like the garlic bread.<br><br>The pizza is great, but I keep coming back because of the people who work there--very nice people, who make you feel welcome when you walk in.<br><br>Serio&#39;s is a great place for families--and Friday, Saturday and Sunday nights tend to draw a bigger family crowd early in the evening. But I&#39;ve never had to wait long to sit and the service is prompt. Lots of TVs, and if you sit at the bar, it&#39;s a nice place to watch a game and eat some great pizza.",

"reviewcomment":"I stopped counting the number of times I said, &#34;Wow&#34; because it seemed like I said it every single bite. <br><br>Freddy&#39;s is a tiny Italian restaurant and grocery. They have things from Italian sweets to homemade sauce, truffle oil and homemade pasta. It&#39;s great because you can stuff your face while you&#39;re there and then take home your weight in yummy food for dinner that night.<br><br>We stopped in for lunch and ordered more food than we probably should have. We got their pizza, chicken lemon, penne, fish salad, garden salad, and their rice ball. I don&#39;t know how I fit a little bit of everything into my stomach but I&#39;m so happy I did. <br>I&#39;ve never had a rice ball, but it&#39;s basically a ball of rice (duh) with meat and veggies in the middle that gets deep fried. It&#39;s filling and savory and I just want more. The pizza was so good because it wasn&#39;t a deep dish Chicago pizza, but it also wasn&#39;t so thin you could see through it.  I really don&#39;t know how I can possibly go into all the detail of why everything was so good. I was just floored by every one of the flavors. <br><br>Oh...and then I went back for gelato. Just when I thought I couldn&#39;t eat any more, but stomach made extra space for Italy&#39;s version of frozen heaven. I got the coffee flavor and happily out-ordered my guy once again. <br><br>There&#39;s really no way to write one review that will cover everything that Freddy&#39;s has to offer. I can&#39;t wait to go back - and really I just can&#39;t wait to make their ravioli for dinner tonight.",

It looks like that is where a lot of their business comes from both before and after Second City shows. We saw many other people both here and in our show. My mom and I are really more wine than beer drinkers, but when we saw they had Magner&#39;s Irish Cider we knew we had to try it. <br><br>We were able to sit at a table, even though we were not ordering food and they were fine with this. The environment really looks like an Irish pub with dark wood and lots of various pictures and trinkets on the walls. They also have many television screens broadcasting all the latest sports. My mom and I are not really interested in sports, but as it was a Monday night we saw groups gathering for MNF. The food we saw being served around us looked hearty and tasty. The prices seemed reasonable and service was efficient and friendly. It was a warm port on a chilly night and we greatly appreicated it.",

They had a mega deal for the holiday: $30 wristband for any drink but shots for 3 hours.... and we were double-fisting! They even poured me strong Long Islands. Legitimate. <br><br>Also, their food is divine. Gourmet chili nachos, saucy pizza, bold wings, and zesty quesadillas.

"reviewcomment":"&#39;You sure this is veggie?&#39;<br><br>I&#39;ve been hearing about SV since before I ever moved to Chicago. My veggie sis has been raving about it for years. We finally made a sister date and I saw the light. <br><br>The place was pretty busy for a 3pm weekday but we were seated immediately. I remember plush chairs and vintage decor, like this place used to be used as a fancy dinner spot.<br><br>We order protein tidbits and I have the BBQ twist. My sis orders something so boring, I don&#39;t remember. For me, the whole point of paying $10+ for a veggie item is because it&#39;s something I could never possibly cook on my own. Why bother with a salad? Yolo!<br><br>Food comes out and from the first bite, I&#39;m in heaven. I have to seriously ask the waitress if she didn&#39;t mess up the order and slip some meat in this. She laughs and says nope.  The BBQ twist was unlike anything I&#39;ve ever had before. The chik&#39;n isn&#39;t rubbery or jerky-tough. It&#39;s perfect. Sauces are not squeezed from a bottle but homemade. I&#39;m in love. <br><br>I make sure to only eat half so I can save it for later. I took it to my bf at the time and even he was like &#39;Whoa! Is this veggie?&#39;<br><br>I&#39;ve made a big effort to visit all the veggie spots in town: the 3 Karyn&#39;s (Green is best), Handlebar, Chicago Diner, Native Foods, etc. None of them compare to SV! <br>Thankfully they sell a lot of their wraps and side dishes to Whole Foods, so I keep my addiction strong that way. <br><br>This place is a little far from me but if I have to take 3 buses in the snow, I will be back!!!",

"reviewcomment":"Nine of us ambled by at 9 pm on a Friday night after going to a show at a dive bar across the street. Two of our friends that live nearby had never mentioned this place before, and too bad, because we could have come here a few times by now.<br>     We got lucky, and we were seated within 15 minutes. And we were treated to some wonderful food. We started with merguez (sausage), zaalouk (eggplant) and bakola (spinach), each with a complex balance of flavors that danced on my tongue. Maybe it danced a little like their belly dancer, whose belly was not there that night.<br>     But my belly was there, and for the main course, the waiter helped me choose the salmon tagine. I needed some Omega 3 fish oil, and this dish provided a swimmingly delicious experience. Cooked perfectly, moist with a delightful &#34;charmoula&#34; sauce. <br>     Did I mentioned the waiter being helpful? Yes, I did, but not to the degree that he was: I asked him a little bit about the culture, and it turned out that he was working towards a PhD in comparative religion, and he was a wealth of wonderful stories and descriptions about Morocco and the broader region. History was never this exciting in the classroom.",

Suffice it to say, I have had everything on the menu except for menu items that had nuts in them. The only one with nuts in it that I had was the berry salad, and that was because I requested the salad without the walnuts.<br><br>Starting with service, I&#39;m in love. It may be that I usually go with one other friend or solo, so I don&#39;t end up with an exasperated server who has to figure out the whims of a large party. Everything comes to the table without incident on the server&#39;s part or complaint on my part.<br><br>The quality of the food has never faltered, as far as I have experienced during my visits. I don&#39;t go to Basil Leaf Cafe often, but when I do, I&#39;m always glad that I did. I don&#39;t leave frustrated and I am alway stuffed to the point of having to waddle out of the restaurant.

"reviewcomment":"When my favorite Indian restaurant on Devon closed down, I was heartbroken. But then I tried Essence of India, and I feel as though I&#39;ve been given a second chance at love. <br><br>My husband and I went here for dinner on Valentine&#39;s Day. We made a reservation ahead of time for 7:30 p.m. We were able to find parking relatively easily, though this can be a challenge in this area. <br><br>When we got inside the restaurant, all but one of the tables was taken. We got the last table, which of course was in the worst location. It was right by the door, so not only was it cold but people standing around waiting for a table were basically looming over us. Then, of course, a couple came in after us that didn&#39;t have a reservation, and they were seated within moments at a nice cozy table in back. Oh well, c&#39;est la vie. <br><br>Anyway, our experience got much better from there. They gave us that crispy wafer-like bread (I don&#39;t know what it&#39;s called) along with various sauces and chutney. Really tasty.<br><br>For food, we ordered three different dishes and shared them between the two of us. In addition to wine, Naan and rice, here&#39;s what we got: <br><br>- We got the Shahi Paneer. This had cottage cheese cubes in a cashew, tomato and cream sauce. This was amazing. So creamy! We absolutely loved it! <br><br>- We also ordered the Murg Tikka Masala, which is basically chicken in a creamy sauce. Delicious! <br><br>- We also got an order of the Shrimp in Coconut Masala. It was OK. It&#39;s a sour dish and just didn&#39;t have the same great flavors that the other two that we ordered did. I wouldn&#39;t order this again.  <br><br>We were pretty stuffed after all of that, but we still had some food left to take home. We also ordered two mango lassis to go, which were a nice way to end the meal.<br><br>Overall, this was a great Valentine&#39;s Day dinner. I defiantly want to go back when it&#39;s less crowded, like when it&#39;s not Valentine&#39;s Day. I feel like we would get a better table and better service. The service was OK, but it did seem like they weren&#39;t used to it being so busy with the holiday. I&#39;ll be back!",

"reviewcomment":"Maybe I shouldn&#39;t write a review...since this is basically my second home; but oh well.<br><br>I visited Cobra for my first time in June of 2013 and have been there easily 100 times since then. I love their shows. They always have a really good lineup. I&#39;ll check any sort of Metal show. Anything from Enabler, Crowbar, EyeHateGod, Withering Soul, Against The Plagues, Novembers Doom, Inter Arma, Gorguts, Weekend Nachos, etc. I have been to 30+ shows here and I just love the setup as well as the sound. No matter where you stand you get a great view.<br><br>The venue and bar is always clean. The food here is amazing for a bar. I am a Chef myself and really enjoy their food. Sometimes I just hit Cobra for some grub and a beer. I like this as a let&#39;s grab a beer and chat spot. Though, people say its too loud--I clearly LOVE loud. So again, it&#39;s my second home.<br><br>Lastly, I love love love the staff. Yes, when I first started going there it would take a while on a busy night to get drinks (even while waving some money). I don&#39;t know if they know me too well (all the bartenders usually just see me and set a drink in front of me) but I don&#39;t have a problem getting my drinks quickly. I also know where to peep in to get my drinks lol. Nellie is an AMAZING bartender and you also cannot go wrong with Shannon. :) The bouncers are also really sweet. On rare occasions, my friends have had their beers and were about to walk outside when they were notified they cannot be taken outside (their permit starts from May I think). The bouncers were nice enough to keep an eye on their drink while going for a smoke. Philly, Dubil, Chris, and Rockin do a good job at crowd control and brawls if and when they happen.<br><br>So all in all, I love this place on all levels. From the food, to the bar, to the venue, to the strong and cold drinks, to the bands that roll in, and the amazing staff.",

"reviewcomment":"My favorite Indian restaurant in Chicago, way better than all the Devon places I have been to. The food is absolutely delicious, the service very friendly, and the space simple but clean and nice. The negative is that it&#39;s so popular. On weekends the staff does its best to deal with the stampede of customers, but the long wait times probably leave some people hungry and mad. So it&#39;s best to go there on other days, or, if you live nearby, to pick up the food and eat at home. <br>My favorites are: Gobi Manchurian (cauliflower appetizer), butter chicken, and Madras lamb korma. But i haven&#39;t tried everything yet!<br>I wish they opened a branch in Edgewater.",

"reviewcomment":"Friendly, courteous service, a wide variety for a vegetarian-only menu, and a decent, comfortable atmosphere. Recommended for the slightly adventurous or even those trying to eat out as vegetarian. The special rava masala dosai is not to be missed and goes with everything. Their spicy broth, rasam, is a bit strong for some but recommended if you can handle a little heat. Their potato and pea samosas is always a tasty appetizer, hot and flaky. A new entry, from their Indian-Chinese menu, is the Manchurian Broccoli &amp; Mushrooms; it has become a favorite of mine.<br><br>There&#39;s always a manager available to help select a well-balanced meal. They are first and foremost ready to help you enjoy your visit. <br><br>Don&#39;t forget to order a masala chai (tea) or coffee, perhaps with the meal, not just after it, as you may decide that one cup is not enough.",

My husband and I had the prefixed menu ($33 for 8 courses including dessert) which was a great deal. They substituted the meat courses for more vegetarian options. <br><br>The arugula sad was refreshing and had these spicy almonds on them! The baked goat cheese was fantastic! The milk cheese selection tasted like dried cheese on top of a pizza... Wouldn&#39;t recommend this. This mushroom risotto was good, just needed a little salt. The gnocchi was too buttery for my but my husband loved it. Entree Potions are small. <br><br>The red and white sangria were delicious!

I love ordering lattes here because they add cute latte art and really make the drinks an experience.

I can&#39;t believe I never wrote them a Yelp review!  We always start with the large Italian dinner salad with the homemade thousand island dressing to share.  With the fresh bread, olive oil, and parmesan cheese, that could be a meal in itself!  <br><br>No matter how full we might get, we can&#39;t pass up the awesome extra thin crust pizza, calzones and pastas.  Our favorite pasta is spaghetti carbonara with mushrooms.  Carbonara doesn&#39;t usually come with mushrooms, but we like to balance out the salty goodness of the bacon.  We never have leftover carbonara.  The lasagna is very good also.  <br><br>My son asked to celebrate his 10th birthday here.  Staff was very accommodating and attentive.  They put us in the back room so we didn&#39;t feel like we had to whisper during the party.<br><br>I figured out why there aren&#39;t very many photos of Dave&#39;s.  As soon as you can smell your food, everyone forgets all about taking pictures and just start digging in!  I have yet to get a picture of the carbonara.  I&#39;ll just have to order it again... :)",

"reviewcomment":"Easily the best place to get a beer in the western/southwestern burbs. In the summertime, the patio and rooftop patio are fantastic places to sit with friends and enjoy lunch and a few drinks. In the winter, they set up a large tent so that they can still accommodate a large amount of patrons and aside from what you would think, hanging out in a heated tent, is really not that bad when you consider the extensive beer and wine list that they have, coupled with what I feel is better than average pub food. <br><br>I have never sat in the front room and had a proper sit-down dinner so I cannot speak intelligently as to the food or atmosphere there, but when I&#39;ve come into the place off of the La Grange Rd. side, everyone seems to be enjoying themselves so it can&#39;t be much worse than the rest of the place that is fantastic.<br><br>Again, the beer list is by far the most extensive list I&#39;ve seen, maybe in all of the suburbs, and top 5 in the entire chicagoloand area.  They have a great party for St. Patrick&#39;s Day and have other random festivities throughout the year that are worth checking out. Definite thumbs up!",

"reviewcomment":"The restaurant is quite nice with modern decor and has a casual feeling. The menu is simple and has a lot of healthy options. The one-sided menu has a list of freshly prepared juices, like Power Green (kale, celery, pineapple, romaine lettuce), a Watermelon and Strawberry juice, etc. And to the right of that were an assortment of espresso style drinks.<br><br>I had the double espresso. The crema was light yet the espresso was full bodied. The espresso had a sour upfront flavor that was balanced well when you add a little sweetness. My friend had both the above-mentioned juices, and they look pulpy and thick, but not overly thick like some smoothies - so you know you&#39;ll get the fiber with your vitamins.<br><br>For breakfast, I had the quinoa cakes and poached eggs. It was served with a spiced tomato sauce; I also got it with a side of tomatoes and avocado. The tomato was a little mealy, but the sliced avocados went well with the eggs and cakes. This dish is a nice combination of textures - velvety egg yolks, crisp and grainy quinoa, and silky and smooth avocados. <br><br>My friend had the lemon hot cakes before and definitely recommended it. So I will be back to try those. As described, they&#39;re ricotta pancakes served with a lemon syrup and blackberries.<br><br>Our server was very pleasant and attentive. <br><br>I would recommend coming here for breakfast.<br><br>----<br><br>So I came back the next day just to try the lemon pancakes as I don&#39;t know when will be the next time I&#39;ll be back in Chicago.<br><br>So, don&#39;t expect fluffy pancakes that you get at IHOP. The presentation is nice; you get 3 pancakes with a few blackberries, some candied lemon zest, powder sugar and a side of syrup. Since these are made with ricotta, these pancakes are delicate and melt-in-your-mouth. Skip the syrup as they are sweet themselves and order a cup of Joe or espresso or even some bacon to help balance the sweetness. This is more of a treat than just breakfast.",

"reviewcomment":"What keeps me going back here every time? Probably the best shepherd&#39;s pie I&#39;ve ever had. The key point for me is the cheese crust on top of the potatoes. Most places don&#39;t do that but it&#39;s the only way I&#39;ll eat my pie now. And everything in it is great- the gravy is perfect with the meat in veggies. Defiantly not dry at all. <br><br>Also their curry fries are delicious and they have a great beer list. I can&#39;t personally vouch for their other food since I get the same thing, but every time I&#39;ve been there everyone else has loved their food.<br><br>Tip: if you really love curry fries and have about three other friends, do yourself a favor and order the traditional irish curry over fries in place of just curry fries for an appetizer. It&#39;s $4.50 more for easily twice-if not three times-the amount of delicious food.",

They can be kind of corny at times but it adds a nice level of humor and personality to the place. <br><br>I&#39;m always excited to go back. I&#39;m used to the tacky &#34;Italian&#34; restaurants downtown with all the glitz of high prices and basic dishes.

"reviewcomment":"YES to Dublin&#39;s!<br><br>After a late night grocery shopping excursion...yes you heard me correctly, It was 2AM the city was asleep (still is at this moment) and I found it advantageous to venture out and gather my staples....plus it is so much easier with zero traffic...anyway...as I was saying,<br>We (my 24 yr old son accompanied me) felt the need for a smooth libation to soften the blow of the fact that we now had to trek up the 5 flights of steps with all these grocery items. (plus it was storming) Whew....just the thought put the thought of starvation as an option quickly through my mind. <br>I knew Dublins was near to my domicile and opted to pop in for a cool glass of Hendricks Rocks. Dublins was still busy at this time , it was approx 3 am. There were jovial genuinely happy folks enjoying themselves with laughter and  non-rowdy  demeanors filling the place. We approached the bar and were greeted immediately. My son ordered a frigid delectable Guinness and I of course my Hendricks. I have to  say that the atmosphere was welcoming non-intimidating and over all a great choice. Ali the bartender was amazingly friendly. When my son inhaled his Guinness seconds after the bartender turned his back , he was offered another on the house immediately for being so &#34;thirsty&#34; and setting a record. lol..What a wonderful bar with it&#39;s white clothed tables and perfectly leveled music system. Can&#39;t wait to return to try their morsels. A definite yes to Dublin&#39;s.  and oh yes...Groceries made it up the stairs with two trips but painless effort.",

They have a well varied menu but the burgers are particularly good - large and generous and very tasty. I also particularly like the Cuban sandwich.<br><br>Really good and really large beer selection. Usually have some sort of nitro stout on tap and plenty of IPAs. Yay.<br><br>Friendly service, we can bring all our friends here and it&#39;s not pricey at all.",

The ambiance of the place is very nice, clean, and the waiters are attentive and super nice. <br>My friend ordered the tandoori chicken and I got the chicken tikka masala. We split an order of rice and naan. Both very pretty good and served at perfect temperature, though I was disappointed at how small the portion was for the chicken tikka masala. One order of rice and naan however is definitely enough to share between two- however i&#39;m a little surprised rice wasn&#39;t complimentary to the dinner meals.<br><br>Overall, I think I will check this place out again.

Everything is made fresh, and the pizza is perfectly baked every time. They also have fresh salads, and a baked dessert item with different fruit or Nutella fillings and a dusting of powdered sugar. <br><br>The lunch special is an amazing deal. You can get a huge pizza and a soda for $10 or less. I order from here regularly and I am never disappointed. <br><br>Not sure what the reviewer who mentioned no vegan option is talking about.

It&#39;s loud, but the vocals, instruments, and electronic noises are all well defined.<br><br>Beer prices are pretty decent by concert venue standards.

"reviewcomment":"My favorite place to go to treat myself to a good cup of coffee, an excellent pastry, and a book during a slow afternoon. Every pastry I&#39;ve tried here so far has been absolutely delicious. My favorites are their seasonal fruit scones and their croissants (voted best in town along with their baguettes). Their lemon tart is exquisite yet, very sweet (think lemon bar). Their pastries are pricer than other places (i.e ~$4 for a scone) but it&#39;s worth it because you&#39;re getting some of the best in the city. <br><br>Service is excellent, space is two-storied with tall windows and wooden floors, and the french-inspired cuisine is all very tasty (keep in mind- it&#39;s true to french cuisine in its portion sizes as well).",

We ordered these after reading all of the amazing reviews and definitely weren&#39;t disappointed!<br>The sandwiches themselves were fresh and flavorful, and the sauces blended together perfectly! The sandwiches are a bit on the pricier end, as they range from 7.50-9, but they&#39;re definitely worth it! They come with either a side of Asian style cole slaw, or chips, and are pretty big. You won&#39;t regret coming here!!!",

There is outside seating with TVs and fireplaces on brick wall in side. <br>Place always has customers but never too busy. We ordered flight of beers. You can pick any beer in the menu to include and believe me, there are a bunch. <br>We got the chili, corn soup, pretzel bread with mustard/cheese dipping sauce, and beet salad. My party kept raving about the chili- it has brisket and sour cream in top. Definitely a must order! <br>Staff are friendly and informative. Definitely stop by on weekend afternoon while shopping !",

"reviewcomment":"Well that was fucking wonderful. <br><br>The skins on the boiled dumplings were, I shit you not, the texture of hand pulled noodles. That alone is reason why any review of 4 stars or less was clearly written by some sort of anti-yelp vigilantes taking mis-justice into their own hands. <br><br>The tofu appetizer was brilliant with well thought out flavors and every item on the dish absolutely needing to be there. <br><br>The egg custard, I mean, fuck man, those are just a thing if beauty. Flaky crust, sweet custardy egg, brûlée action on the top. God I need so many more of those in my life. Pro tip for NYC people- sneak some hot sauce on there and it channels pies and thighs salty sweet spicy amazing happiness and I don&#39;t want to be friends with you if you don&#39;t know that that is the best thing someone can say. <br><br>Here is the problem though. It&#39;s not they they give a shit, it&#39;s they give sooooo many shits. No, actually, I&#39;m pretty sure that they give ALL of the shits. Every single last one. A lot of shits is what I&#39;m saying. <br><br>So that means that the care in every dish we had was beautifully evident. This is obviously food made with love. Buuuuuut... Love takes time. We came during brunch, so it was relatively quiet and really gave them a chance to shine. I can only imagine the challenge of preparing food like this at high speed to keep up with the demands of a long line out the door. Looking at the negative reviews on here I have to assume that it is due to growing pains as they learn to keep up with the huge growth in demand (oh, and douches... Lotta douches writing bad reviews). <br><br>So be smart. Come at brunch or a slow night if you can so that you can get the true experience. If you go on a busy Thursday night then hopefully the food you get is as excellent as what I had but... I dunno, no promises?",

We split this order and it was quite a bit for a damn kid&#39;s size LOL.  The cheese was so creamy and oooey gooey and with the hot dog meat mixed in it was an incredible combo!  We also could not get enough of that damn Fatso so we each ordered another; however, after eating my portion of Mac N Cheese I was feeling regretful while they were cooking my other Fatso, I was just thankful this time around I ordered it with only cheese and sauce.  When that Fatso came up I still scarfed it down and I could taste the meat even more now that I did not have any lettuce or tomato on it, and the meat just tasted that much better.  <br>After that I felt like a bloated sack but it was well worth it.  This is the first time I ever spent $20 at a fast food type joint but I was addicted as hell from the first bite. When we ordered again The guy cooking even said &#34;Good stuff huh?&#34; Oh hell yea good stuff and amazing smells as that food is cooking, which makes you feel like you are sitting in heaven with a grill giving off the most heavenly aromas! <br>They are cash only and have a friendly staff.<br><br>**********update on 4/8/14*******  I want a double Fatso with cheeeeeese right noooowww!  I wish there was one in Bridgeport!  See how addictive this food is?  LOL.  And I want that Char dog baby!",

"reviewcomment":"This is hands down the best sushi I have had in Chicago. I am writing this review over a year since I&#39;ve last eaten at Katsu but I can still vividly remember many highlights from my meal.<br><br>First off, let me caveat this review by saying that if you are looking for sushi such as Rainbow rolls, Philadelphia rolls and etc, this is NOT the place to go. They serve traditional, no frills sushi/sashimi and offers an omakase menu. For me, what stood out about this restaurant was not only the freshness of every piece of fish we received but also the hospitality of our waitress and the simple, minimalist environment. This place is a stark contrast from many of the &#34;high end&#34; sushi places boasting &#34;innovate&#34; and &#34;trendy&#34; Japanese food......the minute you walk in here, you know the focus is going to be on the food. <br><br>The two items that we ordered which stood out to me was the super white toro and the yellowtail fish cheek. The super white toro just melted in your mouth, with none of the weird stringiness that occasionally turns me off from sashimi. The yellowtail fish cheek was grilled to perfection. Our waitress (who I think was also Chef Katsu&#39;s wife) taught us how to break the fish cheek apart and get to the good pieces.<br><br>For a restaurant that was rated #1 in Chicago by Zagat (ahead of even Alinea), our entire meal ended up being about $100 for two people, a totally reasonable price for this caliber of sushi.",

"reviewcomment":"I had an amazing experience at this restaurant that I&#39;d call a gastropub. With an excellent selection of food, it superbly complemented their outstanding beers. Half of my experience at this restaurant was reviewing their extensive selection of beers. With some 15 beers on tap and some 150 bottles, they&#39;re certain to have a beer to please everyone&#39;s tastes.<br><br>What surprised me the most was the varied selection of draft beers, and the fact that most of them carried extremely high ratings on the beer review sites. This is definitely a beer drinker&#39;s paradise!<br><br>If you&#39;re in Chicago and looking for a great location to hang with friends and enjoy a great dining experience, check out the Northdown Cafe and Taproom.",

"reviewcomment":"I have mixed feelings about this Thai restaurant.  They have excellent service, but the food is okay.   However, the asparagus beef roll appetizer is AMAZING, and you have to try it if you try this place out.  The asparagus is really tender, and the beef has a delicious grilled taste to it.  But that&#39;s as far as my love for Ma &amp; I goes. <br><br>I thought the place would be promising, as the waitresses were all Thai.  However, Thai food is known to be spicy.  When we asked if we could get our dishes spicy, the waitress said they don&#39;t do that there. Um, what kind of Thai restaurant doesn&#39;t offer spices? Definitely the first Thai restaurant I&#39;ve been to to tell me that, and I&#39;ve been to my fair share of Thai restaurants.  I had the Pad Kee Mao, and they must either make their own flat noodles or they cut it out from a large sheet.  I&#39;ve never had noodles that were more like big flat squares for a Thai dish.  As for their beef, the texture just wasn&#39;t right.  It had the texture of meat that was boiled/steamed then put into the stir fry.  I&#39;m not sure but it was really chewy, and they cut their meat into huge chunks there.  That&#39;s not really desirable in these kinds of dishes, if you know what I mean. <br><br>Bottom line, good service. Fast service. Average food. Awesome asparagus roll appetizer. Thai tea wasn&#39;t bad, a little too milky. Portion sizes were just right for the price you&#39;re paying. Would I go back? Yes, I actually did during my trip.  But only because I love their asparagus beef roll (and I wanted a quick snack).",

"reviewcomment":"Chez Joel may soon become my joie de vivre!<br><br>It started with a friendly greeting at the door.  The restaurant does not have a lot of seating maybe a capacity of 40 or so.  This keeps the ambiance semi-romantic and does not allow the place to get too loud.  <br><br>Our server Philip exceeded our expectations describing the daily specials in intricate details.  He was attentive and quick to ensure that drinks kept coming and that we were satisfied with every portion.  <br><br>We started off with well balanced cocktails and an order of the coquilles St. Jacques.  The scallops were pan seared beautifully leaving a nice light crispness on the outside giving way to a flavorful moist meaty inside.  <br><br>Next for entrees we had the halibut and filet.  The filet was ordered medium rare and arrived with a perfect warm red center.  The mash potatoes were the right amount of salty and buttery, the carrots were roasted for the right amount of time, and the mushrooms were so flavorful as they soaked in the demi-glace.  <br><br>We finally finished with dessert I order the profiteroles. Delicious puff pastry filled with vanilla ice cream then topped with warm melted chocolate and roasted almonds.  It was the perfect sweet treat to finish off a wonderful evening.  <br><br>This was truly a wonderful experience and so close to home too.  I cannot wait to go back and try something new!",

"reviewcomment":"First started frequenting Yes! a few years ago when we were introduced by a couple of our friends who really loved it and it became our go-to double date or catch-up dinner spot. Really love the ambiance and BYOB for dining in and the staff is very friendly and attentive. <br><br>More recently we have predominantly gotten their take-out, but it&#39;s our favorite Thai restaurant out of the dozens of others in the area. All the ingredients are always really fresh and it&#39;s definitely a step above your average Asian takeout. That definitely explains why it is slightly more expensive, but I would still like more if it were a little cheaper. <br><br>Pad thai is always a standard solid option, but I love the rice entrees and it&#39;s worth it to pay extra for the brown rice (theirs is extra delicious). Also love the spring rolls, potstickers, and other apps or love to get the tom yum soup, esp if I&#39;m feeling under the weather. Yes is a standout Thai spot and we love it!",

No wait at all on a Saturday night which was awesome. Plus BYOB - you can&#39;t go wrong! I got the personal pepperoni deep dish and it was great. My friends both got thin crust pizzas which looked good and both liked. We for side salads to start with too that I would recommend.<br><br>Good option for Chicago deep dish without the hour+ wait!",

"reviewcomment":"Buckle up for some of the most delicious, massive portioned Mexican seafood in town.  From the moment you enter this crowded BYO &#34;people&#39;s seafood&#34; joint and see everyone frantically devouring huge plates of lobster, mountains of shrimp, heaping portions of crab legs, etc., you can&#39;t help but roll up your sleeves and say...bring it on! And bring it they did. Wow!   <br><br>As we were sitting down and before our butts even reached our chair, Ceviche Tostada&#39;s, a plate of limes and basket of tostada&#39;s and some &#34;...dang that&#39;s hot&#34; but soo delicious Habenero hot sauce were laid out in front of us.  I know people come here to consume as much seafood as they can consume but I just have to point out that the Guacamole is outstanding.  FRESH, explosively flavorful, and tasting like it was prepared with the love of grandma making it for her family coming over for a Sunday afternoon meal. I can&#39;t remember eating better. <br><br>Then came the food.  I ordered the Pena Rellena, a house specialty where someone takes a pineapple, delicately slices it in half the long way, scoops it out...then pours a &#34;shovel sized&#34; portion of shrimp, crab, octopus, scallop, onion, pepper and pineapple into it, slaters it with queso fresco and bakes it in the oven.  Served on a plate with fries, salad and moist delicious flavored rice.  <br><br>My accomplice ordered a bowl of the 7 seafood soup.  What they didn&#39;t mention was that it was a SALAD BOWL size!<br><br>As much as we wanted to do the flan and tres leche dessert, we just ran out of room.<br><br>Outstanding, friendly service and reasonably priced.  Charming cozy space.",

"reviewcomment":"We&#39;ve gotten to the point in our pizza delivery escapades where we&#39;re just randomly picking places now, since we&#39;ve struggled for so long to find a good one.<br><br>All that stops here.  John&#39;s is a big hit for us.  It&#39;s the true thin crust, almost the cracker, cut in squares.  The kind I really like.  It&#39;s seasoned just right, the sauce is good, it&#39;s nicely cheesy and it always arrives hot and fresh.<br><br>We ordered some mozzarella sticks and they&#39;re the pretty typical pre-made over-breaded from whatever food purveyor delivers to them.  Not bad per se -- if they had been hot out of the fryer, maybe they&#39;d be better.  The sauce was good.<br><br>Skip the milkshakes -- there&#39;s no way there&#39;s 4 scoops in there and for $5 a pop, plus being rather small and pretty eh, it&#39;s definitely a not-worth-it item.<br><br>Pizza is a winner here, so go with that.  Not sure if we&#39;ll ever try anything else, though we may, but John&#39;s has become our go-to delivery spot for now.  <br><br>Whew, finally!",

I love this place :)<br><br>I had the gyro cheeseburger and SO had the grilled chicken sandwich with a regular cheeseburger. And we had fries...omg so freaking yummy. *drool* The grilled chicken sandwich was juicy and tender...usually grilled chicken sandwiches tend to be dry. The pretzel bun is it? Omg it&#39;s to die for. Absolutely love this place.",
