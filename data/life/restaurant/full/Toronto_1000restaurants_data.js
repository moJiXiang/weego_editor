"reviewcomment":"Went on a Tuesday evening at 7:00 pm and got seated within 10 minutes. We sat on a picnic table on the patio which apparently, is considered &#34;outside&#34; of their physical limits to serve alcohol, so I was denied a cold refreshing Singha beer. Regardless, I ordered one of their signature dishes, the Khao Soi with tofu ($14; also available with beef or chicken, and shrimp for an additional cost), and it was the most heavenly thing I&#39;ve ever had. The egg noodles that floated above the coconut milk curry sauce were crispy and crunchy.<br><br>Service was adequate, nothing to complain about. If I were to return, I&#39;d definitely try sitting at the bar. I think it&#39;d a different experience being inside and sitting at a long communal table than on a big picnic table outside. It was also windy so dust from the road was sure to get onto our food....",

Which is grilled pork with added grilled chicken, spicy. It&#39;s amazing. $3 to add chicken though. <br><br>There is always a line so it&#39;s best to go during odd times, but even with a line they are really fast. I love Banh Mi Boys. Love forever.",

"reviewcomment":"This is by far my favourite restaurant in the city. It&#39;s a difficult one to go to with a gluten intolerance but when you&#39;re determined it&#39;s possible! The first time I went, I went back again 2 days later...it is that good. What I love about it is Jen remembered me when I went back. It&#39;s truly not about how many people you can push through, it&#39;s about sharing the experience of food. <br><br>Since a lot of these reviews have already probably told you how great all of the food is, and it&#39;s served to you in the appropriate order for your pallet, I&#39;m going to help out the gluten-free people out there. First thing&#39;s first, it can be done! Yes, almost everything is served to be eaten with bread but we know how to enjoy it without what can be described as just a facilitator for the good stuff.<br><br>* Horse Tartare - Don&#39;t be afraid by the purple colour, it can be intimidating but it&#39;s worth the try! It&#39;s very good without bread and the fries onions give it a bit of texture and crunch!<br><br>* Charcuterie board - you will really be able to taste the difference between the meats when tasting it without bread. The horse is amazing, don&#39;t skip it!<br><br>* Beef tongue - comes shredded inside brioche. It&#39;s so loaded with meat you can easily find parts that haven&#39;t touched the bread and it taste delish with a little aioli on it&#39;s own. Reminds me of pastrami.<br><br>* Seasonal veggie plates are so good. We once had asparagus and morels - so freaking good, seriously!<br><br>* Pork belly and carpaccio - either of these are usually gluten free on their own and they are two items I rarely skip on a menu. Delicious.<br><br>* Fois gras and (waffles/Nutella) - easy to have a taste of the fois gras on top of the waffles. Not really worth it to order if no one is going to have the waffles though, it&#39;s not a must-have.<br><br>* Bone marrow - I tried my best to taste this without bread but honestly, it just is no good unless you get to spread it on top of bread and it&#39;s not worth it to try!<br><br>My favourite part of the restaurant is the kitchen, it&#39;s right there and not closed at all. It feels like you&#39;re in a friend&#39;s home in a tiny kitchen with hand-me-down appliances. It proves that you really don&#39;t need a bunch of fancy kitchen items to make delicious food!<br><br>Oh &amp; cocktail bar across the street is the best place to wait for a table, or just go for drinks!",

So far, the reputation of Kinton is in the mark - authentic Japanese ramen from broth to noodles to toppings. <br><br>I ordered a cold ramen dish, which is a new addition to their menu and it did not disappoint! Absolutely amazing in flavour and the portion was just right. I was a bit disappointed that there was only one piece of chicken but it is so filling that I&#39;m glad I didn&#39;t have to eat any more food than I can handle. <br><br>The atmosphere is great, but a bit too loud with the music. It is also a bit claustrophobic  because it&#39;s a small ramen shop, but aside from that it&#39;s a very nice, friendly place. A definite go to place with a couple of friends for a bite to eat! If you don&#39;t mind the yelling and loud music, I definitely recommend going to Kinton for authentic ramen, it&#39;s an experience worth having.",

"reviewcomment":"I am a big Momofuku fan.  I planned a vacation to Toronto specifically so I could dine at Noodle Bar, Daisho and Shoto, as well as trying the Toronto-only Milk Bar treats. Lunch at Noodle Bar was both my first and final meals in Toronto which to me made perfect sense.  <br><br>Loved both the original Momofuku ramen and the Toronto-only smoked chicken ramen. To be honest, I&#39;m not a ramen expert.  I am an expert when it comes to great food; the Momofuku ramens are great food!  Also enjoyed the pork buns. Service at both lunches was very friendly and attentive.  Special thanks to Justin!  <br><br>I LOVED the &#34;double double&#34; soft serve from Milk Bar that I was able to get as a dessert.",

"reviewcomment":"Fantastic! Delicate and subtly flavored, but hearty and delicious. We seemed to be served by whoever was nearest rather than one person - I definitely loved the cooperative family atmosphere. There was a light, fragrant aroma to the dumplings, almost Jasmine or lavender like, barely perceptible but that absolutely made my meal. Service is sweet, portions are good, presentation great (adorable dessert dumplings!), food is fresh and delicious, and I LOVED watching the cute ladies make dumplings and wave at the babies brought by to watch.<br><br>I&#39;ll go against popular opinion here and say the chive pancake, while good, wasn&#39;t my favorite. But I loved the steamed bakchoi and mushroom. <br>This is a place I&#39;m happy to recommend and revisit and give my money to! I foresee many a dumpling craving in my near future.",

"reviewcomment":"What a beautiful spot to have dinner as you sit on the highest point and rotate around while dining.<br><br>Very $$$ but well worth it!  I had the Caesar to start--was OK, more iceberg lettuce than it should have been. It also had huge chunks of bacon on it (not a complaint at all!)  For my meal, I had the 10 oz. prime rib--HUGE and delish! I substituted the bread pudding for a baked potato.  Only complaint, plate was too small. I didn&#39;t been discover my green beans until I was half way through the steak!<br><br>I had a very delicious Pinot Noir and a French Kiss martini--but warning the cocktails were VERY pricey.<br><br>Apparently it takes 72 minutes to get all the way around, and if you&#39;re dining in, it&#39;s a slow, pleasurable experiences, so you&#39;ll definitely get all the way around once.  We went around sunset too so got to see daylight, sunset and night which was awesome.  Huge bay windows allow for some great photo ops of sailboats and the city.   An entree purchase gets you a &#34;free&#34; pass to a few floors down to the observation deck too.<br><br>Overall, a really cool, worth it, one-time experience.  TIPS:  Notice where the bathroom is as you go around--you may not see it for awhile! Also, if you&#39;re hesitant about the price, think of it this way...just going to the observation deck costs like almost $40.  A steak is $45.  So go eat and see what you came to see!",

"reviewcomment":"I can only attest to my own personal experience with the five or six dimsum dishes and the pea shoot stir fry that I&#39;ve tried but everything was pretty good. A little on the salty side, maybe. <br>The ha-gao was pretty good, especially slathered with red vinegar, which was ultra diluted down but worked for me since they didn&#39;t bring me a sauce dish and I just ended up using my plate. Stuffed with shrimp and the wrapper didn&#39;t break at first touch.<br>The shumai had plump fish eggs on it, making it look ultra delicious, but in reality was a little on the salty side. And it was super juicy! Which was great.<br>The bbq pork steamed buns were good and apparently a THING in Toronto, or Rolsan, don&#39;t know which~ but by far the steamed custard bun was waaY better. I will admit, the bun was a tiny bit tougher than I like it to be, but I&#39;ll take it. <br>The spare ribs, or short ribs, or something... was alright. But there were others in my party LoVEd it. A little on the tough side and I was not in the mood to use my hands. <br>And we had another dumpling but I have no idea what it was and it was mediocre. Too mushy.<br>The peashoot stir fry came out way too soon in comparison to the dimsum we ordered, but I guess it was good we had some food early since some of us were pretty hungry.<br>Overall, good dinner. I have no complaints about this having been my birthday dinner. My 30th birthday dinner at that. <br>Next time, I&#39;ll try the duck.",

"reviewcomment":"Situated high atop the TD Tower the journey from the underground parking to the 54th floor was definitely worth it. Thankfully they had many signs making parking and locating the restaurant easy.<br><br>We arrived on time for our 8pm reservation. FYI if you want a window side table inform the hostess when booking your reservation to ensure you get one. Our table wasn&#39;t quite ready yet but the hostess offered us another table in the center of the dining room however she said the couple occupying our table would most likely be another 10 minutes as they had paid there bill already.<br><br>Thankfully it was a short wait and the hostess kindly led us to our window side table. All three walls bordering the restaurant were floor to ceiling glass windows creating a breath taking view of the night sky and the lit up city below.<br><br>We started off the evening with two glasses of deliciously bubbly prosecco<br>Followed by the house bread which was smoked pancetta potato bread severed with a butternut squash and garlic puree<br>We absolutely loved the bread crunchy exterior, soft chewy interior, &amp; nice smoky flavour from the crunchy bits of pancetta and the butternut squash spread was a delightful alternative to the standard butter. Needless to say we devoured the entire loaf.<br><br>After one glance over the menu I knew exactly what I wanted<br><br>Alberta Wagyu Beef Tri-Tip - Tree Glazed Short Rib, Raclette Potato Croquette Rapini &amp; Birch Onion Marmalade<br>The entree was beautifully plated like a work of art show casing the main attraction of three perfectly cooked medium rare hearty portions of  beef. The beef was juicy and tender &amp; well seasoned but that short rib knocked it out of the ball park. Loved the sweet glaze on it. The potato croquettte was like a gourmet tator tot extra crispy crunchy exterior enclosing a contrasting creamy smooth potato puree and the onion marmalade is my new favourite flavour of marmalade<br><br>We also got a side of the Pan Roasted Northern Woods Mushrooms which were served in a cute little cast iron pot. The mushrooms had a wonderful earthy nutty flavour, some of the best shrooms I&#39;ve ever had!<br><br>Finally for dessert<br><br>Red Velvet Cake - Salted Chocolate Ganache, Sweetened Cream Cheese, Smoked Marshmallow<br>Again beautiful plating, the cake was a good sized portion unfortunately I did find it a bit dry, thankfully it was sitting on a pool of cream cheese which gave it some much needed moisture. I also loved the salted ganache which was a nice play on the sweet and salty combo. However the best feature on the plate was the smoked marshmallow ice cream - the flavours were spot on! I could of been satisfied with the ice cream alone it was that good!<br><br>Overall I have to say Canoe definitely stands out as a world class restaurant from the spectacular ambiance and breath taking views, professional and courteous service, to the illustrated plating and innovative &amp; creative cuisine it just hits all the marks. Definitely an experience worth checking out!<br><br>FYI If you park underground in the TD Tower parking lot, obtain a parking voucher from the hostess to redeem for free parking",

Yes, yes, yes, and god I hope so. <br><br>Had the sampler for 2 with beef ribs, chicken and of course the aforementioned brisket. It was all well seasoned and had a good amount of smoke infused. No surprises, ain&#39;t nothing wrong with that my man. The sides were also decent. For $65ish for the 2 of us that&#39;s not bad at all. And also, can I say, being offered still and carbonated water? Yes. <br><br>Go here for some honest BBQ.",

Late night snacks, pitchers and cheap breakfast. <br><br>The food: Sure, it might not be gourmet, but Sneaky Dee&#39;s food has satisfied me many of late nights. The veggie king&#39;s crown nachos are my absolutely favourite. So much guacamole, so much cheese, so much good. These people know their nachos. Even their poutine with their shredded cheese (blasphemy, I know) is delicious in my mind. Their breakfast is pretty good too. It&#39;s pub food, but whatever.<br><br>My go to meal: Veggie King&#39;s Crown<br><br>Secret: You can customize the nachos.

First and foremost, it is HALAL! hurrahh!! <br><br>The menu: Limited, yet they have perfected every plate they serve and I think that is the most important part. We get the Sukhothai Phad Thai every single time and never regret it. The garlic chicken appetizer is unreal...just...mouth watering. The spring rolls are deelish. <br><br>Prices: Veryyy reasonable<br><br>Size: Place is definitely small, but I have never had to wait more than 5 minutes for a spot.<br><br>Service: Friendly service, incredibly fast! You order and the plate appears in front of you just a few minutes later. I guess that&#39;s the plus of having a short menu :)<br><br>Parking: Street parking, can be annoying but worth the aggravation lol<br><br>Cleanliness: clean store, plates, glasses and cutlery. Never had a problem here. Even their washroom is relatively clean.<br><br>Definitely try this cute hidden gym out, you wont regret it!",

"reviewcomment":"&#34;If you were my son, Mac, I would&#39;ve smothered you by now.<br>Smothered me in gravy you big dirty man.&#34; -- Super Troopers (2001)<br><br>On a recent business trip to Toronto, and really limited time in the city to eat anything, I knew what I wanted. I wanted to eat some place with local favors, well-rated, somewhat convenient (read near the airport or on the way to our hotel) and where I could get poutine. I know, I know... Poutine is really a Montreal thing. But I was in Canada and I was apt to get pretty authentic poutine without question... Or as close as possible without being in Montreal.<br><br>My coworker trusted me to utilize my yelp skills and find us the right spot. I worked my app and found Bannock. As my Dad would have said: &#34;Looks good!&#34;<br><br>We parked around the corner and braved the cold and found our way to the doors through the inside entrance. We were seated quickly and a server immediately came to us to get our cocktail order. And yes, I also ordered the poutine - yay! While we waited for those to arrive, we decided on our mains. I opted for the Roasted Brick Chicken with Sopressata and eggplant. <br><br>Before you knew it, a steaming bowl of poutine was placed before me and I was in Canadian heaven! Crispy, salty fries topped with gooey cheese curds and a delectable fresh gravy. Who needs Montreal, I ask you? When in Canada... I could have been happy with a second bowl and been done.<br><br>However, my chicken came out and it was succulent and delicious. The skin was crispy, and it was layered with rich sage, eggplant, spicy Sopressata and other veggies. I did my best to polish it off, but I think I left a little. I was jealous of the guy at the next table who ordered the Duck Poutine Pizza - that looked like a masterpiece of flavors! Next trip.<br><br>Service was good, atmosphere was nothing to write home about, but the food was delightful and I would visit them again.",

"reviewcomment":"It&#39;s been a few weeks since Husband and I along with a friend experienced Sansotei&#39;s ramen, and we&#39;re still dreaming about it.<br><br>Why is it so special? It&#39;s the BROTH you guys!! Oh, and it&#39;s an excellent one at that. I can&#39;t even extract all the adjectives from my head to describe how incredible it is. You can tell how much time and love is put into the slow cooking of the pork bones to develop a rich and flavorful broth. Without it, ramen is not magical.<br><br>The three of us arrived around 1:45pm on a Saturday. We thought coming after the normal lunch hour would yield us a minimal to no wait, but we were WRONG! :) There were 4 other couples in front of us, and we were all waiting patiently along the sidewalk. Thankfully, the weather was brisk and cool. We ended up waiting about 20 minutes, so not too bad. Our friend wasn&#39;t as patient, but luckily, it was well worth it!<br><br>The space itself, as others have noted, is pretty small, but typical for city ramen shops. What we liked about it was that it wasn&#39;t super loud, so we could actually enjoy our meal and not have to shout to talk.<br><br>Menu is small, but I love that. We went with the Tonkotsu Black, which is basically the pork broth ramen with garlic green onion oil. Each bowl starts at $9.80, and if you want extra noodles (which our friend did get), it&#39;s an additional $1. Swimming inside the silky broth is a soft boiled egg, that&#39;s executed PERFECTLY. When I bit into it, it was like a dream..silky, soft, and a slight runny yolk. In addition to that, the bamboo shoots were soft and not tough to bite. Pork belly was sliced thinly, and a generous 5 slices to boot. The amount of oil gave it that extra pop to the broth. To round out the bowl, woodear mushrooms were a nice touch and appropriately crisp.<br><br>I had the thick noodles and Husband had the thin noodles. Both were good, though if you like more bite to your noodles, get the thick ones. I enjoyed both equally, but favor the thin just a little more. Our friend who ordered extra noodles was surprised at how much they give. He was stuffed to the max at the end of the day!<br><br>The three of us split the zangi (fried chicken). Good crisp and not heavy. A good snack, but you can easily get full off of the bowl of noodles, something that doesn&#39;t happen too often at a ramen shop.<br><br>I haven&#39;t been to the other location, but considering we had such a great time here at their original one, I&#39;m not sure we will. The wait is so worth it, and I didn&#39;t even think it was that bad. Now the question is, when can we go back? lol",

They do give good amount of beef but it was lacking in flavor. Also, the dessert is just okay. We were actually expecting more creativity from a world class chef.",

"reviewcomment":"A wonderful place for brunch!<br><br>Having walked by Lady Marmalade every weekend for months, I knew what to expect in terms of their line-up outside. I prepared myself for the worst, especially as I visited on a sunny Sunday, so was relatively relieved to be seated and ready to order within twenty minutes.<br><br>The menu manages to accommodate all tastes, while still being unique. I loved how all the staple brunch items you&#39;d expect were included on the menu, but many had original twists, e.g: the croque madame I ordered was served not on toasted bread, but within a tasty crepe! <br><br>My meal was incredibly filling and I left feeling STUFFED. This ensured the slightly pricey nature of Lady Marmalade didn&#39;t bother me too much. The crepe and accompanying poached eggs were expertly cooked and the ingredients delightfully fresh (and sourced from the local, organic, ethical Rowe Farms across the street).<br><br>The filter coffee I ordered was similarly impressive - so often brewed coffee in these type of establishments is a let-down. Not here. The blend was strong and citrusy, served HOT (not lukewarm as is often the case elsewhere), and the refills kept coming without me having to ask!<br><br>The service was good, especially considering how busy the place was.<br><br>I would definitely go back!",

The venue is large enough to accommodate patrons without the need for a lineup which is a big advantage over the likes of biermarkt and Pravda across the street. <br>Additionally, cest what boasts one of the most impressive beer lists in the city and pairs some pretty decent food with it too.<br>The sweet potato chips that are often mentioned on yelp really are some of the best in the city. <br><br>The pool tables are available on a running hour basis. The bar also has the advantage of offering different niches, from a cozy couch area to one with pool tables and another facing a stage. <br>C&#39;est what also serves as a rotating exhibit for local artists (including yelp&#39;s own Neil T) and this is definitely something to appreciate in a local bar.<br><br>Overall consistent service, a cozy atmosphere matched with a fantastic beer list make C&#39;est What? one of the best spots you can rely on downtown.",

"reviewcomment":"What can I say about La Carnita? Well, their website describes it best as a place where &#34;street art meets street food&#34;. This theme is very apparent when you look closely at the walls, where the artwork combines a multitude of gritty art styles to create what I would call a truly urban dining experience.<br><br>I decided to go with the In Cod We Trust, the Beef Short Rib Empanada, and the Beef Cheek Taco. The cod looked beautiful when it came out and was extremely crispy, but I found that it was a bit over seasoned. The beef empanada was definitely the most filling of the three dishes, and it was essentially a baked ball of beef with cheese. The outer shell just crumbled as you bite down, but the flavours found in this dish were very one dimensional - they could&#39;ve added a few more ingredients to make it more interesting. Finally, we get to the beef cheek taco, which was my favourite dish of the night. It was a simple taco with a tender beef filling topped with jalapeno peppers and a sour cream sauce. As soon as I took a bite, I experienced the delicious taste of the savoury beef cheek. Soon after, my taste buds were hit with the spicy kick of the jalapeno peppers (which were actually not too hot because they didn&#39;t include the seeds). Pro tip - I found that I actually enjoyed the dishes more by squeezing a bit of lime juice over the top to ease the spice found in the peppers. Oh did I also mention that almost every taco comes with some form of jalapeno or habanero pepper? Watch out!<br><br> I had a delightful experience at La Carnita and I enjoyed the food very much, but the one thing that bothered me was the staff did not seem too attentive and we received service that I thought was below average. The taco portion sizes were also pretty small so I would definitely fill up on the appetizers. Overall, I would say La Carnita offers a great social environment filled by interesting decorations that reflect their modern approaches to Mexican cuisine. However if you were looking for the most bang for your buck, I would consider going elsewhere.<br><br>For more reviews and pictures, check out my food blog at <a href='/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbundoru.wordpress.com&amp;s=a4b2e555992b7dbf9c43980a7c487ef00b6b2a2ba3384a6691adf934a2983312' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>bundoru.wordpress.com</a>",

"reviewcomment":"Oh Yelp, you rarely steer me wrong. Looked up sushi in downtown Toronto and Japango looked appealing. The place is very compact - seats 20 tightly) and the servers were prompt, attentive and gracious.  The crowd looked to be a mix of visitors and some obviously local regulars judging from the warm greetings. Had the eel and avocado roll plus tempura appetizer. The meal came with a large mug of tea and a tasty thick miso broth brought immediately. Presentation was simple and lovely. Everything tasted so fresh and light. Very subtle flavors, well balanced. The tempura batter was crisp and not greasy and the veggies were plentiful (cauliflower, broccoli, squash, onion, courgette and eggplant) and juicy with a light bite, not soggy. My only disappointment was I would have preferred a sweeter/richer flavored dipping sauce for the tempura, if it was ponzu it lacked a citrus kick. Bit I asked for some lemon and was promptly brought a thick juicy lemon wedge . The soy sauce was especially tasty, full flavored and not too salty. Everything was excellent. Delicious!<br><br>We were unable to linger long because there were people waiting and it&#39;s so small.",

This location is right off the subway line, attached to the Eaton Centre but you have to enter from outside. <br><br>The menu has many options to chose from, it was hard to pick just one thing. There are Indian, Japanese and American options. <br><br>We had the Chicken Souvlaki Sandwich, Steak and Mushroom Demi and for dessert Molten Lava Chocolate Souffle. The Chicken Souvlaki was great, good portion and the chicken had flavour and tender. The steak was a smaller than expected size but the mashed potatoes that came with it was good. The Souffle was amazing! It was just the right amount of chocolate and sweet. <br><br>There are business-casual elements with a full bar and TVs showing games but I also like that there is potential for an intimate setting without TVs pointing at you every direction. <br><br>I would come back to Joey&#39;s to try more of there menu and for the Souffle!",

"reviewcomment":"I cannot say enough how much I love Le Sélect.. This is probably one the most atmospheric, refined and friendly French restaurants in Toronto. There are a few other excellent French tables in Toronto but this is my go to destination for good authentic French brasserie fare, sometimes with a twist. All the classics are here. Boeuf Bourguignon, Tartare, Cassoulet, Choucroute, etc.  Originally on Queen Street west (remember the bread baskets hanging over the tables?), they moved some years ago to this bigger and much better location on Wellington street.The interior is very nicely decorated, with this Brasserie Parisienne atmosphere.<br>I went there for an early dinner with the Pretty Ballerina on Monday, June the 2nd 2014. The weather was lovely and we opted to sit on the lovely front patio.<br>Service was very friendly and efficient, and our waiter even spoke French with me, which is something I like. I have this thing about speaking the language of the cuisine I am savouring, it is a must. Unless of course, I do not know it (here is looking at you, Arabic and Vietnamese!).<br>As I was waiting for my dinner companion, I savoured a  delicious pastis of the Ricard Brand($6.50). Classical presentation, long glass with ice and pastis, with water in a nice carafe with the Ricard logo on it. The selection of wines by the glass is limited but at the same time, quite varied. We all had  5 oz glasses: 2 whites, Chablis Domaine Laroche &#39;12 ($12.25) and Muscadet Coing de Sèvre &#39;10 ($10.75) for her, while I had a red Cabernet Villa des Anges Languedoc &#39;11 ($10.25). I had the pastis already so one glass of wine was enough and my guest had the muscadet as her apéritif.<br>We started our meal with an excellent dozen of Malpèque oysters ($29.00). While not specifically a seafood place, Le Sélect chooses very good bivalves, as they should: oysters and seafood platters being a forte of brasseries all over the Hexagone.<br>Then, the Pretty Ballerina ordered the Roasted Salmon with  cold Quinoa and Aubergine salad, which was delicious ($16.95).<br>I ordered the Bison Tartare. Bison is a perfect meat for this dish: not really fatty, with a good lean, fresh meaty taste. This tartare($17.95) is well-seasoned, with just enough spice and the chopped pistachios on top are a delicious touch . We tasted each other&#39;s dish and concluded that Le Sélect is very apt both at surfing and turfing.<br>For the finale, we shared the parfait praliné ($10.95). Praline is a popular French dessert ingredient  made from candied almonds and hazelnuts that are finely ground to make a sort of crunchy powder. This dessert incorporates it in an ice cream dish which is delicious and light on the palate, yet throws quite a flavour punch, simultaneously sweet and salty.<br>Often I skip coffee at downtown restaurants and head elsewhere for an after dinner caffeine fix, but Le Sélect is quite skilled with the espresso machine: we both had a cappucino(which makes for 2 cappucini, 4.50 each) and enjoyed it very much.<br>One word about Le Sélect&#39;s wine list. It is one of the best in the city and you will find a lot of different bottles for every taste at every price range. If you check the bin end section, you may find delicious bargains.<br>In conclusion, Le Sélect, after all these years remains one of the strongest dining options in the downtown west area. If you are a fan of French Cuisine and if you like restaurants similar to Les Halles in NYC, you will love this establishment.",

"reviewcomment":"Since the last time I was here, it feels like the menu has changed. While there is an overwhelming selection of burritos, they also have satisfying salads and soups. I ordered the soup of the day, which was a red curried lentil (?) and a small Greek salad. The soup was delicious!  I loved lentil soup!<br><br>Funny story, I sat there for 30 min waiting for my salad to come out. No one asked me how I was doing or if I wanted anything else. I called a server and told her I was waiting for my salad. She gave me a perplexed look; came back and told me none had been sent to the kitchen!  Considering my first server threw the business card on the table when I asked for the wi fi password, I was not surprised my order was overlooked. Thankfully, the 2nd server was more gracious and quickly sent the order to the kitchen.<br><br>The salad was on the house. Because they rectified their mistake, I am rating them highly.",

"reviewcomment":"I was apprehensive about Playa Cabana. I heard they rush people out. I don&#39;t like this. I heard some people say the tacos are amazing and others claim they are not authentic. After enjoying dinner there tonight, I&#39;d say the latter is pretty much horseshit.<br><br>Let&#39;s break it down like this:<br><br>Environment: wonderful, but you couldn&#39;t comfortably spend a lot of time lingering here. The decor of the room is super cool and you feel like you&#39;re in a bar in Mexico. Props for decor. <br><br>Service: They did get a little rush-y at the end, but it was pouring rain outside and we&#39;d already lingered a bit waiting for it to stop, so actually, they were pretty hospitable. If is hadn&#39;t been raining, I would not have found a reason to stay after finishing our food and drinks. Our server wad friendly and recommended a few things for us.<br><br>Food: UH MAZ ING. Are you freaking kidding me? The quality and quantity of meat in the Short Rib Tacos was staggering. So tender and scrumptious. The flavours were making me tingle-- in a good way! Who are these pendejos that say the food is not authentic? They vary the shells up a little, but they are definitely tasty and display traditional Mexican seasoning and flair. Let&#39;s also not forget that Mexico is a very big country with cooking styles as diverse as Italy and India. What one region dresses their tacos with is not what another region will do.<br><br>Pendejos.<br><br>My friend had the Toastadas with Barbacoa and Chicken. The tostadas are large and very good. I&#39;d say for a smaller meal: tacos. Medium meal: Toastadas and large meal: Burritos. I&#39;m a piggy and was stuffed after the tacos. My friend took some of her toastadas home. I am still stuffed after heading out for a couple of drinks and a bike ride across the city.<br><br>Value: under $100 with tax and tip for a pitcher of margs, guac, tostadas and tacos.<br><br>I would happily come here again and again. Very impressed and am not surprised that this place does so well. It&#39;s also too far north and off the beaten path for the hipsters. Not a beard or a pair of skinny jeans in sight!",

"reviewcomment":"I ADORE Snakes &amp; Lattes. It is easily the best Board Game Cafe in Toronto, hands down.<br><br>Best food, best board game selection, best events.<br><br>I&#39;ve tried a good 80% of the menu, and I really have 0 complaints. They offer a nice variety of food that is easy to snack on while you game away (sandwiches, quiches, candy, etc.), and they are freshly made and DELICIOUS. <br><br>Snakes &amp; Lattes also boasts a very nice hot drink menu, and I&#39;m a little bit addicted to their Salted Caramel Lattes. Mmm.<br><br>You can&#39;t compare their vast board game collection to any other board game cafe in the area - they have a giant wall full of different games, and some pretty awesome staff who will teach you how to play any game you haven&#39;t played before, or maybe just need a refresher on. Sure, some of the games are a little worn, but none of them are at the point of being unplayable.<br><br>They also hold some awesome events. I recently attended their Ticket To Ride tournament, and just had an absolute blast. I strongly encourage you to make it out to some of their events - not only are they tons of fun, you&#39;ll meet a lot of pretty cool fellow gamers.<br><br>The only thing that sucks about Snakes &amp; Lattes is the wait times. If you come here on a Fri-Sun during peak hours, you&#39;re in for a long wait. But, they will put you on a wait list and text you when a table is ready, so you&#39;re free to go for dinner/drinks/etc in the area while you wait.<br><br>I am definitely a frequent visitor here, and I don&#39;t see that changing any time soon ;)",

"reviewcomment":"This place is a place of legend. We exited at Rosedale station looking to go to Canadian tire. We needed material for our business. <br><br>As soon as we walked out of the station however our priorities shifted completely. The smell. The smell brought us in. We had no idea where it was coming from so we wandered. Men on a quest. <br><br>When we were about to give up, we thought &#34;maybe it&#39;s coming from the convenience store?&#34; &#34;No way. Are you stupid?&#34; And bam. There it was. A shop with no name. Just this camel. <br><br>We looked in but we were unsure. Giving it a shot we opened the door. The smell! The smell. There were other items on the menu that day, but we saw nothing but the pulled pork. That was what called us there. <br><br>As I bit into my sandwich I almost cried. The soft soft bun. The sweet sauce. The slow cooked meat. The best pulled pork sandwich I have ever eaten. <br><br>We gave our thanks and walked away, but we both looked back to make sure it didn&#39;t magically disappear. One thing was certain that day: we had shared an experience and will never be the same again",

"reviewcomment":"Insomnia Restaurant &amp; Lounge located in the heart of Annex is a cafe by day, and trendy restaurant by night.  It consistently delivers great food, music, friendly service and has a wide variety of martini and cocktails, making it the perfect spot for, well, just about any occasion! The restaurant has a relaxing and inviting ambiance with dim lighting and upbeat background music.<br><br>Live DJs are also featured nightly at 10pm, which provides some pleasant, although not overpowering, entertainment. There is a fair amount of seating considering similar venues in the are and some lounge seating in the back of the restaurant which is really cozy.<br><br>The menu is a mixture of Mediterranean, French and International flavours. The wide variety of over 50 martinis is perfect for Martini Madness, which happens every Thursday night ($5 Martinis and $6.50 Premium Martinis). Not a martini type of person? The restaurant also offers $4 Steam Whistle pints! And If you can&#39;t make it on Thursdays, Insomnia offers daily events and specials catering to everyone&#39;s needs each night of the week. On Fridays, they have $3 Jameson Shots and $3 Candy Apple Shots, and the $11 pizzas are always a hit on Sundays.<br><br>We&#39;ve been to Insomnia more than a few times, and their tasty Rosedale pizza-pesto, portabello, sundried tomatoes, red onion, chevre &amp; olive oil-is amazing, but Thursdays are by far the best day to go.<br><br>The  late night snack menu also makes for a perfect romantic date, or a catch-up with the girls. One of our favourite items on the late night snack menu is the Calamari Po&#39; Boy sandwich: two small sandwiches with crispy calamari, fresh lettuce and spicy aioli, super yummy for only $5!<br><br>Insomnia is open late 7 days a week from 10am to 2am, making it the perfect spot for breakfast, lunch, dinner and post work entertainment in the Annex. If you haven&#39;t been yet you are missing out on one of Toronto&#39;s best!",

We were lucky to get seated right away on a Saturday night.  There aren&#39;t many tables here. Maybe like 5-7 and a party was taking up two of them.<br>No sooner had we sat down when diners started appearing at the door.<br>I had spicy salmon that was so good it made me sad I didn&#39;t live in the area. I would get take out from this place any day of the week.<br>We also shared the Philadelphia roll (cream cheese, avocado, salmon). It was heavenly.<br>My boyfriend loved his meal as well.<br>I did feel a little rushed when we were here... more from the people waiting at the door, staring down my food than from the servers (although we felt a little pressure from them too).<br>The sushi however, was so good that I would definitely want to return.",

"reviewcomment":"My first time ever eating steak in a restaurant...and of COURSE, I had to be spoiled by Jacobs &amp; Co!<br><br>Service: amaaaaaazing. Our server, Henry, was really personable, down to earth, and attentive. There was this lady with a cute smile who made the Caesar salad and explained the salts/sauces..she was great. Everyone there worked together perfectly. The hostess stand and management were amazing as well. I can&#39;t say enough good things about their service.<br><br>We tried:<br>- White cheddar cheese popovers with roasted garlic &amp; oregano butter: this is the amazing bread that comes out. I usu don&#39;t like bread and def do not eat butter, but the two together were just melt in your mouth delicious.<br>- 6 oz tenderloin (Canadian prime Hereford-Lindsay, ON): I know I&#39;m crazy, but I don&#39;t like raw meat, so I had mine well-done, and it wasn&#39;t dry at all.. it was amaaaazing.<br>- 10 oz california cut (Snake River Farms Wagyu from Idaho, USA): reeeeally good!!<br>- Caesar salad: love how it&#39;s made tableside! 1 order is def enough for 2 people. The dressing isn&#39;t too creamy, and there&#39;s a perfect amt of dressing to lettuce. I also appreciate how mine didn&#39;t come covered w/cheese, and they added bacon &amp; extra croutons per my fried food &amp; carb lovin&#39; request.<br>- Asparagus: came w/this hollaindaise sauce.. it was really good! Next time though, I&#39;ll prolly skip the asparagus so I can try other veggies.<br>- Potato puree: creamy mashed potatoes, we ordered a 1/2 portion!<br>- Duck fat french fried potatoes: sooooooo...goooooood. I think they&#39;re double fried? Who knows, but they&#39;re a gift from God.<br><br>A+ food, service, and ambiance!! (And they even give you muffins to take home!)",

"reviewcomment":"Was taken here on a business lunch on a week day. I must say I am quite the fan of anything with history and character, and this little one-room schoolhouse with its exposed brick, antique clocks on the wall and an apple on every &#34;desk&#34; warmed my heart before I even sat down at our table.  There was quite a long line as we went just after noon, but we had our names taken promptly and were sat in 15 minutes or so. Watching the chefs in the exposed kitchen and the cafeteria-style display of treats at the front counter got my mouth watering and kept me very well entertained. It also gave me ample time to food-creep.<br><br>There is quite the list of unique cocktails, many of which featured Bourbon if that&#39;s your thang. It wasn&#39;t a Mad Men work lunch for me, but I LOVED that their ice tea is fresh brewed and you can get it unsweetened and sweeten it yourself, American-style. One star just for that! The lunch menu wasn&#39;t very extensive, especially if you&#39;re not a brunch/eggs person (that eliminates half the menu right off the bat). That said, I had the jerk chicken and mango sandwich and my co-workers each had a salad and an egg dish, and we all really enjoyed our meals. <br><br>The only draw back was the service was incredibly slow, we waited over 30 minutes for our food and nearly missed our after-lunch meeting (a shame, really). That said, the place was packed and a waitress had apparently cut herself and they were one man down. The owner came out and spoke to everyone to make sure their meals were good, to explain the situation and offer her apologies. She even tracked us down after we paid and gave us a coupon to come back next time, apologizing again. I thought that was super sweet, and she seemed genuinely apologetic. <br><br>Overall, I would definitely come back to this cozy, quaint little hipster joint in Liberty V. They also have a small patio that will be calling my name this summer.",

"reviewcomment":"* * * * 7 West is a game-changer! <br><br>This place is 24-7-365!! seriously, it&#39;s always open. This place is a super cozy and intimate hot spot to go with a few friends for anytime (prefer: late night) cuisine or on a date (I&#39;ve brought more than a few first dates here). And surprisingly, not every person knows about this little gem! <br><br>Now, I want you to imagine yourself in the Yonge/Bloor area, it&#39;s 4 a.m., it&#39;s been an amazing night with you and your friends, but now you&#39;re all starving.. some people will settle for McDonald&#39;s, others want breakfasty-food.. 7 West is the answer. It offers an exceptional menu with dozens of meals--burgers/sandwiches to salads/soups to entrees and breakfast foods. They serve great coffee, and if the time is right, even alcoholic coffee beverages. <br><br>Definitely a good choice at any time, but personally, I like going late nights when the candles lit up the wooden interior of the room and the small rooms make for great fun. <br><br>Menu: <a href='/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.7westcafe.com%2F7westmenu.pdf&amp;s=416571d1a84a89bbcb7cf3f4db4f65274e8ad7331be7f67b2babcf65f98c04c7' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>7westcafe.com/7westmenu.…</a><br>Recommendations: Penne Chicken, Penne Arrabiata, Mac N&#39; Cheese with bacon/ham, All-Time Breakfast, (Double Stack) Grill Cheese with bacon/ham, Pulled Pork Sandwich, Irish Whiskey Coffee, and ANY desert. <br><br>Keep it classy ladies and gentlemen, enjoy!<br><br>-Ace<br><br>&#34;There cannot be good living where there is not good drinking&#34;",

"reviewcomment":"*Buca&#39;s chocolate hazelnut version of Zuccotto*<br><br>I could have just written about this cake in a short tip, but nope, I chose to dedicate a whole review to this thing. I&#39;m cool like dat. <br><br>Yes, we all know that Buca, Bar Buca and Buca Osteria Enoteca (opening soon in Yorkville) are solid, but do you specifically know about this stunning cake on their dessert menu? Probably not. I think that people tend to go for the other insanely good and more popular options and skip over this traditional Florentine cake option.<br><br>My admittedly shoddy photo was initially of my cute work friends, but for the purpose of this review, I have lovingly cropped them out of the shot and we are left with the blurry, zoomed-in, dome-shaped zuccotto. As a point of interest, the zuccotto is said to be shaped this way to resemble the dome of Florence&#39;s Duomo.<br><br>When I was in Florence for the first time, I climbed the stairs to get to the top of the Duomo and was stunned by the view of the city. You will reach a similar kind of bliss when you share this dessert. <br><br>However, the price of the zuccotto ($26) is also like the climb to the top of the Duomo: a bit steep.The menu does state that this serves two though, and with elements of Gianduja, chocolate, Frangelica and cream, it could easily serve 3 or 4 people (or just one person, depending on your mood). You can also tell that a lot of care has gone into constructing the cake. <br><br>It&#39;s a dreamy dessert combining a cakey top half soaked in Frangelica, a chocolate mousse filling, a gianduja cookie base (we only realized this after we had finished the rest of the cake - best surprise!) and a cream sauce poured over the top... Ciao bella zuccotto!",

"reviewcomment":"When I lived in Toronto, I would visit this place once a month if now more. I&#39;ve surely been here at least 20 times. The servers are some of the best in town and have such a positive attitude. The food is great as well! Recommendations are the Blueberry Scones, the Chicken and Waffles, and the Breakfast Burrito. The scones are a must! I will say that 2 times I received the scones they weren&#39;t good though. They forgot the sugar in the recipe or something. It was off. They did remove them from the bill though.<br><br>The patio in the summer is great and the lounge next to the windows are my favorite spots. <br><br>My only complaint is that I think the menu prices are inflated by 20% or so. The food is good, but it&#39;s VERY easy to rack up a $80 brunch bill for 2.",

I used to avoid this place because the line out the door was daunting, but my friends insisted I give it a try. <br><br>I walked in a few weeks ago and asked the friendly Australian counter staff what his favourite menu item was. He replied &#34;Gobernator, hands down.&#34;<br><br>I just finished my fifth one since then, and it&#39;s too delicious to try anything else. The chewy shrimp, the meaty mahi fish, and the creamy sauce are perfect together. <br><br>After reading the reviews here, I think I&#39;ll have to try the Baja fish next. <br><br>I&#39;d give 6 stars if I could!",

"reviewcomment":"This restaurant was on my list for a while to check out.<br><br>I went here for my anniversary with my boyfriend, its a little on the pricier side for some of their items, which is why we waited until a special occasion to visit.<br><br>You really can&#39;t get in here for a dinner without a reservation, unless you plan on waiting a while - that&#39;s my first tip! Call ahead! It isn&#39;t a huge venue, so there isn&#39;t a LOT of seating available - I consider this a positive though, not a negative.<br><br>The whole venue gives off a very rustic, cozy appeal. They have their own fire place where they bake their own bread (tip #2 - buy their sourdough! Its amazing!). <br><br>We were sat upstairs - I will admit the two person tables are a little too closer together. That was about the only negative I had. If they were a full house, you would be close enough to the table beside you that you would have to be conscious of what you did with your arms.<br><br>We had the Oysters and the French Onion Soup to start. Their French Onion Soup is amazing - I highly recommend it. It&#39;s great to share as it&#39;s very rich - but you&#39;ll always want more when you&#39;re done! The oyster we delicious too!<br><br>I had their Russet Potato Gnocchi &#39;a la Poutine&#39;. They&#39;re not kidding when they put the word &#34;poutine&#34; in the title. It does give off a very poutine like flavour! It was very good though! It&#39;s a very rich and dense dinner, so I didn&#39;t even come close to eating the whole thing.<br><br>My boyfriend had the Stuffed Duck and Savoy Cabbage Rolls - they were AMAZING. I picked off his plate quite a bit because of it. I highly recommend them.<br><br>All in all it was a great experience. It is little pricier, but the service was good - the food was delicious, and as a bonus when we went to buy bread at the end of the night, they gave us some for free! I guess when they get close to closing time, they start to give the breads away if youre eating there - as they bake it fresh each day. Delicious!",

"reviewcomment":"Came here on a Thursday night for dinner and drinks with a pal. I really like meeting friends here because of the location - it&#39;s conveniently located for most people in the city. The patio was nice (a little cold, but this year has had a crazy long winter). It&#39;s a little expensive - dinner for two with two glasses of wine was about $100. The food is okay, but everything else pushed my review to become a four star and to a &#39;yay I&#39;m a fan&#39; level. Service was excellent with a capital &#39;E.&#39; Our server should work in a higher end restaurant as he definitely has what it takes. I also really loved the atmosphere. It&#39;s a great place to meet up with people over drinks and dinner.<br><br>Good for: drinks, dinner",

There&#39;s really nothing bad to be said about a place that focuses on relatively healthy food in a quick and timely manner (both eat-in and take away). Everything tastes great and makes you feel good about your life choices, even if only for a moment. <br><br>The salads are delicious, the bowls are good too. Juices are amazing. Really my only problem with this place is the price. If only I had the time to construct a salad then I may not be paying $15 dollars for a nicely arranged bowl of veggies. <br><br>Yes it&#39;s delicious and yes I do love the place BUT when given the time I usually would rather make it at home for half the price.",

For some reason they start holding up the line even when the place isn&#39;t packed, also you get a lot of line hoppers or people holding a spot in line for like 20 people, it can get pretty frustrating.<br><br>For extra good times, order some 10%+ beers, Delirium and a German one which I can&#39;t spell nor pronounce (starts with a K).<br><br>I like how liberal this place is, some semi-quiet space at the front for people to stand and chat, the mosh pit dancing area for people who want to get down and an easy access washroom path so you&#39;re not wading through a crowd like most clubs.",

"reviewcomment":"+ crispy fries, lots of cheese curds<br>-  needs more gravy<br><br>Went here last night after a concert downtown.  It was a little busy at 11:30pm on a Saturday. Ordered the traditional regular, $6.99.  Lots of staff working here, not sure why they need so many. Waited for about 10 minutes for the order. Lots of room to wait with a few tables to eat at or wait.<br><br>The poutine came in a round container with optional lid.  The fries were nice and crispy, with a good amount of cheese, but not enough gravy. I would have liked the gravy to be more of a beef flavour.  I thoroughly enjoyed the poutine, and would certainly get it again.",

"reviewcomment":"Great spot for brunch.  So happy that we came here as we were very satisfied with the food and service.  The servers were warm, friendly and prompt.  The food selection tends to be heavy but that is what brunches are for, right?  To laze away the afternoon.  So we had the pulled pork grilled cheese, which was rich and savoury and paired with some jam on the side.  This is truly dangerous to have as a meal because you will think this much richness is normal.  We also had the Mexican waffle, which had savoury waffles, topped with super umami bison chilli that taste so bold and decadent.  All of this with poached eggs and salsa, guacamole and sour cream on the side.  I was in meat heaven.  Yummy in my tummy.<br><br>So there it is.  A happy place for brunch and I did not have to wait in line.  What a great spot and so accessible from my hood.<br><br>I will definitely be back here again.  I will have to make sure that I have earned it before I come here though and get those extra workouts to earn the great meals here.",

I&#39;ve gone the past couple Thursdays and have had a really good experience each time. I particularly like the chicken, egg, cheese, and mushroom crepe, and they make a good mai tai. My only minor complaint with the martinis is they&#39;re all pretty sweet, which gets to be a little too much after the second or third.<br><br>Be prepared to either get there super early or wait for a long time to get a table.

"reviewcomment":"I have dined at Canteen over fifty times. I frequent the place a lot! I will tell you why I&#39;m such a fan.<br><br>Service: they are very helpful, friendly and attentive. Yes, they may seem a bit disorganized at times and you may have more than one person serving you, but that never bothered me as long as I have my food and a friendly face. I&#39;m not attempting here to build a personal relationship with my waiter. Also, tables don&#39;t have one allocated waiter. The person bringing you your coffee may not be the same person bringing you your dessert. <br><br>Food: The food is great, it&#39;s fresh, high quality, tasty and innovative. They change their menu every few months and it keeps it exciting!  I have to admit, some of their portions are small depending on what you order, but the flavours are great. Some are complex in nature, others very simple. Everything they serve is top-notch quality and homemade. Hence the price. Ask your waiter about the portion if you&#39;re really hungry so you&#39;re not disappointed. Out of the 45-50 times that I have dined at Canteen, I have complained only once about their food. That&#39;s a ratio of 1:45. That&#39;s pretty good if you ask me. <br><br>I highly recommend this place. If you have a very good palette, are a foodie and want to enjoy a good tasting meal, then this is a good place for you to frequent. Canteen is considered med-high in terms of pricing. So if you&#39;re looking for cheap eats, this is not the place for you.<br><br>They serve lunch, dinner, breakfast and brunch. Their sandwiches are fantastic. Their butter-chicken halloumi pizza is amazing. Their Canadian cheddar cheese sandwich, shredded pork, pineapple fish tacos and burgers are some of my favourite on their menu. They have nice pastries and sandwiches to go. <br><br>Ambiance is very casual, fun, large room with lots of seating.  It gets really busy at times but wait never exceeds 20 minutes (at least in my experience).<br><br>I love this place and I&#39;m a huge fan. I love this TIFF+CANTEEN love affair. <br><br>Viva Canada!",

"reviewcomment":"Honestly, ever since this place opened, I kept hearing how bad it was and what a tourist trap it was. Then over the last few weeks, I kept hearing and reading contradicting reviews and then, I decided to take the plunge. So, Sunday May 8, at 5 pm, I went there for dinner.<br>First the weather was crappy  and we sat inside. However, we had a reservation, so we would have probably been inside anyways as this patio would already be full if the weather were great. Now, the interior is marvelous and a great example of the &#34;old meets new``style characteristic  that is found in most businesses of the Distillery District.<br>The food is serious business. Delicious and authentic, while creative. Perhaps is it the lack of pretentious hipsters that make some say it&#39;s a tourist trap? Hmmm....<br>Anyways, this is the type of place where the fun is to share. The menu is huge and varied. My dining companion and I shared Tuna ceviche ($10.00), delicious and delicate, a perfect harmony of tastes: great fish, citrus, cilantro. a winner. The chicken burritos(10.00) were good, but very ordinary compared to the wonderful fish tacos(15.00)which consisted of crispy fried haddock,chipotle lime coleslaw presented on a flour tortilla. Refreshing and robust at the same time. Those fish tacos alone are a  good reason to visit El Catrin. The costilla corta(15.00) is also a great dish, combining different flavours in perfect harmony: 24 hour braised beef short rib, almond mole, sweet potato purée and sautéed sugar snap peas. Lipsmacking! My Mexican friends believe the dessert we had to be a total heresy. I personally think that the tacos dulces(7.00), while truly unauthentic, were authentically delicious and everything a dessert should be: light, satisfying, refreshing, sweet and with just a hint of saltiness. Think about it:  a banana fritter, dulce de leche, crushed salted peanuts, chocolate and strawberry sauce on a corn tortilla. I could have gone for seconds!<br>But one thing I just love about El Catrin is their strength behind the bar. Although they have wine and beer, cocktails are the way to go here.  They also have an amazing selection of tequilas. If, like myself, you are new to the Mexican firewater, this is a great place to get an education. The cocktail I had( or shall I say the 2 cocktails I had, $12.00 each) was a Mayahuel.  Milagro Reposado tequila mixed with Jagermeister ,  agave nectar,  fresh lemon juice  and what gives the whole drink its zing: ginger beer. Truly addictive.<br>The service was professional and very friendly. Our server really knew the menu well and gave good advice in terms of drink/food pairings. We never felt pressured and had a leisurely time. The noise level, while rather high, is not at all disturbing as the place is big enough and you can hear your dining companions talk. And that is the whole point of going out for dinner with people, isn&#39;t it?<br>So, we had a great time and at $116.39 for 2 before tip, the price is not more expensive or cheaper than a lot of other restaurants with inferior offerings and a boring atmosphere. And we were definitely full at the end of the meal.<br><br>So, for great food, great drinks in a gorgeous setting, go to El Catrin. You will have a great time!",

We ended the evening with a delicious vermouth on the house, which was a great surprise.  Definitely we&#39;ll go back.",

Very friendly and knowledgable just what you want from the person taking care of business and your dinner. <br><br>The menu is reliably delicious, the specials seem deliciously creative. We come about 3 times a month (almost every Wednesday!) they usually chance the specials once a month from what I&#39;ve noticed.<br><br>I won&#39;t lie, it&#39;s almost always busy, so if you&#39;re in a rush come early for dinner or late for lunch! Furthermore dinning here can seem like a fast food restaurant by the speed of the wait staff removing your plates and the amount of people that are in and out of here!

"reviewcomment":"Reasonably priced with a MONSTROUS menu, this gem in Chinatown has a little something for everyone and is open quite late. It was the perfect spot to accomodate some post-shopping foodies before heading back to the States (I am a Buffalo resident who travels to TO somewhat regularly) in the evening. <br><br>Things that really set this place apart from what I&#39;m used to - 1) It&#39;s massive inside and well taken care of. Aside from a few sit down spots, typical Chinese in Buffalo = good to great food dirt cheap, but served from a rundown or very sparse, outdated strip mall/corner restaurant with no table service (and often few or no tables). <br><br>2) Very friendly wait staff - again, most places here don&#39;t even offer table service. Our waiter was very knowledgable about the menu and described in detail several of the beverages they offered. Also with table service came complimentary tea and the joy of seeing what others ordered. <br><br>3) A huge variety of seafood was offered, including a plethora of fish, eel and abalone (sea snail). Many of these creatures are in tanks in the back of the restaurant, which makes me go &#34;awwww&#34; in both a &#34;that&#39;s cool/cute&#34; and &#34;it&#39;s sad you&#39;re about to be eaten&#34; kinds of ways. I know this is typical of Chinatown locales in TO, Boston and other large cities, but not the norm in B-lo.<br><br>4) Massive amount of vegetarian and vegan friendly items instead of the typical four to ten item list at most take out places. <br><br>The food ranged from good to excellent, everything tasting fresh and not re-heated. The egg rolls and traditional boba (bubble milk tea) were particularly good and my boyfriend&#39;s bbq pork with bok choy and fried rice noodles had complex, rich flavor and didn&#39;t suffer the overly salty or greasy trap some bbq veers into. My dish, fried rice with vegetables and a variety of seafood, was fresh and hot (despite my wait - more below) but somewhat bland. It was my least favorite part of the meal, but not bad. <br><br>My complaints - service was very slow. It was busy-ish, but not packed, and there was a lot of staff but it still seemed to take a long time between visits. Also, my date&#39;s food came out (no joke) a full 20 minutes before mine. I don&#39;t know if mine was forgotten or what. I finally flagged someone down (missing waiter) and asked about it. Sh+t happens, so I won&#39;t take much off for this - I&#39;d say the slow waiter return, slow bring out of dinner and my meal itself being just okay combined only deducted a star from the overall experience. <br><br>I would definitely go back. The menu offers almost infinite options at a reasonable price in a convenient location.",

I guess that&#39;s also says a lot to a rotating and fresh menu. <br>Last maybe the best desert in the area. <br><br>Thank You QMC!!!",

"reviewcomment":"Brought my fiance here today for his birthday and im glad I did! Turned out it was $1 sushi Thursdays. Since were both sushi lovers we seized the opportunity and got a few nigiris and sushi rolls. SO GOOD! Probably the best I&#39;ve had. The main reason is because of their chili mayo sauce...to die for! Also, the size of the sushi rolls. They wern&#39;t ridiculously big and I could actually (somewhat elegantly might i add) fit one whole piece in my mouth. <br><br>The atmosphere is dark, romantic. Definitely somewhere to bring a SO or even for a fun night out with your girlfriends. They have a nice patio as well for when its nice out. The decor is beautifull. Havent been anywhere this nice in Toronto! <br><br>Service was good, could be better. I felt they needed more waiters. Ours was friendly and knowledgeable about the menu but I had to wait at times to get a refill of water and to get the check. It wasnt crowded plus I had reservations so we didnt wait at all.<br><br>Price wise...well $1 sushi im not complaining! Definitely good sushi and good price. Their main dishes (judging by the menu) were between 17-25 which is alao very reasonable.<br><br>Will I be back? YES! I want to try that red snapper dish....",

"reviewcomment":"Finally! West-coast chic comes to Toronto! Love it!! And it was hopping busy, even though it&#39;s Monday evening.<br><br>I&#39;ve been to the Earl&#39;s chain of restaurants in a few different cities out west - in Alberta and BC. I never knew they had locations in Ontario! Soooo excited! But they&#39;ve been in Toronto for 3 years. What was I waiting for?! There&#39;s one in London Ontario, and they&#39;re hoping to expand into the USA. Go Earl&#39;s!<br><br>It&#39;s an upscale rib restaurant, with a huge seating area inside and out on the patio, with a clean and chic interior. There&#39;s an outdoor patio that was full already even though it&#39;s only May. This location is well situated to serve the financial district of Toronto. The food is gorgeous and so are the waitresses and waiter.<br><br>We ordered their special: a full rack of ribs for $25.00 so that we could take advantage of their $4 glasses of beer that go with it, and a burger with fries, at about $12.00. Both were delicious! <br><br>I would definitely go back. <br><br>Please bring Earl&#39;s to Ottawa!! Pretty please!!",

"reviewcomment":"We made a reservation here for brunch since it happened to be the closest brunch place to our hotel and it was great! Easy to find with good service and a nice selection to choose from on the menu. Almost too good because everything sounded so yummy it was hard to decide... for me it&#39;s always a toss up between savoury or sweet but thankfully my brunchmates were up for sharing!<br><br>I ordered the short rib hash and it was incredibly tender and the portion was surprisingly very large with lots of short rib. We also tried the in-house made scones (I&#39;m not a huge scone fan but they seemed pretty good), salmon benny, caramelized fruit french toast (this was the dish I would&#39;ve ordered for myself if I went the sweet route and it was delicious!), the traditional breakfast (looked the most &#39;normal&#39; to me, but my friend liked it), teas, fresh squeezed juices... all were really good. Of course the short rib and the French toast were standouts for me and you can never go too wrong with brunch! <br><br>The restaurant itself is really nice and upstairs from the big name brand stores, there is a patio but it was incredibly windy and still cold so it wasn&#39;t open which was fine by us. They have nice booth seating inside which is comfortable. When we got there the restaurant had just opened at 11am and we had the first reservation so it wasn&#39;t busy but definitely by the time we left it was all full. Service was nice and I liked the French bistro feel to the place. Really liked how they take reservations especially for brunch! Unheard of in Vancouver!",

"reviewcomment":"I loved this little restaurant so much that I wish I could&#39;ve eaten here more than once during my short trip to Toronto earlier this week. <br><br>I stopped in on Tuesday for dinner and fortunately had a reservation. The place was packed. Tables are close together and I could hear the conversations going on to my right and left, but I tried not to focus on that too much. The drinks and food in front of me were too great to care.<br><br>My first drink was the juniper gin and tonic, which was a great twist on the classic, and my second was the hibiscus royale. Delicious! I also hear the spiked lemonade with gin was good. I can&#39;t believe I didn&#39;t sneak a sip. Strange of me.<br><br>For an app, I had the deep fried beer cheese croquettes and they went down too quickly. It was ridiculous. They were too good.<br><br>When it came time for my main dish, I flip-flopped between the chicken pot pie and the mac and cheese. I had read the Yelp reviews ahead of my visit and both sounded top-notch. Finally, I decided on the chicken pot pie and geesh! That thing was huge. Huge. And so, so good, creamy, fresh, meaty, crusty and hot. Man, oh man.<br><br>Considering my level of stuffed-to-the-core, I don&#39;t know why I ordered dessert. But I did: the mini doughnuts. Cleared the plate, too. Tells you something.<br><br>The Gabardine is an experience I&#39;ll most definitely want to repeat if I&#39;m ever in Toronto again. Fantastic meal!",

I went over the menu and couldn&#39;t see the French toast that everyone raved about including blogTO. I asked the waitress and she advised that hasn&#39;t been on the menu in like a year and its still all over the internet. So I&#39;m putting it out there... <br><br>THEY DO NOT SERVE THE STUFFED FRENCH TOAST ANYMORE!!! <br><br>I was disappointed but was hungry so had go pick something else.<br><br>Order their $5 Cesar!! Almost everyone had one when we looked around, so you certainly can&#39;t go wrong. It was delicious. It wasn&#39;t watered down, thick and spicy! <br> I choose the mushroom eggs Benny without onions and Dave got lola&#39;s breakfast with frites.<br><br>We both thoroughly enjoyed our meals. My dish was loaded with mushrooms, you can take the herbs and lemon in the sauce and the home fries were nice and crispy. Mine was delicious. Dave enjoyed his too but it was eggs and bacons and frites and he loved the frites.<br><br>What started off disappointing left me satisfied and besides there&#39;s so many dessert places around that I was able to satisfy my sweet tooth after. <br><br>My only suggestion is adding a sweet dish to the brunch menu.",

"reviewcomment":"I came here for a friends birthday. We reserved a private room and the birthday celebrant ordered an array of dishes from the menu. Food was AMAZING.<br><br>Served fresh and timely, you can tell the food was homemade and with quality. The meatballs, calamari, vegetables, fresh pasta and lamb were all to die for. <br><br>Our hostess was polite and very attentive to our needs. Unlike some places, they do separate bills. It may seem like a hassle and to some, a little unorthodox, but they to accept separate bills. Wine menu is pleasant, and the drinks are typical of any restaurant. <br><br>Atmosphere is dim and relaxing, however, some of the paintings on the wall were a little disturbing for my liking. The music they played was dope, but a little weird for the overall restaurant setting. There was an abundance of Biggie Smalls and Tupac, but did not expect it from a restaurant such as this. Overall a pleasant experience.",

"reviewcomment":"This place has some solid food in a part of the city that is usually known for mall food courts and touristy chains.<br><br>The FOOD is the reason to come here.  Everything is incredibly fresh and delicious.  The falafel do not go on holiday here, instead, they are fried to order and come out deliciously fresh.  They also come with a delicious garlic sauce, so if you&#39;re on a date, make sure you&#39;re both having it ;)<br><br>The chicken shawarma here was a definite hit.  Clearly real chicken was harmed in the making of it, and it shows.  None of that pressed factory garbage that gets shipped in frozen.  That was truly delicious.  It&#39;s served with a side of pita that comes out freshly baked and puffed up in an awesome way.<br><br>The SERVICE we had was great.  We got very lucky and had a very good waitress last time, who despite being rather busy was quite on top of our needs.  This level of service is not always guaranteed.<br><br>The process of getting a table though always seems to involve an insane amount of confusion and waiting and miscommunications.  What is going on at the host/hostess station?  <br><br>The VENUE itself is just fine.  Tables are super close togethers...it&#39;s back to back (and side to side).  The upstairs looks pretty cool, but I&#39;ve never gotten to sit there.  Avoid the front venues in cold weather...it was just silly cold there, and everyone still had their hats and coats on sitting there.  Crazy!<br><br>Overall, the best middle eastern food I&#39;ve had in the city at a reasonable price.  Especially good if you need something to eat to fuel your shopping spree at the Eaton Centre that won&#39;t break the budget.",

My mom and dad (who were married in 1952) used to frequent this place shortly after they met.  <br>I remember them having their condiments on a lazy susan type device (which I loved as a kid).  <br>Their hamburgers are absolutely delish.  The fries are great, and if you go there for brunch their coffee will blow you away.<br>This place holds a special place in my heart because of my mom and dad, but that aside, it&#39;s an awesome restaurant with an old school feel and great food.",

"reviewcomment":"To start off, I&#39;ve been to the Woodbridge location before and I was not blown away by the gnocchi that I had ordered. So, when my friend recommended we go to the Eglinton location, I was a bit hesitant. The reason I decided to go was because I remembered how delicious their tiramisu was.<br><br>After scanning the menu and looking through some yelpers&#39; pictures, I decided I wanted to have the Basta pasta dish with creamy sauce. Someone had posted a picture of it with what seemed to be no sauce and another with rosé sauce. I asked the server about the rosé one and he said that isn&#39;t how they normally serve it and he didn&#39;t recommend the switch either. In any case, I was really hungry and was craving shrimp, so I ordered it as is on the menu! <br><br>Verdict? It was probably the best pasta I&#39;ve ever had in my entire life. It tasted soooo good that I ended up using the side of bread they brought us to wipe the plate clean. I would definitely recommend it to anyone and everyone. I&#39;ve never had green spinach pasta, but it tasted delicious. I also tried my friend&#39;s pasta with pesto sauce and chicken and it was really good as well. <br><br>Finally, the reason I came for...the tiramisu. They serve it like 3 scoops like ice cream on a plate, which is completely different from the Vaughan location. But oh my..it was still so creamy and just delicious. <br><br>Overall, I had a great time! We were seated very quickly even though the restaurant was packed on a Monday evening at 7:30. The server wasn&#39;t in our faces and I really appreciated that. He was helpful when needed. The food was incredible and I would definitely come back to try their other dishes!",

The servers and service was extremely prompt and courteous.  <br>In little to no time, we had our glasses of Castillo de Monseran Garnacha (Spain) ...definitely need to add this to my collection of wines now haha.... <br>After a few mins our Hummus dip with olives had been serve. 4/5<br>In House made hummus, perfect blend of ingredients served with crispy pita bread was lovely, Luckily for those who could never decided black or green olives, this dish incorporated both...so PLUS in my books.  <br><br>ill be back here again. just got to watch the belly dancing performance ;)",

Anyway, SO GOOD. My date and I tried a decent portion of the menu, but our favourites were the Korean fried chicken and the Trini doubles. The quail, reuben slider and tuna hand roll weren&#39;t too shabby, either. Don&#39;t come here on a completely empty stomach, nor an empty wallet. It&#39;s a fun place to come with a small group, late night, in between dinner and a night out on the town.<br><br>Fun little detail: They&#39;ve made their own 416-appropriate version of a San Pellegrino label, in which they serve water. I&#39;m all about the little details... I appreciated it :)",

We shared a Turtle Cheesecake &amp; the friend we met later had a basket of onion rings bigger than my head. As enticingly crispy as they looked, I did not feel like any more food as I had just indulged in a Beef Empanada at Jumbo Empanadas prior to hitting this place up for coffee, desserts &amp; more chatter. <br><br>Impressive array of cakes &amp; cheesecakes... &amp; flavour-infused gourmet coffees. English Toffee was pretty good. Everyone gets French Vanilla &amp; I already know how universally appealing &amp; good it is, so I passed. <br><br>The place was overrun by Asian Visa students because there was a promotion for 20% off all-day breakfasts with student I.D. It&#39;s very close to U of T &amp; is a quaint, spacious atmosphere to relax &amp; study in so I guess the congestion was inevitable. <br><br>Very efficiently operated: I noticed that the entrees counter was separated from the desserts &amp; beverages one. If I actually had to eat a full meal here from start to finish, I would likely have to endure both line ups. That would not be fun. I especially liked its proximity to Spadina Station. The exterior Ultramarine or royal blue walls with medium yellow trim/accents make this place easy to track/describe to a friend.

"reviewcomment":"Throughout the years Hot House has always delivered great food and great service: these are the reasons that patrons are loyal. HH is always busy and if you have definite plans, you are best to make a reservation. During spring and summer, good luck getting in - whether inside or on the always popular patio in this lovely neighbourhood. <br><br>I&#39;ve never had a meal here that I didn&#39;t fully enjoy:  Penne alla Sambuca and Supreme of Chicken (stuffed chicken) are my personal and highly recommended favourites. I&#39;ve always enjoyed any pasta and the salads are excellent. Their pizzas are very popular. Wine selection and desserts are always great. <br><br>Whether you are just stopping by for a meal or a glass of wine or celebrating an anniversary/event, down-to-earth and family friendly Hot House is a favourite - it&#39;s a comfortable, warm, and easy atmosphere.  The host and hostess are always friendly; wait staff are friendly and attentive.  In many years (dining as a couple, small or large group) I can say barely any service issue (possibly the odd slowness of food during a peak time - understandable and not an issue for me) and never any disappointment with the quality of the food, wine, dessert etc.  I can truly say this for friends and family as well!",

"reviewcomment":"This is, without exaggeration, the best food I&#39;ve had since coming to Toronto. Maybe it&#39;s because I&#39;m a sucker for fake chicken or maybe it&#39;s just really that good, but I&#39;m definitely returning.<br><br>I went here with my meat-loving boyfriend, whose food I sampled for the purposes of this review. We shared an appetizer of vegan buffalo wings. For me, this was the highlight of the meal. I looooved buffalo wings when I ate meat, and I had high expectations for these. I am pleased to say they were crunchy and the sauce was great.<br><br>I got the unchicken + waffles, and my boyfriend got the &#34;bacon cheeseburger&#34; with fries supremacy. Mine was great, and the sides of collared greens and sweet potato mash complemented it sooo nicely. I tried some of my boyfriend&#39;s meal too! The burger was nice, and the fries were awesome. Even my boyfriend, who is nearly a carnivore, really enjoyed it.<br><br>Overall, I definitely recommend eating here, especially if you&#39;re a vegetarian! Even if you&#39;re not, I still recommend checking it out.",

"reviewcomment":"So I had a groupon voucher that was expiring soon, so I decided to make good use of it. This place is known for their yellow victorian home and is split between a cafe on the right and the fine dine on the left. We sat inside the dining area for this occasion. We sat by where the running little falls were against the tree wall. You hear the nice pleasant flow of water pouring down. One thing about fine dine I DO NOT like is the darkness! Its hard to see the menu and also the dish that is presented to you.<br><br>We presented the voucher to our server Walter and he handed us a pre-fixed groupon selection. <br><br>For starters we got the beet salad and roasted bone marrow.<br><br>Ontario beets walnut crusted chèvre croquettes / field lettuce / pickled fennel /maple tarragon vinaigrette<br>- I thought the size for this is quite small, but then again it is a salad.<br>- I enjoyed the oven cooked cheese round balls.<br>- Not a big fan of arugula. Beets are new to me and I hear its healthy.<br><br>Wild mushrooms and Marrow garbanzo purée / roast garlic / lemon frisée / house crostini <br>- First time trying bone marrow and it was a hit n miss for most ppl. For us, its a &#39;HIT&#39;. Its like consuming melted fat. You pick it in between the bone and the flavour is really there. Two bones to enjoy the slitter meat fat in between.<br><br>Mains we got the Ontario Lamb Shank and ltsumo Tuna.<br><br>Ontario lamb shank <br>ancho braised / northern bean tomato ragout / lamb sausage / garlic chips<br>- This was a good size drum stick meat. It was very tender and a bit fatty at the same time. My gf enjoyed it very much. I enjoyed it.<br>- Didn&#39;t like the bean tomato ragout.<br><br>Itsumo Tuna purple potatoes / edamame / kumato tomatoes / Sriracha emulsion / soy glaze<br>- Cooked right at medium rare tuna. Really enjoyable but only two rectangular pieces. <br>- Noticed the purple potatoes and the kumato tomatoes.<br>- Didn&#39;t really taste the sriracha, but did taste the soy glaze.<br>- edamame beans were a few.<br><br>Desserts we got the churros and dark warm chocolate cake.<br><br>chocolate dark warm chocolate cake / vanilla ice cream / lime marshmallow white chocolate pistachio lollipop / raspberry sauce <br>- hockey puck size of gooey chocolate flowing out as you cut it in the middle. Goes well with vanilla ice cream. Didn&#39;t really like the lollipop marshmallow.<br><br>churros Spanish donuts finished in cinnamon and sugar /chocolate chili / cajeta <br>- Its alright. Not that impressive.<br><br>I also got a mixed non-alcoholic beverage that had grapefruit, orange juice, pineapple and ginger beer. It was quite tasty.<br><br>Overall this place gets a solid 4/5. Service was attentive and good. Food was good. Atmosphere was good. Just a little too dark for me. Only has one stall in the bathroom for men in the cafe area which is kind of sad. =(<br><br>After the groupon discount with tax and tip, I still shelled out an additional $35 for the dining experience.",

"reviewcomment":"This place holds a very special place in my heart because it was the location of a very special date with a certain special person some time ago. That being said, the experience itself of dining at Cantina was nothing short of special!<br><br>We rolled the proverbial dice (a poor piece of planning on my part) and decided to show up and try our luck - my date was confident that the bar seats were actually the best place to eat according to her local friends. Unfortunately it was packed... like packed! It&#39;s not a big place, so I strongly encourage you to make reservations if you&#39;d like a table. <br><br>That said, my date was absolutely correct! We ended up just squeezing into two seats at the end of the bar and while i had an espresso machine poking into my back for part of the evening, it was one of the best service experiences I&#39;ve had to date.<br><br>I have a theory that when a bartender is required to step up as your server for the evening, they&#39;re far more relaxed with their jobs - sometimes that can be a bad thing but from my experience it&#39;s always a win for me. They&#39;re more jovial, spend more time with you, make jokes and even give you a little something something extra sometimes if they like you. <br><br>Our bartender was awesome! He made incredible recommendations, wonderfully strong margaritas (I think I had about 3) and kept us laughing all night. I credit him for making an early date with my now girlfriend a wonderful experience (especially when there is so much that can go wrong on those &#39;early&#39; dates).<br><br>For food we ordered guacamole which was amazing and arrived almost at the same time he punched it into the POS. ESG (extra sensory guac!?!?) Then we ordered a crunchy open faced taco piled high with toppings (I believe it was called a torta?) The plan was to share it but it was a hot mess so we ordered a second so we&#39;d each have our own - screw romance we need food!<br><br>I then ordered a combo of 3 different kinds of tacos. I can&#39;t recall which ones I had but my notes tell me the meat was perfectly seasoned, tender and perfectly cooked. <br><br>Overall an amazing dining experience here, and it&#39;s actually about time I went back for another great night. Until next time...<br><br>Eatcrest OUT!",

"reviewcomment":"In a frantic last minute search to land a dinner reservation for Valentine&#39;s Day we were lucky enough to secure a 6:00pm reservation at Brassaii.<br><br>We arrived 15 minutes late but called ahead as a we were stuck in traffic. Parking was a cinch to find as street parking is available starting at 6pm so were able to score a spot right out front. <br><br>We walked down the romantic cobblestone courtyard up to there signature red doors. We were welcomed by a pair of hostesses holding the door open followed by complimentary coat check. Another hostess offered us complimentary glasses of sparkling wine before leading us to our table.<br><br>Since it was Valentine&#39;s Day they had a complimentary candy station and picture booth. We of course took part in the picture booth, dressing up with props and received the free photos at the end of our dinner. I thought that was a great idea, we had tons of fun doing that.<br><br>We were seated a cozy table in the corner dressed fittingly with red table cloths and napkins and candlelight. Our waiter was really friendly and attentive the whole evening. After taking our orders he brought a basket of warm sliced bread and butter.<br><br>For Drinks we went with two glasses of champagne - Moet et Chandon which is always delicious and bubbly.<br><br>For starters we went with the house soup<br>Butternut squash + pumpkin seed brittle + apple + parsnip<br>The soup came in a huge bowl, very creamy and flavourful without being too heavy, and I loved the added crunch from the brittle<br><br>For mains we both went with the striploin<br>16 oz Striploin - grilled + mushroom sauce + shallot + choice of one side<br>The steak came beautifully plated in thick juicy slices. it was a humongous portion looked far more larger 16 oz, more than enough for one person. The steak was cooked perfectly medium-rare, nice tender cut and very flavourful. I also loved the sweet grilled shallots adorning the steak. <br><br>For my side I went with the Brussels Sprouts + Pancetta<br>Again another huge platter which was fitting for two people. The sprouts were lightly caramelized with bits of the diced pancetta giving it a nice porky flavour<br><br>We also go also a side of the House Cut Fries + Parmigiano Reggiano + Aioli<br>Again another huge portion. The fries were ok - very golden brown with a sprinkling of  grated cheese over top, nothing more to it<br><br>As if we weren&#39;t overly stuffed at this point I could not resist having a look at the dessert menu<br><br>Pot Au Creme - Baileys Alunga Milk Chocolate + Dulcey Orange Tart + Coffee Sauce<br>The pot au creme had that distinct bailey&#39;s flavour however I would have liked it to be slightly more chocolatey. The orange tart with coffee sauce was the clear winner on the plate - I was really hesitant that I would not like it all - coffee &amp; orange? - however the flavours really complimented each other, the bright citrus flavour from the creamy tart and the sweet coffee sauce really worked well together.<br><br>Overall I have to say Brassaii really did a great job in creating a romantic and memorable Valentine&#39;s Day.  Food portions were very generous, staff were all very friendly and service was great from start to finish.",

Service is brisk, sometimes frenetically so; the waitresses literally RUN from place to place.<br><br>My experience here actually was a somewhat poor one; as I ordered the raw wasabi octopus, and was promptly rewarded with an excruciating stomachache. It was my fault for ordering so adventurously though, and I suspect that my gastrointestinal distress was due mostly to my Americanised digestion system rather than a true case of food poisoning. Still, I eat pretty much anything without my body complaining - so unless you are blessed with an extraordinarily robust stomach, I&#39;d stay away from that option.<br><br>Otherwise, the bowl of udon that I had was delicious, and the prices are cheap enough that you can try a bunch of menu options without putting too much of a dent in your wallet.<br><br>Be warned that takoyaki is made to order, so it&#39;s a twenty minute wait. The rushed schedule of office lunch hour precluded me from trying it this time, but will do so upon my next visit for sure.",

"reviewcomment":"Let me start by just saying that if you are a fan of onions and spice, you will LOVE this place. They started each table off with a bowl of hot sauce and a bowl of an onion and jalapeno salad.<br><br>You were hit with the sweet taste of chopped onions after each bite into the fish burrito. The burrito was a good size and eating it was like digging my way through a tunnel of deliciousness. The texture of the fish was perfect and by the end of it, I was still craving more. One of the things I notice about the burritos here were that it wasn&#39;t dry at all from the rice.  Each piece of rice was comfortably cushioned in between the guacamole and bean sauces.<br><br>Overall, I would say that this place offers a great experience in Mexican cuisine and would be perfect for a late night meal. The burritos were only $7.50, and they sure filled me up for the entire night!<br><br>For the rest of this review (and pictures), check out my blog at <a href='/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbundoru.wordpress.com%2F&amp;s=810db531478deb3b583f6e319499d24bf45cd36bc19d2f8c52fbbbce2bbed016' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>bundoru.wordpress.com</a>",

"reviewcomment":"This place is a little pricey, expect to spend at least 50$ a person to enjoy the full experience. The place is pretty cozy, with low ceilings I felt like I was at someone&#39;s home enjoying a home cooked meal. The novelty on how they display the food is impressive as well, but you pay for the novelty. A appetizer bowl of soup cost $8, if you want it served in a fresh coconut, it cost $18..   <br>I tried the coconut soup in the regular bowl... I couldn&#39;t justify paying another $10 on top only because it&#39;s served in a coconut that cost $2 in the supermarket. I only had the vegetable one but the variety of vegetable is good enough for me. <br>From the royal menu my friend and I decided to try the avocado prawn. $18, serves 2 It was a petite sized bite size appetizer - 1 pcs of shrimp each with 2 pcs of cucumber with panang curried guacamole on top. A definite must-try ! Too bad it&#39;s so small tho, i wanted more !<br>For entry, I followed fellow yelper&#39;s advice and tried #54 , nothing else on the royal menu had any number on it except for that one...  so dont worry you&#39;ll spot it. It;s their house special red curry with chicken, lychee, and pineapple. The curry was served in a pineapple.. like I said, back to the novelty. I personally didn&#39;t like the lychee.. the red curry soaked up all the sweet flavour, it was really soggy. There&#39;s absolutely no vegetables in the curry like the other Thai places. I would highly recommend the coconut rice!. Just a hint of coconut small enough to notice, but wouldn&#39;t ruin the curry.<br>For dessert I tried the lemongrass creme brulee. I wouldn&#39;t suggest trying it if you&#39;re wodnering. The fact that there&#39;s lemon grass in it sounded exotic but it tasted like a regular non-sweet creme brulee. <br>My overall experience was pretty good. Would I come back? Definitely.  But it&#39;s not going to be my go-to place for thai food.",

"reviewcomment":"I just LOVE Chino Locos! It was recommended to me by a former colleague and it was one of the best pieces of advice I&#39;ve ever received!<br><br>For those who don&#39;t know, Chino Locos offer a compact, yet wholly satisfying menu of take-out Mexican food, with the option of adding Chow Mein noodles to any burrito. Yes, I thought this was strange at first, too - but it actually works, with the noodles adding a completely different texture to the standard burrito recipe. (Overall, though, I still prefer the traditional rice option.)<br><br>The portions are incredibly generous for the price and will keep you full for ages. Ingredients are fresh and prepared right in front of you by knowledgeable and friendly staff, who encourage customisation and deviation from their suggested recipes.<br><br>I&#39;ve recently learned that they&#39;ve opened a new location on Gerrard &amp; Broadview, which saves me the trek all the way to Greenwood whenever I want a fix. Woohoo! I look forward to trying their new spot.<br><br><br>Best burrito I&#39;ve had in Canada, by a long stretch.",

Everything&#39;s plastic.<br>I liked our metal tables and the cool vibe and look of the place.<br><br>They have a bunch of different draft beers including fruili (which I love) and delirium. They also had this awesome mix called &#34;Fruilium&#34;, it was fantastic.<br>I ordered a glass of hair of the dog lager and really liked it. I didn&#39;t see an option for pitchers so I ended up just getting another glass. It was about $6 for 16 oz.<br>Also, part of the proceeds when you buy the hair of the dog lager go to helping animals! So sweet.<br><br>The food can only be described as a flavour journey. In fact, that&#39;s exactly what I said at first bite.<br>I opted for the butter chicken breakfast poutine (which was more like a shredded chicken).  It was kind of watery at the bottom but still very good.<br>I loved the sweet potato fries my boyfriend had, and the spicy mayo had a nice kick.<br><br>Everyone enjoyed their food and our server was amazing.<br>My friend&#39;s breakfast sandwich came out later than the rest of our meals and our server apologized profusely and gave her a free beer.<br><br>They also had thin slices of banana bread with icing sugar on the table. So nice!<br><br>I really like this place. Definitely for a drink and I&#39;m eager to try it again for dinner food on their menu!",

"reviewcomment":"Excellent food, excellent value, customer service a tad off.<br><br>So I Yelped for an Ethiopian restaurant, and I couldn&#39;t help but notice everyone raving about the vegetarian platter at this one, so I figured I&#39;d check it out.<br><br>I was there after 7pm on a Saturday, and the line-up to get seated went from the back of the little restaurant all the way to the front door. I was looking to pick-up the famous veggie platter &#34;to go,&#34; so I passed the line to the cash register. There, I was advised it&#39;d be an hour wait time, so I decided to try this venue another time. I decided to try calling them from the car after I left, and I placed my order having been given a new estimated time of a half an hour. I came back 35 mins later, and was asked to wait another few minutes, which ended up being around another 15 minutes. In the meanwhile, I wasn&#39;t offered to pay or any water or anything like that, but I was invited to have a seat at the bar.<br><br>The food was quite excellent, however remember to bring cash with you as they&#39;re a cash-only joint. The veggie platter (or &#34;veggie dish&#34; as they called it) portion could easily feed at least two people, and it only cost $10 + tax + tip.<br><br>All-in-all, I&#39;d definitely go back here not expecting amazing customer service, which is a fine trade-off for quite reasonably priced huge portions of food. I&#39;ll just remember to order well in advance for take-out, and I&#39;ll have to try to remember to get a pic of both sides of the latest ver of their menu for reference.",

"reviewcomment":"My hubby took me to Ruby last night for my birthday and what a fantastic way to end the day! Overall, the best meal I&#39;ve had this year (which really is a fun thing to say since the year is only 2.5 weeks old). <br><br>Our menu was very eclectic but delicious. The meal was truly thought out to balance the sweetness from the meats with the right acids and palate cleansers.  Highlights included pork belly in a rich apple-butter sauce, parsnips that were smashed and covered with a salsa verde and the main course, slow roasted pork, with a cornbread chorizo and poached cherry stuffing. <br><br>I&#39;m already a big fan of Grey Owl cheese so was thrilled to see it on our menu. It was served with a golden raisin puree, pickled grapes &amp; toasted almonds. Unfortunately, the pickled grapes got lost in the dish but that didn&#39;t detract from the flavours. <br><br>Our dessert was truly out of this world. It was listed as a butterscotch pudding but was so rich and creamy that it was almost like a butterscotch creme.  I can&#39;t fully describe the wonders that this pudding gave to us and it was such a perfect complement with what came before.<br><br>We chose to have the wine pairings with the first three courses and all three were perfectly matched. The highlight is the wine served with the Grey Owl which on its own was a sweet, heavy almost dessert wine but when paired with the Grey Owl opened up and became lighter in body and fully in flavour.<br><br>In the past, when I&#39;ve gone to other celebrity-chef restaurants, the celebrity is nowhere to be found. That&#39;s not the case here. Lyn was in the kitchen, expediting the dishes and making sure they were perfect for each table. The staff all looked to be having a great time which helped make the ambiance that much warmer. <br><br>I highly recommend Ruby Watchco for anyone looking to have a special night out. Even with the volume cranked up (and my hearing being shitty) it was one of the best meals I&#39;ve had in a long time!",

"reviewcomment":"For those of you who don&#39;t know, Marché isn&#39;t really a restaurant but a marketplace as the name suggests.  At Marché, you are immersed into an environment where you can interact with a variety of international street vendors serving up food with the freshest of ingredients.  You create a tab by logging it on your Marché card and you pay for all your consumed items when you leave.  It has always been quite a unique concept.<br><br>But for me, the novelty of Marché has come and gone...for the most part.  It&#39;s no longer a place that comes to mind when I am deciding where to dine out.  Gone are the days that I crave for a Rösti, a Swiss pan-fried potato dish that the chain is known for (at least for me).<br><br>However, when I am in the vicinity of one just out of happenstance, the thought of their mouthwatering Napoleon Square is enough to allure me back.  It&#39;s hard for me to resist such a delicious treat.<br><br>The Napoleon variant at Marché contains a generous amount of velvety smooth custard and strawberry slices sandwiched between two layers of flaky puff pastry.  On top, it is finished with powdered sugar and whipped cream.  I highly recommend it!",

"reviewcomment":"Apparently, I passed by this place a million times and the big sign says &#34;3 brewers&#34;. I know some French, but I never knew this was what it was referred to and was the same place as Les 3 Brasseurs.  <br><br>Ambiance/Feel: Really cool and neat.  It felt really chill without feeling too dive-y and not douche-y either (it&#39;s Friday, my English is broken).  I was also impressed by the newspaper menu&#39;s.  It was unique (yes I&#39;m impressed by little things).  Just the overall vibe seems awesome and I hear it&#39;s 3 floors though I only saw 1. They also brew their own beer .  <br><br>So 4/5.<br><br>Service: Ahh...I hate judging service. I arrived earlier than my friends, being the not-so-fashionably early type and the waiter came around 3-4 times within 10 minutes to see if I wanted something to drink besides my water.  When one of my friends arrived about 10 minutes later, he didn&#39;t come around for about 5 minutes, strangely enough.  But they are busy and the guy was very  nice, so I have to give 3/5.  <br><br>Food/Beverage:  I ordered a shrimp and baby salmon pizza that had onions and veggies on top.  While I liked it, I think calling it a pizza is a bit of a misrepresentation.  It should be called &#34;seafood bruschetta&#34; or something like that.  That&#39;s what it tasted like.  Don&#39;t get me wrong, but I thought a pizza would at least have some melted cheese on it.  I know, it wasn&#39;t listed as one of the ingredients, but sometimes I go dumb and just make assumptions, but still.  For taste and creativity of the food: 4/5.  However, as my friend so &#34;delicately&#34; pointed out to the waiter, the pizza was barely sliced. I could literally pick it up by the corner and pick up the entire pizza with no risk of it coming apart. As for the beverage, ordered a Blonde beer and it went down fairly smooth, sort of like a Heineken or something.  So overall, I would give it 4/5 for food/beverage, but loses 1/2 star for pizza not being cut.  3.5/5<br><br>Final judgement: Cool place to hang out while at the Eaton Centre or Yonge/Dundas square and awesome location. 3.5/5.  Since I&#39;m in a good mood, I&#39;ll round up.",

"reviewcomment":"As an indecisive woman who happened not to be hungry on this busy Friday night, i spent a long time wandering in front of the menu sign written in chalk by the counter trying to figure out what I wanted to eat. <br><br>Alas, when everyone has made the order and i am the only one left by the counter, the dude at the counter said to me, &#34;try the vegan burger.&#34; <br><br>I looked at him incredulously, flabbergasted and, frankly,  a bit appalled: &#34;you are asking me to eat the VEGAN burger at a joint called &#34;Hey MEATball?&#34;  <br>He shrugged, &#34;I&#39;m telling you it&#39;s good...come on, YOLO!!!&#34;<br>&#34;Did you just say YOLO to me???&#34; my asian eyes wider than it has ever been.<br>&#34;YEAH! You only live once, try it!&#34;<br>&#34;Ummm......are you VEGAN?&#34; You can clearly see I&#39;m letting go a little<br>&#34;Naw..and I think it&#39;s really good!&#34;<br><br>And I&#39;m not sure if it was the irony of him suggesting i eat a vegan burger at a place that sells ground up meat, or the fact that he claimed he&#39;s not vegan and liked it, or simply that a dude with weird hair, plaid shirt, and giant black frame glasses thought it appropriate to use the word YOLO to an old crusty asian girl, but somewhere along this journey, he managed to sell it to me. I caved and ordered the $5 vegan burger - why not? I wasn&#39;t hungry, my five friends are all ordering meat dishes, and, well, you only live once, so i&#39;m gonna have to try my first vegan dish.<br><br>He was right, the vegan burger was actually quite good. Quite small, but very tasty. If you&#39;re actually hungry, you will need at least two of them to fill you up. One of my friends had the regular burger and he went to get up to get seconds. The YOLO man told my friend there&#39;s already another guy waiting with the same name, so he asked my friend if he can use the name &#34;Lynn&#34; instead. So when the order came, he loudly called out &#34;LYNN!!!!&#34; a million times. I think he was punishing me for my indecisiveness...<br><br>I couldn&#39;t tell what was in the messy mush I was eating, but it was delicious. I had a bite of the meatball mac n cheese, and the meatball polenta (some type of cornmeal), and they were all good - but i didn&#39;t regret my vegan burger. <br><br>Thanks YOLO dude, at least one Lynn will be back.",

Prices are very similar to other Pho areas except some stuff like their fruit shake at a remarkable price of $5!!! They got some nice combination of meat with rice or vermicelli noodles.<br><br>My friend got their beef noodle soup (famous here).<br>My bro got their vermicelli with some meats.<br>My other friend got the duck bamboo vermicelli.<br>My gf got the vermicelli with spring roll and meat.<br>I got the minced shrimp with crab vermicelli soup.<br><br>Beef Noodle Soup: Soup broth is definitely clear and non MSG, however, the beef is not very tender but tough based on my friends wording.<br><br>My Bro didn&#39;t think too much of his dish.<br><br>My other friend with the duck enjoyed it, but didn&#39;t really finish it.<br><br>My gf enjoyed her dish, but she usually enjoy eating in general.<br><br>My minced shrimp with crab soup vermicelli was good, however, like most other places it taste about the same.<br><br>Overall Conclusion: This place is rated very well in the Ossington Strip; however, I feel that it is good, BUT not the best Pho in Toronto.",

Yes, it took a Groupon to joust me here (which they handled quite well), but eh, I&#39;m finally here now at this recognizable Queen West upscale hangout.<br><br>It&#39;s dark in the back where we sat. But the music isn&#39;t loud and the crowd not anywhere as stuck-up yuppie as I thought. Heck, our friendly server was full of humour and delight, upselling wine (how do you run out of all the beer and wine I want early in dinner service?) and remembering I still don&#39;t have a clue what the soup of the night was. A good time was had by all.<br><br>The aforementioned tomato soup was great and swimming in delectable spices. I also dabbled in their perogies and pan-seared tuna, and it was alrighty. Despite the adopted name and theme, there isn&#39;t a lot of anything Polish or eastern European on the menu. But there are a lot of Queen West themed burgers. <br><br>There is an ATM in the basement. And though Czehoski isn&#39;t an ideal place to take kids to eat, except maybe in the brunch hours, I did see a server put away a high chair. Just sayin&#39;.<br><br>{TTC: the 501er to Palmerston/Tecumseth. Now look up. }",

I was sceptical at first, as a) I was craving a big greasy burger and fries (which this place obviously does not have) and b) I had no idea what arepas were!<br><br>I wasn&#39;t disappointed. I ordered the &#39;curvy queen&#39; arepas with chicken, avocado, coriander and red onion and it was very good indeed. The chicken was flawless, as fresh and well-cooked as you&#39;re ever likely to find. The abundance of avocado in my arepas initially worried me (there was a lot!) but it worked perfectly, helping calm somewhat the powerful tastes of the onions, spicy chicken and coriander. Hot sauce and garlic mayo were offered on the side and the combination of both made my arepas even more delicious.<br><br>Prices were reasonable.

"reviewcomment":"Found smack dab between the Dumpling King and the Dumpling Queen (no relation) we find another Dumpling-offering member of the royal family: The Crown Princess.<br><br>Word of warning: My very intelligent dad, who has been witness to many of the greatest 20th century technological advances in doors, thought that the windows next to the actual entrance were a set of automatically retracting ones. According to legend he stood there for several minutes until he realized the door handle a few metres to his left. He&#39;s only been an official &#34;senior citizen&#34; for a couple months! This is why we let em get into the movies for a buck cheaper, folks.<br><br>Anyway, once you find your way to the door, you&#39;ll be treated to a wonderfully elegant vintage decor (feel free to rearrange that sentence into the opening rap of a song about Dim Sum). The servers all wear old fashioned outfits as well, in the style of (as my girlfriend put it) Nicole Kidman in any of her period-piece movies.<br><br>I&#39;m no Dim Sum expert, but I&#39;d say I&#39;ve been around the block at least once. By comparison, and to be quite honest, I can&#39;t really tell the difference between Crown Princess&#39; offerings, and those of Lai Wah Heen, Casa Imperial, or any of the other &#34;upscale&#34; Dim Sum places in the GTA. From the Ha Gow, to the Curry squid, to the Turnip cake - it&#39;s all delicious. I highly recommend finishing the meal with a salted egg bun. The service is always top-notch, and the food is fast. The prices are in range with other restaurants of the same calibre.<br><br>We tend to go around 11 on the weekend - by the time we leaver, there seems to be a line formed, so I&#39;d recommend getting there around the same time to avoid a wait.<br><br>If you want some more adventure in your life, I also recommend &#34;The Royal Dumpling Crawl&#34; (trademarked, suckers) where you start at the Queen, and eat a plate of dumplings at each royal house from here to Chinatown. The first person to finish all three plates gets to wear a crown that they&#39;ll irrationally buy at the nearest Dollarama.",

The staff is really nice and the prices are pretty average for a burrito in the city now a days. <br>I always get the pulled pork, the meat is always super tender and juicy. My only criticism is that the spice level is lacking. The first time I ordered the spicy it tasted mild to me, so I always ask for extra jalapeños now. While they may not be life changing burritos they&#39;re consistently good and they induce crazy burrito cravings!",

"reviewcomment":"On a terribly cold, windy day of visiting a trade show, my friend and I were starving. We had taken the GO Train in and were looking for something close to Union Station....and there it was, The Loose Moose. <br><br>We (literally) ran in and hoped they could seat us. It was packed! Luckily, their bench style seating allowed us to squeeze in. It&#39;s HUGE and perfectly designed for a fun, pub atmosphere. Hell, even the bathrooms were fun; random antique stall doors, random sinks, even random taps! Not to mention, the beer selection was fantastic! It&#39;s never too cold for beer! <br><br>The menu has a good variety; there is something for everyone. Some of the meals had fun names. You don&#39;t make friends with salad, you say? What if it&#39;s called a Big Bitchin&#39; Green? Definitely sounds better than &#39;salad.&#39;  <br><br>I went with the Avocado, Tomato, Brie and Bacon and my friend went with the Classic Burger. I couldn&#39;t believe how much avocado was on this sandwich; I could barely take a bite! To top off this wonderful creation, it was on a BACON foccacia. It had strips of bacon baked INTO the bread. Amazing. The burger was juicy and the toppings were fresh. The fries were pretty good too. The beer just topped it all off! <br><br>Great location, great service, great food and beer. I would absolutely go back.",

I got the original burger while my friend got one of their fancier ones (the name, I do not remember). Their prices are kinda high so I expected a large burger that would take me two days to finish.<br>I ordered the combo with fries and a can of coke while my friend decided on a combo with onion rings. Like I said before, this place is small so we had to sit at one of the dine-in tables to wait. Note: the tables are super close together so don&#39;t come here and expect an intimate dining experience.<br>Well, we waited around 20 minutes for them to be done and all this time, it was getting really stuffy in there because the kitchen is steps away from the register and dine-in area. At this point, I was getting quite frustrated because I had paid more than I had intended to with the burger and was waiting for longer than I had intended to. <br>Finally, we get our paper bags and happily carry them to eat elsewhere. The burger itself was pretty good but smaller than I anticipated it would be. The bun held up great. The fries were really yummy and my friend actually ate more of my fries than her onion rings. <br>I&#39;ll probably be back, and in a city where a lone burger costs around $10 in so many establishments, Big Smoke Burger is kinda worth it I guess.",

So from experiences at Souvlaki Express and such I assumed Greek cuisine is summed up to souvlaki, gyros and tzatziki. Who knew Greeks are so creative (just kidding. The residents of Olympus had to be eating better than that).<br><br>Ive been to Volos on a few occasions. Now, it&#39;s a fine dining restaurant that uses high quality produce, has great service and is priced accordingly BUT portions are quite big which makes the value worthy. And there are many healthy options for those who are watching their diet (yep, that would be me)<br><br>DO EAT:<br><br>*Healthy and Delicious: <br>Organic Baby Kale Salad, Horiatiki Salad - so fresh and amazing<br>Grilled Calamari (whole not rings), Grilled Moroccan Octopus<br>Giant Sea Scallops, Grilled Mediterranean Sea Bass<br><br>*Simply Delicious:          <br>Saganaki- sheep&#39;s milk salty cheese that they set on Ouzo fire right at ur table (!) goes very well with the bread<br>Sesame crusted feta cheese in orange infused honey (do I need to say more?)<br>Spetzofai - roasted lamb sausage in tomato sauce that is very flavorful<br>Braised lamb shank - just melts in your mouth<br>Black Sesame Wild Pacific Salmon<br>Exohico and Kleftiko were enjoyed much by my friends.<br><br>*A Bite of Heaven:          <br>Ouzo Chocolate Mousse, Flourless Chocolate cake - JUST HAVE THOSE!<br><br>The place has a very nice classy atmosphere, mature clientele and staff, not noisy so you can hold a proper conversation. <br><br>PS: I think I saw Apollo himself (or blame it on delicious Greek wine). All I know is that he&#39;s tall and gorgeous (I think he&#39;s a manager or an owner or something like that)",

"reviewcomment":"I&#39;ve come to the Spaghetti Factory since I was a little kid. Not much if anything has changed; from the decor to the menu. Depending on the time of day and what&#39;s going on in the area the wait times vary. On my most recent visit on a Saturday afternoon around 5:00pm we called in about 15 minutes prior to arriving to ask to be placed on the wait list. Upon arriving we were seated with menus in hand within 5 minutes. I always order the same thing; side salad, lasagne and spumoni ice cream for desert. The lasagne is cooked just how I like it, lots of cheese and meat sauce and a crispy outer layer. It&#39;s really really delicious. <br><br>Sure, this place is touristy but it serves some great food at even greater prices.",

The staff are not overly expressive but they are not rude and are always nearby if you need something. The food is served too quickly, but I believe that can be convenient for some people in a hurry downtown.<br><br>I have always relied on the chicken teriyaki and tempura bento box but I have also had different sushi trays and tried multiple korean dishes like bibim bop and others! Always quite good, and the portions are quite large.<br><br>Plus, when you leave, your bill is always under $20 unless you order alcohol... but even then they have $3 beers!<br><br>Go and Enjoy!",

I started with the Charcuterie, a combo of curried meats that had been done completely in house. The summer sausage of veal was truly heavenly.  I would not have ordered the mushroom and brussels sprout salad if it wasn&#39;t for my friendly and attentive bartender/server. I&#39;m so happy she talked me into it, it was outstanding. <br><br>I had the special, beef duo based on in house processed beef. Well done chef, you are certainly worthy of your accolades.

It&#39;s everywhere all around you and you can&#39;t possibably decide what to eat so what do you do. What I did was looked to where there was a HERD of humanity all gathered around this sea food place.... asked the server what was most popular there (Pickrel and Chips), order up and dig in. <br><br>It was ovbiously very fresh as you could find vendors selling the darn fish fresh about 10 meters away, awesome tartar sauce (if your into that kind of thing) and nice crispy well seasoned french fries which i liberally dosed with malt vinegar.<br><br>Is it just me or does any place that tends to use newspaper as the wrapping around a fish and chips, almost 95% of the time, awesome? Well.... they do it good here, and how can you fail when you have so much product around you.... for reals.... EAT AT THIS PLACE!",

They specialize in rotis, and when they say roti, they mean whichever Indian dish you like, but inside a roti. Kind of like a wrap. I always get the mutter paneer roti, and my non-veg friends get the butter chicken roti, which is also amazing.<br><br>Be careful about the level of spiciness. If you normally ask for things spicy, I&#39;d recommend going for medium-level here. They aren&#39;t kidding around at Mother India. I&#39;ve gone with some Indian friends who asked for Indian-level spicy and their mouths got burnt off.<br><br> I almost always get take out, but I&#39;ve eaten in a few times too.

"reviewcomment":"In the spirit of full disclosure I should admit that I know I have little to add to the acolades about Scaramouche. Great food, great service, great setting.  Tucked away behind Avenue road you feel like you are in a magical place hovering above the troubles of city life.  <br><br>I completely understand why their fiercely loyal clientele protest changes in the menu.  My experience of classics like the fettuccine with steak and the coconut cream pie have made me a loyal fan as well. Alas, I cannot afford to be one of the regulars. <br><br>So this review is really for those of you that might think Scaramouche would be a good place to take a special someone, celebrate that family member accomplishment or impress that out of town visitor.  A definite no, for the special someone, a possible yes for the family member, and a yes for the out-of-towner if you don&#39;t need to talk about anything important. <br><br>I hesitate for the special someone because it is too loud and crowded for any kind of intimacy. It might be better early in the week,  but definitely not toward the weekend. The place was jammed at 7 pm. <br><br>Your family is probably going to be loud anyway (you&#39;re celebrating!), so they&#39;ll fit right in. <br><br>Your out of town guest will be impressed and blown away by the menu, food and service, but she or he isn&#39;t going to want to shout about business so it&#39;s best saved for a sealing-the-deal blowout (you&#39;re celebrating!).<br><br>Reservations definitely needed.

"reviewcomment":"My last and probably best stop on the Winterlicious-see-how-fat-we-can-make-Jacob 2014 tour! <br>To start me and my guest decided to try the wine pairings with our courses and split each dish, so we could each try 6 dishes and glasses of wine. Awesome idea..unless you REALLY want to finish a dish because it&#39;s great! Haha. And with the food at Jump we ran into that conundrum more than once.<br>The appetizers were a pumpkin soup and a dinosaur kale and ricotta salad...which I&#39;m not ashamed to say was ordered purely on the basis of having &#39;dinosaur&#39; in the name, heh. It was tart and delicious with small chunks of fig going nicely with the ricotta and kale. The pumpkin soup was OK, but not really to my taste because of the crab in the soup.<br>For mains, we had goat cheese stuffed Atlantic salmon and braised beef cheeks on bean ragout. I&#39;d like to talk about the salmon, but it was so good that I barely got any by the time my dinner partner was done with it. Haha. The beef cheeks were well done and the white bean ragout they were on was also tasty.<br>For dessert I finally had the chance to have the much talked about (thanks Phillip S. lol) traditional bread and butter pudding. It was a large square chunk of dense raisin bread in an amazing caramel sauce topped with vanilla ice cream. This thing is insane: the sauce is incredibly rich and decadent and it all comes together incredibly well. I&#39;d come back here for this alone. Also, there was a white chocolate panna cotta, but who cares really because: BREAD PUDDING.<br>The wine pairings were great: light white wines with the fish, heavy reds with the beef, and sweet dessert wines with the pudding and panna cotta. Overall, a very satisfying and delicious meal. <br>I&#39;ll make the trip here in the future...if only to have more bread pudding.",

"reviewcomment":"As I entered Splendido, the GM, Jeff greeted me with &#34;you must be Ellen&#34;. After that and for the next 3 1/2 hours, I was made to feel like a welcome friend and not some visitor to a new city. I chose the longer tasting menu, and everything was delicious and creative. Splendido&#39;s sommelier was delightful. <br><br>Bottom line: Splendido would be the restaurant to which I will return when I visit Toronto again. <br><br>I chose the 10 course menu (even though I had promised myself to go with the 5 course menu after a very delicious and filling unplanned lunch at Khao San Road). I was asked whether I had any allergies, to which I said I had no allergies, but requested no sweetbread, rabbit or olives (really hate olives). <br><br>Snacks: cornet (be careful, it leaks on the table from its stand requiring (not by me) a napkin being placed on the table to cover the stain); salmon cracker; oyster; prawn; scallop. <br><br>Smoked oyster, potato and chive (did not get the caviar supplement). <br><br>Green asparagus, pickled egg yolk, oyster espuma and lemon (the most creative egg in shell presentation). <br><br>White asparagus, preserved lemon, morels and creme fraiche. <br><br>Bolero carrots, ginger, coriander seed and pumpkin oil. <br><br>Victor&#39;s foie gras parfait, rhubarb, pistachio and brioche. <br><br>Pickled trout, ramps, cultured cream and fennel. <br><br>Beet dish (not listed on the restaurant&#39;s menu and didn&#39;t take notes). <br><br>Scallop (think it had black olives). Least favorite dish. This was a substitution for the sweetbread dish. <br><br>Rib eye cap (my favorite beef cut), cipollini, porcini mushroom, sweet onion purée and veal jus. <br><br>Perrier Robert cheese. (Adore soft/runny cow&#39;s milk cheese)<br><br>White asparagus and white chocolate mousse, candied lemon, goat cheese and goat yogurt sorbet (only shaped liked asparagus). <br><br>Petit fours. <br><br>I chose a 1/2 bottle of Reichsgraff Von Kesselstatt 2001 Auslese from Mosel that paired beautifully with my meal.",

"reviewcomment":"I have been always wanted to go to an organic raw food restaurant. Moment was right when we celebrated our friends Bacelorette party in Live Organic Food Bar. Our table of 6 was the only table busy at 1 PM. Later few other tables become occupied.<br><br>Nice server came to take our order of drinks and later delivered water for those who didn&#39;t have anything. We got to try our friends smoothies and teas, which tasted fresh, energizing and smooth.<br><br>Menu was short and sweet. Something for big hunger and a small snack. I felt hungry and went for the TRAINERS BOWL. I think I made the best choice, as I had plenty of food, it tasted so good and it lasted for long. It had fresh salad, tempura, tofu, sweet potatoes, chickpeas, beans, quinoa and something which I am probably forgetting. It all came with a nice almond dipping sauce. It was warm and a true comfort food. I was so happy that I made the choice of this $15 bowl. I am used to much cheaper meals, and we always share, but this was totally worthy of the price. I heard that Woody Harrelson is the fan of this place and I imagined him enjoying this :))<br><br>If you are thinking of sunshine wrap, then be aware that this is not half as filling as any of the hot bowls. It is good, but not enough food to kill the hunger. It looks good and tastes again fresh, smooth and energizing.<br><br>Of course a nice meal ends with a nice dessert. We found varieties of different mock Nanaimo bars. Original is my favourite, at Raw we could choose from three different kinds. We had strawberry and mint bars. Mind that the strawberry one is much sweeter and nicer than mint one. I definitely was missing stevia or maple syrup or whatever they are using to sweeten their pastry....but I kept in mind that this was the healthiest bar I have ever eaten :)<br><br>There are not many places where to enjoy raw food in Toronto. After being to Live Organic Food bar, I can definitey recommend this. This is a lovely spot and the food takes care of your body. Peace, love, happiness...and Live Organic Food Bar :)",

"reviewcomment":"This past weekend I had the pleasure of dining at campagnolo, and let me tell you, what a treat it was. <br><br>I was nervous because I tried to get dinner reservations via open table for the restaurant all weekend with no luck. Since we were in the area day drinking, I figured I would stop on by and see if I could get a seat at the bar. Was greeted by a lovely host who immediately sat us outside- and since it was a bit chilly, he offered a blanket! The nicest touch! <br><br>We started out the evening with the Burrata cheese appetizer, which I guess stays on their menu all the time (the restaurant switches most menu items but the Burrata has stood the test of time!)- I can see why. It was the most delicious and creamy cheese I&#39;ve ever had, and it was accompanied by roasted grapes which were divine! <br><br>For my entree, I had the eggplant Parmesan. Not usually a dish I would get because it&#39;s heavy, but decided to share the entree with my significant other. For a guy who never likes eggplant- he loved it! And so did i! The eggplant was lightly breaded, the ricotta cheese wasn&#39;t caked on, and the sauce was delicious! <br><br>Besides the food, the ambiance and staff were spectacular and they have quite a nice wine selection! I&#39;ll definitely be back on my next trek to TDot!",

"reviewcomment":"I came here with my BFF because it was close to his place. It&#39;s all communal seats and bar seats unless you have a larger party. They gave us a choice of places to sit, and we decided on seating in the middle between two randoms and as we walked in, the hostess beat the drum. It looked fun - I wish I was allowed to do it!<br><br>We ordered mostly things that had pictures and said &#39;recommended!&#39; I did some prior research on Yelp and saw that the Shrimp Mayo was popular. Unfortunately for me, my BFF did not want to try the black croquette things because he said it &#34;looked weird&#34;.<br><br>Beef tataki: this was on the &#34;special&#34; menu for $5.90. Pretty good, standard with other beef tatakis. Came with a lot of onion and radish and sauce, could have had more beef.<br><br>Shrimp mayo: definitely see why people recommend this. It&#39;s a crispy shrimp with the tail removed, fried in a tempura-like batter (but not really tempura?) and covered with sauce. Delicious!<br><br>Foie gras: this was weird. It tasted fishy but I thought foie gras was duck? The sauce was pretty much the same as the beef tataki one. Very odd, very weird, and not tasty. I was disappointed with this and would highly recommend avoiding it!<br><br>Tako wasabi: very good! The only thing is, it didn&#39;t come with seaweed to wrap it in. So I guess they expect you to spoon it onto your own spoon and eat it with nothing? I prefer the ones that provide seaweed a lot more. That&#39;s how they usually come where I get it. But based on the tako mix, very good. Needs seaweed!!!!<br><br>Chirashi don: We each got one of these. It was really good. Their sauce made it taste even better. I made the mistake of mixing it - it tasted worse after that. Highly recommend, though!<br><br>Thwat-thwat pork buns: there was not a lot of meat inside and too much sauce. The bun was not soft and there was too much of it. But still ok tasting despite this haha!<br><br>Calpico drink: according to my BFF, it tasted like they poured it directly from a bottle.<br><br>Frozen sake, red, $5.50: This was like an alcoholic frozen / blended ice drink with some flavoured red syrup on top. It was quite strong but once I mixed the syrup in and drank it faster, it started tasting better. There was no aftertaste. Fun little drink, I even ate the grapefruit too.<br><br>Service was pretty average/good, I would say, other than the small order mistake. Also I would have liked it if the servers spoke more Japanese to us, like saying thank you when taking the bill. But that&#39;s no big deal. I also want to mention that I liked the washrooms. Very clean and fancy.<br><br>Bill came to $63 after tax before tips. Very pricey for 2 people and I was not even full after. Went for Chatime bubble tea afterwards to fill up.<br><br>After reading some pretty bad reviews, and for an izakaya, I would say this exceeded my expectations. No, it&#39;s not as good as the izakayas I go to in Vancouver. But I still liked it! I would not go again though because I am getting poor.",

"reviewcomment":"What makes the pizza here so good? It&#39;s made in the Italian way, perfected over centuries as the street food of the poor, the edible equivalent of the opera, also once a poor person&#39;s entertainment. <br>  The base is made by hand in the kitchen, not by machine in a food service warehouse. It takes two days to make the dough so it ferments properly, thereby violating the &#34;money-making first&#34; rule of quick turnover, which has killed all fermenting in the mainstream food industry. <br>     The base is thin, good for people watching waistlines, and baked in a woodfired oven for under two minutes so the fresh ingredients aren&#39;t over-cooked. And the cheese is made-to-order for the restaurant, fresh from Ontario, not bulk cheese bought cheap from the milk pool.   <br>      Alas, pizza came to North America during the 1950s, before countries became protectionist about their food culture, so junkfood operators are able to call their adulterated version pizza. An organization to protect the pizza did not develop until the 1980s, when the trend was too far gone. <br>      I deal with efforts to defend local foods -- the products of local cultures and local places that should be protected from highjacking if the name is to be used -- in my book, The No-Nonsense Guide to World Food.<br>     It&#39;s not just yeast that gives a rise to the pizza dough; it&#39;s an entire culture and a method, now celebrated by the Slow Food movement, born, of all places, in Italy.",

"reviewcomment":"This was the first stop on my Winterlicious food tour this season. I choose this restaurant because I felt like some soul/southern comfort food. This place hit the spot! We made reservations for 3 for 2pm. The gps said the restaurant was about 30 mins from my house so we made arrangements to leave early because we haven&#39;t been to this part of the city before. We were still late and the reason for this is because if your not an expert of the parallel park then that&#39;s going to be an issue. It took me 3 attempts but I managed to squeeze into a spot with the help of my girls. <br><br>Now this restaurant is tiny, a true gem in the wall. Very unique form of design with great service. Our server was friendly and went the extra step to make us feel like our business was appreciated. Their menus are printed on what looks to be an old school vinyl record. Love the concept.<br><br>As being there for Winterlicious, we had a set menu to choose from. I chose the Deep fried pickles as my appetizer. I have to say I was a little, ok maybe a lot disappointed with them. The breading/batter didn&#39;t stay on the pickles. The minute you tried to pick it up with your fork you only got pickles.. for the main mean I ordered their signature sandwich called &#34;The Harlem&#34; it is a 3 layer Sammy of black forest ham, jerk chicken, avocado, mango mayo, jalapeño havarti, served on a ciabatta bun. It was out of this world!! I don&#39;t know how to stress the bust of flavour you get every bite you take. They blend so well that you can&#39;t tell what is what. For desert I enjoyed a outstanding mango cream tart that has inspired me to try and create in the comfort of my own home. <br><br>I would return when I&#39;m in the area to try something a bit different. Maybe their dinner menu.",

"reviewcomment":"came for brunch with friends. The service was very nice. We ordered two hey buttercup (one vegetarian and other with bacon) and a mother and child reunion with $12 add-on foie gras. <br><br>$14( or 16 with bacon) hey buttercup: it was basically a huge salad with 2 poached eggs and a huge baked butter-squash. Overall, this dish was a very light and healthy brunch option and it was very filling. Prob not the best option for people who s looking for a traditional hearty-satisfying brunch. It&#39;s a salad! You know what I meant. <br><br>$13 Mother &amp; child reunion: this is dish is the opposite of hey buttercup. Deep fried duck eggs and house cured duck prosciutto with salad and a piece of bread. The portion of this dish is so small compared to the hey buttercup we ordered. But it tasted good!! <br><br>$12 add on foie gras: It has too be high quality because of the size they served compared to the price. TOO SMALL! It is literally just a size of one bite. Check out my photos and compare with the dried eggs on the side. <br><br>Over all it was a good experience, but I will not order the foie gras again.",

"reviewcomment":"Pho Pasteur, which is turns out has no relation to the American chain I know from Boston, is a high quality Pho restaurant off Dundas.  <br><br>The FOOD:  Now, with Vietnamese pho places, you are not there for fancy tablecloths or flowers on the table or waitstaff that write your order down...you&#39;re there for that Vietnamese breakfast stable (which we always eat at night in N. America), pho.  This place does a mean pho with a nice hearty broth that&#39;s appropriately clear in color but thoroughly rich.  They&#39;ve spent some time making this before serving it out.  It also comes loaded down with a hearty does of meat and noodles.  Much less skimpy than Pho Hung.<br><br>We also had a tasty chicken noodle dish.  These dishes are served in a  pretty basic way...as in Vietnam, if&#39;s your own job to spice the dish up to taste with an assortment of table side hot sauces, sriracha, lime, mint leaves, etc.  Portions are generous at the very least.<br><br>The SERVICE:  We had a friendly, slightly shy, server taking care of us.  She was actually quite sweet and insisted I take a fortune cookie after my meal.  Again, compared to the super-popular Pho Hung, I got the distinct sense that this restaurant appreciated my business.  <br><br>The AMBIANCE:  Well, it&#39;s a simple cheap ethnic restaurant....you&#39;re here for the cheap and tasty food.  In fact, you should be happy the tables and chairs are cheap, because that means they don&#39;t have to skimp on the food to make money.<br><br>OVERALL, this is definitely one of the top three Pho places I&#39;ve been to in Toronto.  I&#39;ll definitely be back.  The price for dinner for two with no drinks ran to $26 with tax and tip...it&#39;s a little high for a pho place, but you&#39;re paying for a higher quality than many of its neighbors.",

"reviewcomment":"I seem to have had a pretty standard experience at O Noir - similar to what others have mentioned. Great concept, good fun, decent food, sadly expensive.<br><br>It&#39;s difficult to emphasise enough just how DARK the dining room is. It&#39;s not the darkness you get when you turn off your bedroom light, or the darkness of a nightclub...it&#39;s total, complete pitch black. I&#39;ve never experienced anything like it, and no - your eyes will not adjust.<br><br>It was very disconcerting being led into the room - quite creepy, in fact! I&#39;d recommend this restaurant for people looking for a good laugh, and it helps if the people at tables around you are also up for some fun and giggles. We were seated next to a hysterical couple who found the whole experience very funny, which in turn made our experience much better, too!<br><br>The food was good, but I definitely would be unhappy paying the same price for the same food in a &#39;normal&#39; restaurant. The peppers served with my (delicious) goats cheese were soggy, and there was a distinctly salty flavour to my (otherwise delicious) steak and accompanying vegetables.<br><br>Our visually-impaired server, Dianna, was hilarious and very efficient. The friendliness of the front-of-house staff however left much to be desired.<br><br>I&#39;d come back, but only if I was showing tourists around, or if it was part of a larger group who had never been before, and were up for a fun start to a big night out.",

We had reservations however, the restaurant was not full so walk-ins would probably be okay.<br><br>The lake views from the restaurant are gorgeous.  The service is quite good and the food came out quickly.  We were there before noon so we ordered our dim sum from the menu, which I usually prefer b/c all the food is hot and fresh when it arrives, vs when it&#39;s been pushed around the entire restaurant before getting to your table.<br><br>We ordered quite a lot of dishes for 6 people and the bill was about $150.00 plus tip. In my opinion that is hefty for dim sum but given the quality and the location, I would come back for a birthday lunch or some other special occasion.  I guess I&#39;m used to the prices in Richmond Hill/Markham for equally good dim sum.<br><br>My favourite dishes were the scallop rice noodle roll (which I&#39;ve seen in HK but not in Toronto) and the bbq pork pastry. Everything else was really good too.  <br><br>I have to say that for a Chinese restaurant, the service was good.  We received a discount on our bill because there was a problem with our food. Usually at Chinese restaurants when this happens, you wouldn&#39;t even get an apology let alone a discount.  It was a nice gesture.",

It is a step up from Nazareth I&#39;d say in terms of food, but just as good as Lalibela (which is my usual go to). If you find yourself near Bloor and Yonge, this place is pretty good, but I&#39;m not making a special trip for this place. <br><br>The vegetarian dinner platter is quite a decent size and two people may have trouble finishing it (we didn&#39;t finish it). But I also discovered that Ethiopian left overs are pretty dammed good!<br><br>I do recommend that people have the coffee (no matter which Ethiopian place you are at). It&#39;s just a lovely way to end the meal, and always great coffee. Especially at this place. <br><br>I&#39;ve been here a few times and always thought it was just a small downstairs space but I just discovered yesterday they have a whole upstairs seating area, that&#39;s also where the washrooms are. <br><br>In the summer they have a small cute patio out front.",

"reviewcomment":"I really liked this place. Te Aro is in a nice little area- recessed from teh rest of the store fronts on the street. I like its charm very much. <br><br>The actual shop was very cozy inside and very minimalistic in terms of decor. It had homey little things hanging from the walls, and that was about it. The staff are okay... seemed to have a bit of that hipster/douchebag swag, but it&#39;s okay haha. <br><br>I had the hot chocolate when I was there... only because I expected great things from what my friends were telling me about this place. In theory, it wasn&#39;t bad. You could tell that they didn&#39;t use some powdered mix for their hot chocolate, but it was a little too &#34;unsweetened&#34; for my liking. I really think taste is all a personal preference, but it was pretty good. It also had that awesome creamy texture that instant/premade/crappy hot chocolates lack. Overall, I was pretty happy with it. Prices can be a little steep, but hey, you get what you pay for. <br><br>I&#39;ll probably come back if I&#39;m ever in the area again. I&#39;m interested in trying some of the food that they had there as well.",

"reviewcomment":"This review goes out to my two #1 fans who have asked me if I was going to review Congee Queen. Considering reviewing congee queen is like reviewing Asian Mcdonalds, I immediately said no. However, after coming home after our big meal and thinking about this, I realized that I need to be a better person and ensure that those who stalk me feel rewarded with an easter egg, I shall now write this one out for JT and RS. <br><br>Did I enjoy eating at the first and original Congee queen? Of course I did. The food was good, but most importantly CQ allowed us to import 15.5 asians into the restaurant and combine two large round tables so we can all steal food for each other  and make jokes across the table at the top of our lungs. At the end of the meal, we even got some free dessert (red bean sago with grass jelly and a touch of milk). <br><br>I should mention though that I prefer the xo sauce turnip cakes here moreso than congee king. It&#39;s much less oily and much more crispy and flavourful. Their stir fried baby bok choy with garlic and their snow pea leaves are also much better. It&#39;s slightly more expensive than CK, but it might just be worth it.<br><br>It&#39;s hard not to enjoy a meal when the restaurant makes room for a large lovable group ;)",

"reviewcomment":"I should start by saying that I lived down the street from the Fish Store for 8 years and due to my general lack of desire to eat fish, didn&#39;t start eating there until my last 3 years... and that was a huge mistake. <br><br>I luckily still work down the street and go to the Fish Store at minimum once a week for lunch. Everyone on here seems to love the sandwich or the burrito, but I assure you the fish meal is the greatest thing of all time. <br><br>The perfectly cooked fish over perfectly cooked brown rice, topped with the amazing sesame fish sauce and a bit of hot sauce is the greatest thing ever. Add to that a slew of different fresh veggies (currently cucumber, broccoli, asparagus, tomato, {avocado +$1.50}  and olives) and you&#39;ve got a fish meal that can&#39;t be found anywhere else. <br><br>For take out, call ahead and by the time you arrive, if it isn&#39;t ready, they&#39;ll push your order to the front (because they appreciate the call ahead order). Also, don&#39;t forget to ask what the special is, because if you aren&#39;t that picky on your type of fish, then it&#39;ll save you a few bucks. In the summer there is space to eat outside, but otherwise it&#39;s really tight to eat inside. <br><br>Also, in the summer get the lemonade... it&#39;s fresh squeezed and delicious. If you fancy a soup, get the butternut squash, it&#39;s unreal and somehow they don&#39;t use cream to make it. <br><br>Eat here, you&#39;ll never regret it. I now eat fish regularly because of this place. <br><br>(Also, note that for one week a year they shut down for family vacation... like fully shut down. This place is the definition of family run and they love what they do, so usually in Jan or Feb they close it down for a week of family vacation)",

"reviewcomment":"After wanting to try Union for some time now, I treated and took a friend here for a late brunch today.  We arrived just after 1 pm and were seated right away.   Wow...why did I wait so long to finally try Union... <br><br>We started off our meal by sharing the Steak Tartare which was served with butter pickles, two mustards, habanero and four servings of toast.  Although just enough to share between two people, next time I may just order this as an app all for myself.  Some people noted it was bland; I ate every bite of the tartare with a tiny hint of the condiments it was served with, and with a bite of toast.  Tasty flavour combinations which all worked well together, even surprisingly with a pickle; definitely got our palates wanting more.  <br><br>We both ordered the BBQ Rib Benny: smoked pulled ribs, poached eggs, hollandaise, greens and rosti. This was now my favourite eggs benny plate...the one to beat...my friend agreed.  Loved every bite of this plate.<br><br>I will definitely come back and also try dinner; sounds like I must try the elk sliders and ribs next.  Thank you for the great service and amazing food today, Union.",

"reviewcomment":"Went here with a group of 5 girlfriends and we had a great meal. We ordered one of almost everything on the menu and shared it all. Everything was AMAZING although I had a particular affinity toward the pork belly. The texture was spectacular and flavor... Well... I actually licked my plate, but just a little, we sat right in the window afterall. Hahha. <br><br>They should really review their staffing though, we were there on a Sunday of a long weekend, all of Ossington was bananas but these guys only staffed one server. Joe was totally slammed and couldn&#39;t keep up as everyone arrived in a big wave and we were all on the same schedule and the place was nearly full. We waited for 45 minutes with empty plates and wine glasses, and then another 15 after requesting our bill. There was also a long wait to order but the food came fast (meaning the kitchen was probably adequately staffed for the rush but not the front of house). Joe was great, super friendly and kept his cool the whole time but really needed some support. Poor guy was making drinks for everyone too! He was really really great, just a bad situation.<br><br>Ossington on the first long weekend of the year and only one FOH staff? Are you kidding me?! Lucky he was such a strong server or we probably would have walked out. That guy deserves a raise.",

It&#39;s right around my favorite area, close to the alma mater Ryerson, Dundas Square and Eaton Centre. And it&#39;s MILES better than the Jack Astors in the building. But, it&#39;s always fairly busy. <br><br>We were a group of 6. Service was a little bit of a bust, slower than usual on a Tuesday night. However, our server had a sense of humor and you could tell she was a people person. Had us charmed, and hence this is not the 3 star review it could&#39;ve been. <br><br>I ordered the following: <br><br>2 Margaritas - the first one was better than the second somehow. I am guessing a bartendar swap. <br><br>Bellini - WORST ever. Way too sweet. <br><br>Rare Prime Rib Steak - Perfectly prepared with the right amount of fat marbling. The sides weren&#39;t as good. Too much potato... and no greens in the veggie side. And a mustard dressing that didn&#39;t taste too good.<br><br>So, I had a reasonably good time. I enjoy Milestones, particularly because they have some great daily specials. I&#39;ll be back. <br><br>PS: the light fixture next to ours was leaking. And the table freaked out.

"reviewcomment":"One of the best burgers I&#39;ve had at a bar in Toronto. Allen&#39;s and Dora Keogh&#39;s next door are both owned by the same family and both pubs are winners in my book. <br><br>You&#39;ll probably want reservations to eat in the dining room here, which is dressed up similar to cookie cutter NYC Irish pubs - blue checkered tablecloth, bar in the front, patio in the back. There are also a few seats out front next to Danforth Music Hall. Casual and busy on the weekends. <br><br>We sat at the bar and enjoyed wonderful pints of Guiness, but also split an amazing burger with Irish/Canadian bacon, melted cheese and Carmelized onions. It was really, really good. Don&#39;t hesitate if you&#39;re on the fence. The chips were large and fried nicely. I doused mine in vinegar and salt. The rest of the menu is kind of upscale - filets, lamb, seafood...but it all looked lovely and judging by the crowds, tastes pretty good too. I like this neighborhood on the east side of the city. Urban but not business-like. Check out Allen&#39;s if you&#39;re out this way and enjoy Guinness and burgers.",

"reviewcomment":"This was my second time going to Luma and both experiences were great.  This visit was during winterlicious 2014.<br>Was initially disappointed that we were seated in the outer lounge area for dinner but was quickly turned around by friendly and professional staff.  Though I quickly made my choices (celery soup/trout/banana pudding), my date opted to have our server pick their menu.  She always does this and always ends up with fantastic meals, I should be less stubborn and do the same.  She ended up with the bean salad, pork and banana pudding as well.  <br>Everything was perfectly cooked and delicious.  They also offered wine and beer pairings for each item, the wine being available in both 3 and 6oz glasses.  <br>Will definitely be back, even if I have to sit in the lounge every time.",

I am a regular customer and never have I once had a bad dish or time there. Whether it is their tofu stew, bulgogi, short ribs or bibambap - it&#39;s always so delicious! <br><br>I really like their fried pork dumplings for an appetizer. But I&#39;m sure any of the apps would still be great. One great thing about this restaurant is that you could tell the servers that you don&#39;t like a dish and the manager will make sure you get something better. Although I assure you that you most likely will enjoy everything if you get if you like authentic Korean food.<br><br>I love the service so much here that I will wait if there are no tables available. The business is owned by a lovely family and the son is really exceptional when it comes to pleasing customers. Although it&#39;s categorized as Korean, I feel like this place is also comfort food. Having a rough day? Go there, feast and have a cold Sapporo. Surely a great fix to any weekday worry.<br><br>Reasonably priced, delicious and always a good experience. Love this place!",

"reviewcomment":"* this review is a bit dated*<br>I came here for Summerlicious 2013. This place is pretty chic and nicely decorated. For some reason, it reminded me of several fancy posh restaurants in Las Vegas - needless to say, the environment is very appealing to the eyes. My Jamaican friend was really digging the décor as well.<br>I guess it comes with the territory that this is an expensive location, Linda Modern&#39;s price tag is generally $1-5 above market rate for similar dish offered at other Asian restaurants. <br>Foodwise, my friend was not impressed at all and didn&#39;t finished her main course. Since I generally enjoy salty food, I had no problem finishing everything in my plate. However, even I found their food a bit too salty and had to wash it down with 3 cups of water. <br>Although we were there for lunch, we ordered their Asianized cocktails to go with our food. It&#39;s definitely a good decision. We loved the presentation - very cute and tropical.<br>Perhaps you should give it a try too - even if you are only there for their drinks =) No one will judge",

After a few visits with no luck I figured Sunday morning 10:30 am was prime time to hit the jackpot! Gold! Cooookies! The sweet aroma of chocolate- my day was made!<br><br>Service: the wait was long, very long! Seemed to be more bodies wandering aimlessly rather than helping kill the line that kept growing as the minutes ticked away.<br><br>Cookies: I saw a whole tray of cookies cooling probably never make it to the display case. Finally got around to being served, let&#39;s just say I grabbed more than I&#39;d like to admit- umm to share of course and the lady behind me cleared the rest of them out. Sold out in minutes. They do bake throughout the day but don&#39;t last- hope that you have luck on your side when you go.<br><br>This is everything a cookie should be- warm, crispy edges, moist, chewy, gooey, chocolatey, buttery without being greasy and the home baked goodness you wish you could whip up but have yet to turn on a oven. Lets talk about size- the bigger the better! Ideally a cookie this size should be shared but you just can&#39;t stop eating it. <br><br>My journey continues as I pack on the pounds...",

"reviewcomment":"Restaurant: Weslodge<br>Cuisine: American<br>Location: King West<br>Address: 480 King St W<br>Price Range: $20~<br><br>Extra information:<br><br>* Open late night<br>* Takes reservations<br>* Good for large group<br><br>I love meat and I love varieties, so what&#39;s better than a cutting board that offers different cuts of meat for you to try? Cutting Board from Weslodge satisfies just that!<br>Starting couple weeks ago, Weslodge started to offer &#39;Cutting Board&#39; which is $29 per person (2 orders minimum) on Sunday and Monday after 5:30PM.<br><br>Cutting Board that is served on a beautiful wood board, consists of Buttermilk fried Crispy hen, dry aged ribeye, Muscovy duck sausage, lamb ribs, sweet pulled pork, cuban slaw, baked mac and cheese and jalepeno biscuits.<br><br>The current version of the Cutting Board will be served for couple months into summer- and when fall comes along, the Chef says they will be changing up the menu and offering something different! Surprise Surprise!<br><br>Scotch Egg for appetizer- with chorizo, tomato jam and black truffle. Scotch egg was cooked perfectly with crispy exterior and the yolk was runny in the middle. This was a nice way to start off the meal.<br><br>Crispy Hen- marinated in bourbon and cayenee pepper cooked sous-vide for couple hours. It was super tender and and buttermilk batter added crispiness to exterior.<br><br>Lamb Ribs- rubbed in coffee bourbon mixture and slow roasted overnight. This was probably my favorite out of all, it was fall-off the bone tender and the glaze melted in my mouth<br><br>Duck Sausage- interpretation of German wurst sausage, it was moist and reminded me of traditional breakfast sausage.<br><br>Dry Aged Ribeye- Dry aged for minimum 38 days and oh man, was it so tender! I could eat a whole plate of it cooked nicely to medium rare.<br><br>Pulled Pork- Marinated overnight in soy, white vinegar, bay leaf and sweet lime soda. <br><br>For the sides, cuban slaw was nice and light with white wine vinegar with carrots and apple adding crunchy texture.<br><br>Jalapeno Biscuits were nice added carbs to the platter although unnecessary with so much meat. <br><br>Herb Spatzel with wild mushroom and lamb bacon <br><br>Charred Brusels Sprouts with house bacon was a delicious vegetable dish that was served on the side<br><br>Instant Cake with chocolate mousse, olive oil pudding and raspberry. I honestly thought I wouldn&#39;t have any room left for dessert but I did. I can&#39;t say no to chocolate mousse and the light raspberry was a perfect way to end the meal.<br><br>Summary: Overall I really enjoyed the Cutting Board from Weslodge. For $29 per person, you get to try different types of meat and sides and I think it&#39;s very much worth it. The only downside is that it&#39;s only offered on Sunday and Monday night. They take reservation so make sure to secure a spot before you head over!",

"reviewcomment":"My boyfriend was DYING for a cold beer and the LCBO couldn&#39;t deliver (Saturday afternoon... everything was warm).<br>We walked by this place (it&#39;s right beside the LCBO).  He needed a drink, I needed a restroom.<br>It was packed so we thought it must be good.<br>It&#39;s cash only as others have said. There is an ATM upstairs where the washrooms are (the posters up there made me laugh ahaha).<br>We ordered the &#34;grand electric&#34; and one of the other beers they had on tap.<br>Both were delicious.<br>Once we were inside I figured we might as well try the food. We did just have sandwiches... but how could we Yelp it if we didn&#39;t try anything to eat!<br>Vlad and I got the beef brisket sandwich. Mmmm it was so good. It had chipotle mayo (big fans of that) and crispy onions. It was covered with barbeque sauce.<br>The sandwich was so juicy it was running down my hand lol.<br>It was about $6.<br>Sides are not included. You can get baked beans, collard greens, and a few other things for $3.50 each.<br>There are no fries though (that we saw).<br>This place is busy. It definitely reminded me of the restaurants you&#39;d see on Diners, Drive ins, and Dives.<br>I loved watching the chefs prepare everything.<br>Also, although it was a scalding hot day, I didn&#39;t find it too hot inside, just perfectly comfortable.<br>I would recommend popping by this pleasant little place if you&#39;re in the area.",

Lovely warm, cozy, atmosphere and the staff were helpful and checked in with us just often enough to feel welcome, even on a busy Mother&#39;s Day Sunday. The fried eggplant mezze was so simple yet earthy. The garlic tomato mezze was the only off note, and even then still decent. <br><br>All on all a wonderful experience.",

"reviewcomment":"So I ordered chicken souvlaki on a pita with a side of greek salad. The most obvious choice on the Danforth right?  Well, I didn&#39;t expect much, and I was blown away.  The chicken was white meat only and it was super, super, super moist.  So good.  The tzatziki was so rich, and so creamy it made the pita that much better. <br><br>We also ordered the eggplant dip as a starter and it was very creamy, very rich in flavour and I wished I could order it to go in a tub.  Only downside was that for a small portion is was kinda pricy at $8 or so.  <br><br>Desserts were a pass for me-ordered the lemon curd dessert and it just wasn&#39;t that good.  It had random lumps in it and I didn&#39;t finish it.  We also tested the chocolate baklava and the chocolate cake.  Baklava was uber nutty, and uber sweet-so if that&#39;s your thing, do try it.  Chocolate cake was good but just like any other chocolate cake.  <br><br>If I were on the Danforth again I would absolutely visit Mezes again.  This time I&#39;d probably be more adventurous and try the fish or kalamari, I&#39;d skip dessert and go for fro-yo instead.",

I had a burger that was tasty, but could&#39;ve had more meat. All of the toppings were fresh.<br>2. The sides are pretty standard. I had a salad instead of fries, and it was surprisingly green and fresh, as well as better than I expected it to be.<br>3. There are plenty of TVs playing all major sporting events.<br>4. They have plenty of indoor and patio seating. At peak times you will wait! There is ample seating here for larger parties.<br>5. They have a sufficient selection of beers on draught.<br>6. The service here is a bit better than average, but might be less so on a terribly busy night.<br><br>A meal here before or after a Jays game will cost the same as a meal inside the park, yet with better food.",

The pad Thai was not bad but my colleague said that the pad Thai in Canada is always a bit salty.<br><br>We got very delicious complimentary spring rolls as a compensation for a 30 mins wait for our lunch.  Well, this thing happens.  The kitchen possibly screwed up our orders.  The server came to apologize and handled the incident very friendly.  The food there definitely worth the wait but hopefully not 30    something minutes again as promised by the server lol.<br><br>I will go back for lunch or dinner when I am craving for Thai food again for sure:)",

"reviewcomment":"Is the food at Table 17 excellent? Yes.<br><br>Is that enough for me to give it five stars? No.<br><br>I&#39;ve been twice, once for dinner and once for brunch. On both occasions my meals were delicious, fresh and expertly prepared and presented. Wine and coffee top notch also! Yet, I still left hungry, and somewhat frustrated.<br><br>Why? The portion sizes at Table 17 are just too small, even for the average appetite. Add in frankly exorbitant costs, and it becomes clear that this place just ... well, just could be so much better. My French toast for brunch was served with about five berries -not even a salad - and must have amounted to about three slices of bread in total. $10 before tax.<br><br>The dinner menu was infuriating in its unnecessary pretentiousness. It took me about five readings of the menu to actually understand what was on offer. Less of the fancy culinary jargon and arbitrary French/Italian synonyms for basic food items, please. My chicken mushroom tagliatelle was flawless as it was - was there really any need to describe it as &#34;Hen of the woods (is that the new word for chicken?!) hedgehog mushrooms, with tarragon beurre fondue&#34;?! <br><br>Again I must reiterate the pricing. Two mains, one shared side and a glass of wine came to $70. <br><br>Thankfully, the friendly service and general lively ambiance is spared the unnecessary pretensions of the menu. And if the food continues to be mouth-wateringly delicious (and trust me, it is), then I can&#39;t see why I wouldn&#39;t return to Table 17, for a special occasion. <br><br>This restaurant could be a true five-star establishment, if only it had bigger portions and a more down-to-earth, straightforward menu, that would allow the world-class food to speak for itself.",

"reviewcomment":"Omg do I adore this little bar, so adorable. Mini patio at the back. In fact, they opened two bars for the event I was at. The second bar was in a different room actually. BTW: I didn&#39;t come here for a Yelp event!! It was an entirely different event.<br><br>So our event was 6 to 9pm ish. The open bar closed at 9:30.... but they continued the night with some jazz music and served regular customers. Kudos!!<br><br>They have some pretty neat drinks. Sorry if &#34;neat&#34; is a nerdy word.<br><br>- mango margarita (with a piece of mango!)<br>- blood orange juice + vodka (SO amazing) or tequila (not as amazing)<br>- blood orange margarita? <br><br>I enjoyed lots of my drinks but honestly I am going to apologize as I do not remember the REAL name of any of these drinks. However they have many different kinds of tequila, and YES you can do tequila tasters: 7 different tequila shots. That&#39;s what you can do :) I had two of those... they tasted like tequila.... but it was fun. The chaser for tequila is a spicy tomato juice of some very amazing sort.<br><br>My coworker had some spicy cocktail, something with &#34;Red&#34; in the name. Spicy, hot, but really really nice. <br><br>I also had the crab cakes here -spicy! Very soft and tender crabmeat as well, it was good.<br><br>I&#39;d love to come back sometime -NOT due to an event! I very much enjoyed the location, the really friendly/casual bar, lots of summer drinks, cute patio, JAZZ @ NIGHT?... also I was carded!! Why was I carded at AN EVENT I WAS INVITED TO!!?",

It&#39;s very small, with enough kitchen bar seating for 3-4 folks crammed in.<br><br>Karl the owner will gladly provide you with his finest schnitzel sandwiches, all under $10. And for $10, holy crapo these things are indeed huge! The slattering of savoury sauerkraut and other tasty stuff in a small bun... there is no way you can keep it all together before you even open your mouth and say ahh. Even half of a schnitzel is practically a full deli sandwich or a pretentious gourmet burger. Better make room in your tummy, lest you get schnitz-faced.<br><br>Too bad they only open until 7pm.

Victoria St <br>2. Front St.<br>3. College St.<br><br>Victoria and College St. locations are 24 hours.<br><br>The best part of Fran&#39;s is consistency.  Until they changed their Corn Beef Hash, I always knew what to expect when coming to Fran&#39;s.  The crisp home fries, the slightly stale piece of fruit and Sriracha sauce are always there when you want them.   I usually default to the eggs benedict (traditional with ham, or sometimes with Chicken).  I&#39;ve also tried the breakfast steak and vegetarian omelette.  None of the dishes are mind-blowing but they&#39;re tasty and just what you would expect.  If you&#39;ve tasted a Benny or omelette before, this won&#39;t really be much different.  The steak was hit or miss.  At the Victoria st. location, it was always cooked medium well, but at the Front st. location it kept on arriving rare (so I just eventually ate it rare).<br><br>Service is good and coffee is always refilled promptly and without even asking.  Sometimes the food might be a tad slow but it has never been a terribly long wait.<br><br>The only weird thing at this location is that you have to go into what seems like another venue to use the washrooms.  You&#39;re going to feel like you shouldn&#39;t be there but just keep on going and avoid eye contact with anyone on the other side of the doors.",

I think on a regular day it might have tasted a bit on the salty side but after biking around sweatily the whole day and with the cold night approaching, my body needed this. <br><br>The ramen itself seemed slightly undercooked but was hopping the line of undercooked and cooked. Still very tasty nonetheless. The broth was very good. Savoury, Salty and warm to the right amount that I was craving. <br><br>Service was quick and efficient.<br><br>The interior decoration was really fun to look at and even though it did not give the off the vibe you&#39;d want for a cold night with warm food it was certainly an atmosphere which lifts your tired spirit.<br><br>Spacing is a little tight but they weren&#39;t full so it was nothing to worry about.<br><br>Prices seem pretty fair.<br><br>Overall a great place to eat.

As a result, I don&#39;t come here nearly as often as I would otherwise.",

Came in here after the lunch rush on a Tuesday, was greeted at the door by the gentleman at the register (who later told me he was the grandson of Dan), and directed to grab a menu, pick a seat, and order at the register when ready.  He was friendly but not in that flamboyant, annoying, Jack Astors kind of way, which was refreshing.  I get tired of overly chipper staff at times and this was a breath of fresh air.  If you prefer over-animated clowns serving your food and interrupting you every 5 seconds, go elsewhere.  If you just want good food, at good prices, from decent people that let you be (but are there if you need something), come here.<br><br>Ordered the Big Kevorkian burger and dammmmn for $6.99 this is a great deal, and an awesome burger.  It&#39;s not as fru-fru like the expensive joints like Burger&#39;s Priest but it beats them in both greasiness and flavour.  Onions, mushrooms, bacon, garlic dressing, mayo, fried pickle - let&#39;s face it - you&#39;re not eating burgers as a health food, so a bit of greasy meat isn&#39;t a bad thing here and the whole thing came together into a perfect afternoon-coma-inducing caloric feast.<br><br>Decor was car seats which was different and interesting.  It works &amp; it&#39;s comfortable, and definitely a novelty (these are real car seats, not those fake things like in Vaughan Mills&#39; food court) - again don&#39;t come in here expecting fine dining.  But it was just plain old fricking good - I&#39;ll be back next time I&#39;m in the area 100%.",

Probably ate 3 burritos/quesadillas a shift and somehow I was in the best shape I&#39;ve ever been in that summer (correlation or causation, does this mean its healthy??) Bean and cheese is unreal. Great refried beans and rice.<br><br>Crunch from the grill and fresh veggies. Delicious sauces. Well marinated and cooked cambrae meats. The mexican rice is so delicious it should be tried separately. Pretty much any combination/proportion of those delicious fresh ingredients is amazing.<br><br>I miss it.<br><br>Now BBoyz and BBanditos have split the original chain, BBoys got the iconic name and Banditos got the signature creamy, chili, lime sauce.",

Food is always great and I always have a great time when I&#39;m there. Gf loves the martinis and has tried almost all of them on the list - and she swears they are some of the best...<br><br>Not 5 stars because it can get crowded fast (small place) and at times it doesn&#39;t feel that intimate with people chatting right next to you... menu is not that big and prices are not that low... unless you do their specials.",

"reviewcomment":"Buttermilk Fried Half Chicken was da bomb dot com! Choice of one side. Was going to get the fries but opted for the cider slaw. It was nice and purple but I realize I&#39;m not a coleslaw person after all. The chicken was ah-mazing... the skin was crispy and herbed well. The chicken was white and well cooked. Not dry at all. Oh man, I could eat it all over again. Interestingly, it wasn&#39;t greasy like KFC. It was neat and clean. Also came with garlic biscuits which weren&#39;t bad either, but I was so full I couldn&#39;t finish it. We also ordered beer by Lake of Bays Brewing Company (Spark House Red Ale and Rock Cut Baysville Lager). Perfect combination.<br><br>Service was delightful.

Thank you Beast for changing my opinion on what type of meat is classified as suitable for brunch!<br><br>A gnocchi poutine topped with real curds and boar was the perfect appetizer, as were the dirty rice balls. Not sure what made them so dirty, but I guess I am no expert on dirty balls. :) Both were hefty portions and the two dishes were enough for me, along with my Labatt 50 and pickleback. Who knew pickle juice would calm the burn of whiskey?<br><br>I also tried the Beastwich and it was definitely beasty. Giant, open-face fried chicken on a biscuit, smothered in a sausage gravy and fried egg. Well worth the eating if you are hungry! <br><br>I would recommend coming early as a few of the brunch items were sold out by the time 1:30 rolled around.

I have decided to contribute to this community by writing my first review for this awesome joint.<br><br>It doesn&#39;t let me give it 4.5 stars, so I will give it a 4! Come on now, no restaurant is a perfect 5.<br><br>I have to say that it&#39;s one of my favourite places to have fish tacos in the GTA. I have been here several times and not once has it disappointed me. The fish, tortilla, salsa verde, pico de gallo and whatever other ingredients they put in there makes me want to go back for more. I have been to Grand Electric, La Carnita, and other restaurants who also serve fish tacos but are not known for them (ie. Joeys), and I still think this place is the best. <br><br>When I went, they only had fish tacos after a certain time in the afternoon and all days on weekends. Make sure to call before you head over. You go up to the counter to order and they&#39;ll bring over the food when it&#39;s ready. The portion is just right for me, but if you have a huge appetite, I cannot say you would feel the same. If you aren&#39;t a fan of fish tacos, they also have a list of fish &amp; chips which others have raved about. I have not tried them, so I cannot comment. Price wise, I think they&#39;re average compared to other places that also sell fish tacos.<br><br>The place isn&#39;t very big, so it may be more difficult to find a place to sit during meal time. They have couple chairs against the front window and you can people watch as you eat!  <br><br>This location is also very convenient, as it is along king st. streetcar. <br>I cannot wait to go back!",

"reviewcomment":"Well, what can I say...I&#39;ve been here a couple of times and have yet to be disappointed. On my most recent adventure, I took a few newbies to this joint and they both had a great experience as well.<br><br>Yes, the wait times for brunch can be long but it is well worth it. You enter, sign up on the clipboard and eventually an employee calls you in so you can choose possibly one of the best brunches ever.<br><br>Seating space is limited inside and maximized (prepare to squeeze into a table) but that&#39;s what adds to the charm of this cute hipster-y place. It&#39;s warm and cozy while still having a great energy that only an independent restaurant could offer. It feels like you&#39;re visiting a second home. Blissful.<br><br>Although I was planning on ordering something different the second time around, I simply couldn&#39;t resist ordering the Angela sandwich once again. My mouth was watering just thinking about it at the table.  A perfect sandwich combination of avocado, bacon, arugula and tomato chutney with a side of greens and roasted potatoes. You simply can&#39;t go wrong. And the portions are hefty! Come on an empty stomach and prepare to be filled up. Plus they offer reasonable prices!<br><br>My friends ordered the brie and pear sandwich and one of the egg dishes which were both enjoyed. Next to our table, a massive plate of waffles was served and I decided from there on in that I would order them the next time around. They looked delectable! <br><br>If you&#39;re not a fan of waiting out in the cold on a weekend then wait until the spring/summer to come here. In the meantime...prepare your tastebuds.",

"reviewcomment":"Went with my afternoon tea buddy, ST. We made a reservation for a Sunday afternoon at 3.30pm. She tried to phone but nobody picked up. Luckily they answered my email!<br><br>It was busy when we go there but we were seated pretty quickly. I love the room which is full of windows and really nicely decorated. It has a clean, modern look and loved the chandeliers!<br><br>Service was a bit inattentive and they were very slow to serve us. This may have been due to it being very busy that afternoon, and they were pleasant when they did come to our table-but it did detract from the experience.<br><br>The afternoon tea itself was really impressive, however! The tea was good and they topped up the pot with hot water frequently. It&#39;s not just boring sandwiches either-we had spring rolls with dipping sauce, cheese and pear tartlets, mushroom strudel and shrimp crostini. All were really good. Scones were served with jam, fruit curd and whipped cream and were light and fluffy. Pastries were macarons, lemon and chocolate tarts and a black sesame cake. The cake was my least favourite-but I think that&#39;s because of my unsophisticated tastes! They also had no problem packing up some of the remainders to take home.<br><br>We left full and very happy. The time just flew! We&#39;re planning on going back after spending much of our time staring at the group next to us who had the most delicious looking mountain of meat. We think it was the bouef bourgignon. It&#39;s on our to-do list. For Yelp, of course.",

My boyfriend and i shared the remix, a great way to start the meal. We then shared the Halifax Donairs and Potato Fondue &amp; Smoked Sausage. Both dishes were unique and delicious, something that i had never tried before. For dessert, i had a crispy toffee bar. It&#39;s good, but not worth $8.

"reviewcomment":"So many mixed reviews here. <br><br>I came in with three friends on a cold winters day for poutine week #lapoutineweek. After spending a year in rural Quebec and only eating poutine in greasy spoons, I&#39;m a purist. I almost never stray away fries, gravy (&#34;sauce&#34; in Quebec) and squeaky cheese (cheese curds). In this circumstance our server, Matt highly recommended the Mighty Loutine, pulled pork poutine. I went for it.<br><br>Two of us had the small pulled pork poutines, one a small chili-cheese poutine (for veggies) and other is lacto, so she went for a pulled pork sandwich and fries. First, fries were awesome. Fries are the base of any poutine. Cheese curds are fundamental to any poutine. Anyone that throws in any random cheese to poutine, is not poutine. A real poutine means squeaky cheese. The gravy was good, but the primary takeaway from this meal was the yummy pulled pork, stringy, and season perfectly. Poutines were $7.90. so you can&#39;t really go wrong. For two bucks more you can go for a large poutine which is enormous. Hello, gluttony!<br><br>I&#39;m also going to mention the service, because it was remarkable. I can&#39;t remember the last time I&#39;ve had such a great customer service anywhere. Matt was super friendly, attentive, and must have brought over a dozen re-fills before we could even ask. I&#39;m definitely coming back here for afterwork drinks.",

"reviewcomment":"I gave up my gym day to come here. Not to Grapefruit Moon specifically, but just to a patio. Since my fiancé and a friend were going to be in the area, I let them find a place. My requirement was simple; patio obviously and drinks. Food wasn&#39;t so important and Grapefruit Moon fit the bill.<br><br>We got the last table and I sat in the spot directly facing the sun (whoop!). Beer menus are written on a small whiteboard and my first choice was the Steam Whistle Pilsner, and then I had a Flying Monkey. Cold Beer + Hot Day = Beer belly (but happiness!)<br><br>This is mainly a brunch place, so the menu is quite limited. They had some Corn Fritters which were sold out so I am guessing they are very yummy. I opted for their egg special dish which came with Bononcini Cheese (I was expecting bigger rounds, but all I got were small pea-shaped things...) Hit the spot, but nothing special.<br><br>The rest of the table had a burger with fried bacon and egg (filling) and a breakfast special that came with the usual sausages, egg, home fries. It must have been our way of staying longer at the table because we decided to order French Toast as our dessert. Again, hit the spot, but nothing special.<br><br>So yes, come here for their patio and drinks. It&#39;s a lovely local spot that is hidden and takes advantage of full sunshine. I wouldn&#39;t come here any other time as the interior of the building (dark, dark) and the food is nothing special.",

(Which is SUPER convenient)  <br><br>We got there right at 4pm (actually got there at 3:45 and they were still locked so we hung out in an office building connected to it that had a really nice lobby) and were seated right away by the window. <br>Everything came out very quickly and was all cooked very well! Patti&#39;s prime rib cut was HUGE and i filled up on crab cakes, steak and shrimp. Shrimp brings melted butter that you can use on your potatoes ;)<br><br>No apple crumble though on the newer menus?

"reviewcomment":"This place was wonderful. I came here on valentines day and surprisingly it wasn&#39;t over crowded.<br>This is definitely one of the high end sushi restaurants in Toronto along with Sushi Kaji which I still have to try.<br><br>The decor is modern but holds the essence of Japan. Service was great and attentive. The place was kind of small and a little cramped but they coat check helped. The atmosphere was lively and did feel some what authentic Japanese. It took me a few minutes to find the washroom though because it was flush with the wall and push door. But the washroom was nice, it was one of those with nice paper towels and mouthwash on the side for you to use<br><br>All the food I had was great. I have no complains about any of the food I ate that night. Miso soup was light and not overly salty but had a lot of flavour because of the lobster. We shared two appetizers Lobster Carpaccio looked wonderful with exuberant colours and the lobster tasted great with the combination of flavours. The other appetizer was the Kamo Nanban Soba which is pretty much duck with crunchy noodles and this was just as good as the lobster with great overlapping flavours and texture. Duck was cooked perfectly.<br>The main we had the $50 sashimi platter but I added the lobster that was an extra $30 but in hind site unnecessary because we had lobster in the appetizer. But nonetheless I was not disappointed. The platter came with an assortment of seafood that was super fresh and some that you wouldn&#39;t get at regular sushi restaurants like sea urchin. <br><br>Overall experience was great. Definitely would recommend for someone who is seeking to find the best sushi in Toronto. But it is pricy but you&#39;re paying for what you&#39;re getting and it&#39;s definitely worth it.",

"reviewcomment":"As a fan of live music and patios, I can&#39;t believe that I have not been to the Rivoli in the 15 years I&#39;ve lived in Toronto.<br><br>I&#39;m not sure what&#39;s kept me away... perhaps the fact that the patio is almost always full and you get the feeling that those who are there are guarding the seats with their life. Or maybe I have been here, and I just don&#39;t remember.<br><br>At any rate, today, a good friend of mine called me up and asked if I wanted to join her and her wonderful little daughter for lunch. It was the first patio Saturday of the year and I knew that I could get to the Rivoli early and snag a spot of this perfect-for-people-watching -patio.<br><br>The menu is a mishmash of cultures, which I&#39;m generally not a fan of, but for some reason, it seems to work here and I was surprised to see many things that I&#39;d like to try. I got a table right in the corner and ordered a Caesar. <br><br>GREAT Caesars here! Our amazing server asked me &#39;how do you like it?&#39;, which I thought was really nice, since I do happen to have a spice tolerance equal to that of a dragon. She returned promptly with a delicious looking drink, brimming with horseradish, sambal oelek, and crowned with three green olives and a spicy yellow pepper skewered on a cocktail sword. A GREAT Caesar!<br><br>My friend had the fish tacos, which she enjoyed and which her daughter deemed &#39;picy&#39;, which in year and a half year old language means &#39;spicy&#39;. I had the Pad Thai. Normally a no no for me to order ethnic food when not at the corresponding ethnic establishment of said food. But I was quite surprised! The noodles were well cooked and tossed in a &#39;picy but slightly sweet sauce that did not appear to include ketchup. It could have used a little more fish sauce and lime for me, but I&#39;ve had worse Pad Thai at actual Thai restaurants. The shrimp were fresh and plump and there were nice charred pieces of green onion topped with lots of crunchy peanuts and bean sprouts.<br><br>Our server was even so nice as to offer to bring some plain rice for my friend&#39;s daughter. We asked if we could have tortilla chips instead and she was happy to oblige. Luisa loved the chips and I&#39;m sure the dog on the other side of the patio was happy to have a kid dropping lots of food for them to mow down on later.<br><br>I would definitely come back to the Rivoli. The people watching is fantastic, and although this strip of queen street has become more touristy than trendy, that&#39;s completely ok with me. There&#39;s an open feeling here compared to west of Spadina where there is zero room on the street and at the Rivoli, it&#39;s actually really funny to watch the tourist families gape at people who have pink hair.<br><br>A solid establishment.",

"reviewcomment":"I loved this place! To be honest, I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll ever eat here as cheaply as I did today, but I&#39;d gladly give five stars for my experience here today. During the Olympics, they have a tomato soup and grilled cheese sandwich special for just $5! It was a no-brainer -- we ordered one each pretty much as soon as we sat down. The tomato soup is really creamy without being overly salty or heavy. I think this is my first tomato soup made with real tomatoes. The grilled cheese wasn&#39;t too greasy but not dry either. I really liked the cheese that they used, though I don&#39;t know the name of it. Great buttery bread too. We also got the half serving of their fried potato slices (they call it something else on their menu, don&#39;t remember the exact name) and it was certainly a large enough serving for two people! Because the potatoes are cut so thin, they cool off extremely fast. Next time I would ask for the potatoes to be served after finishing the main course so I can eat them with undivided attention while they&#39;re nice and warm!<br><br>The seating area is very small and thus very cozy. I could hear the folks sitting next to us&#39; entire conversation! The decor is very home-y, lots of wood everywhere. My friend said it was like &#34;going over to someone&#39;s house to eat&#34;. They do have two small TVs where they were showing the Olympics. Noise level is relatively quiet, except when Canada scored in overtime :)",

"reviewcomment":"After wandering around the city for about two hours, my friend and I were trying to decide on a restaurant for dinner. We decided on a place but they didn&#39;t have any tables available and I wasn&#39;t interested in waiting. We had walked by Kit Kat and decided to head the two doors over and have dinner there.<br><br>We were promptly welcome and seated right next to the bar and our coats were taken and hung up near the end of the bar. The menu here isn&#39;t huge but there are a lot of good, classic Italian choices. We decided to start with some garlic bread and I went for the veal picatta on the server&#39;s recommendation. My friend go the sausage pasta, which we were told is the best selling dish at the restaurant.<br><br>The garlic bread was good - simple, classic bread with cheese and lots of garlic. Our food came out quickly and MAN was it ever good. Veal picatta can be tricky - its very easy to overcook veal but this was done to perfection. Melted in my mouth. There were some delicious grilled veggies on my plate and potatoes underneath the veal as well. I could have licked the plate clean.<br><br>My friend&#39;s sausage pasta was great, the sheer amount of sausage that was in his dish was mindboggling. We were told that the owner&#39;s brother makes the sausage and you could tell. Fantastic sausage and nice spicy sauce to go on top.<br><br>We opted for dessert and I just HAD to have the tirimisu. Blown away. A lovely dessert, fresh lady fingers soaked in some kind of liqueur, whipped cream, chocolate... again, could have licked the plate clean.<br><br>The service here was very friendly, I felt like it was the kind of place where they&#39;d remember you if you came back again. I wouldn&#39;t hesitate to come back to this restaurant and try some other dishes. Absolutely delicious!",

I did an early Friday dinner and ordered the burger and the Ronald Clayton. The burger was excellent: meat was fabulously tender, and cheddar + aioli = rich + tangy. The slaw was a little less flavorless but nicely cut...but the homemade aioli and ketchup? Best I&#39;ve ever had. <br><br>Service was super friendly -- in fact, they gave me a list of recs for other places to try. Even if the burger wasn&#39;t already awesome, I&#39;d definitely come back because the staff really did a great job of making the experience there so comfortable. You go, Harbord Room!",

On my second visit, I tried the beef okonomiyaki and had a sample of the pork and the chicken from friends and they tasted superb. My friend advised to me before my order that the seafood may cause the okonomiyaki to be slightly watery, which could affect the texture. I usually see a lot of people opt for take-out. I ate a bit of the burger steak and it was yummy too.<br>Note: You won&#39;t be creating your own okonomiyaki.<br><br>Service &amp; Atmosphere: If you go during the day time, the lighting is nice. When nightfalls, the red lanterns cause the entire place to look really red. Service is great!<br><br>Pricing: Very fair and worth it!",

"reviewcomment":"I have been here many times! I prefer the dinner all you can eat sushi because of one and only thing, SASHIMI! It&#39;s $19 for dinner and for all you can eat sushi and sashimi it is well worth it! They have a good selection of the popular sushis such as red and green dragon and my personal favourite the shrimp tempura sushi!<br><br>Their lunch menu however is a little weaker, makes sense since lunch costs less as well, around $13. The good thing is even during lunch hours you can ask for the dinner menu, which in my opinion will be the best $6 upgrade. Specially if you compare it to Spring Sushi by the Dundas square whose lunch ayce menu does not include sashimi and is $16.50.",

"reviewcomment":"a few quick notes off my longer review:<br>&#34;A simple yet significant detail: bread. For a restaurant considered to be in a $$$$ category, having stale bread is inexcusable.&#34;<br>&#34;Our Toula salad was not that great to be honest. It missed some vinaigrette or a sauce dressing - perhaps the lemon that the description promised. There was a bitter taste carried in by endive. The palm harts were great though and Emmental cheese gave the plate a nice finish. There was also corn and avocado to add some sweet, smoothness. I would not call this a signature dish, unless it get that hint of something exciting.&#34;<br>&#34;The Tagliolini Con Salsa Di Astice lobster plate was one of the more expensive items on the menu. It was topped off by a sizable chunk of lobster and tastefully arranged on the plate. We paired it with a glass of Sangiovese which turned out to be a good combination. The dish was heavy and smooth, but nothing exciting. Cannot say it was worth the money, but the presence of lobster definitely upped the price tag on it. <br>The other main dish was Risotto &#34;CasaNova&#34;. Ma Cheri definitely enjoyed it although I would have found it a bit on a plain side. It was light and undercooked for al dente. Chardonnay we got was not a really good match of the dish - a lighter red might have been a better choice. Overall, this risotto was a safe choice. It promised black truffle, rosemary and provolone - all present.&#34;<br><br>read my full experience: <a href='/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Filianaspalette.blogspot.ca%2F2013%2F11%2Ftoula-restaurant.html&amp;s=ca4d00f33e4148537711842fd5b3e8c45799a6efb3543300b28a161fe36763ae' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>ilianaspalette.blogspot.…</a>",

"reviewcomment":"I came here with some co-workers for a good-bye lunch. <br><br>We were immediately greeted when we arrived and asked if we would like our coats taken. We were brought to our table and seated at a cozy booth which was perfect for our intimate occasion. Our waiter described the specials to us, and then was kind enough to say that he didn&#39;t want to rush us, but that he also had two large parties that had just arrived, so that we could get our orders in before these groups. I really appreciated that he took the time to tell us this!<br><br>All table members enjoyed their dishes. I ordered the grilled calamari (lunch size, not appetizer). It came with lots of calamari that was cooked well, although some pieces were slightly overcooked (not uncommon when grilling calamari) and drizzled with olive oil and garlic. It also came with polenta, asparagus, green beans, carrots, and roasted beets. The beets were delicious! My only complaint was that there was a bit too much olive oil on the calamari and the vegetables for my liking, but otherwise it was a great dish!<br><br>Throughout our meal we had superb service that had an air of quiet elegance, not the pompous over-the-top flair that you sometimes experience at higher end restaurants. The waitstaff were attentive without being in your face.",

"reviewcomment":"Clafouti is a small patisserie and cafe, very, very small. Unfortunately, the layout is quite terrible and I missed out on buying a few items because I simply didn&#39;t see them until I was on my way out!!<br><br>First place in the city I&#39;ve seen mango macarons! My sandwich was so good with goat cheese, grilled vegetables and walnuts. I ate a pistachio macaron on the way home, while it was delicious, big and chewy (apparently Nadege isn&#39;t the best) it lacked the flavour of pistachios. Hopefully it was just an oversight and not the way their macarons are usually flavoured. The mango is definitely mango-y!<br><br>I&#39;m a satisfied customer here. I can&#39;t wait to come back on my next day off and take my sandwich to Trin-Bel!",

"reviewcomment":"This is hands down the best sushi I&#39;ve had in this city and can&#39;t even be compared to other fast food sushi joints in the Annex.  I come from Vancouver where I was spoiled for good sushi.  I can definitely taste the love and care put into this food.<br><br>Every item i&#39;ve eaten here has literally melted in my mouth.  There&#39;s something so delicate about the way the sushi is prepared and I don&#39;t understand how someone could review the food as being tasteless.  I know a guy who lives on McDonald&#39;s and fast food and returned his organic chicken burger cuz he said it tasted off.  Some people who are used to eating crap, just can&#39;t appreciate real flavours.<br><br>I had the crunchy maki tonight, for example, and i swear, every time I took a bite I tasted a whole other layer from the last bite and then another flavour magically revealed itself in the 3rd bite...of the same roll!  My whole meal was a delightful tastebud adventure.  <br><br>In my opinion, they are undercharging for their quality and level of sushi preparation.<br><br>Food aside, compared to the other cheapo sushi restaurants in the Annex, this is a great place to go on a date because of the lighting, roomy booths and servers that don&#39;t throw the bill on your table as soon as you take your last bite.",

"reviewcomment":"It was a quaint location in a quieter part of town .  I had dinner here in the middle of the week while in town on a business trip.   The ambiance was warm and the bar was a good size for the space.  While it was quite slow for mid week, there were several groups of people that were eating together.  <br><br>Extensive Italian Wine list but a smaller dinner menu. I ordered the Tuna.  And although was underwhelmed by the size, it was amazingly delicious!  Really a well flavored dish and I enjoyed the tuna/clams combo.   I had only wished I had seen the chalk board above the open kitchen area that listed the specials before ordering.  I probably would have ordered the Risotto special.   <br><br>They had a long family size table right in the middle of the space.  I would go back to taste more of their flavorable dishes even though knowing the portions might be on the smaller side.",

"reviewcomment":"I was wandering around Yorkville and came across this restaurant when the Starbucks across the street was too packed to get a coffee.<br><br>I walked in around 11:30 am and the hostess asked if I had reservations, I don&#39;t and she was very nice and said if I don&#39;t mine sitting inside, she can seat me. The patio was open and jammed pack but the restaurant inside was not too full. I prefer the inside anyway so Bonus for me.<br><br>The server was very attentive and provided answers to questions I had regarding the preparations of the dishes.<br><br>I ordered:<br><br>Steak Tartare - perfectly made, infused with spices, capers and topped with a quail egg, plated with fricasse and artichoke hearts, rice crisp wafers and banquette slices.<br><br>Duck Confit Salad - this was a large lunch portion, Perfectly plump crispy skinned duck leg sitting on top of a beautifully put together beets, walnuts salad. The duck leg was perfectly seasoned and the meat was so tender while the skin was not fatty but crispy.<br><br>Peach Semifreddo - served with peaches poached in liquor over beautifully made Peach Semifreddo surprisingly light and not too sweet! <br><br>After I ordered, I sat back and enjoy the scenery. Lots of very smartly dressed business people, Chanel wearing ladies doing lunch and movie stars. (Now I get why there were so many photogs outside) Mr Wonderful aka Kevin O&#39;Leary was sitting at the table next to me.<br><br>The server brought out a nicely display dish and put it down on the table.<br><br>It was Tuna Sashimi served bite size. I did asked questions about the preparation but I did not ordered it. When I brought it to the server&#39;s attention. He asked if I will take it at his compliment since it was his mistake.<br><br>The Tuna Sashimi was served on 4 Chinese Soup Spoons, pan seared along the edge and raw inside with Soy, wasabi sauce drizzle on top. It was ok, slightly salty and not very special. I am glad I did not order it.<br><br>All in all, a great meal, service was impeccable.. and as I was leaving, ran into Kate Hudson.",

"reviewcomment":"Do yourself a huge favour and try the Indie Burger. Seriously. Just do it.<br><br>They have a variety of different craft beers which are all brewed on site and have super fun names. Picking one can be a little hard, in which case you can always order a flight, which is five different beers of your choice in little glasses, served on a cute wooden board.<br><br>They also have a shop at the front of the store, where you can purchase a 16 oz. growler of whichever beer(s) they are selling that day for $25 AND you get $5 off if you bring in an empty growler when you purchase.<br><br>The decor is warm and trendy, but by no means pretentious. There always seems to be a fun mix of people ranging from neighbourhood hipsters to sweet elderly couples having animated conversations.<br><br>It does get VERY busy and crowded during the weekends, so maybe come during the week or earlier in the day if that&#39;s not your thing.",

"reviewcomment":"We had a lovely table for a large group of 9. We all sat comfortably, while being able to all speak to each other. The noise level was on the higher side, so we felt comfortable in being loud. Though I wouldn&#39;t say this restaurant is suitable for an intimate dinner. That being said, we were seated in the first room of the restaurant, and I can&#39;t comment on how the inner room&#39;s environment is.<br><br>We ordered 2 dozens of the mixed oyster platter, which had 3 types of oysters. I&#39;m not an avid oyster eater, so I can&#39;t recall the names of those types. As my second time eating oysters in my life, I really enjoyed them.<br><br>Additionally we each ordered individual dishes. I&#39;ll do a run down of the other dishes we ordered as a group:<br><br>- Mussels. A few of us ordered the mussels dish because it was the most inexpensive main dish at $19. A good portion, tasted good. The broth was on the salty side, but had good flavour.<br><br>- Grilled calamari salad. I&#39;m not a fan. The calamari was very rubbery and barely grilled. The salad didn&#39;t taste good at all.<br><br>- Crab chowder soup. We were all surprised when the soup came in a red colour. We were expecting it to look white. It was decent, again on the salty side, but that just might be my preference. For the portion and taste, it wasn&#39;t worth the $10.<br><br> - Fries. These came as a side for 4 dishes that were ordered, but they brought them to us in 2 big plates for us all to share, without us even requesting it. The odd thing about the fries (and rather gross I&#39;d have to add) is that the dipping &#34;sauce&#34; they served with them was nothing but ... butter.<br><br> - Baked oyster in bechamel sauce. This is what I personally ordered, and it came off of the Small Dish menu. 5 oysters for $14. They were absolutely heaven. I would definitely want to eat more of these baked oysters.<br><br> - Sticky toffee pudding. A whopping order of 5 of these were served to our table as we were recommended to try out the best toffee pudding in town. It was more of a cake than a pudding. Warm, moist, soaking in sweet sauces, it was definitely well-recommended. I almost never order dessert when I eat out because usually they are too sweet for my liking. I approve of this one.",

Came here for lunch and was able to get a table right away.  The restaurant is nicely decorated and modern.  There was a whole page of lunch specials, all rice dishes.  Each meal comes with hot tea, soup (wonton or hot &amp; sour), and small bowl of rice for $10-12.  The service was quick and friendly.  They brought out hot tea as soon as we sat down.  My friend ordered the Hunan Beef and that dish came out right away like it was already ready.<br><br>I ordered the Szechuan Fish lunch special $10 and it was delicious!  The fish was nicely breaded and covered in a red sauce.  As a matter of fact, as I looked around, all the meals seem to have the same red coloring/sauce.  I wish there was just a little more rice, but that&#39;s just me.<br><br>They have noodle dishes, but they are not part of the lunch special.",

"reviewcomment":"*I would rate this as a 4.5 if I could, but I definitely can&#39;t lean towards a 5 because I&#39;ve only been here once.* <br><br>Anyways, onto the review! First things first, this restaurant is conveniently located in the Beaches and is a great dinner or lunch location after a leisure day strolling through the area. Kinda difficult to spot if you don&#39;t know where it is, but after the first time visiting you should be able to remember the place pretty well. My group and I came in last Sunday around lunch time and even then the place was PACKED. Like when I say packed I don&#39;t mean there just weren&#39;t enough seats, I mean every table is within such close vicinity- but what are ya gonna do about it, it&#39;s the Beaches. Despite the cramped space, the restaurant is still pretty nice and has it&#39;s own charm without a doubt (p.s: A+ for the innovative hanging lightbulbs as lighting fixtures, it&#39;s actually really nice, just don&#39;t be a goof like me and bump into them when you get up). <br><br>Now let&#39;s dig into the food!. Ok, so I went with three other people and all of us ordered completely different things. Something important to note, we spent more time deciding what we were going to get from the plethora of options than we spent waiting for the food to be served. Usually that would scare me, but the food was fresh and was clearly made in house, you can even see the kitchen since they&#39;ve got this visible kitchen type concept going on. <br><br>As for the individual food we got, I&#39;ll start with my Mediterranean Feta Burger which comes served with either fresh fries or a salad (house or Caesar) .The House Salad, which is a typical house salad, served as a huge portion despite it being a SIDE for a meal, is absolutely delicious. I can&#39;t even begin to describe the dressing, it&#39;s sweet, yet tangy, and difficult to dissect into individual flavours. Whatever they put in there, it&#39;s amazing. Definitely recommend. Now for the burger, it&#39;s also quite impressing, both in size and taste. It really stays true to its name, its got the feta, onions, roasted red pepper, and represents the Mediterranean flavours well. Burger is a 4/5, it&#39;s juicy, flavourful, and is a decent size. Only down size: it&#39;s messy cause it&#39;s so juicy, so it&#39;s a pro that comes with a reasonable con I guess?? Okay, also want to point out I was served FRIES with my burger too... I wasn&#39;t suppose to get them cause I ordered a salad as a side, but they gave them to me anyways. I didn&#39;t ask for them, but hey I ain&#39;t complaining. <br><br>As for the rest of my group, they ordered a Classic burger, Mediterranean Salmon Salad, and Rainbow Trout, respectively. Pretty much all of the reviews were positive,  and everyone&#39;s overall consensus was that the portions were huge. The Classic burger received praise because of its cooked through, yet not overcooked or dry patty. The Rainbow Trout was also complimented for its fine execution (nicely seasoned and cooked) as it is dish that is more than easy to screw up. As for the salad, &#34;Good salmon, good portion, nice dressing, fulling&#34; were the general comments. <br><br>The service was also great, our waiter was very kind and was interactive with us, no fake smiles and chitchat. <br><br>Overall, this place is a definite recommend as the food is really worth the price and doesn&#39;t leave you feeling like you&#39;re still hungry or ashamed at what you&#39;ve shelled out of your wallet.",

I am in Entertainment district pretty often but didn&#39;t notice Corned Beef House until I literally looked it up. It&#39;s not tucked away, but a little hard to find around the corner just off of major street where you can find milestone, jack astor and hooters.<br><br>I decided to drop by for a dinner on a week day with a friend and walked into a restaurant pretty much empty. Corned beef house is not really set up like your ordinary deli, but more so your neighborhood bar. The atmosphere is pretty laid back and would be perfect spot for quick lunch or family dinner.<br><br>Every Monday, they have a Man VS Sandwich contest where if you consume a 40oz sandwich within 1 hour, your sandwich is free! Anyone up for the challenge? I don&#39;t think I could do it..<br><br>The menu is pretty simple, you can get a deli sandwich ( choose from Montreal smoked meat, corned beef or couple other choices) and then choose the size (Huge 7oz, Gigantic 10oz or Colossal 16oz). You can get the sandwich by itself or make it a combo by adding couple more dollars and get it with soup or salad.<br>With the bread, you have choice of light, dark and marble rye and then choice of mustard with yellow, dijon and honey mustard.<br><br>Ordered: Corned Beef Sandwich platter 4/5<br><br>* 7oz sandwich with light rye bread and honey mustard on the side<br>* Substituted fries for poutine, coleslaw and pickles for $13.25<br>* Corned beef was super flavorful and there was so much of it<br>* light rye bread was dense and held up quite well but I still wouldn&#39;t try to hold up entire sandwich<br>* I am not the biggest fan of poutine, but really enjoyed it at Corned beef house<br>* Generous amounts of cheese curds on top were squeaky and delicious<br>* Coleslaw was tangy and complemented the heavy sandwich<br><br>Ordered: Montreal Smoked Meat 4/5<br><br>* 7oz sandwich with light rye bread and dijon mustard on the side for $8.49<br>* This was my first time having smoked meat sandwich and honestly I couldn&#39;t tell the difference between 2 sandwiches<br>* I enjoyed both of them nontheless<br>* Dilled pickle on the side was juicy and just perfect<br><br>Ordered: Onion rings<br><br>* Since we were getting poutine with the platter, we decided to try their onion rings<br>* Really large portion and loved the crispy batter <br><br>Summary: Overall I really enjoyed Smoked meat sandwiches at Corned Beef House. If you are in the entertainment district feeling hungry, check out Corned Beef House and maybe try their challenge if you are brave enough!",

"reviewcomment":"So my 300th review will be for my love of burgers, and I had the pleasure of stumbling upon this place for lunch today! <br><br>They&#39;ve got a nice little patio, and have daily specials posted right by the door. The interior is clean and is decorated with more menu items hanging on the walls. I would have ordered the Beets Burger if I saw that first.<br><br>I ordered the Ossington Chuck ($9) that comes with portobello mushrooms that complemented the juicy patty (medium) very well. It&#39;s very messy to eat, but the meat is super flavorful you&#39;d just let the juice dribble down your chin. <br><br>All burger orders do not come with any sides - I&#39;m not a fan of having to order my fries separately and $9 is a bit pricey for just the burger alone. You can choose the quality of your patty, with the Chuck being the cheapest at $9 and the most fatty. The brisket is $11 and for a leaner option, the sirloin is a great choice at $13. <br><br>Service was attentive. Our waitress had no issues doing separate bills or moving us inside from the patio when it got too hot.<br><br>They advertise organic and grain-fed cattle, but who knows, a bunch of restaurants are making this claim to jack up prices. <br><br>The burger here is tasty, but doesn&#39;t come cheap!",

"reviewcomment":"Specialty: Creative interpretations of American-inspired dishes<br>Dining Experience: Dinner<br>Location:  589 King Street West, Toronto, Ontario<br>Menu items: Corn Bread, Kentucky Fried Handshake Sandwich, Chicken and Waffles, Maryland Crab Cakes<br><br>Home of the Brave is home to some brave food. Food one most welcome with open arms, a firm handshake and an empty stomach.<br><br>Known for it&#39;s creative spin on traditional American dishes, a clubby yet nonchalant ambiance and a small space, HOTB serves up quite a meal and some dangerous cocktails (must try The Derby) that are sure to compete with fellow Toronto King West restaurants.<br><br>But former La Carnita kitchen pals, Andrew Richmond and Jonathan Hamilton, are not in for a competition; rather they bring a breath of fresh air to the King strip of trendy restaurants, breaking away from traditional upscale meals, and bringing it back to basics for us lovers of all things fried, greasy and homey.<br><br>Like the Cornbread, a crowd pleaser for its spongy and moist texture. Corn kernels are still present through each bite while the juiciness from the house double-smoked bacon and roasted garlic and shallots infuse the bread with flavour. Add a bit of green onion for good luck (and texture) and you&#39;ve got yourself a dish that in itself passes for a meal. &#34;Sharsies&#34;on this one, a must.<br><br>Crab cakes are tough to &#34;nail&#34; for any restaurant. Those little circles of joy look as though they are the easiest appetizer to make, but a bit much or less of something and the cake is a thing of the past. Yet this is not the case at Home of the Brave. The dynamic kitchen duo make it a point to have these bite-sized pockets of flavour made to perfection with a light breading that is crispy, enveloping some herb-infused fresh crab and accompanied by a slaw drizzled with home-made shallot dressing which balances out the dish quite fantastically.<br><br>For those of you that enjoy indulgence, the Chicken and Waffles are not to be missed at HOTB. A skewer breaks through some thick-crispy chicken thigh pieces and sweet and savory waffles that are topped with sour cream, spicy maple sauce and green onion. No further introduction required.<br><br>And remember when I said one must welcome Home of the Brave&#39;s food with a firm handshake? Well, I was being quite literal. Leg with foot included (bonus), the Kentucky Fried Handshake Sandwich brings some unexpected rejoice to tables as groups shake the so called foot before indulging on this succulent and juicy piece of meat that is deep-fried to perfection and topped with spicy buffalo hot sauce, mayo and iceberg lettuce.<br><br>So if you are brave enough, and can not wait to shake the hand (or foot) that feeds you, head to Home of the Brave. Who knows, you might find me with cocktail in one hand and leg/foot on the other!<br><br>Buen Provecho,<br>Viviana.",

"reviewcomment":"Located in the heart of the entertainment district, Fred&#39;s Not Here is a small restaurant whose food will continue to keep it a favourite of mine.<br><br>One word: paella. The seafood dish is amazing. They bring you the pan that it was cooked in, and it practically took up my side of the two person table. With a hefty lobster placed right in the middle, just a waft of the dish made me swoon with delight. Rich, savoury and plenty for leftovers, this dish is a must try. <br><br>The place is dim-lit, and seems to veer people toward more intimate conversations. The service is around average, but the food I&#39;ve tried is great. <br><br>Worth a trip just for the paella.<br><br>More on my blog here - <a href='/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fsavourthethought.blogspot.ca%2F2013%2F01%2Ftake-in-take-out-freds-not-here-toronto.html&amp;s=defa7715d921ea364b6eb97445265888137d36997fadffcbe63efc8386cdb922' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>savourthethought.blogspo…</a>",

"reviewcomment":"Gilead cafe is a pleasant surprise tucked in an alley around the corner from another pleasant surprise, Morning Glory. I&#39;m envious that this neighbourhood has such a lovely cafe in close proximity where they can drop in for espresso and pastries in the morning and return for yummy savouries at lunch. My braised beef poutine (you know I had to try it!) was perfect. light crispy fries, sumptuous braised beef, the perfect amount of cheese curds and a serving size that was satisfying without making me feel I had made an irresponsible and possibly life-threatening menu choice.<br><br>But the demeanour of the staff makes me wonder about labour practices. Why so glum chums? I seriously felt like I should get out of there so they could stop having to deal with people. Maybe this nighttime expansion has them working triple shifts?Maybe they save the smiles for the guys in suits and can&#39;t be bothered with a couple of women who don&#39;t look like money.  I don&#39;t know what&#39;s going on, but I hope it isn&#39;t serious and only temporary.<br><br>Because aside from that bit of distraction, it seems like it could all be quite lovely. Someone should upload a picture of the interior - it&#39;s definitely a big part of the charm.",

A slice is about $4.00, and it&#39;s thin crust, so if you&#39;re super hungry and/or a piglet like me you probably could eat 2, so it&#39;s definitely not the cheapest pizza in the world, but it sure is delicious. Thin crust, crumbly, and excellent toppings. I tried the white pizza and the pepperoni.<br><br>My go to meal: The white pizza was insanely good, so I&#39;ll go back for that. Delicious soft cheese topped with fresh lemon drizzled arugula. Mmmm. <br><br>Secret: It&#39;s licensed so you can come crush a few beers and a pizza before you hit Bellwoods park around the corner.",

"reviewcomment":"I came to Trattoria Mercatto one day for lunch with some relatives who were visiting Toronto from overseas. <br><br>The restaurant is a good and clean establishment that is decorated well and definitely a good option for a restaurant that is located in a mall when you want a sit down restaurant and don&#39;t feel like eating at a chain that is typical of shopping malls.<br><br>I ordered two appetizer dishes for my meal:<br>1) Misticanza - mixed lettuces, celery hearts, radish, aged sherry vinaigrette ($8) - this was a good salad and a decent sized portion for an appetizer<br>2) Frutti di Mare - marinated shrimp, scallops, calamari, red onion, crostini ($11.50) - this was like a ceviche (although with cooked seafood) or a seafood salad with a vinaigrette-type dressing served in a dish with two small and rather thin pieces of crostini on the side. If you order this dish, I would recommend that you get a salad too because you receive much more seafood than could possibly fit on the two pieces of crostini, so I ended up using the left over seafood as a topping on my salad.<br><br>Our server was attentive and our guests enjoyed themselves. Overall it was a good experience.",

"reviewcomment":"Just come here.<br><br>Just kidding, but in all seriousness, this place is a hidden gem. It really is. Located inside The Grange, right by Manpuku.<br><br>I can&#39;t say much about the decor but the atmosphere of Karine&#39;s little counter space is up beat and lively. The customer service here is impeccable. Every restaurant should learn from them, this is how you keep your customers coming back, son! <br><br>Now onto the food, let me take the time to say that everything on their menu looks and sounds delicious. It was hard for my friend and I to choose but she ended up ordering the waffles and I got the Karine&#39;s Supreme. Both dishes were a little well under $12, which was a great thing for the both of our wallets.<br><br>After waiting for a bit, our food emerges! The lovely lady behind the counter calls for me, &#34;Amy Darling, Amy Darling, your food is ready!&#34;and I dash towards the counter to get my food. I was amazed at how much food I got, it was enormous! If you were wondering, the Karine&#39;s Supreme came with a choice of sausage or smoked salmon, eggs of your choice, garlic fries, toast and french toast! That&#39;s a lot of food at such a great price.<br><br>Overall, if you&#39;re around the area hit this place up and you won&#39;t regret it and all of you lucky OCAD students, I&#39;m very jealous right now! This place has definitely become one of my favourite brunch spots to hit up in the downtown T.",

The first time we went it was a slow weeknight, but the food was great. Since it was a slow night, the service was phenomenal - staff took the opportunity to interact with us, made lots of suggestions with the menu, and had a few laughs. Food was amazing. <br><br>So amazing, that we came back for Valentine&#39;s day. Ambitiously, they had a three course night going on with different sets of groups coming at different times - I don&#39;t know, we got a kick out of watching them run around trying to figure the whole thing out and keep everyone moving along, but it was delicious. Started with oysters, which were fine. Charcuterie board was phenomenal. The different levels were lively and just a killer (good way) combination. But that&#39;s not what impressed. Elk Wellington, never had it before, but damn was it good. <br><br>Love this place, and at some point we will be back this summer, keep up the good work.",

"reviewcomment":"The Red Room ... Oh god, it&#39;s so tough to review this place. Where to begin??<br><br>THE WONDERFUL:<br><br>- Choice. Seriously. This place has everything. You can come here for breakfast. You can come here for brunch. You can come here for lunch. You can come here for dinner. You can come here for drinks, finger food, as part of a night on the town. The menu is HUGE. It has everything from Pad Thai, to chicken curry, to traditional sandwiches, to pasta, to burgers, to French toast, to poutine and quite literally everything in between. Oh, and there&#39;s a wide range of teas, coffees, juices, beverages, and cocktails.<br><br>- The taste! Everything I&#39;ve tried here (and I&#39;ve tried a lot - most of the above listed dishes and drinks, in fact) has tasted great. Full of flavour, everything in balance, mostly mouth-watering. (Why am I writing this review just before lunch? Mhmm....)<br><br>- Value. This place is as cheap as you&#39;d get in Toronto. I discovered it the first morning I arrived in the city on my visa, and ate there religiously for my first few weeks while searching for a job and an apartment. I would have starved if it weren&#39;t for this place! Even when I got a job and moved out to the east end, I still continued to return, as the portion sizes are GINORMOUS, and will keep you full all day. Not only are their base prices well below the city&#39;s average, additional deals are offered on some parts of the menu, e.g.: soup and sandwich for 6.75 (or something), add on coffee to breakfast for just 1.75, etc, etc.<br><br>- Layout.  It manages to be cosy, yet also inviting to large groups, with most tables offering long benches as seating. Décor is mostly Asian, with a trendy, modern twist. There&#39;s an outdoor patio for those summer scorchers.<br><br>If choice, taste, value and layout are all you value in a restaurant, then stop reading and consider this place a five-star establishment.<br><br>THE BAD:<br><br>- The service is overall, quite bad. Slow and unfriendly. I had the experience of our waiter not believing we were tipping enough, so he just took our money and kept the residual change without even asking if we wanted any money back. This was after this particular server began to know my boyfriend and I as regulars, so his actions made us feel as though we were stingy and not tipping enough (even though we were leaving moderate tips for the service encountered).<br><br>THE HORRIFYING:<br><br>- I can cope (easily) with the poor service, but I cannot accept poor hygiene standards. Unfortunately, I read a recent report stating that the Red Room failed a hygiene and safety inspection - one minor infraction, four significant infractions. I can turn a blind eye to many things, but not to food safety and hygiene standards. For this reason alone, I will not return to the Red Room. What a shame.",

Im glad she was right..................as usual. ...most of the time Actually...... as much as I hate to admit. <br>This place literally feels like an old house; old wooden floors, chairs, tables, bookshelf, comfy booths and decor truly feels like you&#39;re at home.  The service was great, and the overall mood of this places exhibits a chillaxed environment. <br>They have a range of comfort foods and the beer and wine lists are exceptionally good.<br>My buddy order a domestic brew while she and I had their Argentine Malbec.<br>For food their calamari 3.5/5 not greasy which is plus! Presentation was satisfactory and taste was not bad... However the batter needs a but more flavour.<br>Sweet Potato fries with maple Dijon dip 4/5 fresh cut sweet fries, again, not greasy...served with a dip. Only recommendation sauce should be a bit more thick so at least the sauce could stick to the fries lol.. <br>Dessert...ooh lordy!!! Wow speaking of sugar kick and diabetes sticky toffee pudding..@&amp;!&amp;#*$ so gooooood!!!! Lots of syrup sauce, soft...melt in your mouth goodness..I highly recommend &amp; give it a perfect 5/5<br><br>Now among my list of chill out places.....gracias hermosa ;-)",

"reviewcomment":"OMG.<br><br>This was hands down one of the best meals I have ever had. <br><br>My sweet sweet BF took me here as part of my 30th birthday present and I was blown away (thank you honey!!). Everything we tasted was amazing and the service was just top notch. It was a very wonderful evening to say the least.<br><br>We started with Oysters Rockefeller, the seafood cocktail, and Ontario heirloom tomato salad with house made mozzarella.<br><br>The oysters were cooked perfectly, still very moist and tender, just warm, covered in hollandaise, topped with bits of spinach and bacon - very decadent but very enjoyable.<br><br>My seafood cocktail was just incredible. I loved the sweetness of the lobster and shrimp partnered with these amazing orange limes (I forget the exact name of them oops!) and a tequila laced guacamole - outstanding!<br><br>The heirloom tomato salad was very tasty, a great lighter dish. I loved the creamy housemade mozzarella, so good!!<br><br>In between courses, we were presented with tiny soup bowls with a couple of peas and creme freiche in a little clump. The waiter then proceeded to cover the contents of the bowl with an amazing bright green soup which tasted like springtime. I did not want to stop eating the yumminess, it was amazing!!<br><br>Our mid course was lobster ravioli, very tender and slightly sweet from the seafood, just delicious!<br><br>My main was a seafood platter of sorts, absolutely beautiful presentation, with a razor clam, crunchy seafood croquette, a tender piece of halibut, and an awesomely tender scallop. I loved this!!<br><br>My BF had the steak with shaved truffles on top accompanied by parmesan frites - it looked incredible and he said it was the best steak he has ever had.<br><br>For dessert, I enjoyed a birthday edition of the apple tarte tatin, which was just lovely. It was very sweet but delicious, with a crunchy lattice work topping of caramelized sugar - OOOH BOY!!<br><br>Loved the housemade truffles which accompanied the bill. Try this place, its awesome! I can&#39;t wait to go back to try the 22 course tasting menu!!",

We were eagerly greeted by a server, who checked on us frequently through out our visit. There was not one time that I had to look up more than once before being noticed. <br><br>We ordered a special combination, which was 20 wings, small pitcher of beer (3 glasses), and potato wedges which was $34.50. Comparatively it is cheaper than other highly rated wing places in Toronto (with booze). While there was not a huge variety of wing flavors, they seem to do what the offer right. We got the medium and bbq. Both were adequately sauced, with a convenient bucket to hold all the bones. <br><br>We would definitely go back. Plus, there is street parking for $2.25 per hour, which for the city is decent. Worth the trip. Also, the patio (currently closed because of snow, looks promising for the summer).",

I was craving some ramen today and noticed that many of the other places with higher Yelp reviews don&#39;t offer vegetarian options and/or are farther from the subway.<br><br>I ended up ordering the vegetarian version of the Ji Su Men (A soy sauce base soup combined with eggs and sesame oil. Mixed with stir fried vegetables.) I found the portion size to be very large and the meal really quite satisfying. I wish I could of had some tofu in there, but my waitress said that unfortunately they could not add any to my dish. <br><br>I also ordered a hot green tea for $1 that was served way too hot and with the tea bag still in the cup. It was too hot to drink during the meal (or even to touch the cup), but I was able to enjoy it after I finished eating once the tea had cooled down to a more reasonable temperature.<br><br>The prices are also affordable and the service is friendly and efficient.

My friend and i went in to just take a look inside and as soon as we stepped a foot in, we were pulled into our seats by the amazing smell of the teppenyaki grill. <br>There was complementary soup and salad to start with. We tried their sushi, hand rolls, and their grilled steak, chicken, scallops, and shrimp. Their sushi was nothing special, but their hand rolls had amazing texture and were stuffed with crab. <br>When the chef came to our table, he was so joyful and laughed with us and cracked jokes about cooking. He did a couple of good tricks including the onion volcano. When he was done with the meat and the fried rice, i dint remember anything but tasting the goodness in my mouth, definitely amazing!<br>This place is pretty pricy compared to other places, bit definitely worth it!!",

"reviewcomment":"Excellent service at Bent. Our server was very knowledgeable about both sake and seafood. <br><br>The food was great but at times awkward to eat (spoonfuls of ceviche and fall-apart fish tacos). Our table was rather small and was a bit too close to the hostess&#39; podium but was by the window, hence it made up for location through its people watching abilities. The darker part of the restaurant closer to the bar looked more alluring. Nevertheless, I am a fan due to the high quality of food (fresh fish) and unique bathrooms (complete with pictures of toddlers). The space is beautiful. There is half-price wine &amp; sake on Tuesdays. <br><br>Apparently, Bent&#39;s patio is amazing during the summer so I think I&#39;ll come back then.",

OMG, it was so good.  it was on the board as a special but she said they didn&#39;t have enough to make orders...lucky me to get that!  <br><br>Hubby had their University Sushi set.  I definitely got the better deal I think though his was $18 I think. <br><br>Again rice is nicely done, not stuck together and over dressed and the fish were thickly sliced and the right temperature.  I&#39;ve had white tuna before but it&#39;s partly frozen still and we&#39;re waiting for it to defrost before we can eat it.  This was just the right temperature.  HEAVEN!",

The service was very fast and efficient. The food had lots of flavour and the dishes were presented very nicely. I would recommend trying the fixed price menu for $28.50 plus taxes. There are good options to choose from the fixed price menu and I strongly recommend trying the daily rotisserie special from the kitchen. The deserts were just delicious. I wanted to try a bite out my fellow classmates&#39; dessert plates but I was too busy enjoying my daily dessert special, it was absolutely amazing.",

"reviewcomment":"I know this place has gotten some questionable reviews by some peeps who say it&#39;s not authentic enough and it&#39;s too westernized.... Helloooooo???. Are there not enough traditional Cantonese restaurants in the GTA???!!!! My god I think there should be way more westernized chinese joints in toronto like there are in Honolulu and LA. Everyone&#39;s pallet is different. To each their own.. If your looking for duck webbing, intestines or pig ears then move on, don&#39;t bother with this place. I&#39;m looking for quality proteins, crisp fresh vegetables, wok hay and a clean environment... Check, check, check and check. Do the &#34;authentic&#34; restaurants the previous posters yearn for have the 4 check marks? Not a chance, if anything I&#39;ve noticed that the authentic Cantonese restaurants, save for the Yang&#39;s of this world are not concerned with cleanliness AT ALL.<br>Tenderloin with avocado is quality and very tasty , veggie bird nest I love, seafood dishes need some work, for the price point they need to serve high quality prawns that are big, crunchy and have been cleaned.. Chicken and chives awesome , salt and pepper pork loin very tasty.. It almost always costs me a c-note for me, my wife and 8 year old boy so it&#39;s definitely on pricier side.. But for quality this place takes a backseat to no one.",

"reviewcomment":"Hand down one of the best Italian restaurants I&#39;ve ever been to. Food, atmosphere and service all perfect. <br><br>Came here for dinner on a trip to Toronto and wasn&#39;t disappointed. It&#39;s a very small restaurant that doesn&#39;t jump out at you while walking down the street. You walk down some stairs into a dimly lit room with pictures of various celebrities who have visited on the wall. It&#39;s a very intimate setting and a great place to come with a date. FYI, a reservation is absolutely needed.<br><br>I had the Pennette Via Frattina which is penne with wood smoked salmon and asparagus. The most delicious italian dish I&#39;ve ever had. A bold statement to make, but everything about the dish was perfect. Sauce was absolutely delicious and the salmon was cooked perfectly. Also had the Gamberetti Limone for appetizer which is shrimp in wine sauce with fresh lemon. Absolutely lights out. Both meals were about as perfect as you can get.<br><br>I think this is the perfect place frankly. Delicious food and intimate atmosphere in a really cool part of town. This was by far the stand out meal on this trip and I haven&#39;t had an italian meal thats been comparable ever since. My advice: Make a reservation and get to this place immediately. Likely one of the best restaurants in Toronto.",

"reviewcomment":"The Caledonian only got better on my repeat visit. A confluence of elements created the perfect meal - cozy dimly-lit dark wood interior, gorgeous bar, quiet chatter, amazing owner, delicious food, wonderful beer selection. It&#39;s the perfect place for a casual date night (if you enjoy your date). The service was also top-notch, and not for nothing, but the servers and the owner were all running themselves silly to provide their guests with the best experience in the most unpretentious manner.<br><br>The owner is a no-nonsense but delightful and warm woman who darts around the place like a pistol, clearing plates and spouting out wonderful things in a Scottish accent, such as &#34;Of course we&#39;ve got room for you! Jump on in there!&#34; This, my friends, is what you want from a front-of-the-house manager. Straightforward and charming, she made the experience go from good to great. My husband swore that she&#39;d go zipping across the room on a horse just like the main character in Brave at any moment, gorgeous wild red hair flying behind her!<br><br>The selection of Innis and Gunn here is fabulous - they have the original, the oak aged and a seasonal. In my opinion, go with the oak aged. It goes perfectly with just about anything! We got the Taste of Scotland appetizer...something right up my alley. Fried haggis, sausage rolls and a Scotch egg. Beautifully plated and a wonderful mix of textures - squishy, crunchy, salty, moist. Just the right amount to warm two people up with a couple pints of beer. As we usually do, we split an entree as well, this time being the steak pie with a side order of neeps. Mmm, mashed turnips - a favorite of mine from childhood that I haven&#39;t had in ages! The steak in the pie was fork-tender and the crust was homemade too. It was a nice little portion and, after our starter and beers, just the right amount of food. Of course this left room for dessert. We got the fried Mars bar. Every time I have this dish, I&#39;m amazed by how good something so simple can taste -- that melted chocolate and carmel, covered with the crispy batter and a little dollop of ice cream is the perfect way to finish off the night!<br><br>The crowd at the Caledonian is mostly people in their late-20s to mid-50s. It&#39;s couples and groups catching up, it&#39;s not a place to go on a girls&#39; night or a guys&#39; night to pull someone of the opposite sex. Once you&#39;ve found them at another bar, though, this is the perfect place to get to know your date better without killing your bank account. This isn&#39;t to say that the place wouldn&#39;t be perfect for groups to do organized whiskey tastings. Looks perfect for that!<br><br>A favorite that we will certainly return to as much as we can in Toronto, the Caledonian conjures warm and happy memories just as I write this review. We&#39;ll be back!",

"reviewcomment":"This is undoubtedly the best café in Toronto. They do the best espresso/Americano I have ever had outside of Tuscany!!!<br><br>The staff are always pleasant, relaxed and friendly, but not overbearing. The decor and atmosphere is cosy and romantic; quiet enough to study or read but there&#39;s enough buzz so you can go with friends for a chat.<br><br>There&#39;s great variety on the menu and some interesting sandwiches and snacks also. I haven&#39;t tried their take-home coffee beans but it&#39;s on my to do list, as the way they display their coffee-bean wall is really inviting and draws you in!<br><br>All in all, a wonderful place to relax and unwind in. Reliable, fast free wifi and chillout music played at a perfect volume rounds off the experience. Slightly on the pricey side but totally worth it. A little piece of what feels like 1800s Paris in Leslieville! Unbeatable!",

"reviewcomment":"Visited George for the first time a while ago but am only now getting around to write the review that they very much deserved.<br><br>We had the tasting menu which was fantastic and I would highly recommend! They respected my dates dietary restrictions without compromising the quality of the meal.<br><br>I&#39;ll admit, things started off a bit slow as the first two dishes were good but not outstanding. Luckily, the creativity and flavours of the dishes continued to build and they finished off strong with a great dessert.<br><br>The service was amazing, our waiter was the perfect balance of attentiveness without being overbearing. He was absent whenever we were engrossed in our meals, but through some metaphysical process I don&#39;t quite understand, whenever we had a notion of wanting something he would somehow read our minds and magically appear.<br>He was, in a word, perfect.<br><br>My date was lactose sensitive (not intolerant) and was given a dessert that contained ice cream. She was going to eat it anyways rather than make a fuss about it but our waiter immediately noticed it (while servicing another table from a far!) and swooped in to correct it. We ended up getting to keep it (win for me!) while she got her non-dairy one.<br><br>The cheese, nuts, and honey from their own bee co-op was the perfect finisher.<br><br>I would highly recommend the tasting menu - just make sure to book off a few hours to fully appreciate it. I think it took us ~3hrs to get through it.",

It reminds me of that, but just a little better. Anyway, the menu is large enough for everyone to enjoy.

"reviewcomment":"Despite the fact that I live basically across the street, I&#39;ve only eaten at the Drake once before this past weekend. It wasn&#39;t bad the first time I suppose I&#39;ve just found myself there for drinks only since then.<br><br>So last Sunday rolls around and my husband suggests we go for brunch, really glad we did. We each started with a Drake Caesar (the classic one) but it had a really great punch of fresh horseradish that I loved. I prefer a celery garnish to the olives served here but overall the cocktail was excellent and the rim was nice and peppery. <br><br>I struggled between ordering the Caleb Benny or the Bagel + House Smoked Salmon but went for the bagel in the end. I&#39;m SO glad that I did. This is not your traditional long slices of smoked salmon, it&#39;s chopped up finer and has more variance in it&#39;s texture. Below the salmon was whipped cream cheese and above was a chow chow topped with alfalfa sprouts. The chow chow had the most wonderful sweet, tangy, pickled flavour to it. It reminded me of a sweet giardiniera. I&#39;ve been thinking about the dish ever since - I even finished the massive portion. <br><br>Husband had the classic benny and also almost finished his. He loved it and really appreciated the &#39;real&#39; slices of ham. No deli meat here. Also the fresh cheddar biscuit was a welcome subsitute for an english muffin.<br><br>Man, I might have to go back this weekend.",

"reviewcomment":"I had a shockingly good meal here, in a lovely room with excellent service. All three courses were a home run, but I actually teared up a little when I finished my main course and then contemplated the strong possibility that I would never get to eat it again: a &#34;walnut foie&#34; that was so velvety and delicious and so perfectly complemented by amazing quinoa and charred escarole that I really fear the rest of my culinary existence may be a let-down. <br><br>Also delicious: the raw salmon with yummy leaves, the root vegetable tartare (who knew vegetables could do that?) and a dessert called &#34;textures of chocolate and caramel&#34;. It was all awesome, and not &#34;awesome for vegetarian food&#34; -- I happened to order veggie dishes but there&#39;s lots of meat and fish on the menu. The foie wasn&#39;t just a consolation prize for giving up foie gras (something I did a few years ago, in one of my few food vs ethics concessions) -- it was more mind-blowing than any goose foie I&#39;ve eaten.<br><br>If I lived  in Toronto, it would be hard for me to choose any other restaurant for future celebrations or special meals. But I don&#39;t live in Toronto anymore, so I guess I&#39;ll just have to give up eating altogether.<br><br>P.S. I did deduct one star from my rating for the menu&#39;s egregious misspellings of  both &#34;pomegranate&#34; and &#34;meringue&#34;. But I mentally gave it a six-star review, so it still works out to five.",

"reviewcomment":"I used to eat here all the time, I believe this place and Ginger are owned by the same people. At one point early on after they opened they had Ginger&#39;s logo on their menu. Their food is very similar to what they have at Ginger, casual Vietnamese fare (Pho, noodles, rice dishes, Vietnamese sandwiches). It took them a little while to work out the kinks in their menu, if my memory serves correctly, I believe they originally had steak or burgers on their menu. Most of those items are gone, they do have some random items still on their menu like butter chicken, but overall its almost exactly like Ginger. I used to get their salad rolls, spring rolls, Vietnamese sandwiches, and combo meat noodle dishes which were all pretty good. My girlfriend used to get Pho from there alot as well, she said it wasn&#39;t the best but it was OK.  They also have cheap alcohol and smoothies there too, but it never seemed like a place where I would ask friends to go grab a drink.<br><br>Its pretty cheap, around $7-$10 for most of their main dishes, their sandwiches are cheaper (around $4) and so are their appetizers. I&#39;d say its just slightly pricier than Ginger, but a much nicer atmosphere and you get table service. <br><br>Side note: They did admit to putting MSG in their food once when we asked, but they said &#34;only a little bit&#34;. So that&#39;s something.",

"reviewcomment":"YUM YUM YUM YUM!!!<br><br>I am literally salivating remembering my last meal here. I&#39;ve eaten many happy and memorable meals here. For a vegetarian, there are limited options which they more than make up for in quality and outright deliciousness.<br><br>I could honestly eat the Kabilee Rice every single day and never get tired of it. It&#39;s one of the best things I&#39;ve ever tasted. EVER! Your plate is literally mounded with enough (cardamon spiced?) brown basmati rice to feed a village and topped with deliciously and delicately sauteed carrots and raisins. You don&#39;t need to be a vegetarian to enjoy this ridiculously delicious dish. Everyone who I&#39;ve (grudgingly!) let try it has absolutely loved it. The boulangee (a potato and herb stuffed pancake/bread) is also pure heaven.<br><br>I can&#39;t speak to the meat dishes but my friends tell me they&#39;re amazing. <br><br>The atmosphere is no nonsense. You order at the front and bring your food to your table, being careful not to trip because there&#39;s not alot of room. You&#39;ll want to get in and get out because there will be someone else waiting very eagerly for your table. Lunch time is super busy so get there early if you want a seat.<br><br>Highly recommended!",

"reviewcomment":"A great little restaurant in the Annex has a martini special every Wednesday which is sure to satisfy that mid week cocktail craving. Hey Lucy has three locations in central and downtown Toronto-the others are situated at the corner of King &amp; John in the entertainment district, and in Cabbagetown at Carlton &amp; Parliament.<br><br>This particular Hey Lucy is just steps from the University of Toronto campus and brings a bit more class to a section of Bloor Street that is overflowing with a diverse array of dining options.<br><br>A pit stop here for drinks and maybe an appetizer or two is definitely in order for a Wednesday night out in the Annex, especially considering their $4.49 martini specials.<br><br>The decor has the feel of an upscale lounge, with decorative chandeliers adorning beautifully molded ceilings. It is small but inviting, with almost all booths making for a cozier dining experience. Exposed brick and wood paneling surprisingly complement zebra-print seats.<br><br>The martinis are comparable to Insomnia&#39;s down the street, varying on a sweetness spectrum ranging from Jolly Rancher and Caramilk to a potent Lemon Drop and the classic olive and vermouth. These 2oz. cocktails-otherwise priced at $8.99-make getting a seat or even a spot at the glimmering bar almost impossible on Wednesdays, and there are no reservations allowed on this particular evening: first come, first serve.<br><br>On a Friday evening, Hey Lucy is busy enough to feel like a hot spot, but not too packed that you feel suffocated. pic861<br><br>The pizza is cooked in an authentic wood burning oven and is thoroughly delicious, no matter the combination of toppings. Most go for $13-17, ranging from the classic Margherita to unusual combinations like their Smoked Bacon Pesto.<br><br>The nachos ($14) are a standout, with an array of rich grilled vegetables spread atop crisped flour tortillas. The pastas are a good value for the quality-my chicken primavera came loaded with vegetables and creamy alfredo sauce at just $14 for a large bowl. It is more than ridiculous that they charge an extra $2.50 for whole wheat pasta, however.<br><br>All in all, Hey Lucy is a good bet for a decent dining experience. It&#39;s certainly not the best, but it is definitely a place that we frequent a couple of times a year.",

"reviewcomment":"A picture is worth a thousand words; so is one bite of a robust juicy steak.<br><br>When Wildfire Steakhouse &amp; Wine Bar opened it&#39;s doors at it&#39;s new downtown location, it did so with a cosmopolitan makeover, but with the same classic menu as its North York location that has established itself as one of Toronto&#39;s great steak houses. Modern tweaks appeal to vegetarians. We&#39;re hard pressed to think of another steak restaurant that caters to vegetarians and also proudly lists gluten-free options.<br><br>While the cocktail crowd nibbles on crunchy polenta cubes and succulent chipotle and lime-marinaded beef kabobs, our eyes are on the racks of lamb, tangy ribs and piri piri chicken whisked to neighbouring tables. But we&#39;ve come here for the steak. Aged in-house for forty days, this quality Canadian beef is as tender as it gets. Owner, Jody Ness, has his finger on the pulse with an urban-chic vibe, but knows that you can&#39;t fake a great steak. Melting in house-made butters like peppercorn, shallot truffle, and blue cheese, add a creamy essence to already mouthwatering morsels.<br><br>Serving an award winning selection of wines in an unpretentious ambience, right in the heart of Toronto&#39;s financial district, Ness delivers on his motto of hospitality, &#34;one guest at a time&#34;.",

From the minute we walked in - the staff were super friendly and accommodating. The Pomegranate wine is utterly amazing, the food - fantastic. <br><br>The infamous &#34;tattoo&#39;d lesbian&#34; was...well...super friendly, nice, and witty. <br><br>That said - I would definitely come back - there&#39;s a lot on the menu that sounded superb. A big thank you to the staff and kitchen for what was an awesome, personable, and delicious evening. A++",

We usually get takeout as the place doesn&#39;t have the best ambiance but I find that is what you get for most cheap Chinese restaurants. <br><br>I always get sweet and sour pork and my bf black pepper beef. We also like to get some yang chow fried rice to go with our meats. <br><br>One of the employees who is an older gentleman who is always at the cash is very kind and makes my trips very pleasant. <br><br>If you want to save time waking for your takeout call ahead about 10 minutes before you arrive to the location and your good should be ready when you arrive. I always have their takeout menu pinned to my fridge so I can call ahead and arrive to my food waiting for me. How convenient :)",

"reviewcomment":"This was my first visit with 5 friends. Two of which have been here before and swear by it. The place is nice and bright and fairly busy. We spent a total of three hours here!! The wait staff was really good; they were patient and prompt at the same time. The bread was homemade but I really wasn&#39;t a big fan. <br><br>I started things off with the arancini which I was really impressed by. The exterior was nice and crispy. The interior was creamy. The seasoning was spot on. It sat on a bed of arugula.  Really good combination. <br><br>Then I chose to go with the pasta of the day which was a gnocchi with osso bucco.  The meat literally forked apart and was tasty. The gnocchi was fluffy and delicious. I could eat this dish every day for the rest of my life and still wouldn&#39;t get tired of it. <br><br>I will most definitely be going back. Highly recommend this place. I miss it already.",

"reviewcomment":"Amazing place!!<br><br>The decor: I&#39;ts okay, it&#39;s nothing superb but it&#39;s very clean and nice. 4/5. <br>Service: I&#39;m surprised with how friendly the staff was. Our server was pretty shy and it was really endearing XD They were also very polite and informative. 5/5/<br><br>Food: Oh. my. gosh. <br>I got the &#34;normal spicy&#34; pork bone soup and it was phenomenal. I usually don&#39;t like pork but I saw that this was very recommended so I tried it. <br>It was so good. The serving was huge, so big that I couldn&#39;t finish it! The pork was falling off its bone, so tender and amazing. I used chopsticks to simply lift the bone off, it was that easy! Not hard/dirty to eat at all. The bean sprouts and cabbage on top was wonderfully spiced - it wasn&#39;t too spicy, in my opinion. I don&#39;t eat spice that much, so if it&#39;s okay for me it should be for you :)<br>The side dishes were very good too. I in particular liked the noodles &amp; the potato carrot stew &amp; seaweed salad. Very delicious! <br><br>Then I had some of my friend&#39;s food... First I stole a bit of the Tteokbokki (hot and spicy rice cake) from a friend. He said his mouth was burning, but it was not spicy at all haha! He doesn&#39;t eat spice often so perhaps that&#39;s why ;D It was really chewy and delicious, but the flavour is a bit flat. I wouldn&#39;t personally get it.<br><br>I also ate a bit of potato pancake. YUM! It was a little bit too greasy but ah it&#39;s still not bad :D<br><br>Then. I had some bibimbap... Amazing. The rice was crisp on the bottom, the bulgogi was not over-seasoned, and the fried egg on top had a perfect yolk.<br><br>I am so pleased with the food here!<br><br>Price: AMAZING! I paid $10 for my meal, tax and tips included. So worth it.<br>I would definitely come here again for the awesome food!!",

Not because I dislike Neapolitan pizza (I actually love it) or because I&#39;m never in The Annex (I&#39;m there way too often for someone who doesn&#39;t live or work there). I avoid Famoso because who every heard of great Italian-style pizza from CALGARY?!?! That was my mistake.<br><br>Usually I&#39;ll get a Margherita pizza to test the waters but at Famoso I dove right in to the new Catalan pizza. A pepper based sauce, with roasted apples, spiced raisins, and pine nuts might not be the first topping combination I would come up with inventing a pizza, but it was fantastic and not too sweet. We also had the Abruzzo pizza, which I enjoyed (though not as much as the Catalan) but the large pieces of Italian sausage were just too heavy for the thin crusted pizza.<br><br>We spent a lot of time looking at their excellent dessert menu but in the end didn&#39;t order anything. Oh, don&#39;t get me wrong, things like a white chocolate panna cotta or a gelato brownie cookie sandwich looked amazing. But we were much too full.<br><br>Why too full? Because the Wednesday special was $10 off any bottle of wine. That&#39;s enough to encourage us to split a bottle on a work night. But the bottle of Valpolicella we ordered held a secret not mentioned anywhere on the drinks menu. Our bottle of wine was a full litre! <br><br>I&#39;m sorry I doubted you, pizza chain from Alberta. We&#39;ll be back soon for more great pizza and more litres of wine!",

I have no idea on how they manage to keep doing so many burgers and make sure they get them right!<br><br>Well I had their Big Jerk burger and it was quite nice and the right size. The stuff was cooked well and was still juicy. The server was quite nice and friendly in taking the orders. The pricing of the burger is easy on the pocket as well.<br><br>Its like a local bar with 2 floors and a pool table. The place is located just beside Runnymede Station so its quite accessible and they have a green P behind them as well. <br><br>Do check it out!",

"reviewcomment":"The Epicure is a Queen West institution. What it lacks in pizzaz and trendiness, it makes up in satisfaction. I often wonder what it takes to keep a restaurant afloat in a market flooded with competition. A quick look around Epicure will cue you in to what makes this place a perennial favourite. A decor that isn&#39;t fancy, yet has the attributes that help make you feel at home and relaxed. Just right seating with plain tables for eating on, plain chairs for sitting on, a decent table cloth, candles on the table, the things that we all like to see when we sit down and start perusing a menu. And what a menu! The Epicure is known among locals to satisfy everyone (&#39;just take them to the Epicure, you can&#39;t go wrong&#39;). They can whip up such a competent and varied selection of food that it boggles the mind. I&#39;ve had the burger there a few times and love the fries. But everything else looked good too. And the second floor overlooking Queen St.? What are you waiting for? I haven&#39;t tried the patio but that should be just as appropriate as everything else.",

"reviewcomment":"I love this place. I found my favourite beer here, and it&#39;s the bar that I compare all other bars to. Nobody can beat their impressive and always changing list of beers on tap. Go to their website and check it out. The patio is also great, and much needed as the space is small and can get really full on a friday or saturday night. And don&#39;t miss their beerfests and events! Plus the crowd here is an interesting mix of old-guys, hipsters, dates, girls/guys nights out, and basically if you can think of it, you&#39;ll see it here.<br><br>Have I mentioned that I seriously, really love the only? <br><br>Years ago I went to school across the street, so I&#39;d get my coffee fix from the one, and it was *my* cafe. It felt like home, with it&#39;s mismatched chairs and mugs, and dark, cozy atmosphere. Pinball? Boardgames? heck yeah. Then I grew up and fell in love with beer, and yet again the only has become mine. Sundays are especially awesome since a pint is $5, over the normal $7 (which is still a great deal). <br><br>Downsides: Small space, so you dont always get a seat, and it&#39;s also bad for large groups if you show up in the middle of a busy night, the music and staff can be hit and miss, but who cares? If you love beer, you&#39;ll love this place.<br><br>Also, squareboys is across the street.",

"reviewcomment":"There aren&#39;t many Pho restaurants I particularly like in downtown Toronto. That said, Pho Linh is my favourite out of what there is. the Pho itself isn&#39;t the best I&#39;ve had, but it&#39;s nowhere near the worst. I generally get the Pho Dac Biet, which is pho with everything. The one complaint I would have is that the beef meatballs could be bigger and better seasoned. You could also argue that there is the ratio of meat to noodle is too much in favour of the meat, but I don&#39;t particularly mind that.<br><br>The real standouts here are the non-pho dishes. From Monday-Thursday, their specials are Bun Rieu, and Pho Bo Kho (Beef Stew Noodle Soup). From Friday - Sunday their special is Bun Bo hue. All 3 dishes are some of the best I&#39;ve had at any restaurant in Toronto. Those are my usual go to&#39;s instead of Pho here.<br><br>Another dish that they do particulalrly well is banh cuon. I think people usually get it as a complete dish, but I usually get it as an appetizer. It&#39;s just so well made, and delicious.<br><br>If you&#39;re not in the mood for a noodle soup, the bun (Vermicelli) dish is alright but not amazing, and their com tam (broken rice) is good. With the com tam, the porkchop is really well seasoned, but their cha trung (steamed egg quiche?) could be better, but it&#39;s alright.",

I know, it&#39;s weird that I end up in a burger place.<br><br>I knew from previous experiences that Capitano knows how to do burgers. And I mean, real meat burgers. I&#39;ve tried plenty of &#34;real meat&#34; burger joints in Toronto, but most of them either freeze their meat or add things I don&#39;t like into their patties, and that takes away from the whole concept of a freshly-made burger IMHO.<br><br>While the atmosphere in this place isn&#39;t &#34;happenin&#39;&#34;, per se, I was hungry and wasn&#39;t willing to walk any further for food, knowing that this stretch of Yonge isn&#39;t the most populated with good options. <br><br>I got myself a regular vegetarian burger, all the toppings, and a side of a small lemon gelato.

"reviewcomment":"I met up with a group for brunch here yesterday. The atmosphere is comfortable/eclectic. Their brunch menu is fairly small, but I actually appreciate places that focus more on quality than quantity. As we were drinking coffee and waiting for our meals, we were eying the plates that were headed for other tables. Each one looked great, and it was clear that the kitchen paid attention to detail. <br><br>I ordered the eggs benedict ($12) with the hollandaise sauce on the side. I usually don&#39;t particularly care for the sauce, but I really liked it here. My only (minor) complaint about the dish was I had difficulty cutting through the english muffin. Overall, though, I was happy with the experience and will definitely be back.",

I had it with a corn chowder soup and a side of seasonal veggies (will not get as a side next time). The waitress highlighted the special features and catch of the day.<br><br>Service &amp; Atmosphere: The waitress who served my friends and I that night was really friendly. Service was quick and formal. A waiter asked me to cut into my steak to check if it was cooked to my satisfaction.

When we eventually ordered, the food came pretty quickly, I ordered the steak enchilada which was just the right size (not to large or small portions) . for drinks I had the Sangria which was quite strong, but still easy to drinks..<br><br>I would recommend the Rancho Relaxo for sure, its not amazing food but its still good comforting Mexican meals and reasonable prices.",

"reviewcomment":"Wow a third update and it&#39;s not so I can complain? This review is for Lamesa&#39;s new brunch menu.<br><br>I am so very glad Lamesa decided to do brunch. The man and I love brunch (see: wedding menu). We had a server we hadn&#39;t seen before, a lovely lady that stuck true to the service offered at Lamesa; hint: very good. She was pretty proud of the Yoda-themed boardwalk sign she had done up. To her credit it was really funny.<br><br>The brunch, like the rest of the menu, is a refreshing twist of Filipino and Canadian cuisine. I had the Pork &amp; Pancakes. Mm, whipped coconut cream + a sweet and salty pulled pork atop light fluffy pancakes. Just a warning the portion size is small but the price reflects it, so nobody is getting &#34;cheated&#39;. The man had the Halo Halo Sisig with Garlic Fried Rice because &#34;it&#39;s not breakfast without rice&#34;. A true Filipino statement! Lamesa even has rice sides for brunch. We&#39;ve had the Halo Halo Sisig before and it was as delicious as previous visits. <br><br>For dessert we had a cool twist - Halo Halo stuffed into a crepe. The dish was delicious and aesthetically pleasing. The Mango Mimosas rounded out our brunch, whatever champagne they use was delicious and almost yeast (in a good way).<br><br>Can&#39;t wait to come back, as usual.",

However, the poppy seed bagel was so fresh, it was like heaven.  I didn&#39;t even put butter on it!!!  Oh yeah, the wedges were adequately seasoned as well.  So the NYC LOX and scrambled egg combo came with scrambled eggs mixed with lox, bagel, and potato wedges for $9.29 (I think).  Not cheap, but not too expensive either.  As for the coffee, it was decently strong and tasted like a coffee, which is rare for diners these days.  So I was happy with it, especially the free refills.  <br><br>Verdict: Great breakfast place with huge selection in the Yonge/Eg area.",

"reviewcomment":"Winter-freaking-licious! One of the best food festivals around has brought me to Globe. My Aunt and I searched the menus and based our decision on one item on their menu, a Dutch dessert called Speculaas. Yes, the reviews were good, but no one else offered Speculaas.  <br><br>Upon arrival, they took our coats and seated us. They offer seating on 2 levels and in a private room. This place was beautifully designed and earth friendly. The bathroom even had real hand towels! Not to mention, the kitchen is centrally located which made the entire place smell fantastic. <br><br>Our server, Stacy, was fantastic. My dad can be a bit of a handfull in an out-of-work-stand-up-comedian kind of way. He made friends with the table beside us as well. Poor couple! They were a good sport about it(Thank God!). Stacy was fun and attentive. Our glasses were kept full and our plates cleared. It&#39;s always nice to have a server that is fun yet professional. Stacy was awesome. <br><br>We got a chance to meet the Chef and ask him why he made the Speculaas. He&#39;s Dutch, like us, and wanted to give some Dutch flavour to the menu. He knew we&#39;d be tough critics about it, so he said he&#39;d come by after dessert for the verdict. <br><br>First course was the Smoked Haddock Croquette, another Dutch treat! It was crisp and fresh and the mustard aioli cut through the intense smoky flavour. It was lovely. My Aunt chose the Duck Liver Parfait. She said the liver had the perfect texture. The elderberry preserves and brioche made it divine. In addition to the Winterlicious apps, we also tried the Steak Tartare. This was a first for me. It was seasoned well. I expected the texture to be unpleasant, but it was actually an enjoyable dish. Pleasant surprise! <br><br>Next was the main course. I had the Rosemary &amp; Garlic Braised Ontario Lamb Shoulder. I love food I don&#39;t have to chew. The lamp was so tender, it fell off the bone. I literally pulled it apart with my fork and let it melt in my mouth. Fantastic! My dad chose the Roasted Perth County Pork Loin and my Aunt went with the Mushroom Tagliatelle. By the time, I had enjoyed some of the lamb and veggies, my father&#39;s plate was clean. The pork loin had been slow roasted and the chick pea masala was a nice touch. My Aunt loves pasta and this was no exception. A good helping of fresh pasta piled with local mushrooms and topped with parsley and celeriac puree. What a meal! <br><br>Dessert time. *cracks knuckles* It&#39;s time to get down to business. The Speculaas had arrived. We could smell the cinnamon scents of the dessert we know and love. Well, this definitely passed the test. If you&#39;ve never had it before, it&#39;s a dessert square with flavours of gingerbread and cinnamon. He nailed it. We reminisced about my Oma and compared it to hers. Great job! <br><br>he Chef returned to see what we thought. Two thumbs up! It was just like Oma used to make and we were so pleased with his recipe. He said he&#39;d been working on it and we were glad he did.  <br><br>I&#39;m a chocolate person. So, we also tried the Dark Chocolate Custard. Rich, rich, rich! The mixture of the custard with the hazelnut merengue and whipped cream was absolutely to die for.  <br><br>What a great experience. Right from start to finish, it was a memorable night. I&#39;d absolutely come back. Knowing it&#39;s farm-to-table makes it even better.",

"reviewcomment":"Came here last night to catch the Raptors game. <br><br>$5 drink specials - I had fun. :) Asked the bartender to mix me something from bar rail and he brought me back a drink containing three of my favorite ingredients for an alcoholic beverage - cake vodka, amaretto and pineapple (pic with recipe included below). <br><br>Service was fast and friendly. They were attentive but not annoying. Wasn&#39;t super busy but I didn&#39;t mind. Oscar (owner) was super accommodating about seating us where we wanted. <br><br>Had a bunch of those drinks and also ordered some crepes. I got caramel apple (LOVED) and my date got the berry ones (I didn&#39;t like them but I&#39;m picky, he liked them). <br><br>Bartenders were great. At the end of the night, Oscar came over and got us a round of shots and sat and talked for a bit - love when owners take the time to do that. It&#39;s good to see they have a vested interest in making sure their clientele are happy. <br><br>This place is fairly new but they&#39;re already doing everything right (and I don&#39;t say that often, considering I have worked in the hospitality industry most of my adult life, am a business owner myself, and am generally critical). Go check them out. :)",

"reviewcomment":"Blowfish can blow their own horn!  This was a welcome treat during our May 2014 visit to Toronto.  The spicy edamame was something I hadn&#39;t tried before and really liked.  The drinks were an excellent accompaniment to the meal.  The calamari and korean beef apps we had really set the stage for some terrific sushi rolls. I didn&#39;t care for the orange and black salmon roll, but I&#39;m not a fan of salmon to begin with so no surprise there, I just don&#39;t like fishy fishes, but wifey felt it was good.  The Ebi Shooter was simply awesome and the flavors seemed to change as you made your way from top to bottom, or bottom to top depending on your preference.  Even the non-sushi fans in the group enjoyed their meals here which gave them confidence to try things that they normally wouldn&#39;t - white people, go figure ;-)<br><br>All in all, I would recommend this to anyone looking for a moderately priced sushi, Asian restaurant and if I ever make it back to the great white north, I&#39;ll stop in again!",

"reviewcomment":"I went here for lunch yesterday. The service is really good. Our waitress waved to us through the glass, as we walked through the front door. Since we came shortly after they opened, the place was quiet (to start!), and it was a weekday as opposed to their craZy busy weekends that I&#39;ve bore witness to, as I bike by and see a line-up out the front door.<br><br>It was our first time there and we had a lot of questions. Our waitress was patient with us, which was wonderful and something that may not be awarded during the weekend brunch hours, so the time we went was perfect!<br><br>I ordered the omelette on the Specials list for the day. It was a three-free-range-egg omelette that came stuffed with fried cauliflower and ricotta cheese and with guacamole and salsa verde on top, two toasted pieces of bread (cut in half) and a side salad with honey dijon dressing (this, I ordered instead of the French fries), which was a solidly good choice, since their french fried tend to be quite done, almost, if not, to the point of over done. I also got the smoked trout. AMAZING! Smoked fish is honestly one of my downfalls, so damn good!   <br><br>The ambiance and the way Fanny&#39;s is set up definitely gives off a homestyle feel. My sister said it is a mix of modern diner with vintage and I would agree with her. It&#39;s extremely clean and very inviting. Their signature colours are orange and a light brown and they&#39;ve designed it in such a way reflecting that, with those colours blended throughout the space. It&#39;s very well designed!<br><br>There were other things that could have improved the experience:<br><br>My omelette for example, originally came with bacon inside and a beef brisket. I supplanted the beef brisket with the smoked trout, but the bacon, which I specifically told my server that I do not eat RED meat, it came with the first omelette I received. Thankfully, my sister was interested in trying some and I saw the bacon when I cut the omelette open. I&#39;m not really a hard core vegetarian. In fact, I am more of a flexitarian, however RED meat is something I feel rather strongly about, in that I do not wish to have it near the food I am eating (preferably). I told my server. She was mortified and I understood that people are people and they make mistakes. Especially since I&#39;ve been in the hospitality industry myself to know what it is like. It was also her first lunch shift. <br><br>And while others, who are more particular with their food intake (ie. strict vegans and strict vegetarians) may have blown up and been super upset because it&#39;s BACON! I maintained my composure. Our waitress was incredible about it and allowed us to take that one home. In addition to the new omelette, sans bacon that was prepared for me, on the fly.<br><br>Restaurants tend to get loud, very loud when there are a number of people filling up the empty spaces and having their own conversations with one another. Some are a lot louder than they need to be, especially when talking to people RIGHT BESIDE THEM- it&#39;s their own prerogative. Unfortunately we experienced this with those sitting behind us. It was somewhat unpleasant and uncomfortable, considering I turned around and told them but it was also something beyond our control. People wanna be that way, there is not much anyone can do, except those specific people. People wanna be inconsiderate, rude and disrespectful... by all means! <br><br>Apart from that my experience was over-all good. I&#39;d like to try their finnish pancakes and perhaps other items, but I might get take-out next time.",

"reviewcomment":"I&#39;m a woman who has been disappointed by them many times. Sometimes I meet them at a party. Sometimes they catch my eye at a nice restaurant. Occasionally I even spot them at the supermarket and bring them back to my place (!). They sound good, they look good. The problem is that once I put them in my mouth, it&#39;s kind of a letdown...what, you&#39;ve never had a bad crabcake? Did I not say &#34;crabcake&#34;?<br><br>People, here&#39;s a tip: It&#39;s at e11even. It swims in mustard remoulade. It lasts 2 heavenly minutes and costs $21, which is too much.<br><br>Follow that up with Tuna Tartare ($19), chilled, flavourful and snuggled in spicy aioli; then Deviled Eggs ($7 for 4 halves), which will have you imagining Chef Graham Pelley as everyone&#39;s favourite person to invite to a Midwestern church potluck.<br><br>I was already stuffed at this point in my meal, but you know, [insert cliché here that might justify why I kept eating despite being almost uncomfortably full]. Washing it all down with my delicious and spicy Dark and Stormy ($12), I carried on.<br><br>The Speckled Trout with fingerling potatoes and green beans ($33) was tender and doused in truffle butter with enough to share, but the side greens were too meagre for my carb-stuffed liking. I also tried the Lobster Roll ($27) which was quite tasty, as was the side of stringy fries - I would have eaten more of it but by now I was so full, I didn&#39;t think I&#39;d make it to the Raptors game.<br><br>Highlight: the BREAD. Sweet, salty, soft, warm, buttery, everything. EVERYTHING.<br><br>Other highlight: the BIDETS. Well *that&#39;s* something you don&#39;t see at Sneaky Dee&#39;s. I didn&#39;t try them, seeing as I&#39;m not a raging sociopath, but I would love to meet the person who, mid-dinner date, goes to the bathroom and decides to go the extra mile of freshness while other people are waiting around outside. Or maybe I wouldn&#39;t, I don&#39;t know.<br><br>In summation: 3.5 stars, rounded up for ordering drinks via tablet for no particular reason. Totally overpriced, but the food is good, service is good, and the derrières around you may or may not be especially refreshed. This glorified sports bar is a welcome alternative to the standard pre-/post-Air Canada Centre fare if you have money to blow and can&#39;t stomach Jack Astor&#39;s...and you want a really good $21 crab cake.",

The entire staff was amazing, from the person that sat us at our table to our waiter. All spoke French as a first language and the impression was really nice. <br>We started with the escargots and the Papillon salad - both excellent choices. The escargots were delicious with a nice garlic butter sauce. For the main we had the New York steak et frites and the Filet Mignon. The filet mignon was one of the best I have had in a long time - amazing peppercorn sauce that had a little ting to it. Really amazed with the flavour. Washed it down with a nice French pinot noir.<br>For dessert we had the creme brulee and the pouding chomeur (the second one a traiditional Quebec dessert but using caramel instead of the traditional maple syrup). Still excellent.<br>Because it was our anniversary we got some champagne at the end. Nice touch from them.<br>We loved our evening. Classy place, great food, excellent staff and a great night out in town. Strong recommend!",

"reviewcomment":"My husband are in Toronto on vacation and found Cora from an ad in our hotel&#39;s &#34;guest services&#34; book. We. Loved. It. The decor was adorable, and all near the kitchen area, it was surrounded by dozens of pieces of fresh fruit. All the signs were different and bright and colorful, it seemed clean, and there were a variety of people there, so it&#39;s good for anyone!<br><br>The service was admittedly a little slow, but the waitress was super nice, we were seated right away, and we were chatting with our waitress about us being from the US. We both got moccachinos, which were a nice balance of sweet and caffeinated. =) <br><br>I got the seasonal Spring omelette, which has green apples, cheddar cheese, bacon, and a light drizzle of maple syrup. It was served with potatoes, toast, and freshly sliced green apples. The omelette was a great balance of everything; not too much of any ingredient- definitely a nice flavor blend. =)<br><br>My husband got the crepe panini with ham and swiss, and it was served with a *ton* of fresh fruit. I tried it and was impressed with the heartiness of the &#34;panini&#34;, but also that it wasn&#39;t greasy or too heavy. The huge side of fruit definitely helped. <br><br>We&#39;re here for 4 more days and will definitely be back for breakfast and/or lunch! :)",

"reviewcomment":"Having moved here from the US, I found a lack of good, authentic, hearty Mexican fare west of the GTA. I was really starting to miss it. My sister was assigned the task of picking a restaurant downtown and she found this gem of a place on Queen St W. The place was pretty packed for a Thursday evening which I usually take as a good sign. We were greeted by a very pleasant server who knew the menu in and out and was able to help us modify our menus to suit our taste. <br>The tortilla soup had an earthy smoky flavour (yum). I ordered the chicken torta-- huge portion so I ended up taking half of it home. The sangria was fantastic albeit a little mild. But the best part of the course was the jicama, mango, avocado and cucumber salad. It amazing how simple ingredients, if fresh, can make such a simply prepared course so delectable.<br><br>Milagro Cantina gets two thumbs up from me! Definitely going back!",

Mine had the Rigatoni Vodka, of course I sampled it, excellent.  My wife and I split a crostini with arugula and ricotta with fresh figs for an appetizer.  She had the fettuccini bolognese and I had spaghetti with their homemade spicy sausage.... All well prepared, full of flavor.  Combined with a nice red wine we ordered, it was a really fulfilling meal!<br><br>The service was attentive, friendly, and helpful as well!<br><br>Dessert....

"reviewcomment":"This is going to be a story about coming full circle.<br><br>Many years ago I read an amazing book called The Film Club. It was a beautiful and heartwarming memoir written by a Canadian author named David Gilmour, who mentions some charming French restaurant called Le Paradis a few times in the book as one of his neighborhood haunts. It stayed in my mind for several years and when I moved to Toronto years after, I decided that I would visit the restaurant.<br><br>It&#39;s as charming as you can imagine a French bistro to be. Especially in the evening when business is bustling and the space is warmly lit. The first meal I had here was absolutely fantastic - some roast chicken with potatoes, and coconut ice cream for dessert.<br><br>The second experience I had wasn&#39;t as good. The pork chop with mustard was overwhelming and the waiter spilled water all over the table at one point, but there was a saving grace to that experience. As I was leaving the restaurant, I spotted David Gilmour eating a meal alone at the bar. I didn&#39;t approach him but I definitely had a fangirl moment inside.<br><br>For my third and most recent time, my experience was good, but didn&#39;t quite live up to my fantastic first experience. Still, I have a deep fondness for this place. Sometimes the memories you have dining at a particular restaurant feel so special that they make you forget the shortcomings.",

"reviewcomment":"This place was completely off my radar. I never knew it existed even though its probably a century year old. It&#39;s mixed in with a dozen of mom and pop restaurants, in which the types of cuisine are dizzying and difficult to keep up with. It&#39;s also off a side street, on the second floor of a building, sealed by thick giant doors. Nevertheless, I&#39;m glad I know about it now and I&#39;m glad I ordered the chili chicken.<br><br>Picture a clean, spacious and slightly modern. Chinese restaurant, with a combination of booth and table seating. Hard isn&#39;t it? To my surprise, I sat there, patiently, looking across such a place, as I described above, while reading a traditional Chinese menu. It was a great feeling. I hear its packed at lunch, which I can and can&#39;t believe. Can because the food is both delicious and fair priced, can&#39;t because the space is large and seating is ample. <br><br>The thing to get is chili chicken on sizzling plate and make it dry so its crispy instead of the wet version which is saucier and less crispy. Order a bowl of plain white rice to tone down the spiciness and to also mute some of that robust flavour it packs. The combo will make you the happiest camper on the block. Not a fan of any sort of heat (I&#39;d rate this a 6 out of 10 for heat)? maybe stick with any of the classics like the Cantonese chow mein. I had that too, noodles were crispy as they should be and topping was normal too. Nothing to write home about though, keep that pen in your pocket. But chili chicken and I bet, other items on the special menu are definite winners.<br><br>After 12 bucks you go home super full and satisfied.<br>Overall, its a clean, spacious restaurant with good prices and decent service.<br><br>I am craving chili chicken right now. Rumours have it, Carlos Delgado (baseball all-star) used to come here and order three plates of chili chicken all to himself. I can understand why, but I hope he had rice too. Its a bit salty otherwise.",

One of my favourite spots in downtown Toronto for a quick lunch. The fruit really makes it different too.<br><br>Service is always good, not excellent, per se, but no complaints.

"reviewcomment":"Kokyo is a great place to eat with friends, and in the bay/college  &#39;student ghetto&#39;, the best sushi bang-for-buck . It&#39;s not the cheapest sushi around, and nothing particularly gourmet, but for a casual dinner with friends, it&#39;s a great place to eat.<br><br>My favourite is the &#39;sashimi boat&#39; to share with a friend. It comes with one soup, rice, and salad, so order an extra bowl of rice if there&#39;s two of you. The boat comes with things you wouldn&#39;t get in your average sushi set. Amaebi (sweet shrimp), scallop, and ika (squid), along with your usual salmon, tuna, etc.<br><br>The fish is fresh, and cut with skill. Many sushi joints in the area serve all fish cut in the same way, but the chef at Kokyo cuts the salmon nice and thick, the leaner fishes in thinner pieces, and the ika in delicate scored strips, sometimes wrapped around a shisho leaf.<br><br>My other go-to at Kokyo is the &#39;special bento&#39;. The combo comes with enough food to satisfy the hungriest of students -sushi, sashimi, tempura, and teriyaki. It&#39;s not comparable to the quality of , for instance, Japango, but for $16, the portions are generous and the fish is fresh.<br><br>If you&#39;re hungry for sushi in the area, this is your place.<br><br><a href='/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fhedgehogfb.wordpress.com%2F2014%2F05%2F04%2Fkokyo%2F&amp;s=79bfccf7886ae76afdeb21c0a23e72cf967f5c26a1d8b46ab01c20e47d4509b7' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>hedgehogfb.wordpress.com…</a>",

The thin crisp roots were a great way to eat this paste-like tartar avocado salad. As for the raw tuna - tender, fresh and definitely of high quality. While the crispy white Grigio was an equal, close match for the tuna, the ravioli was definitely well enjoyed with the more full bodied, opinionated Valpolicella.&#34;",

"reviewcomment":"A bit of a trek getting there and finding parking but it&#39;s well worth the travel. <br><br>I had the mix ceviche (fish &amp; shrimp) which was served with a very buttery avocado and fresh plantain chips. I&#39;ve been on a search for really good ceviche after having it almost everyday at Four Seasons Resort Costa Rica and I must day that this comes pretty close! The main dish I had was the Carne Asana which included tender strips of beef, rice and beans (which was to die for), coleslaw and fried sweet plantain. Everything on the plate just complimented eachother. The portions were also generous so I&#39;d say I got my money&#39;s worth. Also tried a bit of the fried red snapper which was very flavorful. Like the ceviche, it was pretty comparable to the red snapper I had at Four Seasons Resort Punta Mita.  <br><br>I highly recommend this place to anyone looking to try something new.",

Solid beers (I like the Barking Squirrel), ridiculously good fried pickles with spicy mayo, and a great selection of burger toppings. I always order one of the pre-selected combinations (usually something spicy) rather than choosing my own toppings. Poutine for a side is also great - better curds than many places. Did I mention that I&#39;m not watching my calories when I come here? The veggie burgers, which my wife gets every time, are also apparently great - I haven&#39;t tried it yet though.<br><br>Every time I&#39;ve been, we&#39;ve been seated quickly and service has been good, even when in a big group.<br><br>Being located near Donlands, The Works is easily walkable from the Danforth/Greenwood area or Greektown. Highly recommended for nights when you just feel like a great burger and appetizers!",

"reviewcomment":"Yesterday night was the first time I came here and had a very pleasant experience. The restaurant was nice and warm so we felt real cozy after coming inside from the Toronto cold.<br><br>The host who seated us was very nice. Same goes for the waitress and guest appearance from one of the chefs who brought out a dish for us. The employees who work there have such a nice aura about them.<br><br>The food was good but it is a bit mild compared to some Indian restaurants. My friends and I ordered the chicken biryani, butter curry paneer, butter chicken, goat vindaloo, and the tandoori naan. It came with complimentary yogurt as well. We were very big fans of the goat vindaloo and the tandoori naan which was baked to perfection (very soft and fluffy). The other dishes were okay, they weren&#39;t tasteless but lacked the quintessential spice kick that we were used to. Their butter chicken is made sweeter than conventional butter chickens but it is nice. Wasn&#39;t a huge fan of it but that&#39;s definitely a preference bias; some may love it.<br><br>Worth noting was how accommodating the staff were. I requested for some additional peppers to add to my dish and they were very cool about it. Brought me some very delicious hot peppers right away. <br><br>My friends and I ate for 25 bucks each and I believe it was a pretty good amount of food for that price. Also, the service was flawless so that was also a plus. <br><br>The restaurant does cater to a more diverse crowd, which is good as I know not everyone can handle a lot of spice. Personally the lack of spice was my own little qualm with it but the restaurant is a really good place to check out.<br><br>If you&#39;re like me, just order some additional hot peppers and you&#39;ll be good to go :).",

"reviewcomment":"Two friends and I went for dinner last Friday. We had the Francis Bacon &amp; Henry Moore Prix Fixe Dinner ($45/pp). <br><br>The menu had to starter options- Guinness braised mussels with soda bread or apple slaw on clover cress.  Both were generously portioned. I love mussels, and I was impressed, especially considering Toronto is not a seafood town.  The broth was delicious. I wished there was more bread to soak it up.<br><br>The salad was bright and fresh- I didn&#39;t try it, but my friend enjoyed it, and it looked very pretty.<br><br>We each ordered one of the three mains and all tried eachothers:<br><br>1) Pan Roasted Lamb- Probably the best lamb dish I&#39;ve ever had, and I order it any chance I get.  The tenderloin was perfectly roasted, mashed potatoes were smooth and well seasoned.  So were the carrots, green beans and kale. I hope to go back and order this again.<br><br>2) Pan Fried Mackerel- this was so good I almost wish I&#39;d ordered it. Mackerel is very succulent, and had a nice crust on it.  I didn&#39;t try the sides (potato fritters &amp; green veggies) but my friend ate almost all of it, so it must&#39;ve been good!<br><br>3) Irish Stew- braised beef with bacon, carrots, potatoes, peas &amp; cabbage. Delicious! Beef was very tender and flavorful.<br><br>The portions are really big, and the food is rich.  So much so, we only had about a bite each of the desserts- sticky toffee pudding and Bailey&#39;s cheesecake.  Pretty plating.<br><br>The entire experience was wonderful- we were made to feel very welcome, service was attentive and not at all pretentious.  Highly recommend for a fancy but affordable dinner date.",

"reviewcomment":"This place just got a pretty serious makeover and menu overhaul, which has its pros and cons. <br><br>The cons: all the prices went up, which means it&#39;s no longer a ridiculously good value. This used to be the kind of place where you could buy an excellent, satisfying lunch by scrounging together the change in your pockets. Now you&#39;re looking at a minimum of $6 for two tacos, and that amazing $5.99 three taco deal is $6.99 now. Not a huge difference, I know, but it&#39;s -just- not quite cheap enough anymore to go there on a whim. The burritos also jumped in price from $5 to $6.95, which is probably the most disappointing thing of all. I loved how you could get a cheap burrito here that was tasty and filling but not the size or price of the more common massive ones from places like Fat Burrito and Chipotle. <br><br>That said, the pros: the whole place looks nicer, which addresses a common complaint in reviews. Also, the menu makes a lot more sense now - the old one was out of date and didn&#39;t always have accurate prices. They added fish tacos too, which are very good, and seemed to up the portion sizes of all their tacos. Now the three taco deal has A LOT of food and isn&#39;t really necessary unless you&#39;re very hungry, or unless you&#39;re going there for dinner. So you pay more now, but everything is a little better, and you get more in return. I miss going there for insanely cheap eats, but hey, restaurants have to keep up with the times.<br><br>Overall, this is still one of the most underrated taco places in the city and definitely in the Kensington Market. It&#39;s no frills, no hipster nonsense, just absolutely amazing, well made food. <br><br>Oh, one thing: I would be so happy, and probably a lot fatter, if this place decided to stay open late instead of closing around 7 every night.",

Whether you&#39;re a dedicated beer nerd or just a casual purveyor of the occasional ale (I&#39;ll admit I fall into the first category), the Granite has something for you. <br><br>Beers here are brewed on site in their own microbrewery (nano brewery?), in the traditional way. My personal favourites are the Darkside IPA, Keefe&#39;s Irish Stout, and the Hopping Mad (always on cask, always delicious). The food is above average pub style, with some unusual curries and seafood dishes thrown in (maybe not unusual for a British pub, but you&#39;ll never find a legit curry at a Firkin). I&#39;ve also never had a burger I didn&#39;t love here, especially the lamb burger ($16) or the bison burger ($15). <br><br>On top of all the nice things I&#39;ve already said, I&#39;d like to say how awesome the staff is - friendly, polite, and knowledgable.

"reviewcomment":"Ah, the Beacs. A Queen West staple for years now. I have so many fond memories there. While it&#39;s mostly a place I&#39;ve been for beverages, I recently had dinner there so thought I&#39;d post a review for that as well.<br><br>A welcoming, dark wood, darkly lit space mostly inhabited by the beautiful bar, the Beaconsfield is a trendy but laid back establishment. Dark leather benches, chairs and lots of standing room accommodates an astonishing number of people on a busy weekend night. In the summer the crowd spills out to the small but quaint patio facing the Drake. An attractive, hip, fun crowd is always present.<br><br>I&#39;ve eaten here a few times - menu is small but adequate. I recently tried their veggie burger which was alright. The fries and salad were very nice. My friend had a salmon dish on sweet potato and greens base that she really enjoyed. The veggie spring rolls we started with were a bit lame but conventional. In previous visits I&#39;ve had the mac and cheese which I enjoyed. A bit above average pub food is what you can expect here. Wine list is decent, cocktails are always good, a full bar accommodates any thirsty palette.<br><br>One of my favourite spots in Toronto, it&#39;s nice that they do serve food before the party starts but really, go for the party.",

"reviewcomment":"One of the first handful of Mexican restaurants opened in the city of Toronto &amp; in Baldwin Village, Margaritas has some history.  Historically speaking I&#39;ve only been here a handful of times, and the food is decent, however, not over-the-top foodgasm. <br>5th time around myself and my foodie partner decided to start off with their:<br><br>Mango-mole dip. Solid 3/5- perfect amount of guacamole, however they could have added MORE mango.  I admit, it was a bit disappointing, however their tortilla chips was not oily, nor soggy. <br><br>for plata principal! I had their Dirty Miss PIggy Enchiladas: chirzo enchiladas with veggies, served with refried puree beans craddled in a nacho shell, and some spanish rice! overall 3/5........<br><br>Overall service is friendly, the ambiance is chilled out, like your typical mexican cantina, dim lighting, colorful murals, sombreros hanging on the walls, and musica blasting in the background.  Though Margaritas can exemplify a mediocre experience at times, its still brings a crowed of people...porque  es Bueno, Bonita &amp; Barato! (because its good, pretty, and cheap)......y their Margartias are delish!!",

Their salmon sashimi is great given that Toronto isn&#39;t near an ocean.<br><br>Must Haves:<br><br>- Salmon Sashimi<br>- Spicy Chicken<br>- Beef Hot Pot<br>- Spicy Tuna Maki<br>- A roll made with Brown Rice (it&#39;s more purple than brown and it&#39;s delicious.)<br><br>All in all, if you&#39;re looking for that AYCE experience, don&#39;t look further than Echo - heck, even their salad dressing is actually THE BEST.

For the price (the bill came up significantly higher than, say, my new favourite spot for brunch, &#34;Lady Marmalade&#34;) and the fact that the portions left me barely satisfied, I&#39;d expect something significantly better tasting.<br><br>With that out of the way, service was good, the place itself looks clean. Nice decor and a very chilled atmosphere. Good music.<br><br>About the food: Was it bad? no, not even close to that. But it wasn&#39;t outstanding.

I really appreciate that they take reservations even for small groups. <br>Really like the space, it&#39;s split amongst 3 floors and each feels a little different. There were families and groups of friends filling all the tables. <br>The food was delicious. We shared a plate of donuts - light with espresso sugar and lemon curd. They also do an assortment plate of scones and coffee cakes, will have to try next time. Our mains in our group included Huevos Rancheros with perfectly cooked poached eggs, black beans, guacamole, salsa, tortilla and cheese - potatoes on he side. Smith Breakfast for a standard breakfast including fresh thick cut toast. And the brisket hash, topped with poached eggs, potatoes and bearnaise sauce. <br>Service was very friendly. <br>We will definitely go again.",

They were participating in Winterlicious and I was told by my boss that I just had to go there. As soon as I enter I couldn&#39;t help but notice how packed the place was. My initial thought was &#34;Do they even have table for my reservation?&#34; As soon as I said my name they knew exactly who I was and brought my friend and I to our seats. We were seated at a table that could fit 4 even though we were only 2. It was nice to have the extra room.<br><br>For my appetizer I ordered the Kolokithokeftedes (zucchini croquettes with feta, kefalograviera cheese and fresh herbs).The cheese just melted in your mouth and gave you a burst of flavour. For my main I decided on the Olympus Chicken Breast (chicken supreme topped with feta cheese, button mushrooms, and rosemary cream sauce. They were served with new mini potatoes and pan seared veggies. Initially I thought the chicken would be stuffed with the feta but realized it was part of the sauce. The chicken was tasty but towards the middle got a little dry. For desert I enjoyed the Karidopita (Honey walnut cake). I asked my Greek friend if this place reminded her of home cooked meal, she responded &#34;To the T&#34; <br><br>I also noticed a few of the servers looked alike, probably sisters or something. Definitely related! What I also liked was when I went to use the restrooms they had installed toilet seats that have built in protective plastic that u change before using. <br>I would go back for sure to try some of their other dishes.",

We were seated within 15 minutes and although the restaurant was packed you didn&#39;t need to raise your voice to have a conversation with the people you were sitting with and didn&#39;t feel like you were eavesdropping into everyone else&#39;s conversation.<br><br>There is a stone oven in the back so all three of us ordered pizza. We were all very satisfied with the quality of the pizza. One of us ordered soup as an appetizer and received a good size, hardy bowl with tons of vegetables. Prices are average at about $10/entrée and the pizza was a size that I felt full but not overly when we left.<br><br>If you are looking for good, everyday Italian food, this place fits the bill.",

Let your imagination run wild.<br><br>The small buffet setup they have is surprisingly decent, though obviously not the main attraction. I was disappointed the last time I went and they didn&#39;t have the pork belly slices. <br><br>Pro Tip: the water they use to help the stir-fry cook really dilutes the taste so don&#39;t be afraid to go heavy on the sauces and seasonings.",

"reviewcomment":"I went to Sushi D for my birthday this past weekend and noticed they cleaned the light switch that I mentioned in my previous review so the operators of Sushi D must be keeping an eye out on the reviews on Yelp. Table was also cleaner (no more bad smell) but still a little grimy. Sishi D tip: use a little bit of white vinegar and water at the end of the day to clean your tables. It will cut the grime and grease off the table and neutralize odours. The vinegar smell will be gone by morning.<br><br>Anyways, service was better than usual. Waitress was a little more attentive but still not that great in terms of service. The man who brought out some of our orders and cleared some dishes was a little more talkative and polite. An improvement... but still needs some work. <br><br>Food quality was still consistently good and tasty. Portions were generous for things like the rock shrimp and orders came out fast. Well done.<br><br>Sushi D has improved a bit since my last review. I hope they continue improving their service and maintain their food quality.",

"reviewcomment":"I only ate at the sushi bar (conveyor belt sushi) instead of doing the a la carte and eating inside at a table, and I am so glad I did.<br><br>PRESENTATION: They replaced the industrial looking conveyor belt with a motorized stream of water that flows at a quick pace, where wooden boats that are hooked onto each other travel down the rotating stream, carrying two plates each. Each plate is covered with a plastic cover, so that it remains hygenic while it makes its rounds along the bar.<br><br>PRICING: Plates range from $3 to as much as $7 per plate, and each price point uses a different plate design. You will see sample plates with clearly labelled pricing in a trail of boats, so do not worry about not knowing the price of what you eat. <br><br>PORTIONS: Each plate generally carries 3 tiny pieces of maki or 3 pieces of sashimi or 2 nigiris (sushi). The plates can also carry a small portion of Japanese dessert. <br><br>THE GOOD: Beautiful interior design, great service, great presentation by replacing the conveyor belt with the stream of boats. Pricing is very obvious, and they are not trying to trick you with prices. Most of all, it a lot of fun to watch the boats go by, and watch the empty spots  being replaced with different nigiris, makis and sashimi. They have quite a selection hidden up their sleeves. Your eyes will be very happy. You almost feel like a child, because you are thinking that you should grab that plate before it disappears! You feel a little regretful if you did not grab something the first time and you are waiting for it, and you realise it is gone by the time it comes back to you because someone else took it! For me, it was all part of the fun.<br><br>THE BAD: The quality of the food. Sashimi was not fresh, and in fact, it was warm. When I ate it, the flesh of the fish was not at all supple and it tasted of nothing; meaning it was not fresh. Makis are also not very good...I tried the spicy tuna...it only had avocado and tuna, and as someone mentioned before, the spicy sauce was literally mayo and sriracha mixed together....ew. <br>Also, they do not label anything, so if you do not know much about sushi and Japanese desserts, you are in a bit of a pickle.<br>Another thing is, you have to go at the right time, which can depend on the day. I went at 7, and there were only a few people at the bar. By the time I left, more people had come, and that is when it started to get really fun, because dishes disappear quickly and they are putting out new things you have not seen before. I was kind of angry that when I was there, they were putting out all the same ordinary things like tuna, salmon, escolar, and when I was about to leave, that is when they started putting out more variety, like mackerel and eel. I do not understand why they were saving the eel all this time...it is very popular...<br><br>I would say this is a great place to go with a date or for a fancy birthday dinner for 2 or 3 people. I would honestly never come back here unless I wanted to wow someone with the novelty of sushi on a boat and fancy decor and superior service, because the food was honestly below average. However, I give 4 stars because they are executing something that you cannot find elsewhere in Toronto. It is worth a visit, and for me, it was worth the price for the experience (not the food, though).",

"reviewcomment":"Me and my companion went to Bodega for their Winterlicious 2014 Prix Fixe Dinner. Having a relatively forgettable experience at another restaurant for Winterlicious 2012, we skipped out on 2013 and hoped to turn things around for this year. Bodega ended up providing a fine experience overall with mostly good food, but a few problems here and there.<br><br>The decor of the restaurant was elegant - dim lights, white linens and all. The staff was courteous and did not make us feel the least bit out of place inside. The noise level was moderate, not intimate - as a large party was in the other room.<br><br>I ordered the Warm Goat Cheese Salad as an appetizer, Slow Roasted Beef Short Ribs for the main and the Almond Pear Tart for dessert. My partner had the French Onion Soup for an appetizer, the Grilled Fillet of Atlantic Salmon for a main and the Bread Pudding for dessert.<br><br>As a whole, one of the biggest issues I had during my experience with Winterlicious 2012 was the portion sizes being much too small - an app the size of an amuse, the main the size of an app, et cetera. At Bodega, I found the portion sizes much more appropriate for a dinner, leaving me full but not bloated. <br><br>The complimentary bread was warm, hearty and had a nice crusty exterior. I ate it without the butter provided and was quite happy with how it was made - likely baked the same day (though I&#39;m not sure if it was baked in-house or bought from a local bakery).<br><br>I love cheese. Just having the warm goat cheese salad in the menu was a slam dunk in pleasing me. The salad came with a few raspberries which visually popped and provided a nice sweetness and freshness to counterbalance the richness of the cheese and tartness of the vinaigrette. There were mixed microgreens, sprouts and a large slice of just-to-the-point-of-almost-melting goat cheese on top of it all. The salad was delicious but was just slightly imbalanced for my taste.<br><br>There were maybe three or four berries for the whole salad, causing me to portion them to ensure I had some of it in every bite. On the other side of the equation was the slice of goat cheese: it was quite large - I had a full quarter of the cheese leftover after I finished all the greens.There were also bacon bits, but they tasted quite ordinary and felt as though they were added to make the dish more familiar to people who don&#39;t eat fine dining. I finished it all, and it was ultimately a delicious plate of food that could&#39;ve been a bit more polished.<br><br>I tried a bit of the french onion soup and it probably just wasn&#39;t my cup of tea. The onion was strong and the melted cheese was strong, but the soup itself was very thin which felt strange to my palette. Perhaps with a slice of baguette to sponge up the soup or additional textural components and my opinion of it would be better.<br><br>My main was absolutely delicious - the jus was flavorful and plentiful. The meat was completely tender and well portioned - not to the point of belonging to a steakhouse or smokehouse but large enough for a proper meal. It came with some great vegetables with a nice balanced mix of tartness and sweetness and varying textures. The garlic mashed potatoes were nothing special, but nothing bad - loads of butter and a great creaminess and acted as a fine canvas to the other ingredients. Texturally engaging, flavorfully complex and well portioned, this main was divine.There were a few tiny bones throughout the meat, due to the nature of the cut of meat, but wasn&#39;t a particularly troubling issue for me.<br><br>The Almond Pear tart was served with a sabayon. The crust was thin but had a good snap to it. The portions of the tart with a bit of pear, almond and sabayon were a truly euphoric experience - something I would look forward to from the start of any meal. Unfortunately, those great bites were matched with equally dry and uninteresting bites of just almond and crust - with just a few slices of pear baked in and a paltry amount of sabayon served. If they were a bit more heavy handed with the sauce, things would have been perfect in my opinion, but the bites that chewed dry took away from the dessert as a whole. <br><br>Overall, it was a memorable night with an experience that I don&#39;t get to have very often with my price range and personal preferences. Some moments of the night really were spectacular whilst others were slightly disappointing. The food was delicious but lacked a bit of balance - especially in the salad and dessert. I may be a bit nit-picky in the review, but as the price of a meal goes up, so does my expectations of it. It&#39;s a great experience to have once in a while, but I can&#39;t see myself financially or preferentially doing this too often.<br><br>3.5 / 5, closer to a 4 than a 3.",

You&#39;re missing out if you don&#39;t sop up the garlic butter and some of those chorizo juices with the bread. <br><br>Main course is always a big garden salad (so simple yet so perfect, onion cucumber peppers iceberg and tomato in a house vinegarette) and the BBQ chicken with rice and potatoes. What on earth do they do to those potatoes to make them so delicious. They&#39;re perfectly cooked and that oil on them is delicious. Chicken is always nicely prepared with crispy skin and juicy meat. <br><br>To top everything off, and I mean I put it on everything, their peri peri sauce is not too spicy but certainly not mild.

"reviewcomment":"Joso&#39;s. *Dreamy sigh*<br><br>Seafood has been for some time now my &#34;safe&#34; dish, as in the dish I will order when all else fails. But Joso&#39;s brings it to a whole new level. I now understand why Drake sings about this place; it inspires tribute. This place is not cheap (expect $50 each at minimum), but it manages to be so good, you still get more than what you paid for.<br><br>First off, I knew it was going to be a good night when the seafood soup (with lovely morsels of white fish) was delicious. Best I ever had (Drake pun!). This is also the first time I&#39;ve seen a resto pull off a tomato-based broth that wasn&#39;t an overpriced and embellished version of minestrone. A-mazing.<br><br>For fish we got the Portuguese sole, and I was again blown away by Joso&#39;s ability to do something better than your imagination could. Grilled and seasoned to perfection, I literally do not think this could have been better done. <br><br>The risotto as many people have said is also quite good, and the squid ink sauce is both intriguingly novel and delicious. Perhaps not my favourite dish here though (for an Asian, I&#39;m not overly fond of rice), and I think that my stomach space would have been better used sampling more fish. It&#39;s also worth noting that the portion size is huge, and although it&#39;s supposed to serve 2-4, I really think that 4 is the minimum if you don&#39;t want the risotto to be your entire meal. <br><br>Overall, amazing. The service was lovely and the ambiance was sensual but classy, but the food is what I will dream of. I will be back whenever my wallet permits.",

"reviewcomment":"Another great dinner here tonight. Called last minute ( 7 people ) and they managed to get us right in to what appeared to be the only empty table. <br><br>Confession: our go to for these things is the keg mansion but after meeting there we were told it was a two hour wait. I couldn&#39;t have been happier when someone suggested five doors and called them up and they said come on up ! Reasons for choosing the keg : two of our party have hearing problems, decent food at decent prices, good service, easy parking, central to all family members. Reasons for choosing five doors: it&#39;s way freaking better!!!! My brother and I had the ribeye and while it&#39;s not the birthday cake size piece of meat you&#39;d get at the keg we both agreed that it was definitely much better than anything we had ever had there. Amazing flavour. Perfectly cooked super flavourful and ( a big plus in my books ) not stupid big ie not force yourself to finish size - who needs that?!?!   <br><br>If you&#39;re still reading here are the families&#39; favourites : grilled calamari, avocado bruschetta, the flat iron w Gorgonzola, the pork chop ( I&#39;ve has that at least 15 times - never disappoints ), the ribeye ( have this the first time you go and you will be back to try more ). A word of advice - portions are generous so pace yourself. I&#39;m not a big eater though so don&#39;t let me hold you back if you wanna go nuts !  If it&#39;s two of us we usually share an app then get two mains and a side to share. <br><br>In a barren landscape of overwrought and underskilled restaurants ( yes quince, coquine,grano, grazie ,la vecchia and all you other overdone pretentious dumps I am looking straight at you ! ) five doors is a breath of fresh air that delivers a great meal every time. Go early go late just go.",

"reviewcomment":"When you&#39;re at Yonge and Eglinton there&#39;s a lot of food options in the area.  Places that are new or have been a neighborhood gem, The Duke of Kent (DOK) is a local landmark...or think of it as that show called CHEERS...but in uptown T.O. <br>First off this place is jammed packed, my broski and I were lucky enough to find a booth on the 2nd floor  of this pub. Though it was crowded the DOK is a warm, cozy, socially loud place where everyone comes to drink....eat...socialize...and play. But keep in mind after 6:30-7 seat availability may vary.<br><br>Our server was politely efficient. ..and chilled out...and knew his drinks, and food which is IMPORTANT in my books.  He was able to provide us recommendations, what types of foods we liked, how hungry we were?, chicken, beef? etc. etc.<br>after it was all said and done we made a decision.<br><br>The food....we both couldn&#39;t help not noticing their Caesar Steak n Fries.....lol $16.99...not bad at all...only drawback..my steak was medium rather than medium rare...oh well.  PORTION was satisfying. ..drinks complimented the meal....over ambiance is chill....and peeps are friendly....my Yonge n Eg joint aside from Spacco lol<br><br>Solid 4!!!",

I got half a sandwich and a portion of pasta.Finished my meal in less than 10 mins.<br>Their tasty looking treats caught my eyes and I had to have one. I got a Cinnamon Crunch pastry. It was too delicious for words. <br>My cashier was so friendly and helpful.<br>My only issue was with the cost. I spent over $15. Ouch!!! Too much for lunch time, and for half a sandwich and such a small serving of pasta. But it was so good, I will return but I&#39;ll order something else maybe just a sandwich on its&#39; own.",

"reviewcomment":"Vesuvio&#39;s has been well loved by those in the neighbourhood for a long time... a long, long time. They opened in 1957 and we&#39;ve been eating there for 7 years! This Italian-American restaurant offers some wonderful comfort foods, this isn&#39;t high-end Italian, it&#39;s more what you&#39;d find at an Italian family&#39;s home in Brooklyn, simple but rich in flavors and delicious. We find the prices quite reasonable, both for food and wine. We&#39;ll go over delivery and dine-in.<br><br>Delivery:<br>The delivery is delicious! Big portions of pasta: I love their Ravioli, Gnocchi and Tortellini. You can get your choice of sauces (meat balls, rose, pesto, frutta di mare, clam or alfredo). There&#39;s also lasagna so big one person never manages to finish it, Canneloni and Manicotti. The sandwiches are huge, we&#39;ve only ever had the veal cutlet and have no need to try the others because we love this one. The thin-crust pizza uses fantastic cheese and tomato sauce, and all the ingredients are fresh. Even a straight up pepperoni is wonderful, they curl up and blacken around the edges a bit, giving a bit of crunch when you bite in and forming lovely pockets of grease that explode with awesome flavor. We day-dream about their pepperoni. We&#39;re a huge fan of their Volcano pizza, hot peppers, hot capicollo and hot Italian sausage. For 7 years We&#39;ve ordered the delivery and will admit that sometimes the delivery men can be a bit off-putting but most of the time they&#39;re fine. The delivery here is crazy busy, so you might want to avoid the typical rush times. If you want to guarantee the pizza is as hot as possible consider pick-up, but you have to find street parking. We tend to tag team, one person drives the other runs in and grabs the pizza! It&#39;s just so popular you really gotta get it down to an art.<br><br>The Restaurant:<br>We&#39;ve only recently just stepped foot into the restaurant itself, I&#39;ve been so addicted to the delivery we never got around to it. The ambiance is a casual, and pretty, not a bad place for a casual date as it has charm. They seem to have a lot of specials on the weekends. Even on days where everything else in the neighborhood is slow this place is humming with activity.<br><br>Appy&#39;s: Bruschetta is unique here, they take a very fresh tasting approach. The tomatoes are diced and drizzled with olive oil at the end, so it&#39;s not wet, and the fresh taste of the tomato really comes through. Parmesan is freshly grated on and instead of basil they use parsley, again adding to that garden fresh taste. The crostini was perfect, great baguette nicely toasted and still soft and hot on the inside. The spiced olives are MARVELOUS. They&#39;re done in-house and have a lovely spicy kick to them, with bits of rosemary. We adored these!<br><br>Entree: So far we&#39;ve only had the veal while eating in, and will update the review once I&#39;ve had more. We can say the veal was good quality and well cooked, with generous portions. The lemon butter sauce is well balanced, too many places over-do the lemon, but not here! Shrimp is cooked perfectly, still crunchy and naturally sweet. The scaloppini is prepared with two kinds of mushrooms and was delicious, loved the sauce and there&#39;s lot of sauce so make sure you get some bread for mopping. We did find the sauce a touch acidic, but nothing a nice bold red wine doesn&#39;t round out. The veggies are cooked properly, they&#39;re heated through but still crunchy. The potatoes ARE AWESOME! They&#39;ve got a great garlic flavour and roasted to the point of being caramelized, so so so good.",

"reviewcomment":"Wow. Often I expect vegetarian food to be unfilling, or bland, but that was not the case at Rawlicious.<br><br>We got the smoothie and it was delicious! I think the Cream Avocado something? The fresh spring rolls were alright too but not really anything special though the sauce was really good. My SO and I shared the soft tacos and it was soo good. Surprisingly filling and flavorful! We got the Ginger Date dressing on the salad also, which again, delish. For dessert we shared a key lime tart.<br><br>Overall I found myself pleasantly surprised by their food. The tacos are a perfect example of fantastic vegetarian food without lame-o tofu/seitan meat substitutes. <br><br>My favorite part about my meal was that afterwards my stomach was full but I walked out without feeling gross, haha. I definitely think I&#39;ll be making a stop to their locations sometime in the near future.<br><br>Aside from the food the service was great, though we were the only ones in the restaurant at the time. Some people however may find a bit pricey  but eating their food, you know everything was made fresh. This place is definitely worth it. :)",

"reviewcomment":"I have been following the owner of this restaurant from his Fidel Gastro food truck days!! Food was never a disappointment then. So when I heard he was opening up a restaurant on Queen West i was thrilled.<br><br>My boyfriend and I came here for the first time about 6 months ago and instantly fell in love with the decor and sort of communal seating. The manager greeted us right away and was so friendly, we told him all about ourselves and he recommended some drinks and food items. <br><br>Their menu is always changing but a classic and must have at Lisa Marie is the PAD THAI fries. So delicious and like nothing you&#39;ve ever tasted before. We&#39;ve tried about 3 different menus and most of the things on there. I trust his food decisions, so I try as much as I can. My favourite so far, beef cheek ravioli... mmmm and for dessert, the decadent Elvis in a jar. <br><br>This place is not where you go on a diet!! So much fun on the weekends, good food, great drinks and after 10:30, they have a live dj so amazing atmosphere!",

Oh and did I mention the tacos are amazing? <br><br>There&#39;s a wall of the day&#39;s specials and I&#39;d highly recommend the Baja Fish Tacos; crunchy, savory and flavorful. Only word of advice, get a reservation and make sure to order at least three tacos, as they&#39;re a bit on the smaller side.<br><br>If you&#39;re out with friends or looking for a good place to start your night, Barrio is always a stellar choice. Highly recommend it, tacos fan or no, it&#39;s delicious all the way &#39;round.",

We got our entrees and finished it before we got our appetizer spring roll. <br><br>Aside from the service, the food was good, you get what you pay for in terms of quality (was a little on the expensive side compared to other pho places).

"reviewcomment":"My favorite Vietnamese restaurant in Toronto. The BBQ vermicelli (pork and beef is my favorite) is amazing and is constructed very simply, but is done so well. The pho is absolutely delicious with no MSG from what I can tell. It is aggressively seasoned with star anise, but I really enjoyed it. For me the strong star anise flavor is what made the pho very unique compared to most places. <br><br>In addition, the portion sizes are great considering the price and the place is relatively clean (except the washrooms - atypical of most Vietnamese restaurants). <br><br>Finally, what really stood out the most about this restaurant is the front is run by an extremely friendly father and son combo that provided great friendly service. <br><br>This is my goto Vietnamese restaurant and I refuse to go anywhere else!

"reviewcomment":"It has taken me 5 years to write this review. lol...well 5 years on my first visit...and our last visit last year. Weve been a little busy but im glad i can finally do this.<br><br>Me and my now husband had our first blnd date here 5 years ago. We had such a fantastic first date, we must have spent 3 or 4 hours here. We shared 2 bottles of wine (Tini &amp; Fat Bastard) and a bunch of appaetizers. Needless to say, we obviously fell in love and our relationship grew to more date nights and foodie adventures - but we have a special place in our hearts for this place. <br><br>We returned last summer and we had the idea of doign some of our engagement shoots here in this space. I emailed the restaurant and told them about our story and how we had our first date here... we asked if it wa sokay if we scould bring in our photographer and videographer and if we could re-do the date by ordering the same wine etc. <br>When we arrived we were happily greeted by the staff, who were soo friendly and amused by our entourage of cameras. The waitress brought over a complimentary bottle of bubbly and glasses for everyone. We also ordered a pitcher of beer for the crew (it was a hot humid toronto summer day) and everyone was so helpful. After the shoot we ordered food and proceeded to just hang out. <br><br>This restaurant is awesome. A wonderful place for a first date -- not too stuffy feeling, casual, great food and a fantastic wine list and beer list. The location is ideal and the service is wonderful. :) Thanks guys for everything!",

"reviewcomment":"So I have a terrible confession to make: I hate fine dining. <br><br>Okay, that&#39;s not exactly true or fair. I guess it would be more accurate to say that I fear fine dining, that it makes me quite uncomfortable and gives great anxiety. But it&#39;s not for the reasons why most people would prefer Applebee&#39;s to five star French haute cuisine. You see, I love getting dressed up and I relish in perusing an expansive wine list. I like trying new dishes and I&#39;m fairly confident in my ability to pronounce all of those items on the menu with the fancy names and actually know what they are. So why do these types of restaurants fill me with dread? I&#39;m a vegetarian. <br><br>Glance at the menu at pretty much any fine dining establishment and you&#39;ll be hard pressed to find anything meatless. Even most of the salads are a no-no! Now I know that any good chef should be able to accommodate any patron but I&#39;ve been told (by fairly reputable sources) that a lot of them don&#39;t care much for us crazy non-carnivores. That and the fact that I also hate having to ask for substitutions or order off the menu or whathaveyou. I don&#39;t want to cause any trouble even if I am a paying customer! <br><br>So you can probably guess that a place like Mark McEwan&#39;s North 44 wouldn&#39;t be my first choice, despite its impressive pedigree. My girlfriend actually took me here as a surprise treat and although I suffered a mini panic attack as soon as I looked at the menu (the food, not the prices...she was paying, after all!) I&#39;m happy to say that North 44 may have helped alleviate some of my fine dining fears: it was a fantastic dining experience. <br><br>The service was excellent, not too aggressive, nor too inattentive. Both the chef and our server also made sure that my dietary restrictions were attended to by providing some of those dreaded off-menu options...my lady had called ahead to warn them that I (a scary vegetarian) was coming. The chef prepared a gnocchi in cream sauce dish, which was simply phenomenal. They&#39;re usually one of those things that I like well enough but have never been crazy about. These, however, were cooked to perfection...just the right colour and texture. They almost literally melted in my mouth. Far too often gnocchi are too heavy and doughy. This was most certainly not the case here. Perfection.<br><br>While I may not be crazy about gnocchi (or at least wasn&#39;t up &#39;til this point) I am huge fan of crème brûlée (the Cadillac of desserts) and this was among the best I&#39;ve ever had. It was a coconut crème brûlée and I&#39;m always a tad apprehensive when it comes to the flavoured variety. But in this case the coconut was just subtle enough so as not to overwhelm the custard itself. Again, the consistency was spot on and the dish was beautifully plated. <br><br>I would be remiss if I didn&#39;t mention my apéritif, their &#34;Knob Creek Sour&#34;, which was also masterful...one of the best whiskey (or Bourbon in this case) sours I&#39;ve ever had. My girlfriend had the streak for dinner, cooked rare and she enjoyed her meal as much as I did. <br><br>Now I&#39;m not sure what the bill came to (and I&#39;m not sure I want to know) but I think North 44 is a pretty safe recommendation...even for scaredy cat vegetarians like me.",

It&#39;s never that kind of chewy, not so fresh tasting stuff I seemed to get most of the time when I used to order from other sushi places.<br><br>Beyond that, their seaweed salad is fantastic and very well portioned, their gyoza is perfectly crisp every time (and dirt cheap at $2.50 for an order of 5), and they have green tea ice cream, yum!<br><br>Delivery times are great as well, usually within 25 to my area. They quote 45 minutes, but have only ever once taken that long during that bit of a storm we had yesterday.

It&#39;s really a good place to grab a quick affordable meal... It&#39;s fast food, but not deep fried! Today I was craving something like a banh mi, but without the bread... and low and behold, I found they had a spicy beef papaya salad. And I thought that&#39;ll do! The salad is really reasonable at 4.85 and it totally hit the spot. Crunchy green papaya, carrot, spicy beef, crushed peanuts... Mmmm. In the past I have opted for the spicy beef and lemongrass on rice as well. The spicy beef anything there I am sure is good. In the past I didn&#39;t love the spring rolls. The banh mis are cheap and filling, though I&#39;d rather go to banh mi boys.",

"reviewcomment":"If you&#39;re going to splurge, you could do far worse than Café Boulud. Some of the seating here is novel yet practical - one-sided booths make it easy to share with a partner, which can come in handy. The rest of the seating looks inspired by office decor and undercuts the prestige associated with the FS brand. <br><br>The tapas-based menu makes it easy to try a few things without donning buffet pants but you might need to order extra if you arrive with a big appetite.  Everything we had was good. Gluten free bread is provided upon request. I&#39;d give an extra star if they weren&#39;t so fully onboard the tapas trend bandwagon. Sometimes when it&#39;s -30 winter weather, heartier fare seems more appropriate.",

"reviewcomment":"I came here with a few friends after dinner on Friday night, and we can&#39;t wait to come back again!<br><br>Roll Play Cafe has a minimum charge of $10 per person. They offer a variety of food options from soups to salads to sandwiches to pizzas. As for drinks, they have hot tea, Italian sodas, bottled sodas, and even beer. Despite the minimum, they have a 2-hour limit when it gets busy, and it was surprisingly quite busy on a cold and rainy Friday night.<br><br>The 4 of us each ordered a drink, and the High Roller Nachos to share. I enjoyed my bottled cream soda, but the nachos could have been better. I doubt I will order it again, but I don&#39;t mind giving their pizzas and sandwiches a try next time.<br><br>The cafe is a lot bigger than I had expected. It is very spacious, bright, and welcoming, but bigger tables for our game(s) + food + drinks would be great. ;) The variety of board and card games is decent, but I noticed some of the games were a little worn out.<br><br>We enjoyed our time here, and we&#39;re glad it is close to our workplace. I am sure we will be back soon!",

"reviewcomment":"Ate here on a Friday night with a friend and it was a good time. We enjoyed the $26.99 all you can eat premium tasting menu. It was probably one of the best AYCE places I have ever been to. I started off with the mango salad and my friend had the hot and sour soup. Both were great. Our favorite starter was the triple cheese dumplings which was a flaky crab and cheese filled pastry.<br><br>I had the sashimi which was good although the pieces were cut too thick for my liking. The presentation for each dish was always beautiful.<br><br>I really like the size of the main courses which were just enough so that you could try various things. I had the lamb chop. We finished things off with green tea  and coconut ice cream.<br><br>Oh and we also had wine. A bottle of 2013 sauvignon blanc cost us $25, which was reasonable. <br><br>Overall I would say it was a really enjoyable night with lots of great food in a nice atmosphere for the price paid. Definitely going to go back!!",

"reviewcomment":"Finally opt-ed to dine in on a Saturday night. Not bad if you arrive before 6pm - we only waited about 30mins at the bar which is never crowded. After that, the wait is at least an hour, and no they don&#39;t take reservations. But ppl will stand in line for hours, you&#39;ll see :) This place is that good, if you like home style food. Presentation is not fancy, but big portions, everything under $10. I found their wine is really expensive - $29 for a litre or bottle. <br><br>Foods to try: pasta alla bolognese, linguine al pescatore (with shrimp, lots of mussels, and other seafood) and calamari appetizer - so lightly breaded with a delicious warm sauce on the side.<br><br>I&#39;m pretty sure their pasta is fresh, made from home.

"reviewcomment":"It&#39;s expensive enough that we only eat here on special occasions, like my wife passing a big exam with flying colors at graduate school.<br>The wait-staff are friendly, smart and casual. The decor is laid back, the music a tad too loud. But it&#39;s still comfy.<br>The food is excellent. Dishes are quite original, even though most are based on pasta. There are many ways to verify the authentic Italian approach to cooking; one is that red meat is not central to any dish. Healthy fats -- the olive oil served with bread is a knock-out -- prevail, as do veggies.  <br>The place is a real tribute to local and sustainable, though they make no fuss about that. The owners are supporters of Local Food Plus and it shows in wine choices that are organic and local, as well as many ingredients. <br>The pasta is made in the kitchen by two pasta makers who come in four days a week -- talk about the local job creation that comes from local, sustainable unprocessed food!! In my book Food for City Building, I rant at length about how Toronto&#39;s restaurants could become major scenes of artisanal job creation, so there&#39;s no reason to rant anymore here.<br>Lots to enjoy and feel good about at Ascari",

"reviewcomment":"I&#39;ve been eating quite a bit of schnitzel as of late and I&#39;ve found myself growing disillusioned with the seemingly impossible-to-mess-up item. It seems like most of the time it arrives at the table room temperature with underwhelming breaking and tough meat.<br><br>Enter Country Style. In my opinion, these guys serve the best schnitzel in Toronto. It arrived at my table just a few minutes after I ordered it and it was as hot and fresh as one could imagine. Cooked to perfection, the schnitzel boasts a tasty breading and meat that&#39;s almost unbelievably soft and moist. You can cut your pieces with a fork!<br><br>We also tried the cucumber salad, which is essentially thinly sliced cucumbers in a sweet, tangy sauce. Very tasty. We closed out the meal with an apricot-filled crepe. I assumed it would be some previously-made crepe served right out of the fridge but it was actually fresh! The crepe itself was fantastic with a little bit of crust, while the apricot filling was perfectly tangy and delicious.<br><br>Service was excellent, although the restaurant&#39;s cash-only policy meant I had to head out in the rain to grab money from a bank machine. A minor hiccup in an otherwise flawless dining experience.",

"reviewcomment":"This has to be one of my favourite Toronto bars! I love how packed it always is, especially the dance floor. <br>I realize a lot of people would find that to be a fault, but I think it&#39;s part of what makes Gracie&#39;s so much fun! Everywhere you turn there&#39;s someone new to meet!<br><br>I&#39;ve been there more times than I can count and I&#39;ve never had a bad night! If I want to be guaranteed a fabulous night of dancing I go to Gracie&#39;s!<br><br>The live bands are always great and I sometimes forget in my drunken haze that I&#39;m listening to live music and not a recording, that&#39;s how good they are! <br><br>If you&#39;re female you will definitely have an easier time getting served at the packed bar, but while you wait you&#39;ve got interesting people surrounding you to pass the time.<br><br>The lines are sometimes long, but it&#39;s worth the wait and the $10-$15 cover, which varies each night.<br><br>The bathrooms are clean and well lit and there aren&#39;t usually line ups.<br><br>My only complaint is the bouncers at the end of the night, who have been very rude and aggressive on several occasions. But the staff inside the bar are always friendly!<br><br>If you&#39;re looking for a place to go with friends and dance the night away, this is the place to be! As long as you&#39;re not opposed to some country music and some popular 80&#39;s/90&#39;s covers!",

"reviewcomment":"I used to come to Torito a lot. When they first opened eight or nine years ago I was a huge fan. It was a warm, inviting and super fun place to eat, drink and make much merriment.<br><br>I&#39;ll confess that after 5 visits or so, I became bored with the menu because it didn&#39;t change. I was happy to find that they now take reservations and also have added a whole slew of new things to the menu while keeping some of the favourites such as Chick Pea and Spinach Stew (this is yummier than you can imagine) and the Steak with fried egg.<br><br>I will also say that I was hoping for the same hospitality to which I had been treated before. They don&#39;t rush you here and they know that tapas is about eating good food, having nice drinks and enjoying the company of those you&#39;re with. Their Sister restaurant, Carmen, failed at this and as a result I gave them a far lower rating than what the food deserved. I can cook at home and I serve tables all day at work, so when I go out, I want stuff I don&#39;t usually make at home and to be treated well. It&#39;s about the total experience.<br><br>Torito, despite not having as much culinary finesse as Carmen, was a wonderful night out and I&#39;d recommend it to anyone looking for romance, a night with the girls, or some casual cocktails and nibbles.<br><br>We began with a pitcher of the white sangria. We asked out server for suggestions and he confirmed a few of the dishes that we had been eyeing on the menu. The Sangria was a lot of apple, and not a lot of other fruit, but I liked the size and I liked the strength.<br><br>The octopus carpaccio was recommended by our server over the grilled octopus. It was delicious and almost creamy in texture with a whisper of pickled red onion and a couple of capers. I wasn&#39;t in love with the colour of the squid ink aoli, but the combination was delicious.<br><br>Almonds and dates covered in bacon were crunchy, oozy sweet and sexy. THIS is what Tapas really should be and the flavour profile had the punch to live up to it. You must oder these. If you happen to be a vegetarian, you should happen to take a night off and eat these wonderful morsels.<br><br>Shrimp were plump and served with a nice sauce which didn&#39;t rely strictly on garlic for taste.<br><br>Lamb meatballs were super tender nestled in a bright, zippy tomato sauce with both fresh mint and mint pesto. So delicious.<br><br>We had some cheese for dessert and a glass of wine each.<br><br>Then our amazing waiter topped off the night with some complimentary churros. <br><br>This place is not getting all 5 stars for the food, but it is far more similar to authentic Tapas than many other &#34;tapas&#39; places in Toronto that just want to charge you half the price of a main for a quarter serving size of food. Everything is always tasty and satisfying. <br><br>The service is warm and friendly and so is the environment. The pillows the decorate the brightly coloured benches say &#34;Stay, and enjoy our food and drinks!&#34; The music is never so loud that you can&#39;t have a conversation, but tuned up enough so that you may occasionally need to do a quick chair dance. Have fun and love life! THIS is the essence of Tapas.<br><br>I have never had anything less than an amazing time at Torito and now that there are still a few things on the menu I haven&#39;t tried, I&#39;ll be back.<br><br>And to all you Toronto diners, there is no need pay money to scarf back tacos and be treated like shit by your server. Wise up and quit being so hipster that you always have somewhere cooler to be than out for dinner with whomever you&#39;re with. And if you want a taco, go to a taco stand. <br><br>Or go to Torito and kick back for a couple of hours and enjoy!",

SO SO GOOD. I&#39;m the only gluten-free vegan in my family. But we all appreciate great food. And we all loved the food here. For raw food newbies - if you get a dish that&#39;s very dense, it&#39;s going to be a smaller portion. However, it will be just as filling, as it will be all nuts/seeds. If you&#39;re going for quantity - get a &#34;pasta&#34; dish. I had the burger today and it was amazing - and not something I&#39;d ever make at home. We all split the cheesecake and pumpkin pie - yums all around.<br><br>The only thing that could be better was the service speed. We were the only ones in the restaurant eating when I went with my family and it took forever to get the food. It seemed that the two servers were also making all the food, instead of a chef in the back. I&#39;m not sure whether this is standard for them - I don&#39;t remember it taking as long during the winterlicious dinner, so maybe not. On the plus side, more time for conversation (just don&#39;t come starving).",

"reviewcomment":"If you want your son, who hates shopping, to buy a raincoat, today was the day to take him out.<br><br>After a long walk along Queen Street (after a detour to buy glasses)  we were drenched and cold by the time we reached this restaurant.  The hot tea was a welcome respite to the weather.  Warm welcome by the server, with a relaxed pace of service for the 2:00 meal.<br><br>The Hot and Sour soup cut the chill, and was delicious as a starter.  Perfect heat in the spice department, piping hot from the temperature.  I would definitely order this again (although the vermicelli / hot and sour soup could be my next main here).  The portion size was also good.  A small, served as a appetizer, was enough to share for two.  I would rate this soup a 4/5, with an extra 0.5 for it warming our insides and settling us down for the meal.<br><br>The dumplings (steamed and pan fried), good (3/5), but I would skip these the next time, or dial up on the hot sauce.  We also had the spring roll, mango roll, with mango salad.  The pickled daikon / carrot in the salad had a great crunch and a great flavour (4/5). <br><br>For the mains, my son had the braised mock duck and vegetables.  As he stated, outstanding (5/5), and the flavour of the sauce on the tofu was spot on.  As a student, he doesn&#39;t splurge on food, but this dish made him think of Toronto for Grad School.<br><br>I had the Spicy Kung Bao Mock Chicken with vegetables and cashews.  I have to admit that the mock duck was better, but the chicken was also very good (4/5).<br><br>We also had the vermicelli noodles, Singapore style.  Very nicely done, and a good sized portion. <br><br>My son is a vegetarian, and I am a beefeater.  As other reviewers have commented, I didn&#39;t even miss the meat.  My son said it best &#34;It is great to have so many flavours at one sitting&#34;.<br><br>We had leftovers to take home (final verdict from my wife tonight), since we ordered so much food.<br><br>Service: 3/5<br>Food: 4/5<br>Watching my son devour so many dishes at one sitting and stating that it was awesome... Priceless.<br><br>Return Visit: You bet.",

Get another call.  They&#39;re at my condo again. (I&#39;m still at work). He grumbled slightly and said they&#39;d have to make it again.<br><br>6:45 rolls around.  Nothing. I call the restaurant after a few minutes to make sure there wasn&#39;t something weird going on- and our buzzer rings while I&#39;m on the phone.  He&#39;s here!<br><br>Head down.  Order isn&#39;t complete.  A whole pizza is missing.  He told me I only ordered two pizzas (incorrect) until he actually looked at the receipt.  He then proceeded to indirectly blame me for the the fact that three poor drivers have had to bear the blistering cold to bring me my pizzas and that the restaurant doesn&#39;t even look at the time on the receipt- just what&#39;s being ordered.  I didn&#39;t understand how that was my problem and I refused to a) be spoken to like that and b) pay for an incomplete order.  I told him to take it back to the restaurant because I didn&#39;t want it anymore.<br><br>I went back to my apartment and called the restaurant and explained what happen, and the nice lady put the owner on for me to speak with.  I told him what had gone on and even though I really didn&#39;t want the pizza anymore, he said he&#39;d deliver it to me himself and pretty much offered me anything extra I wanted- I told him he could surprise me with a dessert.<br><br>Well he did.  He brought the pizzas, 4 desserts and some calamari (holy crap) to me personally and apologized for the mix-up.  I felt horrible for him for having to deal with this, but was very thankful to receive such great, personal service.  It shows how much pride he really takes in his restaurant and that says a lot.<br><br>The food was incredible- I&#39;m actually in physical pain from eating so much of it so fast- it was that good.  I will order from them again in the future (if they&#39;ll let me) but will probably never order in advance again as that seems to be where the main issue was.  <br><br>Thank you!",

Aside from the solid &#39;Dog we were greeted by very friendly staff, and were also introduced to their delicious miniature donuts! We had a dozen each of the classic and the Nutella/Biscotti treats and they really did not disappoint. The warm, fluffy, and flavourful little fellas are a bargain at ~$5/dozen and will definitely lead me back to this corner of College St.",

"reviewcomment":"This is only my second time at this location. The last time was close to 20 years ago so you know it&#39;s a whole different place. <br><br>I wasn&#39;t overly impressed with it then, and I wasn&#39;t overly impressed this time either. <br><br>The service was very good. Waiter was attentive and mostly prompt (withy the exception of bringing our bills).<br><br>One of my biggest pet peaves is when a bar screws up an order of wings. I ordered baked medium and the came out sloppy and undercooked. I left 3 on the plate. Not a good experience. <br><br>The thing I was impressed with was the music and videos. We were there because we were heading to Massey Hall for a Dream Theater show. Low and behold - HRC was in the know because they prepared us for the night by playing several of their music videos. Nice touch. <br><br>I&#39;d go back for a drink, but prob not for dinner.",

"reviewcomment":"My girlfriends and I came here on a Sunday night and surprisingly it was decently busy. The restaurant don&#39;t take reservations for parties under 6 so we were lucky to get a table since the place isn&#39;t too big. <br>I have been to the Danforth location and the menu items looked the same. We decided to order 2 apps and an entree for each of us. The items we ordered:<br><br>Spicy grilled shrimp with this avocado salsa<br>Gorgonzola, strawberry and walnut spinach salad<br>Veal meatballs with a side of linguine <br>Orechiette pasta<br>Linguine with a rich tomato sauce and rapini<br><br>All the dishes were delicious and satisfying. The portions are actually really good for sharing. The flavours of each dish were well thought out and super tasty. I would say its Italian comfort food if there are such terms :)<br><br>The service was awesome and the servers are very attentive and knowledgeable. It was a really enjoyable evening with great food and atmosphere! <br><br>I definitely recommend this Italian restaurant and will be back again in the near future.",

"reviewcomment":"Shoop. Push It. Everybody knows Salt n Pepa belong together, and I had a lovely bestie date here with Matt M last weekend. He is the Salt to my Pepper, the butter to my bread, the Ann Perkins to my Leslie Knope. <br><br>We started with their smoked cedar Manhattan, which sounds over-the-top and douche-y but it was tasty and a pretty average price for a fancy cocktail on the strip -- much cheaper than BarChef or somewhere cooking up something similar. <br><br>We then ordered a bottle of the reserve cava. Because treat yo&#39;self. It was delicious, but to be honest I can&#39;t tell the difference between a $90 bottle of Cava or a $20, so I should probably keep the plastic in my pocket and go for the cheaper option next time. To eat we had the cheese board and beat salad followed by the duck confit, which was like poultry candy. All delish. <br><br>The tables for two are spaced a little too close together for my liking. The date sitting next to us was the wooo-oorst and constantly looked at our fun with disdain, which only made us more fun. <br><br>This review was fully powered by bestie Parks and Rec binge watching. <br><br>#jeanralpheoforlife",

"reviewcomment":"This little Parkdale gem is fantastic. Went there with 2 friends, one of them being a regular there (I&#39;m talking twice a week type thing) and the service was flawless from the moment we walked in through to paying the bill. <br>But it&#39;s the food that takes the cake here: we ordered several dishes to share and every one of them was fantastic! The spicy popcorn shrimp was a concoction of shrimp with actual popcorn breading and delivered little glorious explosions of flavour to your taste buds. <br>Next, the beef tartare was such an epicurean orgasm that I think it ruined any other tartare in the city for me - I&#39;ve never tasted anything like that. Spicy, fresh and tender to no end, it was delightful. <br>The torched scallops melted on your tongue and delivered just the right amount of zing from the ginger and scallion. <br>The pièce de résistance, however, was the lettuce meal. Meat so soft you could take it apart with a dull spoon and the house pickles and sauces were to die for. <br>Can&#39;t wait to go back!",

"reviewcomment":"My co-workers and I stumbled upon this tiny restaurant hidden in what looks like fancy townhouses. The restaurant was packed when we arrived, so we ordered to go. I ordered the Parisien ($9), which is a baguette with ham, swiss, dijon, arugula, and pickles. If you order to go, you don&#39;t get the side salad :( The baguette was amazingly good because it tasted fresh. The desserts in the dessert display looked very tempting. My co-workers ordered the almond croissant and said it was really good. I was eyeing the Paris-Brest. The wait-staff speak French, so you know it&#39;s authentic :)<br><br>Would I come back? Definitely. I&#39;ll stay next time for the side salad.",

"reviewcomment":"Came here Tuesday for a bite to eat with a friend. He&#39;s been raving about the place, saying its a great and classy Indian place. It was a miserable day outside and I arrived 30 minutes before he did so I had to content myself with a chai tea and my book, while waiting for him. There were three staff on duty and no other customers. <br><br>Eventually another table came in and my friend waltzed in at around 12:10. We ordered the Crab Cakes with Raspberry to start.  (this would not have been my choice, I would have been much more inclined to go for the Samosas or Pakoras) That being said, the crab was nicely executed, with a nice freshness and a sauce, that while sweet, did not overpower the crab. There was also a nice garnish of what seemed like long grains of some kind of wheat. 7/10<br><br>For my main, I ordered the Veal Tikka after I specified I wanted something mild and my friend, the Lamb Korma (or Qourma on their menu). We also got two orders of Nan. The Veal was good with alot of subtle flavour and good amount of spice. Certainly not as greasy as some Indian I&#39;ve had. <br><br>The Qourma was the real stand out. A great blend of spice, sweet and good quality meat. Too bad I ordered something different<br><br>I will be back when I feel like coughing up the extra $$$$ for Babur. It is a few dollars more than most of the Indian Places I frequent.<br><br>7/10",

"reviewcomment":"I picked up a veal and eggplant parmigiana sandwich the other day and I was impressed. $8 gets you a huge sandwich that&#39;s guaranteed to satiate even the largest of appetites. <br><br>I went during off-peak hours, so the line wasn&#39;t too bad. There was a line of approximately 10 people an hour earlier. Even with the line, service is pretty quick and efficient. Friendly? Maybe not so much. <br><br>I believe Uno Mustachio excels in its breading and deep frying. Both the veal and eggplant are thinly sliced and breaded. They maintain excellent crunch without being too greasy.<br><br>Like others have mentioned, I&#39;d opt-in for the hot peppers. They really add a much appreciated heat element to the sandwich. The peppers also add some moisture to the sandwich. A common minor complaint is that the sandwich is a bit on dry side. Asking for peppers or extra sauce helps.<br><br>Overall, a very good parmigiana sandwich. I don&#39;t think it gets much better. I still give the nod to California Sandwiches, since I enjoy their red sauce and freshness. Sometimes I feel the sandwiches at Uno Mustachio end up sitting under the heat lamp and lose some flavor as a result. Try to get a fresh one.",

"reviewcomment":"This is a great little family run Mexican restaurant with good Mexican food. The food is good and the service is very friendly. <br><br>We started with the fried plantain appetizers, and they were not bad and not great (just ok). I have had much better. (Julie&#39;s Cuban cafe has fantastic fried sweet plantains, aka tostones. No one in the city makes them like Julie&#39;s! They&#39;re supposed to be sweet and caramelized. The ones at Mexitaco were a bit on the dry/bland side.<br><br>We ordered the flautas (one order beef and another vegetarian) as well as a spicy diablo enchilada dish. The flautas were great! Very tasty! The diablo chicken was very tasty as well but it was very spicy! So make sure to ask your server if you can&#39;t stand a lot of heat. We forgot to ask the server about the heat factor with the diablo spice.<br><br>To finish off our meal, we ordered Mexican fried ice-cream. It was not good. I was disappointed. I have had much better fried ice cream. This one wasn&#39;t even covered in a dough like it was supposed to be covered. It tasted like bland vanilla ice cream with corn flakes on top.  I would not order it ever again. They need to seriously fix their dessert menu portion. <br><br>All in all, I will definitely return to this place for the food. They&#39;re food is tasty depending on what you order. Their tacos and main platters are very good. I would stay away from dessert and some appetizers. Not many restaurants have a perfect track record and this one definitely needs some tweaking here and there, but I love this place regardless and truly enjoyed my meal and will definitely go back again.",

"reviewcomment":"Came here for the first time today and had brunch with my husband and our four-year-old daughter. I don&#39;t know if The Emerson is a kid-friendly place in general -- or if they want to be known as such -- but they couldn&#39;t have been nicer to us.<br><br>More importantly, the food was amazing. My husband had the hash, complete with a perfectly smoky and fiery pepper; I had the lamb shank benny (ON BISCUITS; so good) with a great hollandaise; and my daughter had the blueberry-and-lemon pancakes topped with wonderful, juicy blueberries, which she loved. The amount of food was just right, but we (and everyone else in the place at the time) were also given brown butter banana bread on the house and we did not refuse. A lovely and delicious surprise.<br><br>We never felt rushed; the music and decor were pleasant; our server was friendly and even brought markers and paper for our daughter when she realized that my kid would need to be occupied while I finished my food (really thoughtful!); and even the bathrooms were cool.<br><br>Judging by some of the other reviews, this level of food and service is the norm at The Emerson. Can&#39;t wait to return for dinner (child-free; don&#39;t worry, everyone)!",

I&#39;ve been here a few times and have no complaints. Of course the restaurant is huge and you can feel small in an impersonalized setting. But who you are with makes all the difference.<br><br>I came her with a girlfriend and after our girly drinks and our pasta dinners, we had such a long, fun conversation. We were never rushed or expected to leave. Why would they? They have ample real estate to accommodate walk-ins!<br><br>I enjoy coming here equally with large groups and small groups of 2.",

"reviewcomment":"We had a good dinner experience here.  The place was very crowded on a Saturday night but they were able to get us seated shortly after our reservation time.  No big deal.<br><br>The food was very good and interesting.  Complaints about serving sizes are justified, however.  The prices are not cheap and the serving sizes are relatively small.  I would definitely be concerned about coming here if I was starving.  This is more appropriate if you want a small amount of nice food.  There&#39;s nothing wrong with that, but if you come expecting something else you&#39;ll be disappointed.<br><br>Would also like to see a stronger beer list.  But this is nit picking, they have nice wines and that&#39;s their thing so again, it&#39;s not really fair to complain that the wine bar doesn&#39;t have good enough beer.<br><br>So - to enjoy, be prepared to spend, be prepared for &#34;elegantly&#34; sized portions, be prepared to have wine not beer.",

Servers were great and claimed to have invented a cocktail that day which were awesome (also makes you feel hip that you are trying something that was supposedly just invented).<br><br>Korean Fried Chicken - unreal. Just the right amount of spice...very very tasty.<br>Fish Board - interesting flavours. Some parts of it were better than others, but overall a unique plate.<br>Gnocchi - Real good. Full of flavour.<br><br>I would definitely recommend this spot. Rather reasonable as well, the three items above split between two filled us up and were all between 15-20. Has a pretty diverse menu so something for everyone.",

I have tried a few different options off the menu, mainly the 1/4 chicken or the 2-piece chicken fingers. On hungrier days, I ordered the 1/2 chicken or the 4-piece chicken fingers. For sides, I usually get the fries or the mac and cheese. I&#39;ve heard that the candied yams and the potato salad are good. I have also tried the chicken schnitzel, but not a huge fan. The pulled chicken sandwich is very good.<br><br>The Chickery can get very busy during the noon lunch hour.

Cash only. <br><br>This Vietnamese place feels and tastes Southern. I prefer Southern Vietnamese cuisine rather than mid or Northern styles which tend to be Chinese-influenced and less flavourful (but ironically, one of the favoured dishes ordered here is their Hue style pho--nice and spicy!). <br><br>It&#39;s Southern and authentic. The nuoc mam pha (fish sauce) tastes as it should; blended with lime and a swirl of garlic chill in it--thank you. Places that serve you sweet fish sauce are doing you wrong, People!<br><br>It has a multi-dish item on the menu--some refer to this as &#34;make your own fresh rolls&#34; as it comes with rice paper, stuffings, and fixings: spring rolls, meats--including shrimp grilled on cane sugar--rice noodles, bean sprouts, shredded carrots, sliced cucumber, and herbs. It&#39;s sort of a deconstructed noodle bowl. You make a little wrap from the softened rice paper which you dip or sprinkle with nuoc mam pha. I usually also cradle my wrap inside of a piece of lettuce. <br><br>My mother calls this &#34;eating country style&#34;--this is a great dish to share among friends and wonderful especially in the summer.<br><br>If I don&#39;t get this (is it called Banh Hoi?), I get the bun (vermicelli bowl). It&#39;s got all the stuffs in it: herbs, rice noodles, shredded carrot, cucumber, spring rolls and/or grilled meats. There&#39;s a meatless option with tofu &amp; garlicy Chinese broccoli bun: quite lovely--lots of greens in there.",

"reviewcomment":"I&#39;ve been here twice, with the same group.  Such an ideal spot for pre-Ossington theatre dinner.  The first time, we loved the food, the wine list, the service, etc....but we were in a bit of a rush.  We knew we were on to something, so we re-booked for an evening where we didn&#39;t have to rush.  <br>The wine menu is good, well-priced and lots of selection (or maybe its just stocked with my favourites).  We ordered a bottle and settled in to look at the menu.  So many choices!  We tried to have items that we didn&#39;t have the first time - we loved every item from the first time, but wanted to explore beyond.  Our server, Monica, was such fun and made great recommendations for us.  However, I really feel that you couldn&#39;t go wrong with much on the menu.  There were a few stand out items for us - gnocchi, seaweed salad, oysters, tartar, arugula salad.   I&#39;ll definitely be back - would also love to bring the hubby and kids.",

"reviewcomment":"Every time I visit Toronto I try to fit in a visit to New York Subway.  It&#39;s that good!  It&#39;s hard to describe: think about a cross between a burrito and a curry and everything that is good.  I always get the mixed veg.  I once tried something different and it just wasn&#39;t the same.  Even if you are a carnivore, trust me when I say the mixed veg is the way to go.  The jumbo is well. . . big!  If you are of an average appetite, you will be fine with the regular sized wrap.  If you are super hungry (or want to save half for later, though trust me when I say once you start chowing down you won&#39;t want to stop, so this is perhaps wishful thinking), by all means go for the jumbo.<br><br>The resto itself has undergone quite the transformation in recent years.  On my first visits to New York Subway I found the shop run down and needing some TLC.  Then on one visit I tried to visit and was met by the dreaded newspaper in the windows and the sign saying &#34;closed for renovations&#34;.  Sadness!  Normally that means &#34;closed to never open again&#34;.  So I was very very happy to discover not only did they renovate, but it was actually for the better, as the furniture is now newer (and cleaner).<br><br>What I miss however from past visits is the older gentleman who reminded me very much of the soup nazi from Seinfeld, except depressed instead of angry.  I haven&#39;t seen him recently, and wonder what has come of him.  This time it was a pair of younger people working there, and while they were polite and the wrap was delicious, something was missing.",

"reviewcomment":"Free Times Cafe is famous for the AYCE buffet for Sunday brunch so I thought I would have their sampler plate typical of what you would get at the buffet. It was $16.95 and included a bagel, cream cheese, smoked salmon, latkes, along with those scrumptious blintzes. Those are egg crepes filled with sweet, lemon flavoured cottage cheese. Solid and filling. The latkes go well with the sour cream and homemade cinnamon apple sauce. Delicious!<br>Since it&#39;s still winter the fruit accompanying the plate was a little pale, but that&#39;s understandable. It was a lively Saturday and the place was hopping with early afternoon brunch parties and the beer was flowing steadily. Truly a enjoyable and enduring restaurant and a fixture along with College Street strip.",

"reviewcomment":"I will always remember Lalibela, as my first ever visit to Ethiopian Restaurant  and the place that introduced me injera with all the goodies you can put on top of it. So good! I mean, I do not even have to write anything. Just check the photos. <br><br>We had a booking for our dinner date, as the place was tiny and packed. Atmosphere is really lovely and warm and service is fast and attentive. We  got a nice little table and there was not much time to make a decision - injera platter, please. We shared one and it was plenty for us, and we could even take some home. If you never have had injera before, this is your excellent chance at Lalibela. I loved the tiny portions of different veggies and lentils placed on the bread. Funny thing was with the salad during the beginning of our feast. I ate the bread and the filling and had some salad as well. Then I felt terrible burning in my mouth and throat and in my head too. Honestly I felt like I am about to die. Was drinking lots of water and was wondering what was so spicy. We figured out that I had eaten a slice of jalapeno pepper which they had put inside fresh salad. So please be sure to check your salad or ask one without it, to avoid a situation like that.<br><br>NB! If you are running out of injera, ask the server and they will gladly bring it to you.<br><br>There are few nice places where to find injera, so we recommend you to find one close to your home or go to Bloor West and Danfroth where there are several restaurants for your culinary experiences.",

"reviewcomment":"This place has been around for a while still serving up some good food based on reviews, I decided to check it out with my gf. We got two apps, two mains, two desserts for a set price. The place is fine dine with filtered water for each table, and olive oil and balsamic vinagrette with the pita bread and focachia.<br><br>Our apps were the carpacchio and the cured meats. We selected three kinds. One was wild boar, one was more fatty type, and the other was more salty taste like. Our favourite was the fatty one.<br><br>The carpacchio was alright, but we definitely had better else where.<br>The size portion here are definitely good since they&#39;re Italian.<br><br>Entree&#39;s we got the Osso Buco with risotto on the bottom. Now Osso Buco is usually tender, but this I found to be quite tough and also its more bone and cartilage ratio compared to meat. Priced at $31, next time this will not be on my radar.<br><br>My gf got the Branzino two fillets with garlic butter and grilled veggies. Her meal is better than mine for sure.<br><br>Desserts: I got the molten warm chocolate lava cake. Yes, there was oozie chocolate and its warm, so it was a good dessert compared to the Panna Cotta, my gf got which is like eating yogurt pudding.<br><br>Overall, the service was attentive and caring, and we did not feel rush. It wasn&#39;t busy at the time, but nevertheless, this is a place we are willing to try in the future for their pastas and such.",

"reviewcomment":"This Fran&#39;s is located on Front Street east of Yonge on the North side of the street. I&#39;ve been to both the College location and the Massey Hall location of Frans and both were quite good, with the Massey Hall location being my favourite. I expected more of the same from this location when I brought my boyfriend here before a game at the ACC.<br><br>The menu at every Frans is the same but the execution definitely is not. I ordered the grilled cheese and I recall on other menus it was a triple decker grilled cheese and was always nice and crispy, cheesy and came with shoestring fries. They&#39;ve changed up the fries at this location, not the best. It was an okay dinner but it really didn&#39;t live up to the Frans I&#39;m used to. Service was fast enough but we were sat at a table DIRECTLY beside the kitchen, which is a horrible location to sit. <br><br>If I had my choice, I&#39;d go back to the Frans at College or the one across from Massey Hall. Better food, better service and better experience. In a pinch, this one will do.",

"reviewcomment":"Specialty: Authentic Japanese<br>Dining Experience: Dinner<br>Menu items: Salmon Sashimi, Seafood Don, Hotate Rolls and Spicy Tuna Roll<br><br>The unpretentious 20 seat restaurant on the Yonge strip is right to make claim as one of Toronto&#39;s best sushi restaurants, or maybe I am the one making the claim. Either way, this place competes head to head with famous Toronto restaurants such as Yuzu, To-ne and even Guu Izayaka!<br><br>Shinobu&#39;s selection of sashimi is best described as fresh, flavourful and beautifully sliced. From the salmon to the tuna, this Japanese restaurant stole my taste buds away in blink of a bite!<br><br>The Seafood Don is a perfectly assembled bowl of sashimi sitting on a bed of rice, sprinkled with green onion, soy sauce and fish eggs. From white tuna, to scallops, salmon and shrimp, the assortment of fresh fish on a rice bowl is a must order at <br><br>Playing on the scallop tune, which to me was probably the best sashimi symphony of the day; the Hotate Dream Roll truly portraits the knife skills and expertise from the chefs at Shinobu. The roll consists of spicy salmon mix wrapped with avocado and topped with thin slices of scallop and salmon roe (aka salmon eggs). Yum, yum, yum.<br><br>And because to me there is no such thing as too much sushi, I couldn&#39;t help but also give the Spicy Tuna rolls a try, which are basically a similar take to the Hotate roll sans the scallop. The ingredient that gave a whole new taste to the otherwise traditional roll, was the sesame seeds, socking up all the flavour and moist from the rice and slowly releasing it back in one&#39;s palate. Another mush order at Shinobu.<br><br>Buen Provecho,<br>Viviana",

I ordered a small donair to be polite. Since that first bite, I have dragged myself across town on several occasions to pay pilgrimage to this delicious treat. <br>The soft, thick, perfectly toasted pita is the best I&#39;ve eaten just about anywhere. The sweet aioli sauce mixes tantalisingly well with the savoury melt-in-your-mouth meat. There&#39;s a bit of fresh salad in the mix to relieve some of your guilt over this decadent dish. The quality is consistant.<br>By now, your mouth should be watering, and I hope for your sake that it isn&#39;t Sunday (they&#39;re closed).",

I love how they set the korean appetizers in a stylish way on the table. <br>Been here twice, first time waited about 15 minutes, boyfriend got gamjatang (pork bone soup) and also kalbi beef (grilled marinated beef). Very good he said. Kalbi beef portion a lil on the smaller side but enough to satisfy a hungry stomach.<br>I got the beef rib soup, it was ok, it&#39;s not very flavourful which I had envisioned. Oops.<br>Second round was a few weeks later with the fam. This time I got pork cutlet. Great size and huge helping of korean salad, almost coleslaw-like. Delicious. Prices are between $7 -$35, expensive ones are things like dinner for two combo. My sister&#39;s korean ribs were $20. <br>Overall, clean decor, decent service, good food, nice location to satisfy scarborough korean cravings. Woo!",

"reviewcomment":"On a recent family trip to Toronto, I visited Smoke&#39;s Poutinerie on the recommendation from a friend who has family in Toronto. While out with 11 of my other cousins (and no, that wasn&#39;t all the cousins in my family!!), we stopped in. Just as most things I&#39;ve noticed in Toronto, it&#39;s a small place, with less than 15 chairs. Needless to say we took up all the space! With having that many people, one advantage is that we all ordered different things so that we could all taste as many dishes as we wanted :) For those who aren&#39;t familiar with poutine, it&#39;s a typical comfort food in Canada.....fresh cut fries, cheese curds, and beef gravy. We had a few varieties:<br><br>Traditional: just as the typical poutine, it has Smoke&#39;s signature gravy and Quebec cheese curds. I&#39;m not a huge gravy fan, so I was more appreciative of the varieties that Smoke&#39;s had to offer. With that being said, the gravy was pretty light and very flavorful! When I think of gravy, I think of thick Thanksgiving gravy that you pour over turkey. This one was more of a lighter sauce that was over all the fries. My only gripe is that the cheese that was used didn&#39;t melt quite as much as I would have liked. I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s typical of Quebec style cheese-curds, but I didn&#39;t get the stringy consistency I like with cheese curds found in the midwest :) <br><br>Double Pork: Now although still with the traditional gravy and cheese curds, this was more my style with the addition of chipotle pulled pork and double smoked bacon. The bacon wasn&#39;t crispy like I&#39;m used to, so the texture of the entire meal was generally soft.  The flavor, however was awesome! The flavors of the pulled pork and the bacon were easily identified, but together made a great meal!<br><br>Chef Special - BBQ Pulled Pork Mac and Cheese: Now we&#39;re getting to some interesting combinations! This looked like it was specific to the Queen location. They took the chipotle pulled pork, added a mac and cheese that was more like a Hamburger-Helper type mac and cheese than your typical cheesy mac and cheese, but non-the-less it was delish! The addition of the pasta didn&#39;t do much other than add extra texture, which is sometimes needed with a generally soft dish. Overall flavor though was just as good as the previous!<br><br>Butter Chicken -  Being this was my first time here, I&#39;m not positive, but I believe this is a special this month at all the Smoke&#39;s Poutineries. If you&#39;re an indian food lover, than this is the poutine for you :) Butter chicken is (apparently!) a typical Indian dish. I tend to stay with my curries, so I&#39;m not super versed in the variety of indian cuisine :) I don&#39;t believe this one had gravy, but the butter chicken sauce. It definitely had an indian flavor, but it was not spicy. It had a strong &#34;spice&#34; taste, which was great, but it was not hot-spicy. My only complaint is that I couldn&#39;t tell the difference between the cheese curds and the chicken, so I couldn&#39;t even tell you if there was chicken in it! However, the flavor again was fantastic :)<br><br>Overall, some great local comfort food!",

The two of us split the Bay Platter, fried chicken, ribeye steak, and shoestring fries. <br><br>THE BAY PLATTER WAS HANDS DOWN THE BEST SEAFOOD FEAST I HAVE EVER HAD. It came with a giant king crab leg, a whole lobster, a platter full of clams and oysters, scallop ceviche, giant cocktail shrimp, and tuna sashimi. It was a meal in and of itself - we clearly did not need to have two entrees in addition to the platter. I was impressed by the freshness of the seafood and dipping sauces provided - absolutely delicious. The fried chicken was also fantastic! The only criticism I had was the steak, which was okay but I would not order it again (perhaps my fault for ordering steak at a seafood restaurant). <br><br>The service was excellent as well.

"reviewcomment":"Food here is terrific, I tried the chicken platter and Lamb roti. Was great amount to share between two people. Mango Lassi was great, not too sweet but quite tasty. I would skip the kulfi ice cream, consistency was strangely sticky with no real favour. <br><br>Staff was very welcoming and friendly when we arrived but then disappeared. Ambiance of the place is fun with great design but still pretty low key. <br><br>Prices are good value for dinner $40 for dinner for 2 but maybe too pricey for lunch goers. They also offered alcoholic because including $5/glass for wine with dinner. If def come back!",

"reviewcomment":"One of my go to Italian restaurants in the city. Food is always really nice, and the deserts are especially good. Some nights i wish i could skip appetizers and mains just to get them instead! My personal favourite is the carpaccio. It&#39;s super simple, full of flavour, and like everything else, reasonably priced.<br><br>Service is usually good, but depending on who you get. The last time i came, our server seemed like he was just going through the motions. I mean sure he did everything he was supposed to, but it was nothing special. Other nights however, the servers have been terrific. On that night with the so-so server, i actually remember spotting the waitress who served me the first time i came and thinking &#34;i really wish i had her instead right now!&#34; Another complaint i have is that while minor, the hosts seem especially rude. Not a good first impression. <br><br>My only concern is that it seems a bit rushed. Don&#39;t get me wrong, the vibe and atmosphere are nothing to complain about. Always lots of families and large parties talking and having a good time. The problem is that the place is always so busy, i feel as if they try to get you in and out as quickly as possible. <br><br>Overall, it&#39;s a nice place to go to. Good food, pretty good service, and a good choice to go out with family.",

"reviewcomment":"Normally I yelp a restaurant first before I even consider it, especially when I&#39;m traveling. However, we were starving as we left our hotel (Courtyard by Marriott) and Grill Time was just across the street, so we decided to give it a shot. And for a random walk-in, I was pleasantly surprised and very full by the time we left.<br><br>The good: My favorites were probably the short rib and the squid. The rib got a nice char, and the squid was sweet and flavorful. We also liked some of the banchan: the kimchee, the pickled radish, the spicy bean sprout, and the potatoes.<br><br>The bad: The fish, which was nice to have included and justified the higher than average buffet price (around $20 with unlimited drinks), was bland. <br><br>The funny: We loved the banchan so much (and were so hungry while our meat was cooking) that we kept asking for refills of our favorite sides. By the third request, our main server (who was very nice) finally got the hint and brought us a &#34;supersize&#34; bowl of each that sustained us for the rest of our meal.<br><br>Would I recommend to a friend?

"reviewcomment":"So far, the best resturant I&#39;ve been to in Toronto.<br>BF and I decided to pre-valentines day here (as real valentines day usually means crowds, sub par service, and set menus). <br>Intimately small, and a little loud due to the Saturday night crowd, but I think the boisterous laughter from surrounding tables added a bit of character to our night out.<br><br>Started with a half bottle of wine reccomended by the server. <br><br>Restaurant bread with olive oil... fresh and quite good, but unmemorable compared to the rest of the meal, so don&#39;t fill up on it!<br><br>Appetizers: <br>Muscles in spicy tomato broth - amazing, fresh, flacourful<br>beet Salad - fresh, but not memorable<br><br>Main:<br>Rack of lamb- amazing, medium rare to order. Reduction sauce (port?) was perfectly fitting. <br>Spigola- baked, which is my favourite. Herb crust was fantastic, with a bright flavour and crisp texture to compliment the denser fish. The accompanying rosti seemed a little soggy, but didn&#39;t drastically affect my opinion... well paired, execution could have been better.  <br><br>Dessert: <br>Tiramisu- traditional, not too boozy, high custard to sponge ratio (my preference, though BF would have liked more sponge).<br>Cheesecake with blueberry reduction- dense, rather than the fluffy style, so, although very tasty, maybe just not for me.<br><br>Wonderful, friendly (but still appropriate) attentive service, with a little lesson about Italian wines.<br><br>The epitome of sophisticated, old-school italian- I&#39;d go back to Il Mulino any day.",

"reviewcomment":"I have been so excited to come to Happy Hooker - all the great reviews, the mouth watering photos, I had to experience it for myself first hand...<br><br>Finally I was in the west end and I set my mind to make it over there for dinner after a business meeting. When I first walked into the restaurant, the space was larger than I expected and there are waitresses who serve you. I honestly thought that it was more of a take out counter with seats for you to sit and eat.<br><br>The service was great and the two ladies always made sure to check on us, making sure our experience was a good one.<br><br>It ordered the cocktail special - a tequila sour and it did not disappoint. Shaken nicely with a nice garnish to finish it off, you could taste a good kick of tequila combined with the ample amount of tartness in every sip. I could have drank at least two more!<br><br>It was also buck a shuck on Wednesday so I ordered a few oysters which came with an awesome portion of spicy horseradish.. Just what I needed! I was very excited to try the Baja Fish taco, having read some great reviews about it. Unfortunately, I was saddened because it wasn&#39;t what I thought it was. I am only realizing this as I write my review, by the way. What I had imagined was a large piece of battered fish ejecting our of each side of the taco shell. Instead, I had several pieces of lightly battered fish pieces. After reviewing the photos, I now know that I should have ordered the grouper taco instead. I had set my expectations a little to high, nonetheless, the Cali Baja was still flaky and loaded with flavour. Sasha ordered a shrimp and mahi mahi taco that was loaded with punch and spice. <br><br>We also shared a small Baja fries to share, which was a great portion for its price. Loaded with toppings - cheese, sour cream, salsa, onions, the works, every fry was packed with deliciousness. I pretty ate much most of the fries and did not want to share with Sasha.<br><br>All in all a very tasty dinner and I cannot wait to go back to try the Grouper and Lobster Rolls.<br><br>Thanks for the smiles ladies :)",

The food is your run of the mill pub food; the menu is extensive so there&#39;s something for everyone should you dine here as a group. I like the location as well. Conveniently located at the corner of Yonge and Bloor, you&#39;re only a few steps away from the subway. The reason why I&#39;m giving this place a four star is the service - it was excellent. The staff here are attentive and super efficient; our plates were cleared as soon as we were done and drinks were brought to us even before asking. <br><br>Good for: drinks, groups, dinner",

Their lunch/dinner dishes are epic! but, this place has a little secret that not a lot of people know about.. and if Torontonian&#39;s knew, it would change breakfast in the city.<br><br>Amore is perhaps one of the best breakfast spots in. the. city.! <br>I like to judge a breakfast place by it&#39;s ability to do an &#39;egg benedict&#39;--their bacon benedict is amazing--homemade hollandaise sauce is the game changer! the truth is, I wish they served 3 egg benedicts on an english muffin rather than 2, because it keeps you wanting more! they also have great breakfast juices (mmm, pineapple!)<br><br>The problem: Breakfast is ONLY on weekends between 11a-4pm.. so those who work on weekends are pretty much SOL. To tell you the truth, whenever I do get a day off on the weekend, this is one of the first thoughts that I have: &#34;breakfast at Amore&#39; then I think about all the other possibilities for the day... <br><br>Keep it classy ladies and gentlemen, enjoy!<br><br>-Ace<br><br>&#34;There cannot be good living where there is not good drinking&#34;",

It&#39;s an old favourite and whenever I crave some good old Korean chicken, I go there. I&#39;ve only had buldak at the Bloor location and it&#39;s still pretty good, although I find it little less spicy.<br><br>At 710 Yonge St, my favourite is the fried chicken. The salt/pepper that comes with the wings is like crack! I sometimes just taste the s+p alone... it&#39;s that good. I&#39;ve also had the lunch menu: the tofu soup, pork bone soup, and the rest are pretty tasty and very affordable for downtown.<br><br>The decor is not that fancy, but it&#39;s very typical in Korean restaurants (let&#39;s be honest, we go for the reasonably priced, delicious Korean food). The service is pretty good too: it doesn&#39;t get too busy during lunch hour and is only serviced by one waiter usually. Anyway, I&#39;ll keep coming by!",

The beef was chunky much like the kind you find in a stroganof same with the chicken and the pork was shredded.

I would also highly recommend the Greek Salad/Spring Mix Salad, and if you are so inclined for a taste of Jewish comfort food, get a scoop of the Whitefish and some potato latkes.<br><br>The extensive menu boasts enough choices for every member of the family. <br><br>A family restaurant for family, by family.

"reviewcomment":"Funnily enough, I&#39;ve always encouraged people to go to Hooters for their food. And I say that every single time with a straight face. For some reason I&#39;ve noticed that me saying that very sentence, causes apoplectic fits of giggles and titters in others not unlike what a 6-yr old does when he says the word &#34;boobies&#34;. But seriously, I have fond memories of going here in my undergrad years, ordering the cajun wings, and enjoying them quite a bit! I&#39;ve always also maintained that the Hooters girls are....overrated. Nice show on the side maybe, but I don&#39;t think they&#39;re THAT much prettier/more wowzers than many people that I know of.<br><br>So I traipsed back here, bemused coworkers in tow, yesterday to re-live if the food was still as good in my memory as I remembered. And the short answer? Sadly, no. But the positive side is that the overall food itself isn&#39;t too bad at all.<br><br>Firstly, I love the fried calamari and deep fried pickle appetizers. They&#39;re ACTUALLY tasty, even sans sauce (but that&#39;s just frankly crazy talk). The pickles in particular are much better than the ones at Dave and Busters because they are sliced more thinly and thus have much more yummy oil and fat penetration than those ones. The chipotle-like dipping sauce that comes with them are also awesome. I use that sh*t on everything. The calamari were scrumptious and NOT rubbery. Wonderful.<br><br>I then wanted to order something that&#39;s NOT wings for a change, and ordered the strip cheese sandwich (Jimmy, STOP LAUGHING THERE AT THE BACK I SWEAR TO- oh sorry got sidetracked). The Texas toast used was so, so tasty (and so bad for you) while the cheese made everything awesome. But I noticed that the chicken meat itself was very dry. The sauce (and cheese) masked this dryness considerably but it was definitely not good chicken. This, coupled with my colleagues disappointment at the small size of the wings, confirmed my fear that the actual quality of many of its offerings really aren&#39;t stellar anymore (if they ever was). <br><br>Also, our server seemed disinterested, even though we had both sexes present and behaved impeccably. I know you probably get a lot of boorish buffoons saying idiotic stuff that makes you weary ma&#39;am (which you can unfortunately also argue comes with the territory), but if you cannot muster a genuine smile to a group of well-behaved work colleagues just having lunch, then you should probably not be at Hooters. She was polite enough, but I&#39;ve never seen a more disinterested server in all my Hooters experience. Maybe if we behaved like morons then she&#39;d warm up to us. Odd.<br><br>I&#39;d come back because I did like sandwich and because the food is still decent overall. But I&#39;m not gonna rave to everyone to come over here. The very definition of a 3-star place. <br><br>PS: It WAS very nice and toasty in the restaurant though, which was nice and understandable given the waitresses&#39; attires.",

"reviewcomment":"I came here for a late lunch after escorting a VIP for her Lasik follow-up appointment. It was December 31st and the crowd was much smaller than the usual midday rush. I love when a restaurant isn&#39;t completely deserted nor rammed to the walls. Our server was great and had extra time to make a little small talk between courses. The room felt a bit cold from a draft coming in by the front doors, but it wasn&#39;t unbearable.<br><br>My main was a spaghettini with clams, pancetta and bone marrow bread crumbs. This is my kind of cooking, a classic combination with the addition of creative twists. The bread crumbs were roasted with the bone marrow till golden brown and crunchy. They also soaked up some of the sauce which was a combination of natural clam juice, pancetta fat and white wine. I must steal the recipe and recreate this dish at home with an extra dash of green herbs for freshness and balance.<br><br>The VIP ordered the handmade ravioli with ricotta filling. Who doesn&#39;t love fresh pasta? This dish also had some roasted pine nuts for texture, arugula and a brown butter sauce. A decent plate of food, but not as innovative as the one I devoured.<br><br>The sweets did not meet my expectations. My cannoli shell was more like a fried wonton than an Italian style pastry. At least the ricotta, cherry and pistachio filling redeemed the dessert slightly. It was OK, but I know they can produce a better shell. The macchiato was surprisingly flawless. A proper macchiato is a shot of espresso with a small amount of foamed milk on top. Mercatto&#39;s version is the most authentic that I&#39;ve had in Toronto. I would come back for the coffee alone.<br><br>The Scarangella brothers have been slowly expending the Mercatto chain throughout the core. I haven&#39;t been to all of the locations, but I have a personal connection to this address and the Toronto St. location. Good food and service at a reasonable price minus the Terroni style arrogant attitude.",

"reviewcomment":"Giving this place the honest 3.5 ( at most ) it deserves. <br><br>Decor: If you see this place from the outside, and have never heard of it,  you wouldn&#39;t come in just because it doesn&#39;t look too appealing. But once you open the first of two awkwardly inconvenient doors ( followed by three steps ) you still wouldn&#39;t be sold on this place. The hallway is often crowded and really tight and narrow before opening up to a big space, which is two tables and then the kitchen. BUT there is a second room once you pass through the kitchen area which looks a lot nicer than the first room, and a lot quieter. They freshly painted the walls, which makes the place look slightly better. The cashier counter is old and scratched up, but that can be looked past. The bathrooms are SO small, if you&#39;re claustrophobic you should just hold it. I felt like the walls were closing in on me in there. And my boyfriend who&#39;s not even that short couldn&#39;t even look at himself in the mirror in the guys bathroom..so i guess if you&#39;re a guy and under 6 feet.. you&#39;re not looking at yourself in there. Tables , chairs, utensils, all of that are fine but it doesn&#39;t exactly change the fact that the place is ugly, but I guess they can&#39;t help it.. this building wasn&#39;t meant for a restaurant. <br><br>Food: Don&#39;t come here if you&#39;re on a diet, because the food here is oily. Should be called Buddha&#39;s Oily and Greasy Restaurant. Little tip, ask for your food to be MSG and salt free, the very bare minimum of oil, and if they can&#39;t do that... don&#39;t get it. Anything deep fried? DO NOT under any circumstances get it, I wrapped a piece of paper towel around my spring roll and it completely soaked all the way through, and I did it again and it still soaked through ( yeah, that oily ). The taro roll&#39;s ( also deep fried)  oil count is fine but there isn&#39;t any flavor to it, it depends too heavily on the &#34;sweet and sour&#34; sauce that comes with it. The noodle dish we had was good, maybe just because we asked for MSG, salt, pepper free and minimal oil. We were so full afterwards, it felt we ate a whole day&#39;s meal at once (probably enough fats and calories in that meal for the week). <br><br>Price: It&#39;s cheap for the huge portions you get. <br><br>Overall: As I said, 3.5 at best and I would return wearing sweatpants and out of options.",

The focaccia to start with is home made and so good I had to have more. We had the small charcuterie board  - lots of variety on it and quite large for a &#39;small&#39; portion just for the 2 of us. The lamb bolognese and wild mushroom pizza were both equally delicious. The wine choices are also excellent! I will absolutely be coming back here and highly recommend it.",

My friend had the lamb moussaka and it was like one she&#39;d never had---I don&#39;t mean that in a good way.

"reviewcomment":"This place deserves four stars in my books, but I&#39;m going to qualify this: TDB really isn&#39;t a good place if you&#39;re looking for something that is trendy, or completely dive-y or pub-y. This place just sort of is what it is, which is a bland almost-sports-pub, but they don&#39;t apologize for their lack of identity. They just own it, and they reward their patrons handsomely. <br><br>How do they reward their patrons? With cheap stuff! Plentiful, cheap stuff! $10 pitchers of Canadian and a snack platter for under $30 that could feed a small island nation. I shared it with two friends 14 hours ago and I&#39;m still full, and we didn&#39;t even finish it. The platter consists of: wings, chicken fingers, potato skins, onion rings, french fries, calamari and garlic bread. There might have been more, but since I was hardly chewing and kind of drunk it&#39;s all really blurred together.",

"reviewcomment":"I went to Hiro today for a nice lunch for the first time today to relax, after hearing really good things from some of my friends who are in the business. <br><br>Hiro was entertaining some guests already, but I managed to get a seat at the bar area so I could watch him at work. He made everything look really effortless, and he was constantly bringing out new things that I&#39;d never seen before (fugu bone+fish gelatin or something like that from what I overheard, for example). <br><br>Keep in mind that this is a relaxed dining atmosphere: AKA your food will take a while to come out. Onward to the food! I got a &#34;Sushi for 1 and Half&#34; lunch combo, along with orders of house-made anchovy, monkfish liver, and hamachi sushi. Everything has wasabi on it already, and I recommend using just the tiniest dab of house-made soy sauce.<br><br>I&#39;ve got to say that the quality of Hiro&#39;s fish is pretty amazing. There was one piece of escolar that I had that was incredibly, impossibly delicious -- the kind of food that makes you feel good feelings as the smoky, buttery and ocean-esque flavours encapsulate your tongue and fill your mouth. The atlantic salmon nigiri were excellent as well, being some of the best salmon I&#39;ve ever had in the city. The BC tuna was okay, and I was a bit sad that he put in an imitation crab nigiri on my plate. But such is life the first time you go to a restaurant like this and order a lunch special! The rest of the offerings on that lunch plate (shrimp, egg, a bulbous squid like thing marinated in soy sauce, a marinated mushroom, and some simple salmon rolls) were all good as well.<br><br>The anchovy was a bit too salty for my palate but it still tasted pretty good. The hamachi  was amazing and super fresh. One of my favourite meaty fish to order if I don&#39;t feel like splurging on toro. And finally, the monk fish liver was great too! Fortunately not too many people like it so there&#39;s more for me.<br><br>I think the next time I go here, I&#39;ll try their omakase. It&#39;s a very nice, laid back atmosphere, and friends of Hiro are constantly coming in to talk to Hiro. A no-nonsense, traditional and great restaurant!",

"reviewcomment":"I hosted my first UYE dinner here last week and it was a great success. Gerri was wonderful at helping me select items for the set menu so that everyone could have a fixed price for all the course including a glass of wine and gratuity.<br><br>Daniel, our server was amazingly professional and made the night particularly perfect with his great friendly service and attention to detail. Everyone remarked how well taken care of they felt. Being a server, myself, I was impressed!<br><br>I had never dined in the back and the ambiance there was even nicer than in the front (which I always liked, but I may like this more). Lo Zingaro were nice enough to give us the back room exclusively for the event and it couldn&#39;t have worked out better for the 21 of us who attended. Watching the guys in the kitchen in action and the glow of the long fireplace was really relaxing and conducive to casual dining with great company.<br><br>The food was just as good as I remembered it. Gerri asked the kitchen if they could make smaller versions of the Suppli and the Tiramisu so that everyone could try smaller portions of more things. The Crudo Di Bufala Pizza was absolutely perfect and I will be tempted to switch from my usual anchovy pizza the next time I visit. The Fresh Fettuccine with Lamb Sausage was so delicious and well made.<br><br>Big kudos go to everyone who came out because this event could not have happened without you! It was wonderful to catch up with fellow Yelpers whom I&#39;ve met before and meet new Yelpers, too!<br><br>In addition to being the perfect place for a date or girls night, I&#39;ve discovered that Lo Zingaro is the perfect place to hold an event and I wouldn&#39;t hesitate to bring a group here again.<br><br>Lo Zingaro is my local Pizzeria that keeps surprising me with it&#39;s awesome-ness!",

"reviewcomment":"&#34;A beautiful girl does not need a lot of make up&#34;. Similarly, &#34;if you have beautiful ingredients, you don&#39;t need to do too much with them&#34;, shares Hemant Bhagwani, mastermind behind Toronto restaurant, Amaya Restaurant. For Bhagwani, whether in business or on the menu, it&#39;s about always trying something new, but &#34;the key must always be good quality ingredients. That has to be the base of everything&#34;.<br><br>Born in northern India, but fascinated by Indian southern cooking, Bhagwani trained in Switzerland, Syndney, Dubai, and Toronto, enjoyed successes and endured struggles along the way. He observed Indian dining in London, England, and realized what Toronto was lacking. Never wanting to do a buffet, Bhagwani has since elevated Indian cuisine in Toronto. From his first restaurant opening in Brampton years ago, Bhagwani now maintains sixteen Amaya restaurants, as well as a line of sauces and naan bread.<br><br>So here we are at Amaya tasting their new menu, and we are wowed by the creativity and diversity of colour, flavour and texture from lamb tenderloin with wasabi ice cream to saffron chicken korma with pistachios, orange and kumquat. There is quite a range of cooking here. Crunchy kale and spinach fritters, smoky chicken tikka with a refreshing coriander foam, and plump Amaya prawns lavished with green mango curry. All delectable teasers.<br><br>Eggplant steak is stuffed with potatoes, peppers, carrots and asparagus in a mild mustard based sauce. Tender beef short-rib is nourished in a curry perfumed with cinnamon and cumin; and roast lobster sits atop colourful citric beet rice. There is an interesting juxtaposition of sweet and spice that harmonizes on each plate. Biryani, presented in an earthenware pot and covered by a layer of naan is cut open tableside to reveal a wonderful medley of baked aromas and ingredients including lamb and nuts. A variety of naan bread from garlic, to chili and olive, allows us to soak up all the wonderful curries before us, and then, &#34;pow&#34;, we&#39;re hit with hot spice, so a cucumber raita serves as our fire extinguisher.<br><br>For dessert, ice cream is not to be missed. Prepared a la minute with liquid nitrogen, before our very eyes we watch this lab experiment result in a pretty display of rosewater ice cream with crushed pistachio, cardamom powder, saffron caviar and blueberry sauce. Light, airy, and delicately flavoured, this molecular gastronomy reflects the imagination of Bhagwani, his passion for flavour and texture, and his forward thinking to create and define new possibilities of Indian cuisine.",

"reviewcomment":"Blu Ristorante, located in the heart of Yorkville at 17A Yorkville, is an Italian restaurant based on authentic classic cuisine created by executive chef Massimo Callovini.<br><br>The restaurant is made up of a stone walled, dimly lit interior, both elegant and romantic. There was a live pianoist playing, reminiscent of an extremely well-executed fine dining experience and a refreshing change from the typically loud bustle of other restaurants in the area.<br><br>The good: The menu had a good variety of appetizers, pastas and meats. The Truffled Beef Carpaccio ($16) and the Grilled Calamari ($14) were both cooked to perfection. The beef was sliced very thinly with pickled mushroom, crispy capers, crostini and parmigiano. The grilled calamari was infused with pepperonata, olives, capers, chilli olio and argula.<br><br>The Bad: It&#39;s a pretty pricey restaurant, but it is in the heart of Yorkville.<br><br>The Crowd: 30-somethings enjoying a nice relaxing night out with a group of friends, or the perfect date night for just about anybody. photo-2<br><br>Overall: The restaurant is very cozy, initimate and charming; the perfect place for a date night. The food, atmosphere and service were amazing. The servers gave us the right attention and the food came quickly so we still had time to enjoy a Friday night out on the town!<br><br>Pricing:  $14-16 for martini&#39;s, $10-20 for appetizers, &amp; $20-30 for entrees<br><br>17A Yorkville Ave, 416-921-1471, or online for reservations",

"reviewcomment":"I have visited this location a few times and I like it best among all the other Amaya restaurants in the city.<br><br>I think they have brought down their prices a bit. The food is always presented well and flavourful but this time it was too salty for my taste. We had the following dishes.<br><br>1. Eggplant fritters - They always offer you something complementary, which is a nice surprise to start off the meal :). The fritter were crunchy and were complimented with some vibrant and tasty chutneys (mango, mint and tamarind).<br><br>2. Mixed grill for 2 - This is basically a kebab platter chicken tikka, sheekh kebab and tandoori prawns. I was really looking forward to the prawns but they were substituted with malai chicken kebab which was pretty good too. I liked the sheekh kebab the best as the rest of the meat was a bit dry. They served the kebab platter with a refreshing side of salad and pickled onions.<br><br>3. Biryani - You can&#39;t write a review for an Indian restaurant without tasting their biryani. It is a dish which is hard to master and involves a lot of work. The rice was quite aromatic but was a bit mushy. We also got a complimentary cucumber raita with it which toned down the spices quite well. <br><br>4. Chicken Mughlai Korma - Rich and creamy. It was also very fragrant. It&#39;s a shame that the chicken was a bit dry and overcooked. At least that proves that they use white meat here :P. <br><br>5. Garlic Naan - Full of flavour, so good I could eat it all alone!!<br><br>Service was great. Everything came on time...it was like a well-oiled machine. We got our complimentary starters then our kebab platter. After we were done they were prompt in changing out plates and serving main course.<br><br>The food was very filling and plentiful. We got 1 huge app, 2 mains and sides for $50 plus tax and had enough leftovers for 2 more meals!<br><br>Overall these are my ratings.<br>Food- 3.5 stars because of the amount of salt.<br>Service - 4.5 stars. The waiters are always courteous, professional and were glad to get my feedback about the salty food.<br>Ambiance - 4 stars. I would recommend you to sit at the front of the restaurant. We were seated closer to the kitchen and they seriously need to get some doors installed there. It can get quite noisy. All the other times I have sat in the front room and it has been pretty quiet.",

Arrived a few minutes early where I was informed that the manager just now (at 6:10) advised the server that a party of 13 was coming in and one more server will be starting at 6:30. <br>Our party all arrived and we were all seated. <br>We were given menus and water. Took about 20-30 minutes before the server was able to get to us to take our drink orders because by that point the restaurant of about another 15 tables was FULL!!  The servers were hustling like crazy in top speed, but not for us.....They turned all the tables in the restaurant twice before our entrées arrived. In fact one of our guests had to leave as after waiting 2 hrs before the entree was served. Once the food arrived, it was absolutely delicious !! We all had something different and everyone enjoyed their meal. I will say because the servers were to slammed with customers but drinks we&#39;re not flowing. We would have spent allot more money on cocktails and wine  if we could even get the servers attention as he was so busy with all the other tables. <br><br>All in all it was great to see my friends at the holidays and the meal was wonderful, but the manager should",

"reviewcomment":"I love this place!<br><br>The ambiance is very inviting and cozy, and even though the place is pretty small I&#39;ve never had to wait more than 10-15 minutes for a table. Plus they have a comfy couch to sit on while you wait, so the time passes quickly! <br><br>The staff are wonderful - super friendly and attentive. Their menu is pretty small but offers a variety, and everything I&#39;ve tried there has been delicious. I highly recommend the crumpets - they come with some amazing lemon curd spread, whipped cream and jam. Sooo yummy. The coffee is great too, as are the smoothies (although they are a bit expensive). <br><br>Definitely the best spot for brunch in the Junction, and probably one of my favourite brunch places in the city!",

The menu is not huge, but tried most items over the last while, and all satisfied. Huge fan of their ribs. I sometimes worry if we&#39;ll be able to get a table, as it&#39;s not a huge space, but don&#39;t think we&#39;ve ever had to wait more than five minutes. Good service generally.",

"reviewcomment":"I love food and I enjoy dining in the many restaurants Toronto has to offer. However, I never bother to write restaurant reviews. That is because I&#39;m a very easy to please diner. If the food is good, the dining area is clean and the service is there... I&#39;m going to give it a 5/5. So I&#39;ll leave the restaurant critiquing to someone with a more discerning approach to it. But I would like to say a couple things about my recent experience at Nunu.<br><br>First off I should mention that I am familiar with Ethiopian food. I grew up in an Eritrean household eating many of the types of dishes on the menu at Nunu.  Eritrean food is nearly identical to Ethiopian food. My date and I ordered the Misto Misto and we found it fresh, delicious and very well presented. I particularly liked the way the different foods (meats and veggies) were equally spread out on the dish (Ethiopian and Eritrean meals are eaten with the hands - right hand only - from a communal plate).  There was no need to awkwardly reach across the plate to sample the different foods.<br><br>The atmosphere is trendy, fun and very much in line with the neighbourhood bars and restaurants.  The dining space was clean and open with an airy and welcoming feel.  This is not typical of the Ethiopian/Eritrean restaurants I&#39;ve been to in the city.  Most have good food and relatively attentive service but the dining rooms almost always leave a lot to be desired.  We arrived around 8pm on a Saturday without reservations. The place was packed! The only waitress, who is also the owner, was a little overwhelmed. She mentioned that she was desperately looking to hire more wait staff.  Nevertheless, we were seated quickly and our food came out surprising fast.<br><br>Overall, I&#39;m impressed with this place. I very much enjoyed my experience. And I highly recommend it to anyone interested in trying something a little different. Whether you&#39;re new to Ethiopian cuisine or you grew up on injera, I think you will leave Nunu with a unique experience.",

"reviewcomment":"La Merceria is perfection in the form of a cute little Argentenian style espresso bar &amp; home boutique. <br><br>I loved it from the moment I walked in. It&#39;s small, but in the best, cozy kind of way. Seating comes in the form of small chairs, and larger benches filled with comfy cushions to relax on.<br><br>Some of the walls are filled with knick-knacks, home supplies, and assorted items for sale - they have some really neat stuff and its worth at least browsing!<br><br>The service is super sweet &amp; friendly. If you want to chill out with some free WIFI, ask one of the workers here for the password and they&#39;ll slip you a teeny piece of paper with the goods on it (and make you feel like you&#39;re in a spy movie.)<br><br>I decided to try their 4oz &#34;Morocchino&#34; which was simple but delicious: chocolate, espresso, foam. The bitterness with the espresso worked really well with the chocolate, and I devoured this quite quickly. It&#39;s presented on a cute little wooden plate that looks like a chunk of a tree trump, with a complimentary cookie on the side - super adorable.<br><br>They have a variety of baked goods, sandwiches, and empanadas, so I decided to try the ham &amp; cheese empanada. Mmmmmm. The empanada dough was fluffy and fresh, and this was simply some awesome cheesey, meatey, ooey gooey deliciousness. It also comes with a side of homemade chimmichurri which was fantastic (you can also buy it by the jar here!)<br><br>Jimmy&#39;s used to be my go-to coffee spot in this area, but sorry, Jimmy&#39;s!

"reviewcomment":"I absolutely love this Keg location. The service is always friendly and on point. It&#39;s a nice large location so plenty of tables, beautiful patio on nice days. Great wine selection by the glass in various size options. The steak is always cooked perfectly to my request. The seasonal specials are reasonably priced.<br><br>I have found since being diagnosed Celiac that eating out is challenging. Often I don&#39;t quite trust the care in a kitchen to not cross contaminate plus going through the Q&amp;A with the serving staff can be exhausting and a little embarrassing sometimes. This Keg location takes that away for me and makes eating out easy again. When they greet us at the door, I simply have to ask for their Gluten-free menu. They seat me and a floor manager comes with the menu and they ask if it is allergy or preference. When told it is Celiac, they explain potential cross contamination points (fries fried in same fryer as calamari). The meal is even delivered separately from my dining companions and I&#39;m always asked if it is ok for bread to be on the table for my gluten-eating friends.  I have never gotten ill from eating here and I continue to frequent as my &#34;go-to&#34; for a night out with the girls.<br><br>I also love the sheer number of dishes still available to me on their menu with a few small tweaks.  So, thank you Keg Esplanade!!!",

"reviewcomment":"Went to the Eaton Centre location. First off, I love the renovation they have done to the food court. At first I was overwhelmed by all the new food choices, but the smell coming from Big Smoke Burger was irresistable!.<br>Now another decision to make - which burger to order! In the line, I must have changed my mind 4-5 times. There were so many delicous options. My husband narrowed in on the Lamb burger immediately. His took a little longer to cook so they asked us if we were okay to wait. No problem, we loved getting a made to order burger. They started by beef burger later so they were timed perfectly. <br><br>The wait was worth it. Delicious. Mouth watering. Juicy.<br>I have to admit, the lamb burger was better than the beef one. I was jealous of my husband&#39;s meal.<br>The fries were just meh. Nothing special. A little soggy.",

"reviewcomment":"Let&#39;s be honest, it&#39;s pretty easy and common for restaurants to f*ck up Winterlicious, but Byzantium nailed it for me. For a $25 dinner, we had lots of choices for each of the three courses.<br><br>I had the creamy mussels, supreme of capon (aka chicken) with apple bread stuffing, and chocolate cake. All DELICIOUS. This was my first time trying mussels after like a 10-year hiatus, and they were SO GOOD... The soupy marinade they came with was exquisite. The chicken was flavourful and moist, as was the chocolate cake.<br><br>My friend who is deathly allergic to nuts was also able to join us for dessert, which is rare... She was stoked. Service was lovely and attentive. The bartenders were friendly and hot (although, judging by the neighbourhood, they probably didn&#39;t even glance my way). The martinis were exciting.<br><br>Great experience... Thanks Byzantium :)",

And how I love yelp for letting me stumble across this gem! <br><br>I can&#39;t voucher for the dinner selection, although I&#39;ve heard it&#39;s fabulous- but I can say this was the best brunch I ever had in Toronto! <br><br>Was out on a beautiful Saturday morning and feeling a little hung over from the night before, and wanted a quaint joint to have a patio meal. Was greeted immediately by the pleasant hostess who informed me there was a bit of a wait for outdoors, but was gracious enough to seat us at the bar and start us off with mimosas. Awesomeness. After only having to wait a mere 15-20 minutes they sat us. <br><br>After glancing over the menu, I couldn&#39;t make up my mind! I&#39;m a hugeeeee eggs Benedict fan, and I&#39;ve heard theirs with the veal and sauerkraut is to die for... But I wanted to try something different. Something outside of my comfort zone. I usually hate steak tartare but really wanted to give it another shot. Let me tell you, Hudson kitchen hit it spot on. The different flavors popped in my mouth, and the crostini was a nice addition. My partner in crime got the chorizo sausage with eggs and apples, which was probably some<br>Of the best chorizo I&#39;ve had. Ever. <br><br>Thanks Hudson kitchen for such an epic meal!",

But my girlfriend insisted we try a Liberty Village restaurant and Bar Vespa had the best rating and I felt like Italian Food so we came here. <br><br>Boom! We were blown away. The ambience was nice and clean, does not look like a sketchy bar if that&#39;s what you were thinking. There were a few tables for a Saturday lunch. We sat down and were surprised it was Winterlicious. I was happy about the $15 for a 3 course lunch! <br><br>And got bread with their homemade mix in front of you oil and spice mix. The bread was cold but very delicious! We kept on eating til our appetizers came. We ordered the risotto balla and the Paranip and Celery Root Soup to start. Both were delicious and cooked just right. Meatballs were really crunchy and yummy.<br><br>By the time our mains came we were too full to continue. We had a small bit of the grilled chicken linguine which had a nice creamy sauce and we had a lamb dish which was cooked just right. We had to take it home for dinner and it was a really good dinner as well. All for $30! This is definitely the spot for Winterlicious, regular menu items are worth the price.

"reviewcomment":"For those who never knew, Carmen is the same owner of Toritos tapas bar in Kensington, hence it is no surprise the quality of food plays a melody on your taste palate. A popular choice in the Trinity Bellwood area of TO, CARMEN serves out your traditional Spanish dishes ranging from various tapas to your choice of paellas! <br>First impression was the cute bar decor right by the entrance and its chic new age contemporary design from the portraits, boutique chandelier of bottles, to the huge mural on the wall. The service was excellent, and it was a nice surprise to see Carmen bringing the &#39;Paella de Carmen&#39; to our table.  :) lol<br><br>Paella de Carmen; mussels, clams, shrimps, scallops, chorizo, chicken and safron 5/5!!!!!!!!!!!! Segovia Restaurant, seems like you have competition in the city... this dish was a delight to my taste buds! Aromatic, robust and versatility of flavors left my foody partner and I speechless...lol. Plus to top it off the presentation was top notch!<br>In addition we both ordered the Primicia joven tempranillo to compliment the meal.<br><br>Dessert cookies with dulce de leche! Que rico! Wish they sold these babies in boxes to buy and take home :( 3bite cookies with Dulce de leche filling..pure bliss! Like I just died and went to IBIZA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <br><br>I&#39;ll be back pronto",

"reviewcomment":"This place has solid good Indian food for a great price. Very authentic, unlike crappy Lahore Tikka House down the road. The ambience here is tacky and uncomfortable (it sucks quite honestly, but I gies that&#39;s why we&#39;re paying this price). Whenever we&#39;re craving good Indian food these days, we head here. I always get 1-2 dishes to go as well, since it&#39;s really good value for money. Making it at home will probably cost me around the same amount.<br><br>Meat samosas are good, butter chicken, kadhai chicken, chicken tikka masala, biryani... everything we&#39;ve ever tried really. Naan is good too. Head here for delicious reasonable food, but don&#39;t expect a fancy place. The guy who takes the order at the cash is a little confused always.<br><br>We actually ordered samosas and biryani for a pre-wedding family dinner from here, and people loved it. It was so reasonable and good. Highly recommend this place. I have a terrible dislike of Lahore Tikka House with its non-authentic, re-fried, over-priced crap. I&#39;d come here and deal with ambience issues any day for the delicious food.",

"reviewcomment":"So delicious! Went out with my friend who is vegan for dinner- she recommended Grasslands. She had been here for brunch and I&#39;ve been here when it was Fressen! <br><br>Unfortunately, I didn&#39;t have my ID on me, so I ordered the pamplemousse mocktail. It was delicious, with a grapefruity salt along the ridge- would have been lovely with the gin in it, but I enjoyed the non-alcoholic version. The bartender also mixed up my order and made a mimosa for me, so they brought me that on the house; also delicious and a nice surprise :) My friend ordered a glass of the shiraz which was really nice. <br><br>We ordered the risotto and the skewer, and they were amazing! The tempeh was delicious and now that I know what it tastes like, I have to come back and try more. Every flavour was quite unique but tied together so beautifully. <br><br>For dessert, we had the cookies &amp; cream and the bundt cake. OH MY GOSH. They were amazing. The cookies were crunchy but soft at the same time, the mousse was creamy and rich, and the mango/cranberry coullis was great; tart enough to balance out all of the sweetness. The bundt cake was rich and had hot fudge in it; I was in chocolate heaven. <br><br>Overall, the food was amazing, and the service was great, friendly and approachable. Our server was fun and the music was great. Dinner is a great time at Grasslands; also check out brunch!!",

They often have live music , great deals and specials and can accomadate  romantic and business events. The owner is very welcoming and gracious and hands on. Every detail is attended to. I had the grilled salmon with exquisitely prepared vegetables and fragrant rice. The desserts are amazing. <br>The service is great and the outdoor seating  in the summer is to die for!<br>Absolutely a must try in Toronto. Very centrally located at 111 King street east, near Yonge and King.",

If you try to buy their food near the end of the night, it&#39;s not unusual for them to refuse because they don&#39;t to serve subpar quality chicken. These people really care about their product! Having said that, as delicious as the chicken is, it&#39;s that chickpea and bean salad that is seriously underrated! <br><br>Their service is efficient, and always super friendly and helpful. Great quality for the price, that&#39;s for sure! And don&#39;t forget the hot sauce!",

"reviewcomment":"Tucked in a very awkward looking building (just like many other buildings in downtown Chinatown), Dim Sum King is a pretty awesome place to stuff your face with traditional cart-service dim sum. The entire place is reminiscent of a bygone era, before restaurants looked sleek and modern, and when Cantonese ladies with silky-smooth shrill voices peddle their delicious morsels on trays. I wouldn&#39;t say that I love the cart service, but seeing that it&#39;s a rapidly dying phenomenon in the GTA, it makes for a nice change.<br><br>There were six of us, so we ordered a variety of things off the cart as well as stuff that wasn&#39;t listed there. It helped to have a native Cantonese speaker in the group, as she ordered us some delicious fried tofu with fried onion toppings that I&#39;ve never seen in my life before. It was awesome. It was also good to have her around to order some of the stuff that usually come in dim sum but for some strange reason never came around our way during our lunchtime. Dim sum is always a bit of a controlled chaos anyway so between her excellent Cantonese and my terrible Mandarin, we coordinated food for the rest of the table, who were comprised of 100% non-Chinese people.<br><br>The hargow, as is usually the case, became my measuring stick as to how good this place is. And it wins big time with large shrimps that were also flavourful, with almost a hint of sweetness in them. Big time thumbs up. The ham sui ko was also delicious and LARGE, while the fried hard gow was also tender and juicy. The cheong fan was a bit so-so, same thing for the beef balls. A bit bland, though very tender.<br><br>The service was quite efficient. Though most of the wait staff had extremely limited English skills, they were more than willing to listen to many of the requests that our table had . We ended up ordering a lot fo dishes and forked out around $12 a person after tips and taxes, so it was very fairly priced.<br><br>Would definitely return again. Nothing that blew my mind but it was very, very good dim sum at reasonable prices. I would recommend it.",

Sweet but not like ice wine sweet.

( sorry don&#39;t know what it&#39;s called but you can look at the pics for a better idea ). <br><br>It can get messy but it is definitely worth it. <br><br>From now on, it will be a tradition to drop by here after a show or a Tso on king at west. <br><br>Reason for a 4 is that the staff didn&#39;t seem to be as courteous and prompt as they should of been. Especially since there were only two other tables of pairs in the lounge area and two waiters. <br><br>But I will return for the s&#39;mores!!!",

"reviewcomment":"Cutest Wine Bar Ever! This little door that is painted with a damask pattern leads up a stairway into this warm and cozy area full of eclectic artwork and interior design. Large murals on canvas and funky artwork with detailed framing surround the room. For tables, old sewing machines that have been stained and brushed with colour. <br><br>We didn&#39;t order any food, but there is a good variety of snacks to munch on.. including assorted nuts (caught my eye) - includes everything EXCEPT peanuts. I wonder why?<br><br>Menus are screwd into a wood plank (very creative and rustic) and there is a good selection of wine. Wines come in Jars, Jugs or bottles. My friend and I ordered a Jar or Chilean Syrah, which equals to about 1/2 a litre for $22. The wine was fruitful and full bodied. The smell of berries was very prominent. I was quite pleased! We each got two glasses out of the jug which I thought was a great deal!<br><br>Little would you know that you would find boardgames in this place - the table beside us was playing battleship.... would be something I do on my next visit! Another surprise was inside the sewing machine drawers contains colourful post-it notes... of people&#39;s wishes and secrets to be shared with others. It reminded me of the post-secret website where thoughts are always posted anonymously. What a way to top my night off.<br><br>I was expecting this place to be extremely chilly - as it is in an older building, but the interior was very well insulated and I never felt cold, even sitting beside the window. Just before midnight, a crowd of 10 showed up and things got very lively. The music was great and I know on other nights, they play shows like mad men.<br><br>This place is such a gem. I cannot wait to come back!",

"reviewcomment":"This was my third visit to Epic. One out of the two previous times I came for Summerlicious. So this was my first Winterlicious lunch experience here. Obviously my return was based on a positive experience. The service was good for the most part. <br><br>For starters I had the Royal York Seafood Chowder with Maritime Salmon, Scallops and Shrimp, and Fine Herbs. As soon as it arrived at the table, the aromatics convinced me I was going to like it. I absolutely loved it!!!<br><br>Then I had the Asparagus &amp; Sesame Lobster Salad with<br>Citrus Yellow Beet Emulsion, Baby Blonde Frisee, Toasted Hazelnuts, and Sweet Onion Chili Vinaigrette.  This was such a delight. The salad was perfectly dressed and the vinaigrette itself was really bright and full of flavor. The asparagus was bitter so I avoided it. <br><br>I finished off with a White Chocolate and Caramel Cheese Cake With Rhubarb Chutney.  I loved the cheesecake and couldn&#39;t get enough of it. The rhubarb chutney came off a tad bit savory on its own but worked well with the cheesecake. <br><br>This was another great experience at epic. I actually liked what I had during Summerlicious better. Maybe that&#39;s because I&#39;m partial towards scallops and braised short ribs. This lunch was obviously on the lighter side and much needed during Winterlicious. Keep up the good work epic.",

The service staff was a little less-than-attentive, but friendly. And the split bills, which is always a plus.<br><br>Went for dinner and had the butternut squash salad (excellent) and the PBP pizza.

This is a really small, predominantly take-out restaurants, with maybe 3 stools at a counter for eating-in. <br><br>I love the rice to fish ratio at Kokoro. There&#39;s not very much rice, and lots of filling! I like this place a lot better than the other sushi restaurant down the street (Oyshi), as it tastes fresher and much better priced. <br><br>Note that they are closed on Mondays.",

"reviewcomment":"My boyfriend and I had our first date here--many years ago... We had nachos and told each other offensive jokes while everyone else in the pub watched the Leafs get their asses handed to them in the playoffs.  We&#39;ve been several times since, but had a really nice brunch this weekend.<br><br>No waits or lineups for the patio on a gorgeous day and we were thrilled to learn that they have $2.99 Caesars! They bring you the Caesar from the bar and you take your drink to the Caesar station and put any myriad of things in it that you want: olives, celery, cucumber, pickled olives, gherkins... Even pepperoni sticks!!<br><br>A basket of tiny muffins arrived at our table shortly after ordering. Two of them were sweet and two were not so sweet, but I was busy with my Caesar.<br><br>We both had eggs with Farmer&#39;s sausage, Cajun spiced home fries and marble rye toast. This breakfast was surprisingly good for chain pub food. Everything on the plate was carefully presented, properly cooked and the marble rye was great.<br><br>Service was wonderful. And I know from experience that Brunch shifts are almost like punishment. Our server was helpful and on time with everything.<br><br>This place does a solid brunch and with the addition if $2.99 Caesars?? You have to be loving  this place!",

"reviewcomment":"This is an old-fashioned Hong Kong style dim sum house--with carts and grannies. The food isn&#39;t great but it&#39;s as hearty as it&#39;s been during all the years I&#39;ve visited. The service is okay. You won&#39;t always see what you want, but the trick is to yell out and ask for what you want, and someone will get it for you right away or as soon as it&#39;s ready. <br><br>The atmosphere is loud and busy. Of course it&#39;s never as loud and busy as it was back in the &#39;90s. Many of its patrons are now retirees. <br><br>I usually go with the family and old neighbors. We usually get the regulars and sometimes we would try new things. Nothing particular. We usually end the meal with a bowl of doufuhua (tofu pudding).<br><br>Price wise, it&#39;s very affordable, especially during weekdays. Each dish costs a little more during weekends and holidays. Dim sum prices also increase after 3 or 4 pm.<br><br>The Chinese broccoli with garlic and oyster sauce dish is alright, but a little pricey. Vegetable dishes are pricey here. I would not recommend the fried noodles, because they&#39;re very oily and often taste burnt. Go for all the steamed stuff.<br><br>The food isn&#39;t particularly good, but it also isn&#39;t particularly bad. I would say it&#39;s generic Chinatown dim sum reminiscent of the pre-2000s. No gourmet this, gourmet that. It&#39;s just food that we&#39;ve enjoyed eating all along.",

"reviewcomment":"This restaurant is one of the few in Leslieville that seem to be left behind in the era that was... and this is a great thing! No one can deny that it&#39;s always nice to have hip new restaurants opening up on Queen East but once in a while you just want to go out for beer and food to a place that isn&#39;t ultra cool and expensive. That&#39;s why this place is great. It&#39;s inexpensive, it&#39;s good, and it&#39;s so unpretentious. <br><br>The decor inside feel a bit outdated, but there&#39;s an abundance of seating on two levels and lots of tv&#39;s to watch sports. There are a number of beers on tap and in cans/bottles and they&#39;re all a really good price (which is a very nice reprieve from the $8 most new places on Queen East charge for beer). They also have a large outside patio that is fabulous on sunny days.<br><br>They have a very eclectic menu: bar food, pizza, and curry. So far I&#39;ve only tried the pizza but it&#39;s great. It&#39;s thin crust, wood fire, not too heavy, just really good. The curry looks fantastic and I&#39;m looking forward to trying it. <br><br>The gist of this is.... Leslieville really seems to be the new hip place but living in this area there&#39;s only so much coolness you can handle when sometimes you just want to grab a cheap but delicious bite. That&#39;s why this place is so great!",

Which she told me was lackluster at best.<br><br>We also had limeade and lemonade drinks with our meal and had a hard time distinguishing them.<br><br>Overall the service was prompt and the food was satisfactory. <br>The decor and ambiance was relaxed, quirky and fun.<br><br>Will definitely be back for drinks and more food.",

Perfect location (steps from the Panasonic Theatre on Yonge Street, near Yorkville, and surrounded by a great variety of shops), ambience is cozy and relaxing, and the service is welcoming and upbeat.  I discovered this the night I went to see Arrabal.  Hassle-free, fun, and most importantly, the food was delicious and ready promptly.  <br><br>I ordered Oja&#39;s Chicken Teriyaki Bento Box ($12 approx), which included shrimp &amp; yam tempura, steamed rice, glass noodles, California rolls, miso soup, salad - and a slew of Korean appetizers!  Radish, beans, kimchi.  The tempura especially was to die for. Melt in your mouth light, fluffy batter, bursts of fab flavour, generous size.  Such a varied and excellent quality meal.  <br><br>My friend and I sat by the window, watching life on Yonge Street float by in our happy bubble. I highly recommend popping into this pretty little place - wonderful experience. :)",

Big fan of the back of the restaurant--even if we don&#39;t want to sit on the patio (if it is too hot or chilly or just occupied), the area right next to it makes it feel like you are outside--it being very open to the patio. <br><br>Always had excellent, top notch service. Attentive, prompt, and caring. My boys love this place. It&#39;s not because the waitresses are all gorgeous (well, that might be a factor), but because they serve kid friendly favourites that include a drink, a meal (your basic kid offerings like chicken tenders, pasta, a great pizza etc), and a dessert (a decadent chocolate mousse!). I love that they love it, that I can space out to some classic rock tunes and enjoy an adult beverage (and sometimes a nice appetizer or salad) and have some sweet family time. The kids meals are a good value.<br><br>This is a fave.",

"reviewcomment":"On this very cold night, we decided to use our voucher to dine at this mexican place. Its been here for 6 yrs, but I&#39;ve never once come across or noticed this place. Small place where seating capacity is no more than 50ppl. Not much of a Mexican feel though, no sombrero and Mexican heritage. Maybe they&#39;re fusion of some sort.<br><br>Started with some complimentary tortilla chips with salsa. Our voucher was the one app, two entree, one dessert for a set price.<br><br>App:<br>Shrimp Ceviche $12<br>Marinated shrimp in lime juice, dressed with avocados, tomatoes, cucumber<br>olives, cilantro &amp; onions.<br>- Didn&#39;t really need the olives. The plate was marinated with too much juices on the plate. The shrimp is alright. Good portion.<br><br>Main:<br>Fajitas $18<br>&amp; choice of chicken, beef, shrimps or veggies. Served<br>with rice, beans, tortillas &amp; topping.<br>- Got the shrimp fajitas. Good portion. Didn&#39;t touch the beans.<br><br>Lobster Tacos $18<br>3 Corn tortillas filled with Guajillo lobster,<br>bell peppers &amp; onions, served with beans &amp;<br>toppings.<br>- Good portion. Lobster meat were mainly claws. Kind of spicy dish. Didn&#39;t touch the beans.<br><br>Dessert:<br>Got the Fried Vanilla Ice Cream. Not bad.<br><br>This place I&#39;m not sure why its slow, but the food is alright. I&#39;d probably try elsewhere just to compare the differences as this place didn&#39;t stand out for me.",

"reviewcomment":"This place is gorgeous! The interior is very well-lit and showcases just how clean everything is. The mini chandeliers are cute, without being overly ostentatious. I think that the fact that it occupies a basement location in Chinatown makes its cleanliness and decor all the more impressive. There are also massive TV screens on either end of the restaurant, so you can comfortably watch whatever is happening without making your dining companion(s) feel too neglected.<br><br>Kachi prides itself in its pork bone soup, and rightly so. Is it the best pork bone soup I&#39;ve had? Possibly. Is it an excellent pork bone soup? Definitely. I have yet to find that curious layer of orange grease that is so often present on the top of PBS. I also liked the balance of ingredients (ie. pork bones, potato, bean sprouts, cabbage), though the ratios do vary. You may argue about the authenticity of the lime wedge, but I found it to be a nice addition, as it cuts back a bit on the richness of the pork bone. &#34;Authenticity&#34; is overrated anyways. <br><br>The tofu soup is chock-full of ingredients, and dumplings are tasty. I also LOVE that they serve genmaicha along with your meal. A very classy touch.",

"reviewcomment":"This restaurant is fabulous for many reasons. The location is idyllic and you are compelled to go for a stroll along the lake before or after your meal. The restaurant, on the ground floor of a condo is exquisitely decorated and offers a very relaxing and gorgeous view of the lake.<br>The menu is huge and has something for everyone. From hamburgers and panini to whole fish and steak, from pizza and pasta(make your own or special dishes) to veal or chicken parmigiana. The Italian food here is simple, tried and true but delicious.<br>We were a group of 7 adults and 2 children for dinner on Saturday. The staff , including Amanda, our lovely waitress, were all kind, affable and very friendly. They immediately brought a high chair for the one-year old and were very nice to the kids. <br>We had pizza, short rib agnolotti, vitello al limone, Eden pasta al forno, Sausage pappardelle with extra shrimp, orechiette con pollo. All dishes were delicious, the pasta was al dente,  Desserts are few but good (blueberry cheesecake and red velvet cake are the ones we had). Coffees are expertly made, I had a great capuccino. The bartender mixes great cocktails and the wine list has a good selection and the prices are reasonable.<br><br>Overall, this restaurant is to recommend for any occasion. And since they open early in the morning, you can have any meal of the day. I have had their brunch and it is much better than a lot of places which specialize in breakfast or brunch food.<br><br>I plan to go back to Eden soon. Great food, great prices, great service in a lovely location and atmosphere. What more can you ask for?",

Although I was hoping it would be dairy free I think there was a touch of cream or butter in there, it was too good not to have it. It was rich but not over the top. It had green peppers which I usually am not a fan of but didn&#39;t mind them in this curry.<br><br>Chana Masala had a lot of flavour and was really great- but I liked the Chicken more...<br>Naan bread tasted fresh and homemade, and the basmati rice was great (fluffy, with cumin seeds).<br><br>Is love to try this place again and in person to check out the ambiance.

My friend and I wanted some sushi (yes, while in Greek town... what can I say - the heart wants what the heart wants) before our concert at the Danforth Music Hall. This was close enough, and we were looking for something simple and reasonably cheap.<br><br>This place hit the nail on the head. The fish tasted fresh, delicious and not &#34;fishy&#34;. Our replacements in the sashimi/sushi combos were arranged easily. The service was excellent (the waiter brought 2 salads and edamame and miso soup when I ordered 2 teas and wine - he confirmed that we will be on a timeline to get to our show. Very nice!)<br><br>The meal we had was simple - sushi-sashmi meal, and half a litre of white (nice thing - 2 glasses of white cost as much as 1/2 a litre - so nice place for 2 girlfriends to catch up in!)<br><br>Are there fancier sushi places?

Away from the busy Yonge Street, at Bay st and St Joseph across from St Mikes college at UofT, TSH is small, cute, quiet, clean and well priced! The service is friendly and efficient. <br>Keep in mind they have an extensive menu from combos, to bento boxes, and shareables available. <br>Our group of four ended up ordering Bento boxes ($12-17) and some sides; spicy salmin sushi, tuna, gyoza, and edamame (avg $3.50-8/ 6pcs) <br>The sushi and ingredients were fresh, affordable and presentation was perfect. I&#39;m glad this was the place of choice..... :-)<br>Just be sure to make reservations as this venue is small, and street parking is available closeby.",

"reviewcomment":"I love the Atlantic. A lot. A lot a lot. Even though I&#39;ve only been here twice, I leave floating on cloud nine because hot damn this is it.<br><br>In order to really appreciate the charms of The Atlantic, I feel like having a healthy sense of patience, adventure and open mindedness will put you in the proper mind space to have a good time.<br><br>I was introduced to the Atlantic by a good friend of mine about a year ago, he lives in the area and wanted to share the experience. We settled up to the bar since it was packed on this specific evening and we didn&#39;t  call ahead with reservations. We started with their throwback vintage cocktails, I don&#39;t quite remember the names of what I was drinking...something with Zombie in the name? But it was good. Then I had something different with bourbon and orange bitters and that was super good too. Nice and strong, just the way I like it. He had something with kombucha in it. Kombucha beer? Who knows, it was superb anyway. God damn Good cocktails. And then we started feeling peckish. My friend is a &#39;burner&#39; (he&#39;s been to Burning Man), so the guy will try anything once, twice if he likes it, and three times if it amazing. And I like eating weird things, so we held each other&#39;s hand and forayed together into the ~mystery tasting menu~ (not exactly much of a mystery,  the plates were explained to us as we received them, but there was an air of spontaneity &amp; teasing in not exactly knowing what you&#39;d get right until the last moment).<br><br>And Holy cannoli that food was good. <br><br>Some of the best food I have tasted in my life. The stand outs were a nettle soup (which I had reservations about because I&#39;m used to having that in tea, or buying it at the farmers market and then being confused about how to cook it cause it&#39;s prickley!) But it was a beautiful blended little soup. Yum. Then some AMAZING DUCK. And then some other amazing funky dishes that I can&#39;t quite remember because it was almost like a food dream. I had gone to heaven. I was dead. Dead in a good way.<br><br>So, very recently, I had the urge to return to the Atlantic, and I decided to drag my boyfriend, who is NOT a venturesome eater. He&#39;s picky, and he loves chicken; chicken schnitzel, chicken cordon bleu, chicken Caesar salad, butter chicken. He also doesn&#39;t eat vegetables, but he was a good sport and decided to buckle down and go for the tasting menu experience. Nathan (head chef, bartender, server, jack of all trades) came up to our table and explained the concept of his operation, we could go for the pwyc tasting menu, or basically let him know what we felt like eating, and he would whip something up. I also playfully explained to Nathan about my bf&#39;s hate for veggies and Nathan said, with a totally dead pan look &#34;Well...my food is vegetable based.&#34; And then we all had a good laugh. He also explained that he could whip us up a nice bowl of pasta, or a curry, but my bf was like, YA KNOW WHAT, FUCK IT, LETS DO THIS TASTING MENU I&#39;M READY. The thing about Nathan is he can be accommodating as all heck, or you can put your faith in his talent and let him call the shots with his tasting menu. And you won&#39;t regret either choice.<br><br>We had a creamy soup with lentils, a lovely salad with cabbage and cauliflower. And then I started talking about HOW OBSESSED I AM WITH oysters with my bf, and Nathan just glided on by and said &#34;...you guys want some oysters? I have some nice ones...&#34; Um heck yea we do. LIKE WHO EVEN DOES THAT. That&#39;s one of the perks of having an observant chef mill about his restaurant and interact with patrons. All the gold stars Mr. Isberg. Then on to the delectable rainbow trout on a bed of black rice risotto, fan-fucking-tastic gnudi, the famous crickets (loved it), and finally, the tobacco crème brule (which I had a hard time with since that spicy kick from the tobacco was too much for my little throat - the bf loved it though, SURPRISE HE&#39;S A SMOKER.)<br><br>All in all, a wonderful night, the service slowed down towards the end as the place started to fill up, but we had basically finished our meal by then and were also too busy having a fantastic conversation about our plan for the apocalypse - Possibly involves a boat, Cuba, and farming.<br><br>Nathan also gives me Aphex twin vibes with his look, and I love Apehx Twin, so it was like Aphex Twin was serving me amazing food. Good times.",

"reviewcomment":"I put a really last-minute order into Sushi Marche (because of their proximity to my home) on Saturday night for not one, not two, put 120 pieces of sushi and they totally delivered. Everyone commented on how delicious the sushi was and it went over really well. <br><br>That said, they weren&#39;t thrilled to take my order. There was a bit of huffing and puffing and long pauses during my order over the phone. But, when I showed up on time to pick it up, it was all ready and nicely packaged. <br><br>So, all in all, the sushi fantastic, the service, not so. This was my first experience with them and so I cannot compare it to the Sushi Marche that apparently existed previously, but I hope they can be more like and less like...this....",

I was wrong.<br><br>In uni I worked at the other french restaurant on this strip, Bodega. I am going to say, I prefer Bodega&#39;s food (and that&#39;s saying something great, because I ate it daily for a long, long time and never got sick of it!), but Cafe La Gaffe is pretty great, too. Decked out like a true Parisian bistro, Gaffe is oh-so cute. <br><br>I&#39;ve loved on their brunch omelettes served with a really well-dressed side salad, and most recently I enjoyed their soup du jour (split pea on a rainy day? you know it!) and their warm brie salad. I wasn&#39;t wild about the salad, but I didn&#39;t carefully read the description before ordering, so I won&#39;t bore you with that. The food is usually superb. <br><br>Bon appetit!",

I always order the chicken pad thai and I manage to have enough left over for it to be another meal. Service is good - quick and efficient. As mentioned, I find the lunch specials to be very reasonable. For under ten dollars, I get a starter salad with a spring roll and a generously portioned pad thai dish. The last time I dined here, I also ordered an iced Vietnamese coffee, which was super tasty.<br><br>Anyway, when I need a quick lunch, I usually go to Green Papaya as you can&#39;t go wrong here.<br><br>Good for: lunch",

"reviewcomment":"Absolutely divine...this is what I would hope for in a neighbourhood diner.  Firstly, the atmosphere, though simple, is refreshing and intimate.   The coffee was terrific and the service delightful. In addition our food was delivered in a timely manner!<br><br>I had the Fish Tacos (haddock) Special, which came with homemade coleslaw (delicious) $16.00.  It was absolutely divine!  Their generous dollops of guacamole on each taco was killer!  Although, I would say they were tostadas and not tacos, which is totally fine by me because my love for latin food is not exclusive. The fish was cooked just enough to be flaky and still tender.  The homemade hot sauce was quite flavorful yet still palatable for those who don&#39;t like spice that lingers or makes you feel like someone just turned up the rad! <br><br>My partner had a generous traditional breakfast ($11) with scrambled eggs, toast, home fries, and again that delicious homemade coleslaw.  You know coleslaw is doing something right for my partner (not usually a fan) takes it down with a, &#34;yah, that&#39;s good!&#34;. Who knew coleslaw had it in it!   The toast was some sort of multigrain, there was a generous portion of fluffy eggs and homefries (not the deep fried cubes...more like the pre-boiled then seasoned and pan fried kind... just like we make&#39;m at the lakehouse....who am I kidding...how we make them at mom&#39;s!!) <br><br>I really wish this place was a few blocks closer but its definitely worth the hike!<br>Good Job &#34;Cool Hand of A Girl&#34;....you are living up to your name!",

"reviewcomment":"When people hear me say that &#34;I&#39;m going to Church on Sunday&#34;, they immediately know that it&#39;s the Bishop and Belcher on Church and Bloor. <br><br>The Bishop and the Belcher is that pub that is never crowded (which I enjoy), but still has that down home charm about it that I can&#39;t place my finger on. Oh wait.... 2 lbs of wings, half an order of fries, half order of onion rings for how much? $25? That would be reasonable. But no... they give it to you for $10.95 on Sundays. It almost makes you think that the wings were probably store bought and handed to you straight from the gas station or something. But no...<br><br>The Wings here aren&#39;t necessarily a revelation, but they were damn good wings and for the price? You almost have no excuse not to go. Now I don&#39;t want to sound cheap or anything, but ever since I&#39;ve forcefully removed myself from my mother&#39;s bosom, I&#39;ve been hunting around for the best wing deals to save some dough. I&#39;m not broke but lets just say that Bill Gates makes more money blowing his nose than I make in a year.<br><br>Anywho, the wings are naked wings that maintain their crispiness well before they are tossed in whichever sauce you choose ranging from mild and hot to suicide and sriracha. Not many different flavors to choose from but great wings nonetheless. They&#39;re large, meaty, and crispy which is exactly what I like in a wing. The fries are your standard poutine fries in that they are fat and flaccid. Onion rings are giant rings with crispy batter.<br><br>I haven&#39;t tried anything else on the menu because...why? They do have daily specials though so it wouldn&#39;t hurt to come on a day not named Sunday",

"reviewcomment":"One Love Vegetarian is a Caribbean vegan restaurant that is a takeout favourite just north of Bathurst Station and Honest Ed&#39;s at the corner of Bloor and Bathurst.<br><br>Owners Ikeila Wright and Ras Iville Wright began as a soup kiosk in the Harbourfront Centre&#39;s World Cafe food court, at first serving their corn soup which is so amazing it has gotten its own feature on the Food Network. They eventually expanded to their current-- permanent--location in the Annex in 2009.<br><br>The Good: The menu features vegan-friendly roti, with your choice of 3 different types of filling--seasoned jamaican pumpkin, chickpea &amp; potato, and textured vegetable protein-- and 3 different shells: white/whole wheat/dahl puri, for about $8 each. Their signature corn soup sells in two different sizes for $3 and $5. Three different vegan entrees include a BBQ tofu bowl, curried bean curd &amp; lima beans, and Callaloo (Jamaican greens), which all come with seasoned brown basmati rice, ripe avocado sliced and fried plantains. A large selection of fresh fruit juice and smoothies, as well as vegan cookies round off a solid, home-style menu. The prices are definitely reasonable for the quality and large portion sizes.<br><br>We both ordered small corn soups and the BBQ Tofu Stir-Fry as our main entrees and were beyond happy!<br><br>The Bad: It&#39;s a cash-only, take-out establishment with only a few seats--but they serve you at your table which is sweet--and they almost forgot to give us hot sauce ;)<br><br>Overall: One Love Vegetarian is definitely a one of a kind amazing Caribbean food; you almost forget that it&#39;s a vegan restaurant as well. The flavours are delicious and intense but not overbearing, and it&#39;s a unique cuisine that is almost unlike anything you have ever had before. The staff are very friendly and the environment is very warm and inviting, though small. It is what Toronto has been missing in terms of Caribbean food!",

"reviewcomment":"My go-to place downtown for dumplings!<br><br>I usually order one of the boiled variety and one of the pan fried. The boiled consists of such cute, round dumplings that are so flavourful and juicy. The pan fried dumplings here are possibly the best pan fried I&#39;ve ever had. They&#39;re wrapped in a unique way (not how dumplings are usually wrapped), and it comes with a beautiful, crispy bottom that is SO delicious to nibble on. Each order of boiled comes with 15 dumplings, while the pan fried comes with 12. That is more than enough to fill two people&#39;s bellies, and at such cheap prices too!<br><br>Other dishes I&#39;ve tried: Last time I went, I ordered the Yeung Chow fried rice with BBQ pork, and I have to admit, it was quite dry and not very flavourful. Adding some soy sauce did help. Even still, this does not affect the five-star rating I&#39;ve given because the dumplings are the stars of the show here!<br><br>The service is fantastic. The servers are friendly and come around every so often to refill my tea cup without me having to ask! The restaurant itself is decorated very simply, but how a place looks is the least of my concerns when they serve amazing food. Give this place a try if you&#39;re looking for some good dumplings to hit the spot!",

"reviewcomment":"Amazing. Quality<br><br>I had the pleasure of ordering the Beef ribs. Most restaurants interpret charring as burning the meat till it&#39;s crispy. The ribs I received were slightly charred and actually added a nice texture and flavour to the meat. The barbeque sauce was also equally as delectable as it wasn&#39;t overly sweet but just enough for taste.<br><br>My most pleasant surprise came in the form of the 2 sides I ordered, salad and steamed vegetables. I was happy to see actual fresh vegetables that were cut in house and not out of a frozen bag. Vegetables that come out of a bag are definitely one of my pet peeves and I believe they have no place in a restaurant. This small touch, is what cemented the quality of the restaurant to me. <br><br>On my way out I had to compliment the chefs because of the attention to detail that is sorely lacking amongst other restaurants. If you are in the area and want quality, this is the place to go.",

"reviewcomment":"I came here on a Living Social deal for three-course souffle adventure.  This restaurant is slightly off the beaten track...a French restaurant in Chinatown, but why not?<br><br>The FOOD:  We started with the soups.  The appetizer soups were pretty good, especially with the crab.  The tomato soup was rich and had a nice texture.  The main course souffles looked beautiful when they reached the table.  I had the Gourmand which contains pork belly and swiss....it read as an incredibly rich dish without much textural contrast. <br><br>Dessert involved the Grand Marnier and marmalade souffle.  This disappointed me slightly.  I kind of think they forgot the marmalade and skimped on the Grand Marnier...i primarily got sweet as the flavor component with just the lightest hint of orange.<br><br>The SERVICE: This left a bit to be desired. Maybe they were just a bit busy with demand of being near the expiration of the vouchers, but we did have to ask for our glass of wine 3 times.  The meal took a lot longer than it needed to as there were delays getting menus, delays ordering, and delays paying. <br><br>The ATMOSPHERE:  Tables are close together with some underwhelming decor.  It felt homely though in a fairly pleasant way.  Not fussy at all.<br><br>Overall, it was fairly good, and a bit uneven in terms of food and service.  With the voucher, it was so cheap, I can&#39;t really fault them.  Interesting enough that I might try it again, but not at the very top of my list.",

The owner correctly identified us as coming from Glasgow (2 stars right away for that!) and consequently much cheery banter ensued. <br><br>I had the &#39;Elvis is King&#39;, manly because I was curious to see what Challah Toast was. It turned out to be French toast (eggy bread) covered i peanut butter with banana, with a cinnamon dusting and grilled with an egg topping. Very yummy, but completely overshadowed by my 2 ladies&#39; choice of Eggs Brunhilde - 2 poached eggs balanced on asparagus spears on a bed of smoked salmon and hash browns, with hollandaise sauce. A visual and taste breakfast masterpiece - I was instantly jealous!<br><br>Great food, great service and the price is definitely right. A big thumbs up!",

By default, it&#39;s served with a naan bread (pretty good quality), and a salad. If you want it vegan, you&#39;re going to have to get it with no dressing. The default is a cream-style dressing, and their oil-and-vinegar alternative is pre-made with feta cheese bits in it. But whatever.

"reviewcomment":"I had a Love Boat A with two lovelies last night, and it was fresh and tasty. A huge assortment of sushi, sashimi and maki on an adorable little boat. What more could a girl want? <br><br>On top of our Love Boat we ordered their spicy banana roll, something Mazz is apparently known for. What is wrong with y&#39;all? It&#39;s gross! If you like hot banana deep fried in sushi with spicy mayo maybe this is for you? But it sure as sugar ain&#39;t for me. <br><br>I&#39;d like to return and sit in their special Island room at the back with the curtains drawn and have an ultimate sushi feast with friends.",

"reviewcomment":"PARTIAL REVIEW <br>From the moment my sister and I had our coats checked to when we retrieved them at the door, we felt welcomed and well taken care of at Azure. The service is professional, yet personable, so it doesn&#39;t feel like you&#39;re dining in a stuffy hotel- definitely a plus for me.  We were spoiled with impeccable attention- our water glasses were consistently refilled, our cutlery replenished, and the meal moved at a comfortable and well timed pace (about 1  1/2 hours in and out).<br><br>This past December, the hotel welcomed Executive Chef, Shawn Whalen to the team to work alongside Chef de Cuisine Grace di Fede and General Manager, Stephen McGaw. The restaurant&#39;s food menu is very inviting and approachable- creative enough for a foodie, but familiar enough for a picky palate.  Expect to see a handful each of seasonal salads (like Niagara Poached Pear, $12-14)), elegant appetizers (including Scallops, local Beef Carpaccio, $9-14), Pastas and Risotto (mmm... like a beautiful sounding short rib tagliatelle, $21-25), and main courses from land and sea (Gamay Noir Lamb Shank? Yes please! $25-39).<br><br>One thing I especially love about the menu is that there are suggested wine pairings for every dish- a really nice touch for those looking to imbibe on a full-out foodie experience.  There are about 20 local and International wines by the glass ($10-28) and another 60 or so by the bottle ($40-1750). Their cocktail list of 11 offerings fuses trendy ingredients and classic recipes with a wide variety of house made syrups and purees going into each one.  My sister opted to start with a peppery Australian Shiraz ($14), while I went the cocktail route.<br><br>Pear &amp; Vanilla Sparkler ($12)<br>Vodka, Lime, Vanilla Pear Syrup<br><br>Mexican Screwdriver ($13)<br>Tequila, Passion Fruit Puree, Jalapeno Ginger Syrup<br><br>Snowflake Martini ($14)<br>Vodka, Elderflower Liqueur, Lime, White Cranberry<br><br>Three very different cocktails for potentially different palates or moods. The Sparkler was the mildest of the bunch - light, refreshing, but a little muted in flavour for this girl. In contrast, the Screwdriver was quite the kicker with the booze. It was smooth enough for those who like strong drinks, but I was expecting more fruit flavour from the puree and heat from the syrup, and I didn&#39;t really get either. The Snowflake was my far the best in my opinion. It was floral, refreshing and way too easy to drink- definitely my first go to next time.<br><br>For our Winterlicious dinner, we had a choice of 3 appetizers, 3 mains and 3 desserts, available for the reasonable cost of $45 plus tax.  Everything sounded delicious. It was so hard to choose, we ended trying all three desserts!  <br><br>Parsnip Bisque<br>Roasted Pears &amp; Double Smoked Bacon<br><br>The creamy, smooth puree was complimented by the pieces of sweet supple pears and salty bacon at the bottom. This is such comfort food for February weather.<br><br>Dried Cranberry &amp; Apple Salad<br>Brie Cheese, Honeycomb, Almonds, Baby Greens &amp; Sherry Vinaigrette<br><br>Yum, yum, yum. A nice balance of super tangy vinaigrette with sticky sweet honey and milky brie cheese. A lovely winter salad.<br><br>Ontario Grain Fed Veal Osso Bucco<br>Potato Gnocchi, Root Vegetables, Kale &amp; Gremolata<br><br>The gnocchi were light and pillowy and soaked up all the delicious meat juices that accumulated on the bottom of the plate. The meat was perfectly rendered and tender, but it could have been a little more moist.<br><br>Butternut Squash Risotto<br>Arborio Rice, Mascarpone, Sage, Truffle Essence<br><br>Super creamy, luxurious, and cooked a perfect al dente. I did find it a touch overseasoned, and maybe would have appreciated some textural contrast (like bacon?), but that didn&#39;t stop me from wanting to finish the entire bowl. Azure has clearly mastered the allure of comfort food.<br><br>Café Mocha Chocolate Cake<br>Almond Wafer <br><br>The cake itself was very moist, and the flavour was rich and pronounced with the coffee bringing out the subtleties of the chocolate.  I&#39;m not a chocolate lover myself so this was my least favourite dessert of the three, but this might be a good pick for those who love that slightly bitter edge on their sweets. <br><br>Apple Caramel Cheesecake<br>Calvados Sour Cream &amp; Praline Crust<br><br>Best cheesecake ever. This was the absolute best part of the meal and I could have happily eaten two more of them and not felt a hint of guilt. The cheesecake was light and creamy, and the caramel was thick and luxurious. I also loved that in the middle there was a little piece of poached apple hidden inside. Order this dessert. Just do it.<br><br>Banana Walnut Ice Cream<br>House Made Biscotti &amp; Rum Toffee Sauce<br><br>The lightest and simplest of the three, but a very tasty offering for those who like banana- based desserts (me!!).  The ice cream was sweet and aromatic with a nice crunch from the nuts and an addictive sweetness from the sticky toffee sauce..",

"reviewcomment":"I&#39;ve ate here on 3 different occasions. A week ago, a year ago, and 3/4 years ago.<br><br>First time I came here, it was very busy during dinner hours. The decor looks the same now as it did then. The main thing I remember was having lobster sashimi for the first time and it was amazing. I love lobster and was worried about it tasting bad being uncooked, but i was quite impressed.<br><br>Second time I came, my friend was working there as a server. It wasn&#39;t very busy. He got us the chef who he said was the best chef working there. He was an older man who spoke mandarin. He did do a few tricks, but I guess it&#39;s usually the younger guys who like to show off, entertain, and impress. However, his cooking was great. Delicious food. Even complimented me saying how I knew how to eat my steaks; Rare, as oppose to the rest of the table whom ordered medium and medium rare.<br><br>Third and most recent time I was there, we requested the Filipino chef. I apologize ahead of time for not remembering his name, but when we requested the Filipino chef they knew who we were talking about. He was very involved with our group and you could tell he enjoyed doing his job. Put on a great show and cooked us an even greater meal. My nephew who is almost 6 said it was his new favourite place to eat. The chef knew how to entertain the 6 year old and even my 85 year old grandpa who is not easily impressed.<br><br>Our group got a combo dinner. It was a special that requires a group of 8, everyone got a few maki/sushi rolls, a bowl of salad, miso soup, fried rice, a shrimp, a scallop, chicken, mixed veggies, salmon and steak.<br><br>There were a few hiccups though. The servers, although really don&#39;t have to do much because the chef does everything, needed to come by more frequently to top of our tea cups, water, and other beverages. For dessert, I got the mango pudding, and noticed it tasted funny. A tad sour, the milk they used may have gone bad. My uncle agreed and we asked for ice cream instead and they were very compliant about it.<br><br>Overall, I guess if you know what you want. You&#39;ll have a good experience there. I plan on bringing my friend there for his birthday. He has never gone to a teppanyaki place and I think he&#39;d enjoy it. Needless to say, I will be requesting for the Filipino chef again.",

In a nutshell, here are some of its highlights:<br><br>-Family owned and operated; the staff here are always happy, sweet, friendly, and accommodating<br>-Awesome trivia nights. Cool prizes (even for non-winners), a great mix of categories (from general random knowledge, to guessing that song/artist, to watching videos and frantically writing a million things down to spew back random facts, to cookie stacking!)<br>-Fondue Fridays. While they have yummy fondues most days, there are a wider variety available on Fridays (and comes with a nice spread of different goodies to dip into). <br>-Board games! Yep, they have a selection of board games you can break out while enjoying your cheesy treats<br>-The Mac and Cheese ROCKS. It is perfect comfort food (especially in the chilly winter). It is ooey gooey cheesy amazingness.<br>-Candy Bar Grilled Cheese. It may sound weird, but try it, you won&#39;t regret it. It&#39;s pretty much a candy bar of your choice (you get to pick from a giant jar), with some mascarpone, served with syrup and fruit. It. Rocks.<br>-They have lots of deals going on - follow them on twitter &amp; facebook to keep posted<br>-BRUNCH! They have an awesome brunch menu that is ever-changing<br>-Free parking! Something that is rare and awesome in this area <br><br>Check Cheesewerks out next time you&#39;re in the area. You won&#39;t regret it.",

In both cases the food was wonderful (if you&#39;ve ever been to Provence, you will recognize much of the fare on offer; pastas, grilled meats, fish - not all the sauces that people often associate with French cuisine.) <br><br>Last night it was a delicious cold peach soup and succulent grilled lamb. My friend had a salad and a perfectly grilled salmon.  The manager helped us choose a perfect red wine, and the meal-ending cappuccino was flavourful with no bitterness. The ambiance is &#34;classy-rustic&#34;, with a fantastic terrace at the back.<br><br>As much as I like all this, I am also a real fan of the service. The manager was quite happy to answer all our wine questions, and the servers have always been more than cheerful and accommodating.  Last night&#39;s &#34;reunion dinner&#34; meant we sat for a long time after we finished eating. Our server was gracious about checking in from time to time, but in no way making us feel like we needed to get out of there. Another server was happy to take the obligatory photo for us.<br><br>So I am nothing but a fan. Our dinner for 2 with appetizers, wine and cappuccinos came to about $120. Not bad at all for such excellently prepared food and accommodating service. The only draw-back is that it makes me long for a few weeks in  the south of France. At least this is a great substitute.",

"reviewcomment":"This is an awesome take out place. Roti keeps very well for take out. My vegetarian daughter loves their saag paneer roti and I cannot get enough of their curry lamb roti. They do not skimp on the paneer or meat. In fact, I would not mind if they filled their roti with some more potatoes but there&#39;s always lots of meat. The meat is cooked just right. Never tough or falling apart at the touch of your fork.<br><br>Our latest discovery is their chilli gobi. This is deep fried battered cauliflower with a super tasty sweet, spicy and tangy sauce. This is actually spicy. It&#39;s a small portion and  super awesome so I recommend one portion per person. Their roti is big enough for two meals. I do not recommend splitting one of them amongst two people though. You will regret it as soon as you have room for more.",

"reviewcomment":"Dinner last night at Edulis with a friend was cozy and a great spot to catch up over good food.  We both chose the 5-course carte blanche menu over the 7-course; we were told both menus had about the same amount of food in terms of quantity.  I was worried whether it would be enough, but the five-course was just the right amount of food.  <br><br>The fresh house-made bread was served with their amuse bouche of anchovy stuffed olives.  I could have ate that whole basket of bread!  Next courses were fish, one served raw and the other was grilled John Dory.  Both were fresh and wonderfully prepared. This was followed by suckling pig and duck.  These dishes were great for a cold winter evening; they had a rustic, simple presentation yet both very tender and succulent.  Dessert was soma chocolate (served like a pudding) served with meringue.  Not too sweet and a nice end to our meal.  The pace of the meal was served perfectly and the progression of food from each course was well chosen.  <br><br>We both enjoyed our small feast but just didn&#39;t find it outstanding. Maybe it was just all the hype that I expected more.  Nonetheless, the food was delicious and I thoroughly enjoyed every course.  I had two glasses of wine with my five courses and was full after our 3 hour meal.  The small restaurant had a welcoming, warm ambiance and we had attentive service.  The five-course carte blanche menu is definitely a great deal for the price for the quality of food and an enjoyable quiet evening.",

"reviewcomment":"I find it hard to believe that for such a multicultural city, this is the only Malaysian restaurant downtown. Whilst it&#39;s not entirely authentic, the food here is really great. I came here with a friend for Winterlicious on Saturday evening. The restaurant itself has a nice ambiance, and the service was fast, friendly and unobtrusive. The kitchen was a bit slow, but we weren&#39;t in a rush and it was no biggie. With a glass of wine in front of us, we barely even noticed.<br><br>The real reason I wanted to come here is because I absolutely looooove Malaysian roti, but sadly the one they serve here is flatter and a lot more buttery than a traditional roti. I&#39;m also a bit disappointed they don&#39;t have any actual roti dishes on the menu, like a murtabak or roti canai.<br><br>I had the chicken satay skewers for starters which I really liked (but how can you go wrong with satay?). For main I had the beef rendang which was tender and flavourful. My friend also really liked her sambal chicken and pandan crepes. For 3 courses and 2 glasses of wine each, the bill totalled $50 each which I thought was pretty good value!",

"reviewcomment":"Warning, some may get offended with this review. My wife and I went here today for lunch. We went a little crazy ordering $110 worth of food. We started with a $17 soft shell crab appetizer, the most expensive we ever paid anywhere; it was good and larger then most sushi restaurants hence the price I guess. I had the lunch special $20 for rice noodle soup, grilled steak and 3 pieces of California rolls and 2 pieces of special maki roll. Great taste and excellent value. My wife went a la carte nigiri sushi and ordered, giant clams (geoduck) $10 per piece, surf clams, snow crab legs, tako, scallops and octopus sushi. She described it as the best sushi she had in a long time. Both our meals came with salad and miso soup. <br><br>Restaurant was packed with suits from the surrounding office towers. Extra busy because of the coming holidays. Service was discrete and efficient.  <br><br>We eat a lot of sushi and why this restaurant is extra special because the owners and all wait staff and most important the sushi chefs are Japanese. Ta Ke is one of only a few Japanese own and run Sushi restaurants in Toronto.<br><br>Toronto has become saturated with Sushi restaurants, most are not authentic and run by Chinese and Koreans. I am Asian and we can tell the difference. Now having said this there are some good Korean run sushi restaurants, MiNe Sushi in Aurora is very good. <br><br>The best Italian, Chinese, Mexican or Thai restaurants are own and run by people from their specific ethnic groups.  So if you want great authentic Sushi go to Ta Ke and please remember to not mix wasabi into your soya sauce.",

"reviewcomment":"I just had my first time at Ninki last night. I am not going to lie, but the table setting outside of the restaurant threw me off. I thought I would have to sit in the middle of THE PATH, open to everyone. Luckily, there was seating inside. <br><br>The waiters were friendly and always came around to refill our waters which is always a major plus for me! <br><br>I ordered the bento box B - salmon. There was a choice for the meat: chicken, beef and salmon. The price was fair, $16, since it came with a lot of food and rice.<br><br>- Salad and miso soup: Nothing out of the ordinary <br>- 6 piece California roll: Decent and again, very typical<br>- Teriyaki salmon: The sauce was good, and the portion of the salmon was big. I enjoyed Ninki&#39;s salmon since some of the other Japanese restaurants I&#39;ve tried tend to overcook the fish. (Side note: My friend had ordered the chicken instead, and she said it was very salty...)<br>- 2 piece shrimp tempura and 4 piece vegetable tempura: Loved it! I liked how they gave a variety of vegetable tempura: pumpkin, broccoli, eggplant and taro. I&#39;m a sucker for taro and pumpkin tempura.<br>- 3 piece salmon sashimi: I was shocked when I saw the portion of their sashimi. Each piece was at least 2 fingers wide and very very thick. I have never seen such large sashimi in my whole life...<br><br>I was disappointed that the bento combo did not come with ice-cream. :(<br><br>I also noticed that this restaurant offered AYCE. The price is $23.95/person on weekdays and there is a wide selection. <br><br>Would I go back? ...Probably not. It just missed the wow and captivating factor for me (nothing out of the ordinary).",

"reviewcomment":"Back again yesterday. :) <br><br>So happy that it&#39;s finally acceptable patio weather! Got here and was told there was a wait for the patio - no biggie. Sat at the bar with a beeper thingy and ordered some food and drinks. Beeper went off, went outside. <br><br>Got myself a &#39;Beached&#39; cocktail... And my taste buds sang! Might be my new signature drink! Think it was white rum, blue curaçao and pineapple juice. Had me two of those. :) <br><br>Food wise, I decided to do something different other than my regular nacho order and went with the bacon chicken club with fries. Other than the bacon being a bit too well done, it was pretty decent but the star of the show was actually the fries! :) <br><br>Hilarious point - one of the waiters fully tripped and spilled beer all over me in my seat. I didn&#39;t care, shit happens. Half the staff continued to apologize profusely (unnecessary but appreciated nonetheless) and the manager (I assume) came over and comped our round of drinks.",

"reviewcomment":"Went here on a suggestion of a friend, and was SO happy I did!<br><br>The Grove was basically made for me. If I had to create my own restaurant, this would be it! It&#39;s all about the tasting menu! <br><br>The restaurant itself is well designed with lots of groups of tables and a long bar when you arrive. There is dim lighting and I honestly think this would be a perfect date spot, especially if you and your date were up for splitting each others food (more options!!).<br><br>They have a great cocktail list and a decent wine list, with a good variety coming by the glass. Cocktails are a little pricey, coming in around $14, but well worth it. I tried the &#34;Corpse Reviver&#34; and was quite happy with it, it had a serious kick. <br><br>The Tasting Menu is $45 for 5 choices, and is unbelievable. You select 4 savory choices and one dessert. <br><br>Each dish comes out beautifully plated, like a piece of art! Everything I tried was amazing, my favorite being the seared tuna with chicken skin chips and frozen guacamole (WHAT?!). <br><br>During the meal, they break up your courses with a few little bites which come on the house. For us, this including a tiny Parmesan puff, teeny personal baguettes, and a delicious mini dessert tart. <br><br>I LOVE that I was able to try so many little things, and still feel completely satisfied at the end of my meal. I can&#39;t wait to go back!",

Presentation of the food was nice and quality was great. Portions were a little on the small side tho. Very flavorful. We all had the chocolate and caramel pie for dessert and it was delish! However, the dessert portion was giant and we could barely finish it.   I did manage to finish it, but definitely felt guilty afterwards!! :)<br>I would recommend this place!",

"reviewcomment":"Been there twice in the last week.<br><br>The first time I sat down and the waiter (Skyler) was very friendly (even though Skyler is a villain&#39;s name). I ordered the pulled pork sammich (no, not sandwich) with a brisket poutine and cornbread muffins on the side. As I waited for the food, I decided to sample the four BBQ sauces on my table. Each one was absolutely amazing in its own right. I would totally stock up if they were available in my local grocery store.<br>When I got my food, I found the sammich to be bland as I am used to my pulled pork already being smothered in sauce when I get it. I later realized that I am supposed to douse my sammich in one or more of the aforementioned sauces. I put some on, but not nearly enough. My fault for the lack of flavour, I suppose. The pork was quality though. A little dry, but quality.<br>The cornbread muffins were cold and hard. Was not impressed.<br>But the poutine... My word! That was maybe the best poutine I have ever had! Just sooooo good. Three cheeses, layer upon layer of meat and fries and gravy. Amazing.<br><br>Today, for Burger Week, I stopped in for their featured burger (&#34;Angus burger stuffed with pulled pork and topped with cheese, pork belly strips, and pulled pork infused with BBQ sauce and bourbon&#34;). The burger itself was a tiny bit small (but hey, it was $5) but as Samuel L says, &#34;That&#39;s one tasty burger!&#34; It wasn&#39;t even the toppings that did it. It was the beef. The really tasty, quality, beefy beef. I was impressed.<br><br>Did I love everything about Hogtown Smoke? No. Would I go again? Yup!",

"reviewcomment":"I came here with friends after attending the Christmas Market in the Distillery District last month and I will definitely be back! <br><br>I absolutely loved the interior. The space is evocative of a trendy art gallery with its open concept, high ceilings, and enormously framed pictures. The food was delicious! My friends and I shared the bruschetta to start and it was very fresh and flavourful. I opted for the burger and fries. The burger was medium rare, juicy, and tender. Our server recommended the fries, which were also very good. <br><br>Service was exceptional. Our energetic server had a lot of suggestions for us and made sure we were well taken care of.",

"reviewcomment":"I&#39;ve always been a fan of restaurants that are consistent enough to bring people back and responsible enough to get and keep their liquour licenses. Given the location of KOS, with nothing around that compares, I am a fan and hope they keep going and going. The interior reminds me of a quaint spot in cottage country with a menu to match. Nothing out of the ordinary, but their omelets deliver and their home fries are perfect. The patio had a lineup on the first long weekend of the patio season. With its grandiose shade tree canopy above and being in a residential neighbourhood, with plenty of people watching potential, their patio is one of my all time favourites.",

"reviewcomment":"I have been coming to this place since it opened in 2010. I used to be a regular at New Ho King, which was just next door (and has since moved down the street). This place is run by some ex-employees of New Ho. I think they split amicably to start their own place. As such, it has a very similar vibe to the old-school New Ho King: very bare-bones, very utilitarian kind of place. Its one bit of &#34;flair&#34; is the fact that its walls are papered in napkins drawn on by drunken late-night patrons (the collection features many hilarious cartoons and bizarre proclamations of love for the place). The service is very utilitarian as well, but if you get to know the guys, they treat you really well. I am a regular here because they are very accommodating to my needs. If I want to change a dish, I just tell them how I want to change it and they do it, and always get it right. Furthermore, the prices are great. If you go after 11 pm (which you should, as it&#39;s great fun), ask for the late-night menu. Prices on that are about half what they are in the day. The food is not gourmet, but it&#39;s very satisfying and tasty, and the dishes are large. Great value for your money, and a fun atmosphere. I recommend if you&#39;re looking for a fun, laidback, casual place to get some cheap eats, especially after the bar. <br>They cook lobster quite well there, too... And for a decent price. <br>Another winning dish? The Shanghai noodles. They pack a punch of greasy deliciousness.",

"reviewcomment":"I originally had a review here, but deleted it as I felt I was being a bit biased (Simon is actually my uncle, let&#39;s just say). I decided to wait for my next visit to give a more unbiased review on how I really think of this restaurant. That next visit was last night.<br><br>A few things to note: Simon, while still the owner, is no longer the main sushi chef. He recently hired a chef for the sushi counter, and Simon these days either works in the kitchen or does deliveries. He only works in the sushi counter when the main sushi chef isn&#39;t available.<br><br>As for the food, the starters remain consistently good: Miso soup (with the real seaweed instead of wakame), salad with the thousand island sauce, and edamane. Occasionally Simon even offers cooked salmon head as a starter, although I&#39;m unfortunately not a cooked fish person.<br><br>I ordered a la carte sashimi with toro, tako, ikura, tobiko, and ika. I liked the ika the most, and was disappointed with the toro (true toro sashimis are supposed to be &#34;tough&#34;, this one just melted in my mouth). The ikura and tobiko sashimi are both okay, though I keep forgetting they have the cucumber as the base for sashimi orders instead of roll-style for sushi orders.<br><br>The oranges to finish up the meal are always a welcome option, and they usually taste very good after waiting about a minute as they come straight from the refrigerator.<br><br>Service tonight was on the poor side. They had 3 waitresses on shift, but I never saw more than one in the actual dining area serving customers. Definitely a lack of organization compared to other restaurants I&#39;ve been to; despite the fact Simon Sushi has been around for the better part of 10 years, the employees felt like it was their first month on shift.<br><br>That being said though, I won&#39;t argue when the total cost I paid for the whole meal was $20 including taxes and tips.<br><br>Free wifi!

Staff was friendly but they seems overworked. Like they needed someone else on the floor. The kitchen is in the middle and from the high table we were sitting at we could see into it. Which I don&#39;t mind. It&#39;s better to be able to see what&#39;s going on with your food. We got muscles wings and ribs. Muscles were extremely tasty and they have a wide variety of flavours to choose from. The wings and ribs were good and the sauce was very tasty. While they have a small menu they have good options. But I&#39;m giving this place a 3 star because their prices are way too high.  They&#39;re at danforth east  in a neighbourhood full of families. Not in a downtown location! There good was good but not good enough to charge those prices. <br><br>I also tried the pad Thai one other time. Surprisingly good for a non Thai restaurant",

Extremely attractive waitresses (up to the point of employment discrimination really lol), Mens toilet urinals overlook dundas square!<br><br>Negatives: extremely overpriced (as is expected from a sports bar downtown Toronto), bad and lethargic customer service; real life e.g. it takes nearly 30 minutes for a server to pass by and give us menus, another 25 minutes to get our drinks and then another 20 for the food (over an hour wait so far), when the industry standard is 12 mins! oh and ofcourse they messed up my order I specifically asked for NO BACON on my cheeseburger (but meh lower tip for the server). Also they overcharged us more than once on separate occasions! I didnt order three beers, I only ordered one thank you very much.. Oh lets not forget another 20 mins to get the bill!<br><br>Three star rating. Only go there for reliable big screen HD tv sporting events and some eye candy from the waitresses ;) as for Food? only If youre willing to wait and overpay!",

Although Toronto prides itself on its diversity in ethnic food, most people know the good Chinese food is in Markham / Scarborough. And while that is true, New Sky will have you returning back. <br><br>Having been here by recommendation, I have since been a returning customer. It saves me a trip to the suburbs when I crave the food of my people.<br><br>Beware though, they have a secret (better) menu in Chinese that I&#39;m assuming would only be given to you if you appear to be Chinese. And although I am Cantonese, both times the Chinese menu was only offered to me once I&#39;ve asked. <br><br>Recommend dishes: Fried snow pea leaf, sizzling satay beef, fish and tofu clay pot, scallion and ginger stir fried lobster.<br><br>OH: also, BONUS!

The 3 for $10 deal they are rockin&#39; is too much for me... so bring a friend who is a bigger eater to be your sweep canoe. If you&#39;re going the slider route, and you should, double up on the fried chicken. It&#39;s a tiny crispy, greasy and mayo-y delight. Poutine was meh. <br><br>The ambiance is dark and perfect for a drink with friend or shamefully eating slider after slider with a poutine chaser in the corner.",

Yummy green smoothies, Portland&#39;s own Stumptown coffee (amazing) with great non dairy subs. While pricey their energy balls and brownies all taste amazing!<br><br>As for lunch - again very good. Tried a few - favourites being the season.01 and Oaxaca. There&#39;s a line every day from 1145-2 pm but goes quickly and service is super friendly. Definitely worth the wait and super happy to have a place like this in the PATH - I&#39;m sure it&#39;s only a matter of time before we see a second one open (here&#39;s hoping!)",

"reviewcomment":"This is a more family-orientated sit down middle-eastern restaurant when compared to others in the area. It has been in the area for years and has won many awards for being the best Middle Eastern food in Toronto.<br><br>The menu has many different meat options (chicken, beef, lamb, etc.) and comes mainly as kabob&#39;s. All mains appear to come with rice and salad. There were three of us who dined this evening there. Two of us got chicken skewers. They were perfectly seasoned and the meat remained moist. The rice was very tasty as well and it was clear the salad was made with fresh vegetables. The third member of our party got beef skewers and from what I could tell that was juicy and moist as well.<br><br>The one downside was the coffee which was not enjoyed by our table and from what the others could remember, they&#39;ve had a similar experience with their coffee before. Dessert (vanilla and chocolate tartufo) was up to par with many other places that offer it.<br><br>All in all, atmosphere is warm and inviting. Servers are attentive and will remove the skewers from the table once is clear you are finished with them. Price point is great for the amount of food received and the quality of the food. This place is definitely worth a try as both a take out or a sit-down option.",

Right at the corner of Bayview and York Mills, it&#39;s in a shopping plaza with heaps of parking spots. It&#39;s conveniently located close to the 401. I like the layout and the cafeteria style - you go to stations, order your food, and bring it back to your table. Just make sure not to lose your card. The best thing here is the pizza as it&#39;s made in a &#34;wood oven.&#34; Their crepes are pretty good too - after 9:00 PM, you can get a second plain crepe for 50% of the original price. This place is &#34;safe&#34; as there&#39;s something for everyone.<br><br>Good for: groups, pizza, crepe",

When they&#39;re fresh... they&#39;re THAT good. I have a box in my fridge as we speak... well, as I speak. They one day hope to escape, but the only escape is through me. If you&#39;re re-heating the patties, it&#39;s smart to poke holes in the back of them to let the steam escape/to make your home smell delicious.<br><br>Have you ever walked into a place, taken a bite of their food, and it transported you back to a place and time? Well this place does that, just make sure to ask them to make sure your food is hot, and you&#39;re set. Unfortunately, the doubles leave something to be desired, but being from Trinidad, I&#39;m pretty picky/haven&#39;t found good doubles in the area.<br><br>Their breads and cakes and rolls and cookies and sweets are all great, too! This place is essentially the best Caribbean bakery you&#39;re going to get without going to the actual Caribbean (Scarborough/Brampton/Mississauga).<br><br>Do yourself a favour and try a flavour of patty you love. In terms of most of the 1* reviews, these people likely have only been in once and had a bad experience, are hypercritical West Indians, or both.",

Otherwise their all day dimsum isn&#39;t much more expensive. <br>- decent English speaking staff<br>- cleaner than most Chinese restaurants in the area",

"reviewcomment":"We had about 65 people meet here for a 20th anniversary reunion (the company we worked for closed its doors for good 20 years ago), and I have to say that the wait staff was stellar!! They consistently got our orders right - food, drinks, and accurate billing - even though there were only 3 of them serving our large and sometimes rambunctious group! We were talking and hugging, and mingling around, and it could not have been easy keeping tabs on us. Some of us have kept in touch over the years, but most of us, many of us have not seen each other in all that time!<br><br>This was an awesome gathering, and I&#39;m so pleased so many turned out!<br><br>I had a small glass of red wine (about $7), and a veggie wrap with a salad on the side which was about $13.00 and quite delicious! It may sound odd getting a side salad with a veggie wrap, but they were prepared differently than one another - the veggies in the wrap were sautéed, and goat cheese added to the delicious flavouring. I would certainly order this again, and I would go back! It was a great experience all around.<br><br>Bravo to the event organizers for choosing this great spot, and getting so many of us to attend.",

"reviewcomment":"I know some would consider four stars a little high for the Jersey Giant but something just feels right when I drink here - probably a personal thing I guess. A great place to unwind or reflect on life. <br><br>BEER options are rather good, something for everyone. (Note - this is not a &#34;craft&#34; beer pub) I love that they have Maisel&#39;s Weisse on tap - you don&#39;t see it too much in the city (I personally consume kegs of this stuff when in Germany). You get all the irish pub taps, one rotating local craft tap, a house selection, a couple Mill Street choices and some bigger international brands. <br><br>SERVICE has been excellent on all my visits. Very friendly staff who always know when your ready for the next pint. Very consistent - I guess not being super busy helps on this front.<br><br>ATMOSPHERE &amp; DECOR - Somewhat dated for sure. This is defiantly not the latest trendy pub!!!!! It feels / looks like an old style pub, but not dirty. I like the couch seating. They have a pool table room in the back. The bar is also very dark.<br><br>MIXED clientele for sure - everyone from students, suits, tourists, the elderly and many folks enjoying a beer on their own at the bar.<br><br>FOOD is standard pub selections. Never tried it myself but from what I can see, would probably be 2-3 star at best. Come for the beer &amp; quiet time.<br><br>Conclusion - I like it (visited three times in the last two weeks). A perfect place to unwind after a crazy day at work. Not for the hipsters, trend setters or decor lovers (and that&#39;s OK with me). <br><br>BK",

"reviewcomment":"My boyfriend and I came here for Winterlicious this past Saturday. Despite the fact that somehow the online booking system malfunctioned and we DIDN&#39;T have our proper reservation time of 1pm (I called ahead of time to confirm my worst fears), they graciously accepted us after pushing our time a little later.<br><br>The people on the phone were curt but helpful, and as I&#39;m usually very prompt with reservations, I was really upset to find out they couldn&#39;t find our names on the list. That being said, booking for Winterlicious was crazy and I probably should have called.<br><br>When we came in on the first Winterlicious Saturday for lunch, it was busy. Very busy. Winterlicious busy and gross outside, so probably with walk-ins as well. That being said, we waited maybe 10-15 min for a table with no reservation (&#34;Just come in, don&#39;t worry&#34;) and were seated much quicker than I was expecting. The waiter was quick, kind, and knowledgeable and after looking at the Winterlicious menu for well over a week, I knew exactly what I wanted.<br><br>We were given yummy, fresh bread to start with the most wonderful olives I&#39;ve ever tasted. I am usually put off by how salty olives are but these were soft and doused in the yummiest olive oil (with some on the side as well), that I&#39;ve tried in a while. It&#39;s possible we dipped the entire bread basket over the course of the meal.<br><br>We ordered the grilled sardine and the grilled octopus/calamari to start. It&#39;s unfortunate we shared because while the sardine was great, the calamari was unbelievable. <br><br>&#34;So THAT&#39;S what it&#39;s supposed to taste like..&#34; I said.<br><br>We also ordered some wine - a suggested glass of red and white (though the names escape it) - very good stuff and cheaper for Winterlicious ($9 and $8) than the stuff on their regular menu. <br><br>For the main, I had the salmon and my boy had Tile fish - and since he&#39;s a salmon lover I was surprised when he said he loved his much more than mine. That being said, I was thrilled with my dish and the plum chutney, beets, and small salad underneath. The fish was great. <br><br>The dessert was okay - we got some sort of chocolate/strawberry cake - but the highlight was my boyfriend&#39;s Americano, which was so good he said he hasn&#39;t had anything quite like it since we came back from Europe. <br><br>The waiter made a mistake on our check, charging us for the dinner, but was so quick to fix it when we pointed it out that it was unbelievable. The service is absolutely incredible. We would go back just for that. He offered to have a new coffee made for my boyfriend since he was still finishing his wine and &#34;it might have cooled&#34;. <br><br>It&#39;s kind of nice being treated like royalty, and the dishes literally coming out within a minute of you finishing the current dish. Timed like magic. Never experienced before, nothing will live up to this again.",

Pizza was on point with the best of &#39;em. Pasta dishes are made simple, yet flavourful. A real old world feeling here. Service was very warm and welcoming.

Last time I was there, I had the &#34;white salad&#34; to start (pears, endive, fennel), which was lovely and an unexpected mix of flavours, and a chestnut ravioli which was incredible, if a bit oily. Usually I get the beet salad, which is also great.<br><br>Service can be a bit up-and-down, we&#39;ve had great service and mediocre service. You never which you&#39;re going to get, really.

I was shocked, sad and confused. What do I say? How do we move on from this? <br><br>A few months ago, I came back. It was nice seeing you again and I&#39;m glad you&#39;re back on your feet. It was awkward, but I think we can do this.  Your crispy beef is just as tantalizing as ever, the buns are fresh and juicy, the cold noodles are still my favourite.  It&#39;s good to know that you haven&#39;t changed and we can pick up where we left off.

"reviewcomment":"Riding off the business success since appearing in and winning a Burger Wars episode, Parkdale&#39;s Parts and Labour diner opened this Queen West burger-focused takeout satellite location. Great, because Dangerous Dan&#39;s got attitude issues but no tissue, and my first date with the severely overrated Burger&#39;s Preist left me unimpressed. (You are free to read my other reviews for the lack of regard harboured for those two losers, but lest I digress.)<br><br>Opening up in the Queen/Spadina area means they already have some stiff saturated competition to contend wih from established burger names on the block, like McDonald&#39;s, Hero, and yes bloody hell, the new Queen West offshoot of BP. But one first bite of the signature P&amp;L burger tells me they can hold their own here.<br><br>Holy burger-flippin mooseball crapcakes, that&#39;s one mad grease bomb I ingested. And I loved every bite of this giant greasy juicy mess. The Castor is also good, but the Philly is my favourite. If you love having a spicy kick to your patty, then the Philly&#39;s concoction of mushrooms and jalapeños ought to shut you up and make you stop worshiping those other burger guys down the street.<br><br>A doodle wall should keep you occupied while you wait. Orders are picked up at the very back when your number is called. All burgers are $8-9, and throw in some fries and a soda for $3 more, not so bad on the gourmet burgers scale. (Though apparently they cannot add extra toppings, but no problem with subtraction.) Seating in this narrow space is limited to a small handful along two bar tables.<br><br>Having been on a search for the best greasy burger in Toronto that doesn&#39;t leave me fuming, P&amp;L is definitely a strong contender in my books to recommend others to.<br><br>{TTC: the 501er to Augusta Ave. P&amp;L arguably got the brightest sign on the block.}",

"reviewcomment":"Lining up outside the Sunset on the weekend is almost a Beaches tradition, which holds that causal, low-cost, cheery, plenty and friendly is what works -- probably why there are three diners in the main part of the strip, and only one or at most two fine dining spots. <br>The toast is always thick and I really enjoy the dark rye. The fruit bowl is always good. My dad would never eat pork and beans because he ate so much during the Depression, but beans are a popular side dish here, altho they are a bit sweet and have not much of a distinctive taste.<br>I like diners most when a yearning for an old fashioned Happy Days breakfast to get over a hangover won&#39;t go away; at other times I get disappointed. That must be me today because I&#39;m wishing there was something more distinctive about the beans or the eggs -- something like local and sustainable or something far away from a can of pork and beans from the 1950s.<br>The other thing I enjoy in diners is the look of people getting a start on life. The waitresses are always good-humored and efficient in a friendly way, and will be going somewhere when they&#39;ve saved a bit of money; and the short order cooks are immigrants who are making their way in an industry that isn&#39;t too expensive to get into and relies mainly on hard and steady work.<br>As I argue in my book Food for City Building, providing a start in life is one major function of a restaurant strip, and you can see that here.",

The beef-tek was amazing, a hamburger patty stuffed with amazing cheese etc... and the portions are huge. <br><br>What made the Danforth popular in days gone by was good cheap Greek food served from a steam table, they all did it that way at one time. Everything dish under the sun was available, you pick what you want as you walk by and then they would bring it to you all at a very low price. The Danforth seems to be struggling with going high-end and I personally just don&#39;t class iceberg lettuce, pork, rice and potato&#39;s as high end. <br><br>This place is good but I would like to see a return to the old style steam table.",

Healthy (no guilt) but quite delicious. We had the hummus to start, which was different--as in chunkier than the hummus we&#39;re used to. I had the salmon with mango salsa and bakchoy, which I really liked. Light, fresh and well flavoured.<br><br>Service was attentive but never obtrusive. If you&#39;re looking for a good, quiet place in the PATH to catch up with someone, this place is one of the better ones out there. Ambience is great, and the tables aren&#39;t really built for a leisurely lunch, but rather a working day lunch, if you know what I mean--upscale look but not deep seating.<br><br>Perfect for folks working in the financial district.",

You might think $30 is quite a bit for a few tacos and drinks, but in my mind the quality of the food makes the price fair. <br><br>What I love was the fact that they have all the stuff already prepped but they put it out &#34;on display&#34; in small portions so that you don&#39;t end up with brown lettuce and dried out meat. I saw bowls filled with cut tortillas standing by and ready to freshly deep fry if you just so happen to have a nacho craving.<br><br> We liked the food so much we ended up splitting a tres leche cake for $4 some odd i think it was $4.95 it was EXCELLENT very fresh tasting. It also had a nice spring to the cake so much so that the milk just soaked right into the cake but the cake still held up to all the liquid it was sopping up. It was a great wrap up to a good meal. <br><br>Staff: I want to especially mention the line manager for the night, she was so super friendly, and once she found out it was our first time there she made sure to explain everything about the restaurant with a ton of gusto!  She def made the experience a good one. <br><br>In short - it&#39;s a definite try if you are in the neighbourhood.",

"reviewcomment":"The place itself is a bit outdated.  Needs a touch up.  Very simple but simple is sometimes better I guess.  I didn&#39;t know what to expect but the service was Wonderful!!! Our waitress was very helpful and sweet.  <br><br>I was not a fan of crab cakes and have tried them in various places but that day, I fell in love!  Best crab cakes I ever had.  We were told it wasn&#39;t sharing portions but the size of these crab cakes were pretty big.  You can share it if you want.  We certainly could have just had 1 since we had steak and sides coming. <br><br>Now on to the steak...I had a filet mignon and WOW!!! Perfectly cooked!  I like mine medium and a bit of pink.  I have to say, it was exactly how I asked.  <br><br>The wine was great, the vodka sodas we ordered after were perfectly made too...Overall, I will definitely be dining at Shore Club again.",

"reviewcomment":"Let me start by saying that I have stomach flu so I can&#39;t eat anything spicy or greasy. How I got it is another story.<br><br>Back to the review. So I was on the lookout for a non-spicy, non-greasy option in the PATH, and spotted the chicken noodle soup here. Initially I thought $9.05 (what the medium size cost with taxes) was pricey. Well I still think it&#39;s pricey, but it was very flavourful so I&#39;m willing to forget that for a few minutes. It was good hearty soup. But I didn&#39;t necessarily want the sides that come with it--I&#39;d rather pay a little less.<br><br>The line was long, but moved at a reasonable pace. Soup of the spicier options looked delicious, and I bet those are more worth the money than the chicken noodle. I&#39;ll be back to try those. <br><br>This should have been a 3.5 but I&#39;ll update soon.",

I&#39;ll give it a good rating because I think it deserves one even though not everything about the place lived up to my expectations. It deserves a 3 star at best.

"reviewcomment":"I&#39;m not sure what&#39;s taken me so long to write a review for Daily Sushi. Its close to where I live and I go there once a week in the late evenings. I admit, I have a soft spot for Daily Sushi. First off, the male waiter (or owner??) who works in the evenings is very sweet and very professional. He always smiles. He doesn&#39;t write down your order, but he repeats your order item by item after you place it and has not once put in a wrong order for me. Not once. There is a female waitress who also works in the evening. She has a bit of an attitude to her, but for the most part they work together so the male waiter offsets my displeasure with the girl. <br><br>The menu is quite expansive and I like to try new things so I tend to take a while looking things over. I think tea is complimentary, but you need to ask for it. They bring your drinks, soup, and salad very quickly. Their miso soup is exactly how I like it. And your meal comes quickly too. They refill water, and tea and check in with you just the right amount - they are very attentive, but don&#39;t push you to hurry up. The prices are very reasonable and portions are large. I tend to go for some type of bento combination - and it feeds the beast in me. I really like sashimi and find it acceptable at Daily Sushi. The portions are generous -- to the point when sometimes I think the pieces might be too thick -- but I do love me some raw fish, so I would never complain. I tried the ramen and wasn&#39;t terribly impressed with the broth - but I think I&#39;ve been spoiled in the ramen department so it would be hard to reach my standard. As for sushi rolls, I&#39;m not a fan of their sushi rice. I don&#39;t like the taste or the texture of it so I steer clear of it. I&#39;ll admit I&#39;m pretty snobbish about sushi rice so this may not be an issue for others. <br><br>Once you are done, they are fine with you sitting and relaxing for as long as you&#39;d like. In fact, they won&#39;t bring the bill until you ask, but will then bring it promptly.  <br><br>Is it the best sushi you&#39;ll have in Toronto? Heck no. But I do find comfort and nourishment at Daily Sushi -- and they are open till 11pm most nights -- which is a huge plus!",

"reviewcomment":"I work across the street from Caffe Di Portici, and absolutely love this cafe. I have had dinner at the cafe twice, and come in at least three times a week for coffee or food. My coworkers love this cafe, and my dinner guests have been thoroughly impressed by the food and service we have received.<br><br>Both during the day time, and night time, the cafe is cozy, warm, inviting, upscale, and comfortable. Great place for evening drinks, or a date. The patio on a sunny day, or a warm evening, is an absolute delight.<br><br>As for specifics, the pizza is some of the best I have ever had! Thin crust, with the perfect combination of toppings and sauces. The desserts are rich and delicious,  the coffee and refreshments are perfect, and the owner and employees are warm, gracious, and diligent.",

"reviewcomment":"I came to Universal Grill for brunch about a year back- it tasted great, was crowded and bustling, and we were in and out fairly quickly. An OK experience but nothing that made me want to crawl back for dinner. Too bad that I&#39;ve wasted so many months thinking about where to eat next when what I was really looking for...was staring me right in the face the whole time (sort of like Fox and Scully).<br><br>Came for a dinner in what I&#39;d describe as an &#34;upscale-diner&#34; environment. The menu had a comfort-food vibe, but designed by someone who&#39;s adept at preparing more classically higher-tier fare. Does that make sense? I hope so. <br><br>The ambience was great, the servers were kind and beautiful, and my main dish of cornmeal crusted cod was perfect. Very much in the face of my &#34;there&#39;s no good seafood in Toronto&#34; attitude. <br><br>I went with Evelyn W, so It was actually a 4-star experience...but I won&#39;t take that away from them.

Cucumber wrapped instead of rice. So good. The sashimi is served on a bed of ice so they don&#39;t get warm from sitting out. The sushi rolls were decently sized although a bit too much rice for my liking. <br><br>Grilled foods were flavourful however don&#39;t expect great cuts of meat for all you can eat. Beef was a bit chewy. What really blew me away was presentation of the foods. Each dish came out nicely presented. You can tell they put effort in it and it looks nice but we quickly ran out of room on our table because the plates were so big. <br><br>They serve black sesame ice cream which is a win in my books. Didn&#39;t bother to try the other stuff.<br><br>The washroom was also surprising as it&#39;s unisex so just be wary of that. Service was alright. They weren&#39;t that busy when I was there however and it still took a while for refills.<br><br>Overall, one of the better AYCE I&#39;ve been to. Definitely worth a visit.",

"reviewcomment":"Went here recently on a trip to Toronto and had a pretty good experience. The service was excellent. The first morning we went, I ordered the Belgian Waffle with Apple and Vanilla Ice Cream and loved it. I didn&#39;t even need to put syrup on it, when I&#39;m usually one of those people who likes to drown their pancakes and waffles in syrup. The square coffee cups were neat.<br><br>The second morning I wasn&#39;t quite as impressed, I got the Swiss, Broccoli and Chicken omelette which didn&#39;t have nearly enough fillings. My fiancé ordered the western omelette but wanted cheese instead of the green peppers. They added green peppers anyway along with the cheese, but didn&#39;t charge for the cheese. <br><br>Overall, it was a decent breakfast and I&#39;d eat there again if I was in the area.",
