"reviewcomment":"We went to this place on our trip to Spain mostly because of Yelp reviews.  It was good for what it was - a Spanish Dive Bar.  For €10  we had two beers and they gave us two heaping plates of various tapas.  Definitely not the best tapas out there but it filled the belly.  All and all great drinking food.  Seemed like there were a lot of college kids who were studying abroad and a fair amount of locals.  If I went back to Spain and I was looking to have a few drinks and something to pick on, this place would certainly be in the consideration.",

I&#39;m a tourist aren&#39;t I?!? I learned a long time ago just because a place attracts tourist doesn&#39;t mean it can&#39;t be good. <br><br>My wife and I had: a full pitcher of Sangria (Excellent), Shared the Artichokes with Jamon (Drools),  Suckling Pig (pretty good), Suckling Lamb (actually better than the pork in my opinion), and we shared a flan (welcome the surprising star of the show!). and I had an espresso.  <br><br>People say it&#39;s rather pricey - the food listed above came out to 81 Euro and I felt that it was worth it as a whole for the experience.  The staff was excellent and very accommodating.<br><br>Food Ranking Based on what we had here for me:<br>1.

We got the salt cod fritters, ham croquettes, chorizo and some manchego to go with our red wine. All of it was top notch and I would highly recommend any of them. Scoring a place to stand and dine was a bit tough since it was so crowded, but with some patience and luck, we were on our way.

"reviewcomment":"When I planned my trip to Madrid, I had a mission to eat as much jamon Iberico as I could. So before I left for Spain, I had bookmarked Museo del Jamon and was determined to stop by before I left the city. Luckily, when my husband and I were walking to the Mercado de San Miguel, we saw the Museo on Calle Mayor. The place did not disappoint and was packed with tourists and locals. The best thing to do is to stand at the bar and order food from the servers. The bar can get packed at times so you&#39;ll have to squeeze between patrons to place an order. It&#39;s a great bargain for food because everything in Europe is expensive. For two bocadillos de jamon and two canas, we spent less than 8 euro total. They even give you a small plate of chorizo sausages for free.<br><br>A great bargain if you love Spanish ham sandwiches but I wouldn&#39;t say it was the best bocadillo I had in Madrid.",

This is definitely the most affordable good brunch spot in the city, as others are often twice as expensive and probably not as good. The mimosas are also terrific, and they offer great weekend specials on them. <br><br>The restaurant is a bit small, so I would recommend calling ahead for reservations, especially if you&#39;re going for brunch as it is a popular spot, especially for expats. Their sister restaurant is right down the street and is just as good (La Gringa). You might get seated there if you come to dine, but it will be the same menu and same great staff.",

"reviewcomment":"After reading all the reviews on Yelp, we decided to check it out.  The prices were comparable to most places, if not cheaper.  I showed up at 8pm on a Saturday with a coworker and found the restaurant to be empty.  Despite us not having a reservation, the lady seated us immediately.  It&#39;s a nice restaurant, the atmosphere is quiet and is very clean.  We ordered the gazpacho for an appetizer, it was amazingly refreshing.  It is on the thinner side compared to what was served at Botin, but still very good.  The bread comes with an aioli which was amazing, WAY better than butter.  We ordered the Paella Mixta and it could most likely feed 3, or 2 people with a big appetite.  The rice was perfect, the calamari melted in your mouth, the fish and mussels were really good, the chicken and pork, yes were slightly on the drier side, but what can you expect, it&#39;s paella.  The blend of flavors was perfect.  I ordered the flan for dessert and it wasn&#39;t up to par with Botin or Cafe Julian, but that could just be my preference.  It&#39;s not the &#34;well done&#34; style flan and there was almost an orange hue/flavor to it as well.  The scoop of vanilla ice cream that accompanied it was out of this world.  If I were to go back, I would order any of the desserts that included the ice cream, it tasted homemade and was super rich.<br><br>They were very english friendly even though I ordered and spoke Spanish.  They accept credit cards and have no problems splitting the bill (just tell them how much you want charged to your card).  The service was spot on, no problems whatsoever.  It is a nice restaurant, and expect a &#34;nice&#34; restaurant bill.  My share of the tab came to about 35 Euro plus a 3 Euro tip.",

I have had both, and I can honestly say, everything so far has been excellent. Good portions and good taste. I&#39;ve had their salads, their meatballs and potatoes, their macaroni, their meat and potatoes...I&#39;ve sampled the salmorejo, and the pasta is good as well. If it is available, get the chocolate ice cream with turron...omg. <br><br>The only con is that a small bread is 1 euro. The water bottles are bigger than in other restaurants but to me, they&#39;re still too small. Regardless, I love this place...If you&#39;re too scandalized by prostitutes, I don&#39;t suggest you come here, as they are all over this particular neighborhood...If you&#39;re normal, then I definitely recommend this restaurant!",

"reviewcomment":"This is such a cool place. Vintage to the max. Thank goodness it&#39;s right around the corner from my boyfriend&#39;s place. Between HD Cafteria and its across-the-street neighbor Tierra, we&#39;ve always got good options to choose from. The decor and &#34;feel&#34; of the place leave nothing to be desired. It reminds me of an old American diner, actually, but not in the tacky 1950&#39;s way, more the retro, classy, comfortable way of a cafeteria. <br><br>For some reason, my first time I was there, everyone kept dropping everything. It was quite funny as waiters dropped a couple of items, I dropped my napkin, other guests seemed to drop cutlery, etc. Totally just a chance thing, but it was a fun way to remember the restaurant. Very memorable first experience.<br><br>It&#39;s just gotten better and better since that time. I like how they deep fry the cheddar cheese for the burgers, making it into a crispy sheet of deliciousness. Most recently we tried one of the salads, and though it was a bit on the smaller side, it was definitely tasty. I haven&#39;t tried the desserts yet, so I&#39;ll save that commentary for the next time. As far as drinks, I would recommend the tinto de verano HD with a special anis liquor. Very, very delicious (you&#39;ll want more than one!). <br><br>The staff is super friendly and hipster in a good way. They just sort of fit. Now that it&#39;s summer, the terraza is in full swing and I&#39;d recommend that you make it your new hot spot on any given summer night.",

I agree with previous comments that the Spicy Chicken Sechuan Style is great, but I also enjoyed the Spicy Chicken Ma La very much. You should definitely try their dumpling soup or the &#34;sizzling dumplings&#34;, which are made fresh by the whole family and taste awesome. 5 stars straight!",

"reviewcomment":"Down a small, crowded alley we trudged to reach Malaspina. This is the indie movie Spanish experience the hipsters want--a tiny road off the main drag lined with authentic tapas bars and outdoor seating for your slim-smoking pleasure. However, the rather undesirable aspect is the beggars; not actual homeless people, but workers of the tapas bars trying so desperately to get you in their spot. There was a man who literally followed me down the road trying to get me in, and then once I had my meal elsewhere and walked past him again, he followed me and asked why I didn&#39;t come to his restaurant. Like really?<br><br>Either way, Malaspina was certainly the superior choice. Between the three of us, we ordered pimientos del piquillo (stuffed red peppers, deep fried in a pepper cream sauce), chorizo on toast, croquettas de jamon, and carne asado. The meal also began with a complimentary Spanish tortilla and ended with a shot...so essentially this could be my home. Not only that, but it cost us only 32€ for that and drinks! The food was absolutely delicious, service on point and extremely helpful, and the atmosphere was tavern-y and warm. Overall an excellent first meal in Madrid.",

Not a bad deal!<br>This was the first time that I risked it to try eggs benedict after coming back from Ireland, and it was a great success. The eggs were perfectly soft (well one of them was not very liquidy but the taste was great) and the sauce was nice and vinegary, just the way I like it! They added some sort of creamy sauce at the bottom just under the muffin (which was not an english muffin but some sort of tasty spanish soft bread) that matched the dish just perfect. <br>We will definitely come back for brunch!",

"reviewcomment":"I will never return to this restaurant again, not because of the food (which was good for Spanish standards), but because of the offensive decoration. The owner of this place takes advantage of the fact that Spanish people know little of the meaning of Confederate flags. The place is excessively decorated by all kinds of Confederate flags. <br><br>Nunca volvere a este sitio, no por la comida, sino por la decoración ofensiva. La mayoria de los Españoles no se daran cuenta cuando visiten este restaurante de que estan en un sitio decorado de banderas que en EEUU son muy racistas. Esta bandera fue la bandera del Sur cuando EEUU tuvo su guerra civil. Para muchos esta bandera es sinonima con el racismo y la defensa de la exclavitud.",

For dinner, it helps to come during the less busy hours, which in Spain means anytime between 4 pm and 8 pm. Around 8:30, a line begins to form for those dining in. <br><br>We ordered the fried dumplings, the chow mein, stir fried snap peas, and a pork noodle soup. The noodle soup was hearty and featured thick and chewy handmade noodles in a rich broth with plenty of meat and vegetables. The dumplings were handmade and fried, with thicker wrappers and hearty pieces of pork inside. The chow mein was satisfying- just oily and salty enough. The snap peas were stir fried with garlic and were very fresh. <br><br>The staff are busy but very patient and accommodating. The price was very reasonable, and for people who are craving Chinese food and don&#39;t mind the greasy variety it&#39;s just right!",

After being disappointed, I turned around and found that they have another location right across the street! Make sure you look around before you turn away. <br><br>The restaurant is really small and it&#39;s standing room only, mainly because it&#39;s a quick eatery type of place. The menu is small and they&#39;re known for their gambas al ajillo, garlic shrimp, which is the only thing we ordered before we went to our next dinner. The gambas al ajillo is made on a small stovetop in the restaurant. It&#39;s a very small portion and it&#39;s sizzling in the garlic oil when it&#39;s presented to you. The shrimps are cooked perfectly, there&#39;s chunks of garlic, and you get bread with this. I&#39;ve had this dish at many places and have to say this is the best I&#39;ve ever had. It was sooo good. My only regret is that we didn&#39;t order more!<br><br>Must visit!",

"reviewcomment":"I used to live in Madrid years ago, and when I returned for vacation recently I made sure to go to Juana la Loca and see if the food lived up to my memories. It does. Quite simply, Juana la Loca serves some of the best food I have ever eaten. <br><br>The food is rooted in Spanish cuisine, but is innovative and sometimes experimental. Tortilla de patatas is improved upon with the addition of dark, rich caramelized onions, cochinillo is made meltingly tender thanks to a lard confit (not unlike Mexican carnitas),  excellent fideuà is served with house-made squid sausage with a wonderful bouncy texture.<br><br>Juana la Loca also borrows freely from other cuisines and just makes stuff up when it serves. Their Asian-inspired duck confit spring roll is probably the best thing I&#39;ve ever eaten. Beef carpaccio comes with house-made olive oil ice cream, accenting and elevating the taste of the marinated raw beef into something simultaneously fresh and rich. In a mish-mash of cuisines, techniques, flavors and colors that justify the name &#34;Joanna the Crazy,&#34; soft-shell crab is deep-fried and served on a Chinese steamed bun with jamon, chimichurri mayo, and tobiko. Try everything.<br><br>The staff is very friendly, as this place is a bit off the beaten path for tourists, most servers speak little or no English. There are English menus available, and you can get by OK on pointing, but if you don&#39;t speak Spanish it might be worth whipping out your Spanish - English dictionary for their recommendations and wines by the glass.<br><br>Inconveniently cash only, which is particularly problematic as you will almost certainly spend more money than you expected here. It&#39;s that good. Worth it.",

"reviewcomment":"This was a nice spot that was recommended to us by the taxi driver. We told him to take us where the locals go and he dropped us off here. <br><br>It was a Monday night and we sat at the bar (the 3 of us) and we ordered an assortment of Tapas from the bar menu. We ordered a house red that was very good, a pincho of Chicken, some cheese, ham croquettes. I remember ordering something else but I can&#39;t remember what it was since this was about 3 weeks ago, but I remember it was pretty darn good!  :-) I think it was meat in sauce with mushrooms.<br><br>I liked the vibe. The service was good, maybe because we sat at the bar so we were able to get service quickly.  It was pretty full for a Monday night and being by the square was a nice place to see the people walking around after dinner. Cabs are easy to find.",

The food was excellent and the staff are lovely and helpful and there is free WiFi.   The first occasion we just had starters and wine and stayed in the bar area but on the second we went all out 3 courses.  The vegi platter is huge, but i was craving vegetables after a few days of tapas and lots of carbs.  Love it and will be back.",

Very chill, delicious pubby-American-style food--try the nachos, burgers (the onion one) and now their jalapeno poppers--and especially the great service. There&#39;s no cover for concerts, and their twice-a-year (on their anniversary mid-Nov &amp; for St. Patricks) feature of The Colonials is can&#39;t miss.  It being the biggest Irish bar in Madrid, including a big Terraza, it allows them to have other off-the-beaten path events, like Madrid&#39;s Tweet-Up. And it&#39;s the perfect place to watch us win Pub Trivia on Monday nights!",

I never had food there yet but it looks very great ont the tables of the other people - will for sure try it soon and then write about it!<br>For having a drink in the late evening &#34;El Viajero&#34; is a wonderful place! Try to find a place in the first floor, with sight over the Pza de la Cebada. Interior design is very great and there is a special atmposphere! There is also a DJ on some weekends and you can dance in the bar! Clients are mostly between 25 and 40 and it&#39;s a bit upscale. If good wheater (e.g.: on a sunday afternoon, after having visited nerly located &#34;el Rastro&#34;) you should go to the Rooftop in El Viajero.

"reviewcomment":"While I only spent a short part of a long night at Areia I&#39;d go back in a heartbeat. Great music was playing as soon as I walked in around 1 a.m. No lame cheesy top 40s music that you hear in most clubs nowadays. <br><br>Great service. From the front door guy who opened the door and didn&#39;t give me any nonsense lip about an ID to the bar service. Everything was great. It&#39;s a bit expensive for a drink but...treat yourself. <br><br>There is limited seating available and a few tables as well as an area in the back to well...chill out. Also, there aren&#39;t tons of 20 year olds here. A dare I say it &#39;grown and sexy&#39; crowd is what you&#39;ll mostly find. Definitely somewhere you can slip on that little black dress for if you feel inclined but not too fancy or pretentious. <br><br>Great vibe.",

"reviewcomment":"The only reason this place isn&#39;t getting five stars is because I thought the quality of the beef could have been better. A little fatty and tough for my taste...but to each his own.  I have to admit I was nervous trying Asian food in Spain as I had yet to.  I didn&#39;t know what to expect but we had this place recommended to us by a friend.  It was delicious as well as reasonably prices!!  The spring rolls melt in your mouth and the chicken curry was a delightful delicious surprise.  The chicken was great quality...big chunks of white chicken breast meat and the sauce was super flavorful. All of the cooks and waiters are Asian so you know you are getting authentic cuisine. I definitely plan on coming back here many more times during my stay in Madrid!",

Penne with pesto and tuna steak with red fruit reduction, Korean empanadillas and Thai chicken for my wife - everything was top notch and everybody was very accommodating toward our one year old. The place was filling up just as we left and seemed to be quite popular with business lunch types. Too bad we waited for the last day otherwise we probably would have gone back!!!",

"reviewcomment":"I first heard about Public when a friend told me that she and some friends had stumbled upon a very decently-priced, fairly gourmet restaurant in the center - little did I know that this restaurant is just around the corner from my piso! So, claro, I took her recommendation and decided to try it out for date night.<br><br>We were seated very easily (albeit pretty damn close to the folks next to us, though there were plenty of open tables). Perhaps most eye-catching about this locale are the stellar prices. The decor is elegant and cozy, but gratefully the price point doesn&#39;t escalate to match it.<br><br>We split the guacamole and goat cheese salad and the solomillo. Both were perfectly adequate and not lacking in size. For dessert, we went for the brownie and vanilla ice cream... delicious! Though, be warned, the brownie is extremely rich... probably could have dealt with another scoop of ice cream to balance it out. <br><br>I would say that in a major metropolitan city like Madrid, Public is what we&#39;d call a safe bet. Price is on point, quality is on point, and decoration is too.",

The patties were ball shaped and too thick to cook quickly. We had to send it back to cook more and requested medium but juicy... as suspected, when we got it back it was very well done like a leather belt. Took three bites, drank my beer and rolled out. I still have not given up finding a good burger in Madrid. I will try Home burger next and post my review. Maybe I&#39;m just too picky, others there seemed to like it.",

"reviewcomment":"If I could give this restaurant 6 stars, I would.  I was impressed with absolutely everything about it: the decor, the atmosphere, the service, the menu, and, well, the food is truly great.  The prices are excellent for the quality of the dishes and the overall experience.  <br><br>We shared the mango ceviche as a starter, solomillo (sirloin) and atún (tuna) as our main course and brownie with pear tartar for desert.  We also ordered a bottle of Fontal tempranillo 2007 from La Mancha which was surprisingly light and a very nice accompaniment to the meal.  I think that they have a small but good selection of wine and spirits to choose from, as well.  The complimentary appetizer, stuffed peppers with tuna and habas, was delicious.  And, as soon as we finished those up, the ceviche arrived.  I was concerned that the mango, being out of season, would be underripe and tart, but it was as tender and sweet as can be, and perfectly combined with the corvina and a flakey black salt on the side.  It&#39;s really delicious. Our entrees came out next, perfectly timed and perfectly presented, cooked and quickly consumed.  These dishes were all prepared with great skill and the end results were always impressive and absolutely delicious.  <br><br>I highly recommend it for a nice, intimate dinner for a small group or a romantic evening for 2.   Though, it did appear that there was plenty of room in the back dining area to accommodate larger groups.  <br><br>Price per person- 30 eur and up. I don&#39;t think you&#39;ll be disappointed. <br><br>The word is most definitely out, so be sure to make reservations.",

"reviewcomment":"Located near both the Thyssen and Prado museums, we randomly chose this spot for our lunch break after seeing the beautiful decor. Both the wine and tapas were so reasonably priced, we couldn&#39;t help but indulge in a moderately boozy lunch. This isn&#39;t your average tapas restaurant. They do serve some of the classics - for instance, they have a yummy Iberian ham croquette. However, they also reinvent some of the classics in interesting ways - one example being the 21st century tortilla, which was served as a soup. They take pains to present everything beautifully, from the wine menu in the shape of a wine bottle, to the bill presented on a sardine can. If you&#39;re looking for traditional tapas, this place probably isn&#39;t for you. But if you want to try somewhere a little more playful, this is a great spot.",

This is a super cool spot underground, and is very busy on the weekends (though you don&#39;t normally have to wait long for a seat).<br><br>The cocktails are great, especially those with egg whites (clearly called out on the menu).

"reviewcomment":"Do you fall prey to terrace envy? It&#39;s that feeling I get walking around the neighborhood on a sunny day and longily watch people smiling and enjoying delicious food on a patio when I am in a rush to get somewhere else. I found it happening constantly when I passed by Ojala so knew once I had a free moment on a gorgeous day, I would head here first. <br><br>Unfortunately, we were not the only ones to have such a thought. The second the resto opened up for lunch, the outside tables filled up and the rest of the crowd hovered over them like vultures to grab the next available one as soon as quickly as possible. Once we snagged one for ourselves, we ordered fruit smoothies and to share, degustation plates of first and third courses that allowed us to try a little bit of everything. Standouts were the fresh guacamole and creamy hummus, the juicy hamburger and tangy noodles, but everything together hit the spot. Even though I felt like we got to try a lot and certainly filled up, our bill didn&#39;t top 15 Euros each. <br><br>The service was good and if it wasn&#39;t for the people eyeing our table, I was comfortable enough to hang out there all day long. Although the decor inside is cool and different, I&#39;m not sure I would go out of my way to come here just for the food. It is definitely the sunny terrace in the nice plaza that gives it a leg up.",

For the appetizer I&#39;d recommend a salad! They were great! I got a hamburger for my entree. It was surprisingly good! It had crispy bacon pieces on it and grilled onion &amp; cheese. I think the only thing I didn&#39;t like was the cheese! Everything else was great! I got a sort of lemon coffee cake with raspberry sauce on top which was moist and delicious! <br><br>I&#39;d definitely go back! Maybe only for a menu del dia though, because it was such a great deal! :)<br><br>As far as service goes, I didn&#39;t see anything out of the ordinary for Spain...

"reviewcomment":"After walking around allll over the city looking for a suitable American-style brunch (and not a particularly expensive one), we finally came to The Toast. It was like a mirage through our hunger-colored glasses - the decorations were cozy and comfortable, with cool old-timey photos on the walls and plenty of room. Once we discovered that the Sunday brunch was only 12E (without alcohol, 16E with), we decided to sit on down. <br><br>At first it was a little awkward because the people working here clearly speak perfect English and get a lot of English-speaking visitors... so when the waiter came to take our order, he spoke in English. My Spanish boyfriend was a little confused so I took over and everything was fine, but throughout the whole meal we weren&#39;t sure whether to continue in English or Spanish with the other members of the staff. Minor detail though. Another small thing was when we ordered our coffee and I said we wanted it with the meal instead of afterwards. I know here in Spain it&#39;s normally taken afterwards, but if you&#39;re going for the American-style brunch, might as well serve a big cup o joe as we Americans do - with the brunch. Our waiter made me repeat this several times to make sure he understood it correctly.<br><br>We ordered a couple of pancakes to start. Salmon and cream cheese was one and the other was banana and nuts. Delicious. It&#39;s been many months since I&#39;ve had such lovely pancakes. For the second course I got the eggs benedict with bacon (also served with home fries) and my boyfriend got the huevos rancheros with spicy sauce on the side. At this point we were pretty stuffed so though we didn&#39;t finished these plates, they were quite good. <br><br>All in all, I would definitely return to The Toast for brunch. Or lunch or dinner, for that matter. The cozy and inviting atmosphere makes it a perfect choice for a lazy Sunday.",

"reviewcomment":"This is my favorite cafe in my neighborhood. I love the coziness and the decor. It&#39;s very welcoming and homey. I&#39;ve come here a number of times and while I&#39;ve been wanting to try everything on the menu from quiche to salad, hummus or their fresh soup I can&#39;t make it past the cake! From carrot cake, dulce de leche, chocolate, cheesecake and honey nut I&#39;ve tried almost all of their cakes. They are quite simply delicious. They have breakfast, lunch and special merienda menus as well and everything seems well prepared.They serve many varieties of tea, milkshakes, chocolate and coffee. They also have a full bar.<br><br>As a small business I respect the two person operation, with one chef and the bartender/waiter. Take your patience when you head to El Azul and you will be kindly rewarded.",

"reviewcomment":"Wow...what an experience!  The restaurant is over 140 years old and has consistently won awards for having the best and most unique Cocido Madrileno in Madrid (slow cooked, incredibly marinated stew).  It is very slow cooked in an earthen jar over low flame, and they throw in so many tasty ingredients (which they let us watch in the kitchen)...the stew includes lamp, pork, chicken, fat, noodles, special Madrid water, and spices (and more).  It is cooked over a great smelling coal fire and is hands down the best broth and stew we (entire family) ever tasted.  <br><br>Apparently the restaurant has two sittings for lunch and is not open for dinner because the stew is &#34;too heavy&#34; to have at night. The service is excellent and fast.  Place is frequented by locals and by tourists and it boasts Michelin Stars. <br><br>Be sure to bring cash/euros...they do not accept credit cards and make reservations or you will likely not get a table.",

"reviewcomment":"Food: After running the Rock n&#39; Roll Madrid Marathon, I was super hungry. So I walked from my room to this place based on the reviews. I ordered their paella, the tripe stew, and a glass of Berceo red wine. The paella was pretty good and I love seafood! But the tripe stew wasn&#39;t that great. It was a bit overcooked and chewy for my taste.<br><br>Service: I had good service and they were able to understand English, but my waiter totally sized me up and thought I couldn&#39;t eat everything that I wanted to order. So I had to prove it to him by eating the paella first and then ordered the tripe stew. That caused a rather lengthy wait because it took a while to cook the tripe stew. I guess it&#39;s not a very popular item on the menu.<br><br>Location: It was pretty loud and seemed like a really popular place to be.",

We saddled up on one of the high-top stools and were waited on immediately. The first that that caught my eye was the long list of interesting drinks from tinto de verano made with white wine to cider sangria. Everything we tried was refreshing and came in their own can, making it more special. <br><br>I didn&#39;t find the food too bad either. I was impressed by their wide array of salad choices, something not too common here in Spain. Once I saw that 2 of their 3 &#34;menu del dia&#34; options included your choice of salad, I knew I would go with that. Their tapas are unique- with many things coming encased in a mini bread bowl. To top it off, the food is served in a chic brown box and our waitress knew just how to arrange all four of our meals to fit just right. <br><br>Sure the salad was doused in too much dressing but I can get over that. Outside on their nice patio on an afternoon day, this would still be one of my favorite spots in the area.",

(Especially when you&#39;re all tapassed out.)<br>Its funny there was nothing but Americans in here. Prolly Yelpers!<br>I got the green chili enchiladas and was very happy.<br>My tip would be to make nice with the bartender and have him make you some tequila and sprite slam shots.  Very good and cheap.

We were impressed to find such great tasting Thai food while in Spain. <br>We tasted both the panang curry and veggie yellow curry. Both were very tasty, although not as spicy as usual. You also have to order your rice separate from the curry - I wish the curry and rice came together  like most Thai restaurants. <br>We also tasted the chicken pad Thai. Again, ask for extra spice. But over all a good dish. <br>The mango sticky rice is very excellent for dessert! <br>If you go M-W before 4pm the lunch menu is only 6€.",

"reviewcomment":"Thanks to previous reviewer as I came to have the Frances brunch.  It came with a basket of delicious regular sized pastries, two toasts with smoked salmon with poached eggs and jam and hollandaise sauce on the side.  As well, it had tea and orange juice.  Hefty for 14 euros and it could feed 2-3 people.  The eggs were pretty well done but I did not care as it was as close to brunch as I could get and yes it does feed two people.  So much so that the gentleman I shared the table with took the time to google translate to me that he cannot believe how much I eat.  I only shrugged and smiled, harder to explain I am taking most of it to go.  Lots of tourists were there since it is what you would expect from the usual cafe in North America except that the tea serving is still so pitifully small.  I enjoyed sitting in my sunny spot and got a chance to write in my journal.  I felt like I was closer to home in this place.  The service is friendly albeit they spoke very little English but I appreciate them trying to serve me as best they can even neatly packing my food to go.<br><br>If you need a touch of home come here and enjoy the delicious food.",

"reviewcomment":"I really like this place! I&#39;ve been here a number of times and yes, its a dirty hole-in-the-wall, but if you&#39;re down for that sort of thing, they give VERY generous tapas when you order a drink.  They don&#39;t serve normal-sized cañas, only jarras (the personal size, it&#39;s like a beer mug), and it&#39;s about 2.50€, but they give you a plate of paella, stew, or tortilla española with it.  Of course the tapas are hit-and-miss; on a good day you get paella, on a bad day you get bad sausage.  For the most part you get something good, and if you finish the first tapa they give you another one!  It&#39;s a cheap place to drink and fill up, and I actually really like their paella. (You can also order a ración of paella for 10€, good enough for a few people, if you don&#39;t get it as a tapa).  If you&#39;re looking for tapas, this is one of the few places in Madrid where you&#39;ll get more than a few olives or patatas bravas with your drink.",

"reviewcomment":"This place came highly recommended by our &#39;Top 10 Madrid&#39; tour guide as one of the best places to eat and drink in Old Madrid, so on our first evening in this city we knew nothing about, we decided to track it down and sample its Tapas and Vinos Finos.<br><br> We arrived here at about 8pm and sat ourselves in the basement as the upstairs was starting to get busy. We got there at just the right time, as within about 15 minutes the place absolutely packed without a table to spare. Dimly lit over two levels with a highly traditional, rustic feel of Old Madrid about the place, this is a great place to soak up the atmosphere of the city. Almendro 13 is also great value for money, despite the horrendousness of the Pound to Euro exchange rate at the moment.<br><br> One of the first things you realise about Spain is that when you order &#39;Patatas Fritas&#39; on any menu, you can never be quite sure what you&#39;re going to get: cubed fried potatoes, French fries, chips... or hot crisps. Bizarrely, the tapas menu we ordered from here revolved around the latter. Sounds a bit odd, looks a bit odd, but is fantastically tasty.<br><br> The second thing we were very quick to realise is that the bars and restaurants worth going to (i.e. the ones that aren&#39;t overpriced and geared towards tourists) don&#39;t tend to print their menus in English. So after an amusing exchange of sign language with an extremely friendly and helpful waitress, we established that &#39;pimienta&#39; is pepper, &#39;huevo&#39; means egg, &#39;lomo&#39; means pork and ordered accordingly. We also made sure to sample the &#39;jamon iberico&#39;, which is quite pricey but worth it.<br><br> For drinks, we ordered their very own white wine - Vina Almendro 13 - which we drank from tiny double measure shot glasses; not sure why, but it was certainly a novel way to enjoy this is delicious, crisp, fruity wine.<br><br> If you ever find yourself in Old Madrid of an evening, Almendro 13&#39;s atmosphere, food and wine comes very highly recommended. Just don&#39;t forget your Spanish to English menu decoder!",

"reviewcomment":"On my last day in Madrid after spending time at the Templo de Debod, I was looking for a decent sit-down place for lunch. I found Con 2 Fogones nearby with good reviews and decided to give it a try.<br><br>This is a quaint, cozy restaurant located on a quiet street (on a Saturday) off of Plaza de España. I was the only non-locals there which I loved. I ordered a duck confit for lunch and it was perfectly cooked with wonderful flavors. The meat fell off the bones and it danced beautifully with the chutney. Added caramelized pears and gorgonzola cheese to the bite...yummo!!! The servers were very friendly (even toward this non-Spanish speaking tourist) and the prices were reasonable. Who knew I could have such a fancy dish for lunch without breaking my vacation budget? I am very glad I found this place!",

"reviewcomment":"For an escape to a cafe in France without leaving the streets of Madrid, this is the place to go. I found their selection of sweet and savory crepes to be more appealing than some other places I&#39;ve checked out. In the end, I went for the vegetable crepe that was chock full of spinach, mushrooms, goat cheese and a tomato spread. I really liked the wheat-taste of the crepe mixture. It paired nicely with the vegetables and cheese but also with the chicken curry my date got. We couldn&#39;t leave without trying a sweet Nutella crepe that was melt-in-your-mouth goodness. The lady working definitely did not skimp on the Nutella and every single bit bursted with the stuff.<br><br>It&#39;s definitely a small locale so lots of people were taking their crepes to go. But we snagged one of the two tables available to enjoy our crepes quickly. None of the crepes top five Euros which make it an affordable, easy and delicious takeaway joint for whatever mood you&#39;re in.",

Their veggie options (mine with guacamole and his with soy protein) were really tasty. I love that you get 3 toppings plus all the salsa&#39;s you want. Plus all the hot sauce on the table. Ingredients are fresh and vibe is nice. Ate there at 10pm on a Wednesday and the place was still busy.<br>They have a great selection of beer. As a American living in Europe for close to two years the site of Flying Dog and Brooklyn Brewery made my heart smile.<br>The margaritas look great, although since only available in 1 ltr, we opted for beer as we didn&#39;t want to overdo it on a school night.<br><br>The location is also great. If you are looking for something, quick, healthy, flavorful, filling and fresh try it here!<br><br>Also, VERY good music was playing when we were there!",

I&#39;ve been here for about a month now and each time I walked past the cafe it looked like Christmas morning (that is, I often walked by on a cold, rainy night and the warm-colored inside looked heavenly).<br><br>I finally made a first foray after attending a few mini-obras at the Microteatro Por Dinero just around the block. My first impression was a good one - the decoration was warm and cuddly (for lack of a better term), and everyone there seemed to be in their 20s or 30s and part of the &#34;cool&#34; Malasaña crowd.<br><br>The waitress was attentive and we settled shortly thereafter on a couple glasses of house tinto. Delicious. Unfortunately, my stomach couldn&#39;t handle dessert after having a large dinner elsewhere, but the tartas on other folks&#39; tables looked promising. <br><br>I would definitely recommend this place as a good first date locale. The ambiance is comfortable and still cool, and the mood lighting sparks good conversations (as do their flavorful wines). Perhaps I&#39;ll see you there?",

"reviewcomment":"It&#39;s just silly how great this place is. Not even a little fancy, yet as classy as any restaurant charging 5X the price. What Casa Gonzalez does is: serve delicious local tostas, cheeses, jamons, and wines at superb prices, with a smile. Jamon Iberico con Tumaca (Iberian ham with tomato sauce) or Atun Ahumado (smoked Tuna) on fresh-toasted bread and a glass of Grego Grenache will set you back only 7ish euros. If you ain&#39;t happy after; you didn&#39;t want to go to Madrid. The place is tiny, but extremely popular with locals so try &#34;off hours&#34;. Make the 10 minute walk up the beautiful cobblestone streets from El Prado (where the prices are twice as high and the quality is half as good). You&#39;re welcome!",

"reviewcomment":"Man, I am just confused by the way Spaniards have been rating restaurants lately. Personally, I love El Rey de Las Tortillas.<br><br>I have been here twice now and have walked away very satisfied and not that much poorer. You get a pretty good tortilla(a whole one) with an extra ingredient like onion, chorizo, or alioli for 5 euro! Split one of those with a friend and get a jarra(which are cheap too) and you can have a fine meal with a beer for under 5 euro. <br><br>Sounds like the perfect place to go en La Crisis.<br><br>I&#39;ll admit the ambiance leaves a bit to be desired and last time we had an angry troll serve us, but normally the staff is very nice and I will continue to go back here when I need to save some cash.",

"reviewcomment":"From the outside it may look like an ordinary neighborhood bar, but it&#39;s not.  It&#39;s something special.  And, yes, I am biased because this is one of the first bars that I frequented when I first moved to Madrid in the early 2000s.  It is my family&#39;s favorite neighborhood bar and my father-in-law and I used to share the most delicious cafes con leche (lattes) and churros (all of their bollos (pastries) are out of this world) on cold winter mornings before work.  Back then, early morning, all of the seats at the bar would be filled and, today, they still are.  Such is the case in the afternoons for the traditional aperitivo (drink + appetizers) or for lunch and, starting back in 2004 or so, for evening beer and tapas.  In fact, on almost any given day of the week except for Sundays (when they close), they are packed to the gills once the sun goes down.  Many of the customers at this hour are university students.  The reason being: the brilliant introduction of a variety of 20 or so freshly made tortillas (Spanish omelette) and the wonderful cañas.   It&#39;s hugely popular.  It&#39;s really something to be able to boast of quality, fresh and delicious traditional tapas, fantastic beer (expertly poured), great coffee and pastries, a great daily menu (lunch special) and warm, friendly and attentive service (it&#39;s a family run business that was established by Paco senior and now run by his two sons, Paco and Jose, and  grandson, Pepe).  But, the tortillas are heavenly.  And, if you are up for venturing past the tortilla española or tortilla con chorizo  you are most likely to have a difficult time choosing what kind of pincho (slice) you want.  <br>My recent dilemma:  Tortilla de Roquefort or Langostino con Manzana (lobster and apple) or Cebolla con foie (duck liver and onion)??  There are plenty of meat options too like, Lacon con Queso de Tetilla (ham and an amazing galician cheese) , Beicon con Pimiento (bacon and pepper),  or  Solomillo con Cebolla Caramelizada (meat, caramalized onion and goat cheese) y queso de Cabra.  And there are many, many more.  <br><br>They are flavorful (I&#39;ve had 5 types)  and just the right amount of juicy, too.  Any thing you choose, it&#39;s hard to go wrong.",

"reviewcomment":"It was an early afternoon and my friend invited me to meet her for lunch. La Cocina de San Antón is perhaps one of the more unique restaurants in the area. First, its rooftop situated with a bar on the terrace connected to the restaurant. The view isn&#39;t stunning but on a sunny day it&#39;s nice. The terrace outside has this great water spray system to keep the guests cool on a hot day. The other unique aspect that I loved is that you can buy food in the market downstairs and, for a minimal fee, the restaurant will prepare it for you. Quite an interesting concept.<br><br>On our visit we arrived just before the rush of hungry tourists, as it seemed most people there at that time were not Madrileños. We were seated by a rather unwelcoming host but our waiter and the manager were quite friendly. They have the menu in English so ask for it if you need it to explain all the yummy dishes.<br><br>I wasn&#39;t particularly hungry so I opted for the half order of salmorejo (a cold tomato like soup with egg and jamón) and the mussels. Both were amazing. My friend ordered the pork shoulder burger which came with fries and she thought it was quite tasty as well. Their offerings seem to be pretty traditional with a modern take. <br><br>Prices are quite decent and you can order half bottles of wine, of which they have a pretty good selection. Service was fast. As our table was a bit wobbly, our waiter fixed it for us. The manager even lit my friends cigs for her. <br><br>Good food. Good venue. Decent service.",

The waiters were angry and moody, ignoring us, making a fuss out of everything, acting as if they were doing us a favour by having us in the restaurant.<br><br> 4 of us were vegetarian and we had given them advance notice of this - however they didn&#39;t seem to understand that that meant we did not eat meat. Apparently their famous chickpea soup which was supposed to cater to us vegetarians was in fact chicken and pea. So we had to just sit there twiddling our thumbs while everyone else ate starters. Main meal for the vegetarians was a plate of brussel sprouts, cauliflow and a few potatoes. Horrendous! And to think we paid £60/head for that delight!<br><br> When everyone was ordering their coffees at the end, I ordered mine late and the waiter started to complain about me across the room to one of the other waiters.<br><br> Absolutely absolutely terrible. An absolutely awful restaurant with awful service. It is supposed to be one of Madrid&#39;s finest restaurants. We certainly didn&#39;t experience it as that.<br><br> And when we left the doorman letting us out was absolutely wasted! He could barely hold the door open he was so drunk. Still, he was at least the only member of staff there smiling, so he was one of the better things there!",

It&#39;s difficult to pass without getting in touch with the young and funny Bangladesh guys that try to persuade you for a visit in Shapla. I became weak and - even if I&#39;m not a big Indian-food fan normally - didn&#39;t have regrets at all!<br>For 7 to 10 euro you get menus after those you&#39;ll have had enough for sure.<br>Immediately when sitting down,t they&#39;ll bring you some Naan with Chutney which was perfect against the hunger while waiting for the starter. <br>As starter I&#39;ve got chosen vegetable Pakora which was ok but maybe a little bit dry. As main dish they brought me roasted rice with Chicken Tandoori. As i said - I am not an expert in Indian food, but for me it was perfect!<br>As I wasn&#39;t hungry any more i&#39;ve chosen Chai for dessert. But for those who want the menu includes milk rice or mango lassi.<br>Location is perfect to watch on people in this interesting neighbourhood!",

"reviewcomment":"This is a very good tapas bar, but as ricard67 points out, it&#39;s best for its excellent wine selection. The tapas themselves are excellent (although I wasn&#39;t nuts about the jamon and manchego plate they served), but there are only 4 or 5 tables which seem to get filled up by about 10, just an hour or so after the place opens. They also take reservations here, so if you want to be sure you have a table, either reserve one or arrive at 8:30.<br><br> My experience with the service was that it was also that it was (mostly) super-friendly -- and knowledgeable. When I visited with my girlfriend, we tried about 5 different wines (we also had a bottle of the delicious Camins del Priorat) and all were amazing. One of them, the 2003 Alion (Ribera del Duero) was truly astounding. The cost to open it was only 36 or 37EUR, though here in Freiburg, Germany I saw it for 45 or 50EUR in a store.<br><br> Next time I go to Madrid I will definitely be coming here again. On the night I visited, my girlfriend and I went to about 5 other bars on Cava Baja, and this really was the best one. 4 stars as a tapas place, 5 as a wine bar.",

"reviewcomment":"This was the Coolest part of my trip to Madrid!  Came here with my cousin and few of his friends.  The place was packed since it was midnight.  We ordered everything on the Tapas menu but ended up drinking more than we ate.  All I know is that I started with my typical Gin and Tonic but somehow the bartender convinced me to try other drinks he&#39;s made up.  Everything was incredible and it didn&#39;t hurt that he was gorgeous! ;-)  <br><br>If you&#39;re looking for authentic Spanish tapas place, this isn&#39;t it.  The menu is more international so you can get a taste of many countries from one menu.  This place is Modern, Hip and a super fun environment. <br><br>I&#39;ll be back again!!!",

"reviewcomment":"Ok, so I&#39;ll admit upfront that I&#39;m a stupid American who didn&#39;t do his Spanish homework. Still, I mostly I managed to get by pretty well in Spain by pointing and saying &#34;quiero este&#34;. Unfortunately, the waiter here didn&#39;t even want to give me the chance for that. <br><br>I asked the waiter if he spoke english (in english) when I first walked in. He said no, but walked in confidently, not ready to let a little language barrier stop me from enjoying the only 4-star Yelp place within 2 blocks. Big mistake. For some reason, we were left us languishing at our table for a solid 30 minutes while other tables were attended to. When I finally got the waiters attention, I was ready to show him that I had hung on in Spanish class for a couple of years, or at least had a few solid years of eating burritos under my belt. <br><br>I bravely pointed to a picture of beans on the menu and said: &#34;Queiero este frijoles y papas bravas&#34;<br>He responded: &#34;No es frijoles.&#34;<br>Me: &#34;No? Que es?&#34;<br>Waiter: &#34;Es fabada&#34;<br>Me: &#34;No es frijoles?&#34;<br>Waiter: &#34;No. Es fabada.&#34;<br>*phone rings and he walks away, never to return*<br><br>I Wikipedia fabada and decided it was time to leave. 15 minutes later we were able to get our check for the drinks and get out of there.",

"reviewcomment":"We stumbled upon this pizzeria one night after attending a show in the nearby Teatro Lara, and I&#39;m glad we did. First impression: lots of maja folks in attendance. Granted, it was a Friday night, but we did end up having to sit at the bar due to lack of available seats. We were very well attended by an adorable little Italian guy, and we settled on some vino, beer, the chef salad, and some pizza. The pesto pizza was especially commendable. We also enjoyed the olives given with our drinks. They were true to the restaurant&#39;s name - MUCHO ajo (garlic)! I&#39;d recommend that have some mints or chewing gum after consuming them and before meeting your significant other. <br><br>The decorations were cool as well. Had some bike paraphernalia and low lighting. Bathroom was spacious and the noise level wasn&#39;t too bad. Match all that with free wifi (I&#39;m such a sucker for free wifi), and you&#39;ve got yourself quite a nice place for a casual/cozy dinner experience. All that&#39;s missing is you!",

I would also stop by late at night if I had reading to do, and would sit in the salon with a coffee and slice of delicious cake. The place has a great ambiance with very tasteful decor.

"reviewcomment":"Ok wow, Las Bravas really is a WOW place.  I loved it.  I also love patatas bravas and apparently they invented it.  Most definitely my favorite meal in Madrid and it has low prices.<br><br>Of course we got the patatas bravas which were good in their unique sauce.  We also got a tortilla aioli which was so good and the 5 tapas sampler including croquettes, calamari, squid, pigs ear, and peppers.  Everything was so good (although the pigs ear tastes like cartilage...not really my thing).  The peppers were really well cooked and not spicy at all.  The salt on top was perfect and they were sooo yummy.  <br><br>Such an amazing meal... a trip to Madrid is not complete without a meal at Las Bravas!",

"reviewcomment":"It&#39;s small and popular, and if you come on a Sunday, it&#39;s going to be tight inside. But that just testifies that the place is great. Wine cases adorn the back walls and the chalkboard boasts a decent variety of Spanish wines, including less common varieties from the north, such as the namesake effervescent basque white wine that is tangy and crisp and just right for a warm afternoon. Being Basque, the pintxos are fantastic and really some of the best tapas-like offerings in the city. Morcilla wrapped in potato pocket topped with quail egg; spicy seafood and pepper skewers; great goat cheese slices flamed and topped with carmelized onion; bacalao at least two ways and many more.<br><br> A little pricey compared to other tapa bars, but thats because pintxos can be so much better. Go there, sin duda.",

The home cooked meals were stupendous, and the decor was inviting and a nice change from the typical Madrid cafe/bar (you know, the glass case of ubiquitous fried tapas atop the bar and a floor strewn with used bevnaps). The menú al día had three mix-and-match choices for appetizer and entree; we started with a delicious crema (puree) of potato, coconut milk, and cardamom. For the main course we had delicious roast pork over rosemary potatoes with stewed apples. Dessert yielded a chunky apple cake as well as a dulce de leche cake. The other entree choices were grilled tuna or vegetable lasagna.<br><br>The staff was hard-working, super friendly, and accommodating. It&#39;s a bright place all the way around.

(Which I&#39;m pretty sure breaks all kinds of health codes in most countries). Sign me up!!<br><br>The drink menu is completely cryptic and doesn&#39;t explain any of the drinks besides showing you a picture of the glass it comes in. It&#39;s basically russian roulette as to what you are going to get. The Volcano is to be shared by several people and comes with dry ice spewing from the top. <br><br>If you want to escape the standard tapas and wine joints and try something bizarro, go here!",

"reviewcomment":"I had walked by Clarita un montón de veces, but never ventured in until last Thursday for dinner. My date ended up finding a great dinner deal for Clarita on the phone app El Tenedor, so we decided to try our luck. I had always asusmed this locale was just a regular, run-of-the-mill bar, but no sir - in the back of the bar there is a giant salon with ample seating space.<br><br>Firstly I&#39;d like to commend the wait staff. Our waitress was delightful and unimposing, but perfectly attentive and always smiling. Her disposition definitely added to our dining experience. We shared the ceviche for an appetizer and it was a HUGE portion! We couldn&#39;t even finish it all for fear of not having room for the rest of the meal. Flavor was right on. Then I got the pulpo a la brasa, one of my absolute favorites, and it was quite good. It was served with potatoes and mango salsa. My date got the teriyaki/sesami tuna steak. I&#39;ll admit that I&#39;m not a big tuna fan, but I must say this one hit tyhe spot. Even I would order it. Dessert was a pastry dish with dulce de leche ice cream. Warning, it is VERY rich. Definitely to be shared. <br><br>Noise level isn&#39;t awful, bathroom downstairs was very clean, and free wifi is always a plus.",

I went here with my spanish and some Indian friends in a group of 20 almost. The food was without flavour but with orange food color which will stick to your hands (in the tandoori chicken), cold nan, no salt and forget the spices. The service was ridiculously slow and we had to wait hours before the Nan came. All this in-spite of the fact that we had informed them in advance of our arrival a day before. <br><br>The price was cheap but we were very disappointed with the staff and the pathetic food.

I thought it was interesting as the Restaurant was almost empty saturday night around 9pm. I&#39;m still getting used to the late dining in spain. <br><br>One of the few places that had servers that could speak English well enough to help me with the menu. Google translate also helped as well. <br><br>I loved the fact that you can get full, half or 1/3 sized plates. The latter is basically tapas size but I would go with a half sized if you&#39;re sharing with 3 or more. Otherwise for 2 people a few 1/3 sized dishes with some good drink is sufficient. <br><br>We got the Civic, rossejat (a seafoood paella made of noodles and sauce), and lomo (venison)    All were really excellent and diverse tasting. Bread costs money but the olives are free. Service was quite slow but worth it. <br><br>Reservations recommended.",

Only thing, they need to work on their salsas (they were pretty bad) and their margaritas are a bit pricey for not being able to taste any tequila. Also, they are definitely pricey so beware before going. The staff packed my food up togo for me and I was very touched by how they separated everything out and supplied me with more tortillas!

In some other places people did not really want to try and &#34;work&#34; with us. Not so here. We felt welcomed and between my little Spanish and bartender&#39;s little English we were able to communicate. The food was excellent, we got grilled octopus and burger sample with wild boar, ostrich and two more meats.  Both were very enjoyable, better than that both were great.  Wine at less than €3 were also good.<br>At the end we spoke to the owner who was super friendly and spoke good English.  All in all it was a great experience away from places with pictures of paella in the front (typical in the touristy areas)",

We were enjoying the evening from the very first minute we arrived in Bodegas Rosell.<br>Then the food, the wine, el camarero..........el perfeccionismo!<br><br>There cannot be a reason to eat in the hotel. Even if you&#39;re not really in the mood to go out......",

"reviewcomment":"Once again, the Grupo Andilana makes a sure bet with La Caña. All of the pluses for their other restaurants for equally applicable here - the food was international and well-portioned, the service was mostly punctual, and the decor left nothing lacking. The prices are odd in that they end in uneven (and seemingly random) numbers, but I&#39;m sure it has something to do with the tax being included, etc. They are more than affordable, which makes La Caña and any other restaurant in this group worth a date night, a casual girls&#39; dinner, or a menu del día to share with coworkers.",

Their Cous Cous pots are sublime and their chicken in a    pastry was superb. It&#39;s supposed to be tagine but they don&#39;t call it that. My calabaza and milk (yes, leche) pot was a hit and the hubster&#39;s fave. And all super cheap for the quality of cooking you&#39;re getting. Let&#39;s not overlook the perfection that is their hummus. <br><br>One note, however, the hubster&#39;s niece found a hair in her dish. Ew, I know, but the food is seriously that delicious that I&#39;d overlook it. <br><br>They also have seating on the floor but since my mother-in-law wouldn&#39;t be comfy, we opted for a large table in the back.

Why the hell do the burgers taste so good here compared to North America?  My god, they were so fresh and tasty, the complete opposite of the slop we get here.  It actually tastes like beef.  They even give you real white napkins, not the recycled brown cardboard looking monstrosities they give here.  I know, relax, its only napkins, but it&#39;s a simple luxury that adds to the dining experience.  <br><br>We&#39;re actually embarrassed by how much we loved this place and how often we ate here, but it was too damn good.  Another reason to sell all of our possessions and move to Spain.",

Its bar is a couple hundred years old, its register is an old yellow metal...a bull&#39;s head hangs on the wall, and the place was in fact founded by an ex-bullfighter (or so it says on an old plaque inside). We&#39;ve tried some of the meats and of course the potatoes are some of the best we&#39;ve had in Madrid. The wait staff is friendly (we speak Spanish) and the prices fall in the lower-middle range if you eat Spanish-style: ordering a few plates and sharing them while sipping drinks.",

Most notable was the attention to my family&#39;s food allergy (three Celiac gluten-free and one seafood allergy). Server was familiar with concerns, considerate and supportive. For example, when my daughter showed her seafood sensitive warning card, server read it, took it to chef, and acknowledged the handling. Gluten free menu was robust. Food was delivered promptly and was quite good....and a good value. A large space so plenty of availability.   Not a romantic spot, but great for travelers, families and groups.  English menu, too. We enjoyed a nice, low stress dinner after a long day strolling around Madrid.",

"reviewcomment":"Dear Gumbo,<br><br>Why haven&#39;t I met you sooner? After two and a half years and countless days walking past this restaurant I decided to put it on my to do list. <br><br>I gave the lunch menu a try one Friday afternoon and was not disappointed. For the first course there were four options, I ordered the creole/cajun rice. The second course had four or five options I ordered the fried chicken which was accompanied with mashed potatoes and coleslaw. Everything was well prepared. And well seasoned at that! Hard to find in Madrid. To finish off the meal there were three dessert choices, I opted for the orange cake. Definitely a great surprise. <br><br>All this, plus a drink of your choice and bread, for 10,75€. Definitely will be back to try other items off the normal menu. <br><br>Sincerely,<br><br>A very happy lady",

"reviewcomment":"Rey de Tallarines was a perfectly suitable neighborhood Chinese restaurant - not much more, not much less. The place has a look of a typical Spanish bar that has been converted to a Chinese restaurant. I HIGHLY recommend the red curry. I personally can&#39;t deal with super spicy food, so I was happy that the red curry had just a hint of spice (though of course you can add more if you so choose). For &#34;tallarines&#34; to be a part of the name, I was less than impressed with their tallarines fritos - they seemed only luke-warm (thus perhaps reheated) and not very flavorful. Service was almost immediate though, and the price is right. They didn&#39;t knock it out of the park, but I&#39;d come again if I was in the area and had a hankering for Chinese.",

They had Marvin Gaye on the music loop -- when we heard Sexual Healing a second time, we figured that was our cue to depart. <br><br>This was a Yelp find, and it did us right. Sunday morning brunch, and the place was full by 1230.  I got the American breakfast and my wife the huevos rancheros -- she got the better meal.  American bfast came w/ a sausage I wasn&#39;t too fond of -- off taste for me.  However, the bacon was crispy and the potato cakes nice and crunchy on the outside. The huevos were yummy, served w/ a healthy dollop of guacamole and black beans. Some good flavors there!  Mimosas hit the spot, too!  Lastly, excellent and friendly service.<br><br>Cheers!<br>RS",

There is an area with sofas which is great for tomarse una copa o un café with friends and be completely relaxed. The place is to try, at least once !",

It was my cafe as a student 17 years ago &amp; from what I&#39;ve heard, remains the best place for the Carneval Bal.<br><br>We were hungry after a visit to the Cibeles galleries &amp; paid the 1EC entrance fee. Initially, we were going to be good &amp; order 1-2 small plates; I ordered 5 &amp; the maître d made a gordo comment (dude, you, of all people, really have no right to call us fat). The canapés/pinxos were 2 pieces/3,50EC. 2 had salmon, 2 had Brie, one had jamon. I&#39;m fairly certain a potato chip basket was served.<br><br>The wine was good, service prompt, atmosphere incredible. We were satiated for our next stroll around town.<br><br>30EC",

Solo habia un asiento en la barra, yo agarre ese y mi amigp pues le toco parado. No importa, porque lo que venia despues estaba bien merecido. <br>Pedimos taco de pipian de pollo, y mole con pollo, de estos es de pipian estaba para chuparse los dedos! exquisito!<br>despues pedimos chicharron en salsa verde, otra ves...riquisimo! pedimos tambien, pedimos otro mas pero no logro recordar el nombre. Acompañados por cerveza mexicana púes muy bien, los tacos  a 1.50 es muy dificil solo ordenar uno!!! si estas en un budget no ordenes cerveza importada porque sale  a 4 euros cada una, puedes ir por una Mahou a 1.50 o 2 euros la unidad.<br>Es un hecho que volvere aqui ya que ese sabor es lo mas cerca que he probado a algo netamente mex.",

The menu is big, with lots of choices for small and main dishes, and prices aren&#39;t bad given that it&#39;s so near Sol. I had the salad with caramelized Goat&#39;s cheese, spinach and roasted tomatoes, that was superb. I loved the sweetness of the caramelized crust in the cheese with the Balsamic vinegar.<br><br>I didn&#39;t like that they charged extra for the bread (not so common in Spain), but altogether is a good place to try.",

Yes, please. We had an incredibly cheap and yummy meal at this location. I wish they had this kind of restaurant in my hometown because I would be there all the time. If you sit outside watch out for the birds; they swarm dishes left over from patrons who have left (it&#39;s a little terrifying to be enjoying your meal when all of a sudden a flock of birds flies right at the table next to you but if I was a bird I would want to eat here too). All of the montaditos (mini sandwiches) come with chips and there are so many different choices! We sampled the jamon york y queso, jamon iberico, hamburguesa and patatas fritas con 4 salsas (dipping sauces). All yum! <br><br>Step 1 Check out the menu<br>Step 2 Write your order down<br>Step 3 Bring your ticket order inside (if you&#39;re sitting outside)<br>Step 4 Wait while it is being prepared<br>Step 5 Go back in to retrieve your yummy meal<br>Step 6 Enjoy!",

"reviewcomment":"I had seen this bizarre phenomenon in Paris last year and again in Madrid this year. That is, that Asian cuisine styles tend to get lumped together in one restaurant. Convenience? Perhaps. I would think though that it is some sort of insidious form of racism, where tolerance for anything not European forces adaptation on the part of those who have something different to offer.<br><br>That said, I felt sorry for the lack of people in this place. The 10 euro all you can eat lunch special should have been packing in the punters on what was a typically warm, late summer Madrid afternoon. With a good range of food on offer, including Chinese stir fry favourites, sashimi and ice cream, I would almost kill to have something this cheap and this diverse back home in Sydney.<br><br>The service was friendly and welcoming and the beer, as it should be, extremely cold. As we left this place, I contemplated how European cities must quickly adapt to what will be Asian dominated centuries ahead. For one, they will have to get better, that is, much better at doing Asian food. On that point, despite the horrific prices, many lessons can be learnt from Sydney and Melbourne.<br><br>In Sydney and Melbourne, Asian cuisines are thankfully distinct and flavours both sumptuous and gorgeous...",

We ordered their potatoes with eggs &amp; ham, and another dish that resembled taquitos served with delicious guacamole &amp; cream cheese! Also their coffee was great because they serve Nespresso. Atmosphere is lovely too! We would definitely return just to try their desserts and other things.",

"reviewcomment":"I first ventured into Naturbier because I thought it might be a microbrewery (based both on online reviews and on the sign proclaiming it a &#34;fábrica&#34; (factory)). They do have their own house beer, both a lager and what appeared to be an amber (it was described on the menu as &#34;toasted&#34;), but there was no sign of brewery works.<br><br>I ended up really enjoying the laid-back pub feel of Naturbier. When I sat inside at the bar, both the bartenders and patrons were super-friendly. Sitting outside in the Plaza Santa Ana offered fantastic people-watching, but also much less of a social atmosphere. And prices are about 10-15% higher outside (which is standard of the restaurants in this area). So my preference is to sit inside.<br><br>Food was decent, not the best, but definitely passable. The complimentary olives and pickled onions are delicious, and the staff is generous with them. The tortilla de patatas and jamón was a gigantic portion, really more suited for two people, which eased my sticker shock over the price (about 16 euros). <br><br>As for the beverages, I found that I did not particularly care for the beer at Naturbier. I only tried the lager, and found it to have a significantly bitter aftertaste not characteristic of that type of beer. I did enjoy the petite size of the &#34;jarra&#34; portion, which was quite a contrast to the typical pour in the US. The sangría was much more to my liking, and was also deceptively strong. I think this was the best sangría I had in Madrid.<br><br>Naturbier does accept credit cards, but not American Express.",

"reviewcomment":"Word was getting around to the Spaniards that I hadn&#39;t had good food experiences here except on my first visit. During a lunch break, we visited this restaurant, a student&#39;s favorite place. He directed us to the queso de cabra con cebolla and the solomillo de ternera brasa, and everyone ordered the broken eggs dish. <br><br>We started with several dishes of peppers, potatoes, and sausage. We stabbed them in various arrangements with our toothpicks. It was so bloody good! Then our ternera tosta arrived. The tosta was topped with a pounded thin steak topped with vinaigrette. Then the queso tosta arrived. It must have had the same vinaigrette or the onions were cooked until sweetness came out. Both were great. And, of course, I do enjoy my broken eggs.<br><br>A fine meal among friends!",

"reviewcomment":"My girlfriend and I did an 11 day  trip in Morocco. On our way home, we had an 18 hour layover in Madrid so we decided to go out to dinner/etc. We asked around and a lot of locals and tourists alike recommended Ramses. We arrived a minute before closing (the dinner room) and were rushed to order since the kitchen was closing. Sure, no problem. They had a steak on the menu from Galicia. My whole dads side of the family is originally from Galicia so of course I had to order it! It was heavenly...seriously. I know my steak. This was so tender it melted in my mouth. It was so well presented and just wow...<br><br>Ramses also has an extensive wine selection. You can find any wine in your budget.<br><br>Now moving on to the downstairs...so after dinner we proceeded downstairs where there was definitely a party going on. It was so much fun. The crowd was very chic and we had ourselves a great time. Definitely check out Ramses! It was the perfect ending to our 11 day vacation!",

"reviewcomment":"When one pictures going to Europe and you want to imagine what &#39;Old World&#39; Spain was like, Las Cuevas does an excellent job of painting that picture. I had made a late reservation for the two of us as I had no idea where our day would take us and I didn&#39;t want to interrupt anything we might have going on. Plus, it&#39;s not abnormal to go to dinner at 9 PM; at least not over there. Well, our day wrapped up and we found ourselves trying to burn time so we were very pleased when they were able to seat us half an hour early.<br><br>I knew I wanted sangria &amp; I knew I wanted to share an order of the gambas al ajillo. Besides that, I had no idea what I was going to get. Very glad the husband agreed to play along &amp; trusted my twelve year old memory of my previous visit. The sangria was just what you expect when you order a pitcher of sangria in Spain: sweet, with some gorgeous aromatic spices. The garlic shrimp were just as I remembered: served in a sizzling ceramic dish with lots of garlic butter you can soak up with your bread. I tore a couple of pieces off the bread and pressed them down into the hot dish allowing them to get a nice &#39;char&#39; on the edges as they soaked up the butter. Delicious!<br><br>For dinner I decided on the Veal Mianese. Perfectly fried golden brown. Pounded thin to be as big as the plate. I ate every bite. The potatoes were there and I tried them, but I didn&#39;t love them as much and would have been just as happy with just the protein. My husband destroyed his roasted lamb. He would have licked the plate if we would have been eating at home.<br><br>A few reviews make comments about the prices being high. It&#39;s right off the Plaza Mayor, what I believe to be the heart of the tourist area. So yes, I expected the prices to be a little high. Would I ever call the food bland? No. Would I go here on a regular basis if I lived in Madrid? Probably not. Am I willing to not fret about the money spent on one nice dinner while on vacation? Absolutely. Besides, if I didn&#39;t do the conversion in my head on how much I was REALLY spending, the prices weren&#39;t that bad.",

What makes it even better is that the staff is actually friendly and competent. Choices are simple and old fashioned, but well cooked. A pork chop that I ordered was near perfect. Coffee is strong with good flavor. Place gets packed at lunch, but the friendly owners are always willing to put another table outside for new arrivals.",

All this accompanied by White wine from the Basque region...simply delicious<br>to top it off we had as dessert trufas de chocolate ( no translation needed for that one) which were right what we needed to end this amazing night.<br>This place is known for pintxos but that&#39;s on the first floor...and I am sure we&#39;ll be back for those.",

Well worth a visit for great tapas to share! <br><br>The menu is all in spanish and our server only spoke spanish but we were able to get by as they have a &#34;picture menu&#34; so you can point at an item. We were also ntertained by trying to speak really horrible spanish to our server and she just laughed and was easily humored, but good with us.<br><br>Service was excellent and the food was fantastic. We enjoyed the salmorejo (cold tomato soup), croqueatas bacaloa (deep fried cheese-curd like but with fish), ensalada de tomato y queso fresco (fresh mozzarella and tomato salad) and per our servers recommendation the callos a la madrilaña (basically, think &#34;thanksgiving turkey&#34; with a broth-like sauce). IT WAS ALL DELICIOUS! We were definitely full (3 of us shared these 4 plates). Of course, don&#39;t forget to order beer and wine as this is always the way to go!",

"reviewcomment":"I think everyone who is giving this place a bad review based on service really doesn&#39;t understand how things work in Spain.<br><br>1.  Paella, when freshly prepared, takes about 20-30 min to cook, meaning you&#39;re going to wait a while on your meal... so come prepared for that.<br>2.  All Spanish restaurants bring you bread, which you are charged for if you eat.  They change for everything... bread, water... that&#39;s just how it is here.<br>3.  Paella has to be prepared in special large pans... so it&#39;s a waste for them to make it for one person, so the minimum is 2 persons.<br>4.  Some might call the old guy grumpy... but I thought he was hilarious.  He&#39;s old school.  He poured my glass of wine, walked off, then looked back and said &#34;you look like you need a little more&#34;, and topped the glass off and walked off again.  When we presented the paella, in deadpan Spanish he goes &#34;careful, the crayfish will jump out at you&#34;.<br><br>Bottom line though, like everyone else said, great paella.  This is the real deal.",

"reviewcomment":"I stopped by here last night after looking for a place to get a tea before dinner. We opened the door and you could immediately smell the intoxicating odor of their variety of hashish and I knew I had made a good decision.<br><br>My friend and I took our seats in the middle of the place and looked at the menu, which had a good selection of teas all for 2 euro. Then as one of the employees went by with some food that caught our eye, we decided to get an appetizer, and ordered the Muhamara(essentially red pepper hummus).<br><br>The Muhamara was very refreshing and the tea, I got the Reina de Corazones, was soothing. The place had an excellent vibe with low light, delicious odors, and quite good products. My only complaint(this might be because I&#39;m American) is that you really have to work for the attention of the server. Not a big deal, but we American&#39;s are spoiled by people who are working for tips :p",

The restaurant is smart, but in a low-key traditional way, not new wave chic, not too old fashioned either. <br><br>We didn&#39;t t try much from the menu sadly, and I would love to go back to eat more. We did order three dishes. A wonderful bean stew accompanied by cabbage, morcilla and pickled green chillis. The Morcilla was beautiful. We also tried the hongos (mushrooms) - which I think were ceps. Finally the meat was some of the best I have ever eaten. It was a chuleton (rib) of beef, cooked over coals. Amazing flavour and texture. Just meat, a bone and salt. Oh and a bottle of excellent and not pricey Rioja.  Good value at approx €90 for three people.",

"reviewcomment":"This is my favorite pinxos bar in Madrid. I have been going there for years (do not confuse this location with the one in the Cava Baja area, same name but not the same chef!). Completely away from any maddening crowd (tourists, Madrileños or any other kind)  and tucked away in a very nice but residential neighborhood, TXirimiri is one little jewel for the savvy gourmand. There are only a few tables, and maybe 6 stools at the miniscule bar. However, the service is incredibly friendly and efficient. I am always amazed at how they do all they do, and so well. Arrive early, because by 10 PM of any night it will be packed.<br>HIGHLIGHTS: &#34;Kokotxa&#34; (hake cheeks) a la Donostiarra; Fois gras steak(Yes, not a torchon!) with fig marmelade and Maldon salt; boletus(porcine mushrooms), Serrano ham and truffle(!) croquetas(croquettes) ; if you are not adventurous, try their homemade &#34;chicken nuggets&#34;, or their grilled asparagus with Maldon salt. Two exceptional rice dishes are their wild mushroom, foie and Pedro Ximenez Brandy risotto and the black risotto with sepia(a large species of calamari), langoustines(a delicious critter that is a cross between shrimp and lobster) and cilantro. The list goes on... <br>They have a nice wine bar, but I always ask for my txakoli, a dry white wine that is slightly effervescent. <br>I don&#39;t give 5 stars to everything; I reserve them for truly unique establishments doing something(or many things!) right. This is one of those places.",

I ordered scrambled eggs which were really dry and the water, like all other places in Spain, was not free. I went during brunch time and it wasn&#39;t very populated with customers. If you&#39;re looking for a nice brunch in the city, I wouldn&#39;t put this on the top 10 places to eat at.",

All the performers were clearly very passionate about flamenco and put 100% in the show!!! Additionally the entire staff was very friendly! Would definitely recommend if you are visiting Madrid. Please more that dinner is typically eaten on the later side in Madrid. We didnt eat at the show, so if you plan to eat prior to the show, make sure places are open. There weren&#39;t too many options so we opted to go to a great place afterwards.",

"reviewcomment":"This Michelin star restaurant is located about 5 minutes away from Plaza Mayor (on foot) in Calle Cava Baja.  Although their menu outside and their website info state that they open at 1:00pm they won&#39;t open until 1:30pm.  My reservation was at 1:30pm and I got there an hour early in case I couldn&#39;t find the place so, I waited for 40 minutes until I decided to just march right in anyway.  They let me sit at the bar.  The bartender  (he speaks English)  recommended Madrid&#39;s local beer, Mahou.  They also gave me some crackers with pimiento mousse.  <br><br>I got seated at 1:30 and I was their first diner of the day (I&#39;m still used to having lunch at 11:30am regardless of the time zone).  I ordered off of the tapas menu and got croquettas, pan de tomate with jam on Iberico, and tuna empanada.  I was full and I forgot that was only the appetizer!  I forced myself to eat my entree: peppers stuffed with cod topped with crispy Iberico.  The croquettes were creamy on the inside and nice and crisp on the ouside with just enough breading.  The jamon Iberico melts in your mouth. I found myself in such a huge dilemma.  The food was so good but I had no stomach space.  I don&#39;t think they&#39;d allow me to run a mile first and then come back to finish my food. And then, there was dessert...3 of them!  Lemon mousse with chocolate, cheese flan and tiramisu.  The lemon tiramisu was incredibly delicious and that&#39;s coming from somebody who hates chocolate + citrus fruits.  I kept looking at the menu...I was tempted to order the foie gras but I know I&#39;d end up wasting it since I couldn&#39;t eat another bite.<br><br>I got great service even though there was a barrage of people who came after I did.  For all that food, my bill was only 23euros!  They gave me the beer for free - what a nice gesture.",

"reviewcomment":"This is BY FAR the best fine dining experience I&#39;ve ever had. Every course was out of this world taste-wise and form-wise. Olive oil butter out of a small &#34;toothpaste&#34; tube? Squeeze your own ramen noodles out of a syringe? Just to name a few... <br><br>Every course was a show and you are either the audience or the performer yourself. The texture, taste, presentation... I am lost for words trying to describe something that should be left alone because it is simply... perfection. <br><br>What blew our mind even to more pieces was the total bill was as if we ate at Capo or the Ivy in LA. <br><br>Ferran Adria, to my surprise, actually lived up to all the hype. I would come back to Madrid just for this experience all over again. <br><br>And oh, the restaurant is BEAUTIFUL. We sat outside on the rooftop that has been set up to resemble dining al fresco on the sidewalk -- except... you&#39;re on the rooftop overlooking all these historical buildings. <br><br>This review doesn&#39;t do justice!!! If I could give 10 stars I would!",

But what makes the place really special is what the bar is all about. When the rest of the city is closed and quiet, the basement brick cave of El Camerino (the name of the bar part of this business) is bumping with live funk for a local crowd of actors and musicians drinking cocktails beer and wine and enjoying the afternoon doing something besides sleeping. Next door is a pizza place which can actually be accessed through an underground passage behind the performance room, which is also used for theatre, cabarets, monologues, and short film screenings. At night DJ&#39;s take over and spin funk, and the owner refuses to give exact closing times because it all depends on the vibe on a given day. Its a celebration of local culture, and the food is pretty rocking too. Live jam session (guests welcome) every Saturday starting at 3pm. Just the kind of cool this city needs more injections of.",

"reviewcomment":"First stop on our tapas hopping... picked this looking in from the outside and saw one guy bustling. He seemed to be the only bartender and waiter. There was just enough opening for our table of 8 to sit down.<br><br>If you&#39;ve never had the warmed cheese with caramelized onion in red wine, you MUST try it!!! It&#39;s heavenly and such a great starter for our tapas hopping adventure. The sweetness of the onions complimented the warm cheese, which I believe was goat cheese, but the taste was mild than what I&#39;m used to. Everyone was eating the cheese off their fingers since we ran out of toast early.<br><br>We also got the pork, cuttlefish and salad. Not much to say about the pork, except that it was dry and not really flavorful or tasty. However, the cuttlefish was delicious too. I think it was a pesto sauce on top of it, and the cuttlefish was cooked perfectly so that it was not chewy or dry. Also the sangria was smooth and fruity. We really enjoyed this as our first restaurant.",

"reviewcomment":"A nice tapas place with great service and a local flavor. The portions are generous and moderately priced. The fried eggplant in honey was surprisingly delicious. We thought that the eggplant was lightly battered, but weren&#39;t too sure. I had the blood sausage, which was surprisingly light. It was fried to perfection with a crispy, paper-thin blackened outer crust that melted away in your mouth. We also had the patatas a la cabreira, which were a bit greasy, but definitely tasted good. We ended with the mushrooms, which were large caps pan fried and filled with cubed ham. Awesome! <br><br>The most interesting part was that the waitress lives in Arlington while working at the Taberna Del Alabardero in D.C. She was super friendly, but very busy trying to do her job in this bustling joint. What a small world!",

"reviewcomment":"We had dinner here on our last night in Madrid before we headed back to New York. This restaurant was recommended to us by our concierge and it turned out to be a pretty good meal. Even though it was another expensive restaurant (which I do not mind as long as the food is good), the rib steak for two was soft, tender and delicious. They give you delicious bread with great olive oil, complimentary olives and small chorizos as a starter and we ordered the grilled asparagus which were excellent. The steak is delivered to your table sliced and raw along with a scalding &#34;asador&#34; which is a very hot grilling plate. You place the meat on it and cook it yourself and this was very simple and quick. We got some cut up strawberries and a lemon sorbet drink (complimentary) and ordered the rice pudding which was very good.<br><br>The service was excellent but the reason I gave 4 stars is because the man who took our order not only forgot to bring us one of the appetizers but he also never submitted the rice pudding order either. I would recommend this restaurant if you are in the mood for steak. The high cost of the meal is about the same price as we pay for any good steak restaurant on the North Shore of Long Island except that they do not even have a line on the charge slip to add a tip. The meal came to $162 including 2 glasses of very good sangria and one cappuccino.<br><br> Visited May 2013",

"reviewcomment":"Cool enviornment and Awesome bagel brunch on Sundays. Less than 10€ for a bagel combo of your choice, postre, zumo and café. Definitely takes care of breakfast and lunch for the day. I had the goat cheese and tomato preserve bagel, orange juice, café con leche and cherry tart. It was fabulous but I didn&#39;t have room to finish it all. They also are one of the only places in Madrid that serves IPA. Yum!",

"reviewcomment":"First night in Madrid with my husband, we had been traveling most of the day and were looking for good food, cozy atmosphere, and a glass of wine....at 9 o&#39;clock or so on a Sunday. This is a tough feat if you live in Amsterdam (where we do) but luckily in Madrid people dine late and on Sundays :)<br><br>We did a quick search on yelp and found La Cajita de Nori in walking distance from where we were staying and with good reviews. They did not disappoint!<br><br>Service was quick and friendly. We ordered a small tortilla, which was light, fluffy and fresh. One of the best I&#39;ve ever had. We had one of their specials, a marinated eggplant salad with wonderful feta cheese. I don&#39;t know what they did but the eggplant was so tasty. Delicious. We also had a rice/egg dish. A portion of right with two fried eggs with deliciously runny yolks plus a delicious pepper/tomato topping. The topping was fresh and so tasty.<br><br>This is really Spanish comfort food. On the menu are also a nice selection of options with beef and pork, etc.<br><br>We had two glasses of wine. For dessert we opted for the tart queso, which is like a super dense, rich cheese cake with this thick syrup. It was rich and amazing...you need to share with two people, it would have been too much otherwise. <br><br>The decor is cute and funky, colorful and fun. The music was fun with Jimi Hendrix to some others.<br><br>We were the only people dining at the time, so I wish it was more busy when we were there. But this was a great way to start our Spanish adventure.<br><br>Two people, 2 glasses of wine, three dishes and dessert: €33<br><br>Rico!",

I can&#39;t think of another word to describe the interior other than &#34;classy&#34; by McDonald&#39;s standards.<br><br>The layout works well in its confined space, never had too much of a problem running into people like in many crowded Spanish locations. In most aspects it is exactly like every other McDonald&#39;s out there, though quite a bit cleaner than most.<br><br>The food was good, exactly what you expect when you order a McFlurry came out. The beer was decent. It seemed like every city had their own designated beer and they all tasted the same, on the cheap side, but not terrible. McDonald&#39;s served Madrid&#39;s beer here, not sure if the brand changes as you travel. <br><br>The bathrooms were clean enough, though a guy was sick in the men&#39;s so people had to take turn using the women&#39;s (an employee even came out to tell a guy to get out of the women&#39;s pretty quickly, so either the hallway or the bathrooms are being video monitored). And did I notice a retinal scanner to get into the room marked &#34;Privado&#34;? maybe just my imagination.<br><br>The employees in general were brusque and unwelcoming. Most didn&#39;t speak any English which was odd since most people in the city have some English and one would think McDonald&#39;s would look for employees with that quality (especially considering the unemployment rate I&#39;d think they could find someone). Besides the rude intrusion of the bathroom and woman taking the orders it wasn&#39;t a bad visit.",

First off, the restaurant opens 9pm and reservations are REQUIRED. We came yesterday and the manager barely squeezed us in today. Very small place down an alley. Pretty dolled up Vietnamese place. Very short menu and very pricey. A pho bo bowl is 9.5 EU, you can get 2 huge bowls in Houston, tx for that price. It&#39;s decent for where we were (Spain) but overly salty. It has more of a hoison sauce flavor. Cafe sua da (Vietnamese coffee) is off the menu and you get a couple sips, not a large glass like we&#39;re use to. My hubby walked out still hungry, which doesn&#39;t happen when we&#39;re eating pho at home. Still, it will satisfy us till we get back home. Btw eggrolls are off the menu and fried rice is fried as cubes....strange.",

"reviewcomment":"This is by far my favorite neighborhood cafe/bar. It has a very rustic and home like feel, as evidenced with the mismatched furniture. No table service here, take a look at the menu and order at the counter. They have a range of coffee drinks, teas, traditional Spanish chocolate and other tasty treats. I usually find myself here with good friends discussing the events of the day or week. The ambiance is quiet, relaxed, great. They even allow dogs inside! The bathrooms are small and quaint but that&#39;s fairly normal around Spain. My only wish is that they had more space, as sometimes getting a table can be a challenge. Definitely my favvvvvvorite neighborhood establishment by leaps and bounds.<br><br>P.S. No credit cards accepted! Standard Spanish tradition.",

The lasagna was more than enough for a single person. My initial thoughts were, wow is this it? I&#39;m going to need to order more! However, the sauce/gravy was super heavy and almost found myself wanting to take a break from eating. Pace yourself food is meant to be eaten over 60-90 minutes.",

"reviewcomment":"It&#39;s hard to call anything in Madrid a hole-in-the-wall considering nearly ever restaurant is literally just that. But the name isn&#39;t just a literal meaning, it has that deeper meaning of something that people walk by often without looking and then one day fall into it, discovering something they wished that had years before.<br><br>I have eaten here twice now, and the second time was complete luck because I completely forgot what it was after the first time(it was my first night in Madrid and I was completely lost). I recognized it from the playful, Mexican-ish decor. I also knew I had to eat there again after the first time.<br><br>You can sit at the bar in this tiny joint and get some canitas and tapas along with it or you can sit down and order something hearty. I have done both and am happy with both. The first is the cheap option, the second is the delicious option. <br><br>They have wonderfully original tapas as well as some classics, all are amazing. One thing that caught my eye were their &#34;rebanadas,&#34; or tostas. We got one with melted cheese, grapes, and almonds and it was fantastic. I will be going back to try some more.<br><br>While the place is small and usually busy(it&#39;s on Cava Baja...) it is definitely worth a visit. The staff is so nice and the food is some of the best I&#39;ve had here.",

It is very nice inside (trendy &amp; chic) and the views are great - downside - the food wouldn&#39;t cut it at a homeless shelter! Typical. <br><br>So why do you come to Real Cafe and why do I give it 3 out of 5 stars? If you are in Madrid during the summer months you must come to Bernabeau on a Thursday, Friday, Saturday night when they take down the glass windows and essentially build a dance floor/platform all the way out into the stadium (over the seats) - this is a really unique experience and the place is packed for these events in the summertime - so come for the drinks/wo(men) and pleasure but leave your hunger at home!",

"reviewcomment":"Although the design of this restaurant tries to give the impression of a high-class, high-quality Asian restaurant, most of the dishes I tried here were mediocre at best. My friend and I decided to try one of the tasting menus (the menu Teppanyaki), and while it wasn&#39;t completely awful, it did not seem worth the price of 31 euros.<br><br>The sushi/sashimi plate did not taste particularly fresh to me, and the teppanyaki was juicy but bland. The &#34;Cantonese rice&#34; lacked flavor as well, and the dessert (a standard tiramisu) tasted more like a frozen cheesecake. The only parts of the menu that I was actually quite pleased with were the seaweed salad starter (which is kind of hard to mess up given that it&#39;s a cold dish) and the vegetable tempura (which were fresh and hot).<br><br>While the food did not leave me particularly satisfied or pleased, I will say that the atmosphere here is quite nice. The servers are attentive and extremely polite, and if judged solely by appearance, I would say that this is a very aesthetic and up-scale restaurant.<br><br>At the end of the day however, I just do not think that the prices are appropriate for the quality of food they serve.",

"reviewcomment":"I frequented this place regularly given that my office was only a block away... they have great lunch boxes and allow take away. For Madrid, they have one of the better tasting offers - having lived in Japan for 7 years, I know my sushi and Madrid unfortunately is lacking greatly in good sushi shops. <br><br>With that said, the sushi shop does a great job to bring decent sushi your way. I would highly recommend it to travelers who need their sushi fix in a central location. The prices are about 11.95 or 12.95 EUR for a lunch set which includes a sushi box (6 types to choose from), 1 salad and the choice of a miso soup or white rice. Overall its a bit pricey, but in Madrid, eating out tends to be so. <br><br>Another great option here is to simply take out and walk across the street to the famous Retiro park and eat your sushi there!!!",

"reviewcomment":"I had just gotten into Madrid from Barcelona, taken a shower and headed out to get some late night grub. This was one of the only places I found with the kitchen still open and seating outside.. For those that have not visited Spain in the summer... It&#39;s HOT! Majority of the waiters do not speak English, but that&#39;s understandable as I am in their country, not mine. However, I think they tried taking advantage of that, which isn&#39;t ok... I ordered the chicken and eggs dish number cinco). The brought me the dish accompanied by a basket of bread and what must have been an egg pancake thing, cut into triangles. <br><br>The eggs, mashed potatoes and fries were good, but the chicken was a little undercooked... But I was hungry so I went ahead and ate it anyway... I was tired from the trip as making your way through Madrid through the train system when you don&#39;t speak Spanish is very difficult!! (Note to self... Learn Spanish!!) and didn&#39;t feel like waiting any longer to eat). <br><br>When they brought the bill, I saw that they had charged me 1.80 euro for the small bottle of water (which is $2.34!), but I was charged 3 euro&#39;s in Barcelona for a mini size bottle.. ( what was in the water??) so I let it go... However, they also charged me 2 euro&#39;s for a &#34;pan&#34;. I asked the waiter what this was for as I only ordered the one dish and the water. He said &#34;Si... I give you bread&#34;. I couldn&#39;t believe he was charging me for bread that 1) should be complimentary and 2) I didn&#39;t even order! I told him I didn&#39;t order the bread and I didn&#39;t even EAT the bread and he quickly took it off... I think he knew he was trying to pull a fast one. <br><br>Pro&#39;s: open late night, fries, mashed potatoes and eggs were good.<br>Con&#39;s: chicken was undercooked, water was over priced, and tried charging me for bread when I didn&#39;t order it.. Shady!! I&#39;ll be finding a new place to eat late night...",

"reviewcomment":"Imagine my surprise when I found a restaurant advertising &#34;Food from America&#34; while walking along the streets of Madrid! <br><br>After seeing the old-fashioned diner design of the restaurant and seeing all of the &#34;American&#34; food the menu offers, my friend and I just had to try it to see whether it measured up to the food back home.<br><br>To be honest, it really wasn&#39;t bad! I got a personalized burger with lettuce, tomato, bleu cheese, and bacon. The patty was decently thick, juicy, and cooked to order, and the blue cheese dressing served as a nice complement to the meat. The fries tasted quite fresh as well.<br><br>I got a strawberry milkshake for my beverage, and I&#39;d have to say that this was the only part of the meal that I was really let down by. It tasted very watery and lacked sweetness and flavor.<br><br>I absolutely love the design and atmosphere of this restaurant however. You actually feel like you&#39;re in a diner when you&#39;re ordering your food, and old black-and-white shows are played on the television as well. When I was getting my take-out, Percy Sledge&#39;s &#34;When a Man Loves a Woman&#34; was playing throughout the restaurant, and I just got ridiculously happy when I heard it.<br><br>Peggy Sue&#39;s. Cute diner. Decent food. &#34;American.&#34;",

A couple of choices for each course, there is something to suit everyone&#39;s tastes.<br><br> The fish lasagne on my recent visit was delightful, although the home made apple pie had far too many raisins for my liking, and the grilled pork slices my b/f had was quite dry.<br><br> Overall though a very nice setting, with english menus and english speaking staff.<br><br> During mon-thur evenings they also offer a night menu for 15 euros (same menu as the meu del dia).",

"reviewcomment":"This is a great Spanish fusion restaurant a few blocks from Gran Via station. It offers a really good menu del dia at lunchtimes for 10.50 euros (Mon-Fri only I think), offering five choices each for starter, main and dessert, including bread, drink and service.<br><br> The waiting staff who served us did not speak English, but with a guidebook with translations, and my basic GCSE Spanish we managed to order a great meal of vegetarian vietnamese style spring rolls, a rice and vegetable stew to start, a lovely piece of white fish with caramelized onions, and a big piece of pork with sauteed vegetables for main, and a glass of fresh orange juice and the tart of the day to finish.

My favorite plate so fas is the carrillada de cerdo, or very tender pig cheeks. It&#39;s delicious.The salmorejo is also really nice. It&#39;s a nice chill place if you just want to munch on a couple of plates or none, and just drink their great wine selection. Also, it&#39;s a great alternative to the pricey Mercado San Miguel, which is right next door.",

A group of about 9 of us went there for a Sunday evening despedida dinner, and we didn&#39;t leave disappointed.<br><br>What stood out the most was the delightful service. Our waiter was bilingual, and the fact that we could ask a myriad of questions about the menu in English and be understood was refreshing. <br><br>We settled on the fried artichokes with spicy sauce (honestly quite bland) and pulpo a la brasa (delicious but a small-ish serving size). The 1E croquettes were pretty good and had three flavor choices. Wine was tasty.<br><br>Ene&#39;s decor is classy, and would be great for a date with your significant other. In fact, they even have some bed/lounge &#34;tables&#34;, were you can literally lounge (and I actually mean practically lay down), wine in hand. Prices were decent but a little high, as one would expect with such a posh place.",

"reviewcomment":"DIOS MIO!!!! Cuando estudie en Madrid yo iba a este restaurante una vez a la semana. Mi favorito? El espagueti boglanese y el pancito por solo 5 euros. Siempre me llenaba y sali FELIZ! todos eran tan amables conmigo.<br><br>I LOVED THIS SPOT!!! I studied abroad in Madrid Spring 2005 ( I know an eternity ago) HOWEVER 7 years later I still can&#39;t forget this place. Seriously the cheapest most delicious meal you will eat for 5 euros. They made the best spaghetti and meat sauce you will eat in all of Spain. Sure Spanish food is good (sometimes debateable) BUT if you are craving home or some delicious pasta this is the spot. Also I remember the owners being super friendly and outgoing. Sometimes they gave out free tapas and wine (heyyy). I love this spot if I ever go back to Madrid coming back here FOR SURE!!!!!",

"reviewcomment":"Being an English expat can get lonely sometimes. It takes time to adjust to cultural differences, customs, and the language of a new city.  Though you are most definitely having the time of your life, you occasionally miss the familiarity and comfort of family and old friends. Estar Cafe was my solace when I craved conversation, laughs, and a warm embracing environment.<br><br>Almost every Sunday at 6:15 PM, I would wait anxiously with masses of other young locals to seize a coveted seat. It was heaven when the gates finally opened and the mixed scent of freshly brewed coffee and sweet ice cream spilled onto the cobblestone street.<br><br>What made the cafe so unique was they had a six foot shelf piled high  of different cards and board games to play. The throng of games ranged from Trivial Pursuit, Clue, Monopoly, Taboo, Life, Scattergories as well as many others I hadn&#39;t heard of before. I always grabbed Scattergories and Jungle Speed.<br><br>I normally kick major tail in Scattergories, but this one had a twist! It was in SPANISH! It was a hoot! The people I played with alternated between English and Spanish. During one round, I was giving this guy a hard time because he didn&#39;t know what a pickle was, yet he knew AND had the audacity to put down &#34;dildos&#34; under &#34;something people collect.&#34; His attempts to explain to the the table what a dildo was remains priceless!<br><br>Estar Cafe was one of my home away from homes. When you leave Estar&#39;s, your face will hurt from all the smiling and laughing! You&#39;d think you had spent the evening with your family on a drunken holiday!",

They were both OK; nothing to write home about however.  The 2 plates of eggs were just over 6 Euro each and since they lacked a bit of salad and stuff, I thought they were over priced.  A half liter of water was 2.50 and a beer 2.45.  <br><br>If you&#39;re in the area and hungry, check it out but there are several other options around as well.",

"reviewcomment":"I learned that it&#39;s not normal to find a restaurant that serves paella in the evening; that this dish is more of a daytime dish. I also learned that getting a table reservation for 6 or more the same day when it&#39;s a Saturday can be a challenge. Thankfully I wasn&#39;t the one doing the leg work on this one. Shouts to Borja, my Spanish connection.<br>I can&#39;t do much to compare with other restaurants in Madrid as I mostly ate tapas and only one other formal dinner, which did not involve paella and was on the other side of town... but I can tell you that when I  return to Madrid there is one place I know for sure that I can guarantee a good dish of paella at a more than reasonable price. For 7 of us, we each shelled out E35 (and one guy didn&#39;t pay anything because it was his birthday) and we enjoyed several cañas (lost track), 3 or 4 bottles of wine, 3 or 4 cocktails, 3 HUGE plates of paella, 3 orders of tapas and gut splitting desert at the end... for around $45 after conversion. I couldn&#39;t do that in Los Angeles if I tried.<br>The service was polite, prompt and elegant. The food was so good I think a few fingers were lost in the fight for the last morsels, and the ambiance of the place was fun but not loud. <br>If you want Europe through the backdoor, and you want paella when most Spaniards are waking from their disco nap, go to El Albur... but have reservations unless you don&#39;t mind waiting or eating at the bar.",

"reviewcomment":"This place was suggested to us by our hotel concierge. We asked him to get us a reservation for flamenco dancing at 10pm so I&#39;m sure he was limited in options. We arrived for our 10:30 reservation and had a pretty decent table, but I think most tables were not bad.<br><br>The show itself was 28 euros. If you don&#39;t want to pay €3+ each for the bread, don&#39;t eat it when they bring it out. Also, water is not free. The sangria was good, as is most places in Madrid. The calamari was also very good, but about €20. We also had the crispy suckling pig (€20-22), which we also enjoyed. The bread, whether for free or €3, was terrible so I suggest that you just not take it. Our final bill was €128 for only 2 people. <br><br>Overall, the only complaint I had was the limited service, and feeling that they were just trying to take advantage of tourists. I had a checkin offer from Yelp that our server didn&#39;t recognize and just ignored like I never showed him. The dancing was great, but take my opinion with a grain of salt since this was my first experience.<br><br>I would absolutely recommend going to a tablao flamenco, but I&#39;d probably suggest finding a different one to go to.",

"reviewcomment":"We went here twice on our trip. The first time was in the middle of the afternoon on Wednesday, there were no customers and the tv was blaring. The man behind the counter looked truly irritated to see us walk in, and even more irritated that we were planning on ordering food and then handing over our money (I think it was love at first site for me ;P) We ordered two squid sandwiches and decided to take our meal to the sit along the side of the square in Plaza Mayor. The sandwiches were AMAZING and I think I ate mine in 4 bites. So, on Saturday we returned, much different atmosphere, the place was wall to wall with customers, all pushing into each other in order to place their order, this time you definitely couldn&#39;t hear the tv over the buzz of people. After much patience and strategy to push our way to the counter to order we got our sandwiches and ran out. All in all an even more fun experience than the first time, and just as good!",

It&#39;s a little neighborhood place that has a nice selection of wine and beer, and tapas, of course. <br><br>Cazorla is especially known for its battered and fried seafood; the shrimp are especially good. I also have enjoyed the tuna salad -- which is very fresh -- and the garlicky gazpacho.<br><br>They don&#39;t speak English here, so be prepared to order in Spanish. Come early, because the place gets very crowded -- standing room only -- in the evenings.

It is a Kaiten sushi type place (Kaiten meaning the conveyor that brings food out past your table - like sushi boat I guess), but most of the dishes tend to be chinese (dumplings, salads, spring rolls, beef &amp; mushrooms, fried chicken, etc...) with some rolls and sushi mixed in (Some salmon and Tuna)..<br><br>It really really depends on which table you get - you need to be in a good upfront spot to hit the salmon sushi&#39;s or salmon/avocado rolls when they come out. Sometimes there is enough to go around, at other times is drying than a lake in sub-sahara Africa.... if the salmon is not coming out, then just ask a server for it and they will bring some over....<br><br>It is what is it - an ALL YOU CAN EAT lunch menu for 9.95 EUR - can beat that in this expensive Salamanca area.",

"reviewcomment":"This is a real Mexican Mexican food restaurant (not tex mex).. Coming this comment from a Mexican girl.<br>Almost every plate comes as a &#34;taco&#34;, made with fresh hand made tortillas. Everything is gluten free (except desserts), so it&#39;s a really good option for someone who is not tolerant to gluten. The prices are high, but I think they&#39;re worth it, although the service is a little bit slow, the food is delicious.<br>You have vegetarian dishes, meat options and seafood.<br>Also, the cocktails are excellent, we tried one called mezcaliña, made with ginger, lime and mezcal, delicious!<br>It is not the typical Mexican restaurant where everyone is with a Mexican sombrero &amp; mustache, and the music is loud; no, this is a gourmet restaurant where there is a quiet, nice, environment.<br>It&#39;s difficult to get a table, so you need to make a 2 week in advance reservation to be sure. There are not to many tables, it&#39;s a small, intimate place.<br>PD: you should like spicy food to go to this restaurant!",

"reviewcomment":"This AYCE restaurant is located in the Plaza Mayor area.  I have to say that I was extremely impressed with this restaurant, not because the food is worldclass caliber. I loved it because it is good value for the money at EU 9.95 per person.  Seriously, in Madrid EU 9.95 would only buy you a snack i.e. a cappuccino, a muffin and a bottled water.  The buffet is quite extensive with so many offerings like different types of salads, pastas, soup, hot dishes (fried chicken wings, roasted chicken, pizza, pork stew, braised ham hock, paella, desserts, etc.  The drinks are also included with the price.  You can also opt for beer instead of softdrinks...now that to me, is super awesome.<br><br>I thought everything on the buffet were very good and I have to give 4-5 stars for the hot dishes.  The service is very friendly, the counter girl even asked me how to say fork, spoons and knives...as a grouping (asking me while she does her hand gestures...so cute) in English....I said...&#34;silverware&#34;.  The place is small but there is a second floor dining area too.  The restrooms are clean and  have papertowels vs hand dryer...that&#39;s a plus for me.  <br><br>I highly recommend this AYCE restaurant to people who are planning on visiting Madrid.  Bookmark this place, try it out (specially when you are running low on money), then you can thank me later.<br><br>PS.  I was going to take a photo of the buffet but opted not to since a lot of businesses in Europe do not allow people to take photos inside their establishments...I respect that.",

He can&#39;t remember the name of the dish he ordered but he loved it. <br><br>The menu has English translation and the waiters are very friendly. It is also very close to the Atocha subway station.

"reviewcomment":"Out &#34;tapeando&#34; in the Malasña neighborhood one a friday evening, we stumbled across this brave new sushi restaurant with the uncommon, curious suggestion written on its chalkboard: &#34;2 makis &amp; caña-  2,50 eur&#34;.  Now, yes, it might be strange:  a little tortilla here, some ham there, a canape with blue cheese, olives, and now a little sushi?  So, why not dare to be different? Indeed it is what our times call for, it is the 21st century- let&#39;s hear it for fusion, contradictions and extremes!<br><br>Yes, I am glad that we ventured in.  Venture being akin to adventure, and that&#39;s what I expect one&#39;s dining experience to be at Banzai.  We sat at the small bar (4 stools) next to the small glassed-in kitchen (yes, you can kind of see what the chefs are up to, but not entirely) and were greeted with absolute hospitality from both the hostess and who I believe was one of the two spanish owners.  Of course, we ordered the two maki and beer special and were pleasantly surprised with a very delicious eel maki (with veggies) roll and excellent beer.  Having had a good fill of tapas before entering the restaurant, we were not up for a meal, but our makis were good enough to incite us to look at the menu and order a few more items.  I had to start with my favorite, classic: salmon nigiri, which was okay.  I bit too fishy for my taste.  We ordered a special roll and a spicy tuna hand roll, which was a hit and a miss.  The former was good, but the latter was less impressive.  In my opinion it was sloppy, not spicy, and had salsa rosa mixed in with it, which some might consider creative, but what proved to be foolish.  <br><br>The customers continued to pour in, so either word of mouth has created buzz or repeat customers are happy with the menu. Or both.  And, I must admit that the menu does have its allure.  There are a number of classic sushis, makis and sashimi to choose from, but their special rolls and new twists are intriguing and I wouldn&#39;t mind giving them a try at a later date myself.  Though, I saw the word &#34;mustard&#34; sprinkled throughout the menu, and although I am not a sushi purist, I find the idea of combining raw fish with mustard rather alarming.  But the truth is that you&#39;ll never know unless you try.<br><br>And, there are plenty of tables in the back, though on the weekends it appeared to be the seating area for those customers with reservations.  Otherwise, if you pop in like we did, in addition to the small bar, there are a few small tables towards the front of the restaurant.",

"reviewcomment":"LOVED this place! <br><br>This place isn&#39;t far from Plaza del Sol which is a super touristy part of town. That said however, there were not a lot of tourists here. Clearly, this is a local hang out. Although...they did have a menu in English for us. So... still, looking around, this seemed like a local crowd. Or tourists who all spoke beautiful Spanish.<br><br>For starters, they set down a small dish of chorizo or something like it. Since I haven&#39;t eaten meat in about 23 years, I couldn&#39;t tell you what it was. However...I *could* tell you that it tasted really delicious and I astounded my husband by asking for seconds and thirds. Yup, that&#39;s how good the stuff was.<br><br>Hubby had some meat dish that he loved - and devoured heartily. I had grilled prawns that were delicious and fresh. We also had some Spanish tortilla and washed it all down with some rioja. So good. <br><br>But, you need to time it right. It was a Sunday evening - early - like somewhere around 7p or 8p and it was PACKED. Luckily, we didn&#39;t have to wait for a table. It was<br>amazing. Go here!!!",

"reviewcomment":"This is hands-down my favorite restaurant in Madrid! The service is great, the atmosphere is pleasant, clean, and romantic, and the owner is very hands-on.<br><br>My girlfriend came to visit me from the U.S., and I took her here on her birthday. We came in without a reservation, and the owner squeezed us in (I have tried to come here on several other occasions without a reservation and failed). My girlfriend does not speak Spanish well, so the owner gave her a menu in English and explained his favorite dishes to her. The service was great, and the waitstaff also gave us some pointers (For example, they suggested that I order the venison. I usually like meat rare, but they suggested that I have it cooked medium rare or medium, which was the right call).<br><br>We had the burrata with prawns and garlic and the curry mussels to start. The burrata dish may be the best appetizer I have ever had. SO delicious.<br><br>For our mains, we ordered the venison and the chicken tagine. The venison was unbelievable. I only tried a bit of the chicken tagine, but my girlfriend liked it.<br><br>For dessert, we ordered the chocolate souffle and the apple tart filo pastry. The chocolate souffle is out-of-control good. The apple tart had a certain spice to it, and they pair it with ice cream.<br><br>We also had a bottle of wine.<br><br>Our total bill came out to around 80E. Not too shabby for such an impressive meal.<br><br>We loved our meal so much that we came back on her last night in Madrid.<br><br>We had the burrata starter again. She ordered the venison, and I ordered the lamb. The lamb has a honey sauce and is delicious. For dessert we shared a chocolate souffle, and because we were going out for drinks after, we ordered our wines by the glass. Our total bill came out to around 55E.<br><br>The restaurant is rather small, so I definitely recommend making a reservation well in advance (several days). Talk to the owner. He speaks English and Spanish (and possibly a few other languages). He&#39;s very nice and helpful. He is clearly very hands-on, and his attention to detail shows in the quality of his restaurant. He knows the menu inside and out and can suggest the best things to order.<br><br>I will definitely be back there soon!",

My friend and I were just wanting to find somewhere to relax, get some coffee and breakfast and wait for our next flight.<br><br>We came here and took a seat up at the counter. We tried the tortilla española with a latte and of course we also had to get hot chocolate with churros. Both were great! <br><br>The gentleman working at the counter was friendly, the prices were reasonable, the place was clean and fairly spacious and best of all they had good wifi!

"reviewcomment":"This establishment has been around for years.  Probably around 20 or more.  I&#39;ve been frequenting this restaurant-bar since my husband introduced me to the place 9 years ago.  Not much has changed since then.  It&#39;s a great place to meet up for beer, cider and eats.  The beer on tap is good and fresh.  The food, as well.  I&#39;ve had most of the tapas on the menu, save for many of the meat dishes since I&#39;m a vegetarian (I eat seafood, though), and they are always fresh, delicious, and the portions hugely satisfying.  The place will get pretty packed on evening (meaning 10pm onward) weekends, but there is ample room.  The bar has many stools and a side bar where you can also stand, socialize and chow down.  There are also many tables, big and small.  The service is solid.  The waitstaff are efficient and have a nice, wry Spanish sense of humor.  Stand out tapas:  Pastel de cabracho (fish pudding), chopitos (fried baby squid), and patatas con cabrales (potatoes with strong blue cheese sauce).  The bread is heavenly. And best of all, it&#39;s easy on the pocket book.  A stellar find.",

"reviewcomment":"The restaurant is located downstairs in the basement and has a strangely complicated choice of menus depending on what day of the week you visit, what time of the day it is on that day of the week, and what you are wearing at that particular time of the day on that particular day of the week. Or something like that. The menus are generally two-course and will cost between EUR15 and EUR18. this is quite pricey for a two-course menu del dia but bare in mind that the food is generally organic and local and that the menu is way more creative than the typical menu del dia found elsewhere. There are loads of vegan options.

"reviewcomment":"I&#39;m not the hugest fan of tapas, especially the way they do it in the States, as it just seems like an excuse to give you less food for more money while not really filling you up.  It&#39;s hit and miss in Spain as well, apparently in Madrid they have discovered a way to stay solvent while offering FREE tapas included with a purchase of a drink.  Very similar to aperitivos in Milan.  Naturally this means a lot of cheap, fat-on-carb type stuff gets doled out, but it&#39;s free, so can&#39;t complain.  El Tigre is the most well-known with locals, tourists and study-abroad types all getting in on the action, but La Esquina de Eusebio is totally better.  Not only is the booze cheaper, but whereas the dudes at El Tigre will hand you a plate of stuff they pick out, La Esquina will just put out trays of tapas and it&#39;s completely self-serve.  It&#39;s the usual rotation: sausage rounds, tuna, salami, baguette slices with an array of cured pork and cheese-based toppings.  You never know what the bartender will pull out next from under the counter.  La Esquina, being located somewhat out of the way from the city center, is also significantly less crowded and has more of a neighborhood vibe than El Tigre, with random-ass taxidermy adorning the walls, a selection of eccentric older clientele holding birthday celebrations, a football match basically always on in the background.  Seriously, if I lived anywhere near there I would never leave.",

"reviewcomment":"Originally stopped into Chilango because we saw some people inside the window drinking margaritas and definitely needed to investigate.  I think they may only have frozen margaritas, but they definitely impress.  Fairly strong, good taste for only 5 euros.  The bartender was also friendly and helped us out with the (extremely confusing) wifi password.  The Chilango nachos are also delicious - very cheesy with lots of guacamole and other toppings to spare.<br><br>Went back to Chilango for more of a sit down meal a few nights ago and was also impressed with their dinner menu.  Margaritas and nachos were as good as remembered, but their &#34;burritos&#34; (unlike American burritos) were very fresh and delicious as well.<br><br>Will definitely return whenever I need my tequila fix!",

Besides sitting next to an obnoxious group of American high schoolers in Madrid for a trip, the show was great.  The dancers were very energetic and passionate about the music. <br><br>The flamenco show featured passionate musicians and energetic dancers. The stage is small and the venue is small, so be sure to either reserve a ticket online or come early.",

I paid under 3 euros for a glass of red wine, and enjoyed complimentary cheese, sausage, and almonds alongside. The wine was not the best I&#39;d ever had, but it was very inexpensive so I&#39;m not shocked by that. They have a variety of tapas available as well, and you can eat standing at the bar or sitting at one of the handful of small tables. <br><br>La Dolores had a neighborhood feel I really liked. The patrons were social with one another and with the bartenders, and the bar did not seem to be full of tourists. I would definitely head back here for a drink or two.",

"reviewcomment":"Lo más impactante de la Barriga Llena cuando entras es la manera tan divertida en que está decorado el restaurante. El objeto que más destaca es el VW escarabajo que está empotrado en el techo de la esquina del fondo del local. Un toque muy divertido y exótico. La decoración del local da un aire de diversión y de relajación. La gente es muy agradable pero lo mejorcito del restaurante es la comida. Hay que ir con alguien que sabe para poder realmente conocer la comida tan exquisita de la Barriga Llena. Todos los platos que preparan están llenos de sabor. Unos más picantes que otros, pero todos muy sabrosos. El plato más sabroso (en mi opinión) es el Pollo Cabreado unas tiras de pollo mezclada con una salsa de queso Cabrales espectacular! Y para después de una noche larga, una michelada no viene nada mal. Suerte!",

Nice decoration, a great variety of tables and sitting areas, and an interesting concept are reasons why I stopped in but I don&#39;t see myself going back.

"reviewcomment":"We travelled to Madrid,Spain on a family vacation (with three kids) and wanted to expose them (and ourselves) to some traditional flamenco.  Cardamomo was one of the top rated flamenco experiences, so we pre-booked (which I strongly recommend) and selected the 9pm show on a weekday.  It did not disappoint!  If you visit Madrid...experiencing authentic flamenco is a must, and I strongly suggest you try Cardamomo!<br><br>The place is quite intimate...all seats are good, even if you sit toward the back (there is a raised, theater style floor, so your view is great anywhere you sit).  They have an excellent sound system, and the service is helpful and attentive.  We tried several of their appetizers (each were good) and they offered great sangria and one of the all time best Mojitos I have ever tried (try one - it was awesome)!   They have  outstanding &#34;acoustic&#34; flamenco musicians (five total) and multiple male and female flamenco dancers.  Each was outstanding.  They put on a strong show for about 90 minutes and the passion of the performers is astonishing.  The price of the ticket includes a drink.  <br><br>Even our kids (ages 10, 8 and 5) loved the show and wanted to return.  Highly recommend!",

"reviewcomment":"Why are people spilling out of this joint that it had to open another branch just across the street? Because it serves the best tapas for the best prices in the city. <br><br>They&#39;ve got the typical and delicious Galician pulpo, tons of different types of olives, hard bread with a warm center, and fried fish like this anchovy we had that day. Even in the pouring rain, this place was standing room only at the bar and the wait for the dining room was infinite (we made a reservation of course) but it sat all 8 of my hubster&#39;s family comfortably and fed us amply. The service is quick as a whip because they need to make room at the small tables for all the dishes we ordered.<br><br>Great place and definitely authentico as all get go.",

"reviewcomment":"After reading sketchy reviews on the food, we opted for the drink and show option only. We walked in 45 minutes early to our show, and saw two people dining on pork chops. It looked great, but we&#39;re glad we opted to stay local instead (Los Zuritos off Calle Atocha), and it was much cheaper! We spent 1/3 less at an off-site restaurant. <br><br>When we walked in, there were only two tables filled. We knew we were early, but figured that it would get packed soon thereafter. Fifteen minutes later, they started the show (thank goodness we arrived early!!) with only one additional table. This is a fairly big room, and only four tables (us included) were filled. The show, the dancers, the music and the singers were WONDERFUL and they really get into their performance. <br><br>The only reason I&#39;m not giving five stars is because I imagine the atmosphere would have been much better had the place been somewhat busy or even half full! Also: the wine is gross. Get sangria!",

"reviewcomment":"Definitely, a very good place to go if you like meat. The Almuerzo de la vaca menu is amazing value for money, but it&#39;s only available Monday to Friday at lunch time. For 15EUR you can have a small starter (hummus with bread), big beef steak with a quite big side (choosing from roasted vegetables, salad, chips and peppers), 1/2 bottle wine, beer or soft drink and a homemade dessert plus coffee.<br>I went here with some work colleagues. I&#39;m not a fan of red meat, and apart from the steak, you can choose salmon or sardines as main, but given the name of the restaurant (The cow Veronica), I decided I should give it a try. It was very good indeed, although I could only eat half (even though I didn&#39;t try the starter and my side of choice was salad). For dessert, everyone in my table recommended the homemade ice cream so I tried fig and raspberry. I didn&#39;t really like it, but I&#39;m quite demanding with ice cream. Raspberry is not a sorbet and none of the two flavours was very creamy.<br>Service was fast and very friendly, and although I wouldn&#39;t come here again, I totally recommend it and understand that for meat lovers this place is a must.",

The beer was the best in all of Madrid, way better than the typical Spanish piss style beer (mahou). The service could use a little help, but as soon as you get their attention they are very helpful. One of the best meals I&#39;ve had in Europe, not just Spain.  It&#39;s underground sort of, take the steps down by McDonalds and its the first restaurant on your left.",

We were recommended this place and told it was some of the cheapest around but still the best. We were immediately seated upon walking in but by the time we left a little after 10, the place was packed. The friendly servers were very attentive and let us take our time looking at the menu but were fast to grab our order when we were ready. <br><br>When we sat, we were given the Indian equivalent of chips and salsa. The green sauce was fresh and tangy and made for a nice starter. For food, we went with chicken tikka, saag paneer, garlic naan and some plain white rice (which you have to order separately). All of it was delicious- especially the chicken and naan. The bill didn&#39;t even surpass 20 Euro and we left very full and happy!<br><br>In a neighborhood packed with Indian restos, I think I will rely on this one for when I&#39;m in the mood.",

"reviewcomment":"Four words.... This place is amazing! I&#39;m not vegan, or a vegetarian for that matter, but I got the veggie pizza on ciabatta bread and it was DELICIOUS!!! Our tapas consisted of French bread with garlic hummus, and then tortilla Española (am I saying that right?) with some sort of sauce. My pizza was only €5  and was more than enough food, especially after the tapas, and I was literally upset that I couldn&#39;t finish it because it was so yummy. My roommate got vegan toastada which was really good too, although I&#39;m not a big fan of soy cheese... Or soy anything for that matter. When we got there the place was dead, but by the time we left we could barely get out of the door because it was so packed! Filled with locals, of all ages, because it takes a real madrileño to know where la comida mejor is!!",

Adorable, well-decorated place set to jazz music, with a fantastic Spanish-American fusion menu, including a welcome strong selection of sandwiches and salads, as well as fantastic teas and desserts. It really should have sofas or comfier seats, as it seems a little confused if it wants to be a coffeehouse or a restaurant, with service a little uneven, but I think theyre just finding their footing. A definite recommendation, especially to go to before or after seeing an old flick at the Filmoteca it faces.",

You then eat the stew with the following (or you don&#39;t).  To be honest I don&#39;t know, but that&#39;s what I did.<br><br>-Potatoes<br>-Chickpeas<br>-Chicken<br>-Beef<br>-Pork<br>-Two types of sausage<br><br>I really liked the beef, nice and tender. I thought the chicken was bland, but the pork was tasty as well.  I tried one of the sausages which was ok, had a distinct taste.<br><br>There was so much food though and we barely ate a 1/3 of it. It was good to try this though, since it&#39;s very different and you probably couldn&#39;t get something like that in the states. <br><br>I wish I could comment more, but this was my first time having it and it was nice to enjoy something authentic and different.

The decor is so close to being tacky it&#39;s not (if that makes since) I loved the vive, great music and good if you&#39;re looking for hot food and not tapas! I got chicken quesodillas and chips and guacamole both times!  Great mango margaritas I got the frozen kind! Also really god sangria and mojitos ( really fresh) I truly recommend this restaurant especially if you&#39;re traveling and not used to eating cold tapas or jamon for every meal hahaha!",

"reviewcomment":"Sure, All You Can Eat buffets are cool... But how much cooler is All You Can Eat sushi when it&#39;s sailing by on little boats? That&#39;s what I thought. <br><br>You can take a seat around the circular bar at Summa and start grabbing plates off the ships right away. In other words, this is the perfect place to come if you&#39;re hungry and want food fast. For 20 Euros you can eat as much as you want, and it even comes with a big bowl of miso soup and ice cream to round out the meal (although the price does not include your drink of choice). <br><br>Of course, I had to try practically everything that went by. Even if I tried to resist one plate, after watching it pass by a couple times, it was impossible to refuse. If you&#39;re not a raw fish kind of person, you don&#39;t need to worry. Mixed in with the sushi are dishes like chicken teriyaki kebabs, pot stickers, dumplings, and tempura vegetables. I loved all of the fried tempura rolls that were, for lack of better words, a hot and creamy explosion in my mouth. They also had a unique strawberry roll served alongside some sweet eel sauce that I especially liked. <br><br>Word to the wise: Pace yourself. There&#39;s nothing worse than eating as much as you can, all to find that an enticing never before seen concoction comes your way. It might lead you to go over the edge and trust me, it&#39;s never pretty.",

"reviewcomment":"I approached Bangkok with low expectations, despite the reommendation of a friend. My experiences with ethnic food in Madrid have been dismal at best. The Thai food here though was dare I say it decent. Maybe even a bit better than decent, tasty.<br><br>We arrived just before the normal Spanish lunch hour (2-2:30) securing the best seat in the restaurant next to the window overlooking Arenal. Great for puppy watching. <br><br>Despite it being a Saturday the menu del dia (2 courses, a dessert and drink) was in full effect. I ordered the tallerines, pad thai for my first pate, green curry chicken for my second and a tea for dessert. They had about five options for each plate. Everything came out fast and piping hot. The green curry chicken was a bit too spicy for my bf, but typical spice level for green curry. By our second plate the restaurant really started to fill in. <br><br>The service was typical in Spain. No smiling waiters, no niceties. But I appreciated the efficiency. At 12€ each I left pretty satisfied.",

"reviewcomment":"This was good for me, bad for my wife.  Just in from barcelona, we were staying our last night in spain near the Atocha train station.  The previous week, we were near La Latina, and had tried lots of tapas places.  Wanting to stay nearby, our hotel receptionist recommended this place since it was just down the street.  She told us that it was traditional Spanish food.  Well, I liked my meal.  We started with octopus cooked in butter and salt.  Again, I liked it, my wife decided that she does not like octopus, in comparison to calamari.  I had the roasted, suckling pig that came with fries and grilled peppers.  I thought it was excellent, and had been want to try this through our vacation.  It is basically the same as Filipino lechon, which I love.  Anyhow, my wife got a fillet of sole grilled.  She found it very plain, and regretted not ordering the version with meuniere sauce.  So... I&#39;d recommend this place if you want traditional Spanish food.  My wife was disappointed, but I think she ordered the wrong things for her taste.",

"reviewcomment":"Our hotel recommended this seafood restaurant for our &#34;splurge&#34; night out of the trip. It was located right in the heart of the shopping area of Madrid and looked pretty swanky from the outside. The hotel concierge had made us reservations, which we apparently did not even need... there was hardly anyone there!<br><br>We were, however, given the absolute ROYAL treatment upon arrival. The hostess took us upstairs to a more private room with dim lightning and faint Spanish guitar playing. Very romantic for my female companion and I! The art deco design of the restaurant upstairs was really impressive. We were seated next to the window overlooking the shops below. <br><br>The service was unmatched; probably the nicest waitstaff I have ever encountered in a restaurant. The waitress asked if we had a preference of music that we would like her to play for us. The chef sent out not one, but two complimentary appetizer specials. We ordered 2 plain Paellas, but the chef tossed in literally EVERY type of sea food and meat  they must have had without asking or charging. A truly nice gesture... luckily neither of us were allergic to anything and we&#39;re both very open minded! It was reeeallly delicious, but very very fishy when our pallets were not at all prepared for...well...fish. The waitress served us table side and our wine glasses were never empty for a second before they were refilled. It was all fantastic... but to a certain degree... a bit much and overwhelming as well. <br><br>This all might have had something to do with the fact that we were pretty much the only patrons in the entire establishment at the time... but I like to think it was all because we&#39;re just THAT special! :-)",

We couldn&#39;t wait too late to eat so were some of their first customers for the evening and the waitstaff was perfectly accommodating. <br><br>They started by bringing us 3 huge pieces of bread which we necessarily weren&#39;t in the mood for and almost regretted touching when we saw it cost us 6 Euros. However, we looked past that and were glad to get plenty of olives with our pitcher of sangria and an order of calamari on the house. Our waitress was even kind enough to bring a whole pitcher of water which was appreciated later on in the meal. <br><br>We went with the paella mixta and it came out piping hot and delicious. The seafood was plentiful and the pieces of chicken also great. It was so hard to stop eating but the three of us were so full after only digging into about half of it. <br><br>The whole meal came out to about 17 per person which isn&#39;t bad considering how full and satisfied we were. I&#39;d definitely come back and recommend it to anyone looking for quality rice.",

"reviewcomment":"I grabbed my first slice from here while walking home after completing a long run (yes I know it&#39;s a little ironic). But hey, I was hungry and the smell of baking pizza wafting through the air caught the attention of my taste buds. I stepped up to the street side window and ordered a slice of ham pizza to-go. They warmed it up in the oven and I could not wait until I got all the way home to eat it. When I walked through the door, all but a couple bites remained.<br><br>My first words to my roomie was &#34;That was way better than I expected.&#34; Her response? &#34;It&#39;s almost too good, ya know?&#34; Hinting that if we constantly ate there like we knew we would want to, I&#39;d need to see a lot more long runs in my future. <br><br>Either way, it&#39;s nice to have such a great pizza place so close to my home. Their pizza is NYC style- thin, hot and delicious. For 10 Euro you can get a very generous personal pizza. They also run midday lunch deals, along with specials during the week like Wednesdays when medium pizzas are knocked down to just 5 Euro from 15. They also deliver quickly and are overall nice people running the joint. <br><br>In a world where pizza can sometimes be blah, I&#39;d rather have this potentially &#34;too good&#34; spot as opposed to a &#34;too gross&#34; one.",

All dishes are prepared byMiguel Pérez Pardo, the owner, bartender, photographer and all around great guy! We met wonderful people at this restaurant/tapas bar especially a woman name Teresa who lives next door.  She is an absolute angel and is a wonderful representation of the warmth of the Madrellanos.<br><br>We had wonderful beer on tap, and  several dishes: <br><br>Carmelita peas, hortelano chicken, delicious salmorejo, papas  and bacon quiche. You can order Tapa size or a full size portion. I recommend ful size on the chicken and the quiche is only one size. <br><br>Our first night in Madrid and Tapas y Fotos provided a warm, fun, delicious evening off the usual touristy traps,<br><br>I highly recommend you give it a try but remember to bring a Spanish/English dictionary as Miguel speaks no English.",

"reviewcomment":"We decided to take a mini adventure over to the other side of town to try Pui&#39;s Thai Tapas based upon reading excellent trip advisor reviews. As we entered this little restaurant, we were greeted by several staff members filled with smiles. After all Thailand is called &#34;the land of smiles.&#34; It was early on a Saturday night, with a Spain-France soccer match going on outside, leaving the restaurant nice and quiet.<br><br>As we flipped open the menu, we noticed several unique dishes. We decided to start with smoked salmon vegetable spring rolls composed of soft rice paper. These were fresh and tasteful.<br><br>Next we tried the chili basil fried rice. This dish was different from any other type of Thai dish I&#39;ve ever had. After that we ordered the crispy fish in red curry sauce. This was my favorite. Not too greesy or oily. The curry was filled with so many different spices and favors. Nothing like I&#39;ve ever tastes in my life. I cook Thai curry all the time....Panang, red curry, green curry, but my curry always lacks this authentic Thai touch.<br><br>I would describe this restaurant as gourmet, but authentic at the same time. Also inexpensive since the portion sizes are rather generous. <br><br>Atmosphere: the restaurant had a nice, calm and quiet ambiance with soothing music in the background. Everything was clean and fresh. The staff was friendly and welcoming. <br><br>If you are in Madrid, you MUST check this place out. I&#39;ve been to Thailand before and I would say this is still the best Thai food I have ever tasted! Aroi Mak!",

Yes tapas are free in Madrid if you order drinks. The thing with free tapas is that you don&#39;t really get to choose what is provided to you; however, the variety here makes up for it as you just keep eating different things anyway. We had nuggets, meatballs, pigs ear, jamon, olives (the pits go on the ground, as usual), cod croquetas, and more! Drunk and fed - and the guy behind the counter is busy but lovely. Stop by for drinks or to order dinner - definitely worth it!",

I also heard it&#39;s very crowded and hard to get a table so I was on my way to a different pizza restaurant and I happened to see there was no wait and quickly proceeded into the restaurant.<br>The hardest part was deciding what to order. If you like Neapolitan you will love this pizza! It brought me back to my vacation in Italy. The pizzas are served individual size and we ordered two and split them. We ordered a plain margarita pizza and one specialty. When I tell you it was fresh, I mean you can taste the flavors as if the tomatoes were picked out back just before placing them on the pizza! <br>I would not hesitate to return and enjoy the atmosphere and great service.",

The food served was cold and not even cooked freshly but looked like it was deep fried again and again. Very expensive as we ended up paying 30 euros per head for shitty service and food. The rice was the not basmati but some cheap one as we had told them to serve us traditional indian basmati rice. Just went once and never again nor did my friends.<br><br>Not recommended for good Indian taste..",

We also tried the Lentils Rioja, probably the best lentils I&#39;ve ever had!!! Made very traditionally but so delicious. <br>The crowd is also great, young people and older folks just having great conversations with a drink and friends. <br>Stop here if your in the area, for sure!",

"reviewcomment":"Just when I had all but given up on my search for decently priced yet quality sushi in Madrid, a friend stepped in with this recommendation. I will admit I was a bit (ok very) skeptical when I heard that not only was it good sushi, but also an all-you-can-eat joint for only 11.50. However, she was insistent so I decided to try it out when I was in dire need of a sushi fix. <br><br>The place was packed on a Sunday afternoon so I took that as a good sign. On top of that, the staff was not very friendly so I could only assume the food must be good if so many people were there when nothing else was striking. They gave us our paper menu to order and we started penciling in all that we wanted. The food came out at lightning speed which was nice because we were starving. Word to the wise- do not order everything at once. If so, you will end up with a full table with more than you will want to eat. Instead, take it in multiple rounds and your stomach will thank you later. <br><br>I made it a point to be close to starving before this outing so I could eat a lot and eat a lot I did! Go for the dumplings, California rolls, temaki and maki. Skip the edamame (mushy), tempura (too much oily batter) and noodles (too slimy). Also, know that the drinks are not included but overall, you get way more than you would pay for at your standard sushi spot.",

"reviewcomment":"I&#39;m calling bollocks on Fantastico.<br><br>It didn&#39;t start off bad, as a group of me and two friends entered and were immediately charmed by the environment of this trendy Indian restaurant. As we looked at the menu, we did notice the prices, but we also noticed the pictures and thought it was probably well worth it. <br><br>We began with a couple of entrantes: some simosas and one friend ordered the nachos. The simosas were quite delicious but the nachos were just doritos buried in partially melted cheese. Maybe that&#39;s what you get for ordering nachos at an Indian restaurant, but still; doritos?<br><br>We placed our order and got our food, each sauce in different metal containers and with plates of rice on the side(the rice/naan is 3 euro extra, so without it you just get a sauce). We began to eat and while it was quite good, it didn&#39;t blow me away. <br><br>Everything was fine until we got the cuenta: 61 euro! For 3 people. 2 cans of coke was 5 euro. Two plates of rice and an order of naan was 9euro. Each container of sauce was at least 10 euro. <br><br>In the end, we each walked away, having eaten all of the food(the were not big portions) and feeling like we got almost nothing out of it. I am tempted to give my first 1star, but because the food was good and the environment was nice, it will remain 2 stars. <br><br>I don&#39;t think I have ever walked away feeling so ripped off by an Indian restaurant in my life.",

It was not the best paella I&#39;ve had, but overall value is pretty good. With  drinks, paella, and dessert, you pay about 20+ Euros. They make so many varieties of paella, like paella madrileña con callos y garbanzos, o paella vasca, con puerros, bacalao y coliflor, etc.  It&#39;s also centrally located, not too far from the Prado Museum. The ambiance outweighs the food quality, but it&#39;s worth checking out the patio..... es un sitio muy curioso &amp; divertido!",

"reviewcomment":"My husband and I visited Lah! twice while visiting Madrid. We originally were drawn to it on our first evening, as we were hungry and it was only several blocks from our hotel. The interior design team should receive a reward for their work. The restaurant is beautiful. There&#39;s a wonderful youtube video that demonstrates the interior nicely. <br><br>The staff was friendly and professional: taking the time to explain dishes of interest. After sitting down they give you hot toweling to clean your hands with, then, prepare yourself for the most insane explosion of tastes! Every customer is given a small dish with a 3-4 inch leaf with several ingredients placed upon it. We were told this is a typical Thai food that the Chef brought back and reinvented to introduce several authentic tastes of Thailand to the Spanish customer. It. was. amazing. My husband is still talking about it more than one month later, and has even attempted to have our local Thai restaurant recreate it. It was a combination of sweet, sour, and spicy -- like none other we have tasted.<br><br>The menus are on iPads, so you can choose the language you are most comfortable with. (Ingenius!) Descriptions and well--designed photos abound.<br><br>There are dishes for both the meat eater and the vegetarian, and prices are very reasonable. (Most dishes are large enough to be shared. We spent more at VIP eating very mediocre food.)<br><br>The food is delicious. The price is cheap. The atmosphere is groovy. Don&#39;t miss it!",

I walked by restaurant after restaurant, each of which served paella. For some reason, I walked into this place. The man said he could prepare a wonderful, individual-sized plate of paella in 10 minutes. That should have been a sign. When he brought it out, it looked like red rice sitting in a pool of grease. It turned my stomach. Total let down.",

"reviewcomment":"We ate at Restaurant Momo since that was recommended for the 3 course meal. Our dinner was 16 euros per person. Dinner was a great value since my husband and I were really full after the appetizer! Service was okay, not that great. Food wasn&#39;t bad for the price.<br><br>Appetizers: <br>1) Couscous with berries, tomatoes, and cucumbers - We didn&#39;t need to dress the salad because there was enough flavors from the berries. The berries were smaller blackberries. <br>2) Soybean soup with cod and spinach - Lots of veggies with small pieces of cod. It was a hearty soup.<br><br>Main Entree: <br>1) Salmon cerviche with mango, avocado, and mandarin oranges - This was pretty good! Had nice flavors with the fruits and the fish.<br>2) Pork with goat cheese and apples <br><br>Dessert:<br>1) Carrot cake - This was really dense cake, but wasn&#39;t buttery.<br>2) Lemon pie - Lots of lemon flavor in the cream/mousse. It wasn&#39;t a typical lemon pie from Marie&#39;s Calendar.<br><br>Credit cards accepted. For dinner, the restaurant opens at 9pm.",

Great atmosphere, loungebeds where they bring you blankets in winter and comparabily cheap prices!<br>You get a glass of good Rioja for 3 euros only. The church&#39;s tower next to the lounge is lighted what makes the place more beautiful.<br>Staff can be very friendly when they don&#39;t have a lot of people but also stressed and annoyng when there is lot of clients and they are overloaded.<br>Definitely worth going there and have a drink!",

"reviewcomment":"Undoubtedly one of the prettiest rooftops in the city with a 360º view of Madrid&#39;s urban landscape located above the Círculo de Bellas Artes gallery which already is a must visit by itself.<br><br>The rooftop is divided in 2 areas, a chill-out which is just perfect for watching the sunset while having a cocktail or a spiced up Gin Tonic and the &#39;Tartan Roof&#39;, their restaurant which serves food inspired by street markets around the world.<br>I came to the restaurant for Sunday lunch. Got many recommendations from our server which were spot on.<br>I tried the Tortilla, probably one of the best I&#39;ve had in Madrid, but my absolute favourite dish was the &#39;Chukasoba&#39;, a ribs and noodles dish with hoisin sauce that was just fantastic.<br>For dessert I decided to skip the sweets (which looked great by the way) and went for the cheese platter, which was excellent.<br>This place has it all, extremely yummy food, friendly service and a view that has no match, I am definitely coming back.",

It was Sunday afternoon, and the crowd was mellow, chatting quietly at the few tables in the front room. The bartender was busy working on what looked to be well-made carajillos (café con brandy). But the coffee itself was awful. Really, an undrinkable cup. I left it at the table and asked for the bill, as I&#39;d lost the ability to enjoy myself in the place where music ranged from Night at the Roxbury dance tunes to Van Morrison with no continuity at all. The espresso shot came out to 2.5EUR. I&#39;ll not be returning.",

"reviewcomment":"With a wonderful location across from the Park Retiro, Azabal is a perfect way to conclude a long stroll around the park.  They have large wine list with selections all along the price spectrum.  Since i t was the last night in Madrid for one our our party, we decided to celebrate properly with an expensive bottle.  The staff was polite enough to notify us that it was the last bottle, so we&#39;d need to switch to another wine once we&#39;d finished that first bottle.  That was not a problem for us since we planned on buying the cheapest bottle after splurging, since the first bottle was so good that anything after would surely taste like two buck chuck in comparison.<br>The service here was excellent, they filled our wine glasses, water glasses, and swapped out the plates and silverware between courses.  The food was superb, all the dishes were subtly flavorful and simply presented.  They don&#39;t have an English menu, but the waitress translated every item on the menu for us.<br>Afterward we went in search for a Gin and tonic bar, only to learn that Azabal has a reputation for making a top notch gin tonic.  May try to get back and try it.",

The menu is very appetizing and the wine list features many great choices.",

"reviewcomment":"I was here yesterday for lunch and the place, although small, is very good.  My order was a burger, but this was a burger made from chicken.  They tell you immediatley that for a burger (beef or chicken) that it will take 15-20 minutes, which is nice to know if you&#39;re in a hurry; but who is Spain is in a hurry?!  The burger came fully decked out with lettuce and tomato and sme excellent fries, more like potato wedges.  <br><br>A friend who was also there had a vegetable wrap which she raved about and said that she would be going back there at least weekly.  Well, she works 3 blocks away, so fine for some.  <br><br>What I liked was that I asked for a beer and there were about 5 different ones to choose from including one from Argentina!  I cannot remember the name but took a photo of it that I&#39;ll post here.  <br><br>The place is very clean, the waiter who I think might be the manager or owner, spoke decent English, and it was just a really nice place.  They also serve cheese cake but the burger filled me up.",

"reviewcomment":"This is my new favorite cheap Japanese food restaurant in Madrid. They have an all-you-can-eat concept if you want or you can order small plates. We chose the buffet style menu, which, during the weekends, allows you to order from most of the menu. The quality was great for the low price. I liked the seaweed salad, the crab, and the salmon tartar. Really good. They do penalize if you do not finish your plates. That was not a problem at all for us though. We just took our time and ordered slowly and knew just how much food we could handle.The interior is nice and the service was quick.",

"reviewcomment":"Went back the first chance I had. It was a Tuesday night and we were hungry but were told that the kItchen was closed on Tuesdays. But the woman took really good care of us and recommended where to go to get some grub.<br><br>A few nights later we returned and had a pleasant dinner. I had the same burger I had in August, but it was presented very differently. The ramekins of caramelized onions etc, were gone (just mustard and ketchup), and the bun was a more &#34;normal&#34; brioche type thing. It was VERY good, but not as exciting as the first time.<br><br>I have despaired of finding good deserts in Madrid, but the carrot cake was actually pretty good. Kind of a tart style cake. A bit sweet for my tastes but a cut above most Spanish deserts I&#39;ve had so far.<br><br>I&#39;ll go back next time I&#39;m in Madrid. No question.",

Is probably the most Mexican-like restaurant  in Madrid. The location is itself cool as the theme is about Mexican-WWE that creates an interesting atmosphere.<br>I can recommend trying the tinga de pollo wich is really good and their agua fresca is. very refreshing. <br>The only cons I see is that it could be a little bit overpriced for a foreign student in Madrid.",

The people are very nice and the ingredients taste incredibly fresh. <br><br>HOWEVER, this place is also a joke! They seriously charge for silverware!!! How do they expect you to eat with your hands!! The prices are a bit outrageous and charging for silver ware is like charging for napkins, GET IT TOGETHER!",

"reviewcomment":"Need to preface this with the following: I&#39;m half Argentine -- the half that loves cows that are lovingly grass fed in the Pampas and get to soak up the sun. La Cabaña is the second best Argentine steakhouse I&#39;ve been to in my LIFE. <br><br>If you&#39;re curious, my number one favorite is in Buenos Aires (La Brigada, get the entraña al punto). But I digress. La Cabaña&#39;s entraña al punto is the kind of meal I&#39;ll remember fondly years from now--just as I&#39;ve salivated over memories of my dinner at La Brigada. <br><br>Located walking distance from Plaza de Santa Ana, we got there at 9PM, which we thought was late enough. Dinner doesn&#39;t usually start until 11PM in Madrid, so bring the TUMS. By 10PM the restaurant was completely full (on a weekday), so reservations are recommended.<br><br>It&#39;s so rare to get a steak so perfectly executed that it requires no salt, sauce, bread or fixings. Argentine steak is typically served at a perfect pink medium (al punto) with a crispy crust and mega moist middle. Our steaks were served on a communal platter that arrived sizzling and could have easily served 3-4. I said could have. We had no problems devouring it--every bite coupled with a head shake and close of the eyes to soak in the experience.",

"reviewcomment":"Ethiopian food holds a special place in my heart. I don&#39;t know how my love affair began but it started when I was really young and has never ended. I decided it was time to see what Madrid had to offer in terms of Ethiopian restos so decided to give Nuria a shot. <br><br>I was anxious to say the least but calmed down with one sip of the sweet honey wine which I had never tried before. I liked the authenticity of drinking it out of the carafe and got excited to see what else was in store. We went with a couple meat platters and the vegetarian combo that gives you a bit of everything. The place wasn&#39;t too crowded so it didn&#39;t take us too long to get our food. Once it came, I don&#39;t think me and my date spoke to each other until all of our injera (the bread you eat with) was gone and we needed more to finish all the food. <br><br>The waiters were friendly and even encouraged us to eat all the injera soaked in the juices from the food which was a plus in my book. Although they were miffed when we didn&#39;t order dessert and tried to annoyingly guilt us into ordering more, I was so content and stuffed to the brim with the main course that I couldn&#39;t even care. I didn&#39;t come with too high of expectations with fear of being disappointed but this definitely fit the bill.",

She had never been, but heard great things.  We started with the nachos which were great and then I had three tacos and they were delicious!  Mexican in the states is pretty typical, but these tacos had amazing flavors and different cheeses than just cheddar or Mexican blend.  One had a blue cheese, another had a goat cheese. The margaritas were great as well!  well done!",

The most amazing gastronomic experience my boyfriend and I have had. We were blown away. <br><br>El Club Allard is worth a trip to Madrid.",

"reviewcomment":"Spanish seafood bar where there are no seats, lots of alcohol, and order seafood at the bar. They don&#39;t have very many selections mind you - one of the most popular and easy to eat ones are their grilled gambas. Their clams are served raw, their mussels are deshelled and sit in a marinating container, and their razor clams are from cans. However, eating delicious shrimp and dropping the shells on the ground and being super drunk is really the point of this wonderful spanish marisquería is the whole point! This should be a part of stopover route to a tapas night out!",

"reviewcomment":"great place to get tapas and wine. I had cava and white wine which were both lovely. Also, everything we ordered tasted very yummy! Highly recommend the spinach croquettes (i think the best i&#39;ve had my entire semester in spain), and the grilled vegetable and mozzarella pinxto. The chicken skewer I had wasn&#39;t my favorite because it was less flavorful than the other dishes we had. Also, the tomato and cheese salad was dressed with just the right amount of balsamic and olive oil. Also, very reasonably priced- would definitely recommend!",

"reviewcomment":"VIPS will surprise you.<br><br>At first glance, it seems like an ordinary convenience store, but after a brief walk inside, you realize that it offers a whole lot more than you would expect. Aside from the typical offerings of alcohol, wines, microwaveable meals, and junk food, VIPS also sells books and a surprisingly large range of electronics.<br><br>In the back of the store is VIPS&#39;s cafeteria/restaurant, which is actually quite good! My co-workers and I went there for lunch yesterday, and we were pleasantly surprised at how well-prepared and tasty everything was. From what I&#39;ve been told, VIPS does not fare well at making the traditional Spanish dishes, but it is quite good at making typical American cuisine. The best way I would describe the restaurant is as a high-end diner, and the prices seem pretty appropriate if you think of it that way.<br><br>Most entrees here come with a side and a beverage (with free refills), which was a pleasant surprise, and the salads and burgers here are perfect for a quick non-Spanish meal (because tourists sometimes need to get a taste of home every once in a while). I got the Big Tower, which was a burger topped with bacon, onion rings, a fried egg, and all your typical burger fixings.<br><br>As someone who has had burgers his whole life, I have to say that this burger actually measures up to those made in America. It was perfectly cooked to order, very juicy and filling, and a pleasant break from all the tapas that I&#39;ve been eating. My co-workers were big fans of the many salads they offer here as well.<br><br>Environment-wise, the diner-esque cafeteria in the back is actually a lot larger than you would first think, and it is actually quite clean and modern-looking. This &#34;restaurant&#34; looks the part and you frequently forget that you&#39;re in a convenience store and not an actual diner.<br><br>In short, come here if you want a break from Spanish food and are longing for higher-end (but still relatively cheap) diner food.",

This place has great seafood menu by its own right. The seafood pallea is first class rated and seafood soup is a delightful surprise. Fresh catch of the day and many items to choose form this place will cater for most. Upstairs is a more of a Restuarent experience than cafeteria downstairs  standards. Well recommended not to mention well located,  and the fact it opens all day is an added advantage for late noon eaters.",

Be sure to get there early to get a good spot by the stage. Our tickets included a drink. (alcoholic or non) Be sure to use the bathroom before or after the show. They consider it rude if you get up during the performance! Oh and it gets quite hot inside after all the people pack in! Dress up, but wear short sleeves if possible!<br><br>The show was incredible! There is so much passion and intensity in their performance. The music is full of soul. A truly wonderful performance by talented artists. It was a perfect ending to our visit to Madrid!",

So, based on that experience, I have to give Samurai the &#34;hat&#39;s off&#34;.  Just when I was about to give up on the possibility of finding a sushi place in Spain with great sushi at a deserving price, something unpretentious yet fairly serious, with both a good variety of straightforward sashimi, maki, nigiris, and specialty rolls (but not heavy on the mayo or the cream cheese) and creative appetizers, and colder than cold Saporro (claro) we venture into Samurai.  <br><br>My personal sushi odyssey began 15 years ago in California.   By no means am I an expert, but you could say that  I&#39;ve been around the sushi block.  I know a thing, or two, but principally- I know what I like and I think I&#39;m a good judge of what&#39;s fresh and good.  That said, I&#39;ll share my tried &amp; true sushi restaurant test:<br><br>1.  The miso soup.  It should be hot and flavorful, even a little smokey.  Ideally it will have scallions, tofu and seaweed.  Watery, flavorless miso= not a good sign of what&#39;s to come.  <br><br>2.  The sushi, or technically- the nigiri.  The fish (I like to start with Salmon because of the distinct flavor-  it&#39;s very, very obvious when it is fresh and when it is not).  Color is important and the cut of the fish too.  If the cut is wimpy, thin- that&#39;s usually a deal breaker for me.  A big old sloppy slab of fish doesn&#39;t work for me either.  Ideally it&#39;ll be right in between. <br><br>3.  The rice.  It should be slightly, slightly tangy and it should be perfectly sticky, not gummy.  It&#39;s a drag when your sushi falls apart.  <br><br>4.  If the maki is the size of your thumb and the fish is microscopic, that&#39;s also a drag because you are essentially paying for a teaspoon of rolled rice.<br><br>5.  A yummy ponzu sauce for your sashimi.  <br><br>5.  If there is a sushi bar where you can see your future meal in the refrigerated case and you can watch the chef in action, all the better.  I prefer that the sushi I eat not be such a mystery.  <br><br>Unfortunately, there&#39;s no sushi bar in Samurai, just a small dining area, all in white.  Very simple.  Other than that,  the restaurant passed my first 5 requirements with flying colors.  The salmon nigiri melted in my mouth.  I could&#39;ve eaten them all night long.  <br><br>If you like the cocktails, I highly recommend the &#34;Samurai&#34;:  sake, lime juice, ice.....  maybe something else, I don&#39;t remember.  But I do remember that it was incredibly refreshing and yummy.   <br><br>I&#39;m looking forward to trying Samurai Express, their take-out cafe at Alcalá, 122.",

"reviewcomment":"Yum!<br><br>While on holiday in Madrid my family and I came here for dinner on our last night. It was completely empty when we got there and stayed that way the whole night, except for one other American family that showed up halfway through our meal.<br><br>They brought us complimentary bread and some sort of potato salad to start. The bread was crusty on the outside and fluffy on the inside - qualities of a good bread. The potato salad thing was good, even though I don&#39;t like mayonnaise. For a starter, we got langoustines (like shrimp but better) and they were so tender and fresh. For our entree we got steak frites and roast chicken to share between the three of us. The steak was cooked perfectly so it was so juicy and seasoned perfectly and the fries were crisp and mealy. The chicken was so moist and flavorful. For dessert we got vanilla ice cream and cheesecake with a berry topping. The cheesecake tasted great but had a weird texture - maybe we were just too used to New York style cheesecake.<br><br>The best part of our experience was our waiter. He was so friendly and sweet and gave us a little postcard with the history of the building that the restaurant was in.",

"reviewcomment":"The last time we visited this place two years ago, it was crazy busy, with folks waiting outside to even snag a table at the bar. When we went in Dec. 2013, it was deserted. I was hoping this wasn&#39;t an omen for the food to come.<br><br>Sadly, I think the original chef of this place left because when we first went here, the food was inpsired; a sort of, new age spin on Spanish favorites. This time, my oxtail was drowning in some salty concoction that topped the hubster&#39;s lamb and we both didn&#39;t like it. The hubster&#39;s niece, however, got this delectable salmon dish but the mashed potatoes on her plate were almost nonexistent. Then I realized, wait, there&#39;s mashed potatoes on my plate too but the stupid gravy just covered it up and it was lost. How disappointing.<br><br>This place has lost it&#39;s luster and that makes me sad cuz I was very impressed initially. Oh well, the consolation is that there are fifty million other good places to eat in Madrid. Viva La Comida!!",

"reviewcomment":"Relatively high-class restaurant right next to the Real Madrid stadium. You can get a pretty spectacular view of the Santiago Bernabeu Stadium football field, but you should request a table by the window to guarantee it.<br><br>Food-wise, most of the dishes are good, but a little bit overpriced. There was not really anything on the menu (aside from the desserts) that I hadn&#39;t already seen before at every other Spanish restaurant I&#39;ve been to. Many of the members of my party decided to get the solomillo, and while they said that the dish tasted delicious, they were a bit disappointed because the portion seemed pretty small (when compared to the other solomillos they&#39;ve had in Spain). I got the entrecot for dinner, and it was a very hearty and generous steak with a solid portion of fat included. I&#39;m personally a big fan of steak fat, but if you&#39;re not, I do warn you that it probably makes up 30 - 40% of the dish.<br><br>As for the restaurant itself, the atmosphere is a bit more upscale than I&#39;ve been used to here in Madrid. While I do not believe that there is an official dress code, long slacks and a collared shirt seem to be the norm here. Just something to keep in mind before you walk in wearing shorts and a t-shirt.<br><br>For the novelty of being able to eat a nice meal at the Real Madrid football stadium (and getting a great view of the field itself), I&#39;d have to say that making a trip to Puerta 57 is worth the money.",

"reviewcomment":"A fresh, floral and fun bar amidst the hot, Spanish streets of Madrid. I love this bar, and wish I could take it back with me to Edinburgh. I came here after a long night out, so was tired and a little &#34;delicate&#34;; so didn&#39;t partake of many drinks or food. But just sitting with a chilled group of people, enjoying vermouth or gin and tonics (out of giant wine glasses, which I have decided is my new favourite way to drink gin), with friendly staff, other chilled customers, a puppy party in the corner, wide open windows that let in some fresh air, and the very fresh decor -- tiles, flowers on the tables, and tying in to the &#34;Verbana&#34; rose garden theme without being ott. It&#39;s just my perfect idea of a Sunday afternoon g&amp;t with friends bar.<br><br>In fact, I won&#39;t take it back to Edinburgh with me. I&#39;ll move to Madrid instead and make it my local.

"reviewcomment":"Our hotel recommended this place, and I&#39;m so glad we listened to him instead of experimenting on our own. This place has DELICIOUS tapas! We couldn&#39;t decide, so we got the tapas menu. It wasn&#39;t cheap (roughly 80 Euros for 2, without drinks), but it was SO GOOD! Definitely worth it. It was like a 9 course meal. Except usually in multi-course meals, there are always a few courses that aren&#39;t so good, but at La Bocaito, everything was amazing. I couldn&#39;t decide which tapa was my favorite! This has to be in the top 5 meals I&#39;ve ever had, and I&#39;m a foodie.<br><br>Plus, it&#39;s super cute inside, like a Granada cave, and the service is excellent. we never had to wait more than a few minutes for the next course, and even though none of our servers spoke English (just the lady who seated us), they went out of their way to explain what each tapa was. <br><br>The only problem was that it turns out they charge a couple euros for the bread that&#39;s on each table when you come in. We didn&#39;t touch ours but we still had to pay, so just beware - if you don&#39;t want to pay for bread in Spain, tell them to take it away right when you get there.",

I had six taco supreme and two burrito supreme and Clement the tragic mustefino from Nawlins ride around on a scootie chair look like Paul Prudone got quesadilla with chicken and burrito and nacho supreme and we had a damn good time. The spicy spanish sauce they gave us in little plastic bags was damn good too. I didn&#39;t see any sombreros though and I was expecting to see them in Spain, especially near the Bell.",

"reviewcomment":"It&#39;s not really possible to talk about Madrid and food without talking about the legendary Zalacaín. No matter that it has lost all its Michelin stars, this is very much the business. It was founded in 1973 and is famous for its sumptuous interior, excellent seasonal cuisine and formal, polished service.<br><br> I have been a few times now, for both lunch and dinner. A typical Zalcaín meal might start with a classical Spanish aperitivo with dry fino sherry, very good bellota ham and delightful tiny croquettes. Their mushroom lasagne is wonderful - soft, subtle, delicious. On two occasions I&#39;ve had the superb mince of pig&#39;s trotters and suckling lamb. It&#39;s gelatinous to exactly the right degree, nuanced and elegantly understated. Desserts are very good as well, but not to die for. Disappointments include the bread was dull (a restaurant of this category should have its own baker, quite frankly) and a langoustine salad I had once which was plain, gracelessly thrown together; meaningless.<br><br> Zalacaín retains an irresistible air of languid grandeur and formality. The service is world-class. It&#39;s classical Spanish service, which you can&#39;t beat for that precise balance between formality and discretion on the one hand, and gentleness and courtesy on the other. The sommelier, Custodio Zamarra, is also one of Spain&#39;s most knowledgeable, and utterly charming and helpful.",

After asking the concierge for some recommendations I found that the places he recommended were too crowded to even sit down. So, I decided to pick the first place I saw that seemed busy enough to be good but with enough space for me to get some food.<br><br>Then, around the corner, I discovered Los Chanquetes. It was full of older guys who were really into the soccer game. But it was definitely the atmosphere I was looking for. The bartenders were friendly enough and introduced me to how the tapas system worked. You order a glass of wine, you get a small plate of food. Simply enough for me!

The chef Andrea is a wonderful talented professional.  He made us his specialty, Huevos Millesine which is farm eggs yolk, truffle caviar, truffle shavings and black truffle cream.  It is to die for and worth the cost! I also enjoyed my linguine al Frutti del mar and postre, panda cotta which a light flan like cheesecake.  Then to try the Spanish favorite we tried the table side Gin and Tonics which a beauty to watch the preparation of (and drink).

Who wouldn&#39;t.<br><br>This restaurant is a little off the beaten path, and out the way -- but it&#39;s worth the walk, or 5Euro taxi ride from the centre. We came on a Saturday afternoon and it was quite quiet, but I imagine it gets very busy at night. <br><br>Peruvian food, and lots of ceviche. Unfortunately i don&#39;t speak Spanish, but the menu looked full of delicious options, and the octopus-on-ice I caught a glance of near the bar assured me it had every type of seafood option.<br><br>We went for some delicious potato in a yellow mayonnaise (far better than it sounds!), plantain, then white fish ceviche. One portion of ceviche was enough to feed 3 people for lunch, a very generous portion. And SO fresh. I realised that until now I&#39;ve never really had proper ceviche. This was divine.<br><br>But that&#39;s not all! The BBQ skewers of steak and chicken were perfect. Usually a red meat lover, the steak was good, but the marinade on the chicken actually was my winner of the lunch.<br><br>And not forgetting the aforementioned Pisco Sours (and caipirinhas). Oh and a rather unusual ice cream that was from a plant that &#34;kind of tasted like mango, kind of tasted like coffee&#34;.<br><br>This is one of those places you review, but your words cannot do it justice -- simply go. Leave time in your day to linger, and enjoy just one more drink. And enjoy!",

We consulted the menu and had choices all ready but in the end submitted to the waiter making a selection from the specials for the three of us to share and weren&#39;t disappointed. The service was a bit impersonal at times and it wasn&#39;t easy to catch the wait staff&#39;s eye for more water, to pay the bill etc. but that seems to be par for the course in the city so you pretty much have to just take that on the chin.",

"reviewcomment":"I love this place. It is a little creperie in the Malasaña district, next to all the interesting spots. The food is very good, based on crêpes, of course, but what a varied selection they have, in both salty and sweet versions. The atmosphere is intimate, dark rooms with candle - lit wooden tables. They make some mean sangría too. And it&#39;s very affordable. My only complaint would be the heat in the summer. Having been there both in hot and cold weather, I would say it&#39;s definitely a winter place, as in summer it gets too warm inside, and the ceiling fans cannot do the job of cooling it off. Perhaps they should get some A/C, and THEN it would be perfect.",

I had forgotten that revolutos meant scrambled eggs, but they were delicious--soft with nothing rubbery or overcooked, easy to do with both seafood &amp; eggs. The morcilla was flavorful &amp; warm, &amp; both kids devoured it. Fried anchovies? Yes please! The bacalao pastel included 2 slices of mousse, with a side of creme fraiche--totally decadent. We could not finish it all &amp; our server was happy to wrap up our leftovers for us. <br><br>A bit pricey--50EC for lunch--but we were happy.",

He was right, the food there is actually quite delicious and the best part is that their bread for a mere 1.20 euros comes with a host of delicious meat and pate! It was sooo good.<br><br>We ordered a plate of Jamon Iberico for 11.40, pretty decent price, and eggs sauteed with asparagus for 8.50. The eggs were SOOOO good, but the portion for that was a bit small. The beer was 2.70 and together the total was 23.80.<br><br>GREAT place for your actual traditional Spanish Cuisine NOT IN A TOURISTY area!!",

Our Host, Jesus, was as welcoming as were the eclectic mix of locals; Jesus from Mexico, some young man from Manchester, the beautiful Nordic girl whose parents moved to Madrid when she was young and has lived all her life in Madrid, various other waifs and strays who find their way to this part of the city. All of us felt like we belonged to the city and in no small way thanks to Jesus and his perfect caprinas. If you do go then do me a favour - dont tell anyone about it.",

Interesting name, entrancing book lined interior, peculiarly named menu items.<br><br>I ordered the cheese plate with slim breadsticks and marmalade. I also had the salad with smoked salmon and avocado. Both were presented really well. The cheese were great, the marmalade memorable. I do wish there were more breadsticks or crackers to eat the cheese with. A dish for two. The salmon salad was quite nice and paired well with the avocado. I hope to return.

"reviewcomment":"It was already 10:30 pm and we were wandering the streets of Madrid in search of somewhere to eat.  I understand why locals eat so late because the sun doesn&#39;t set until 9:30-10,  It was past 11 when we were walking down one of the streets and a worker spoke Spanish to us and showed us a menu to here.  We walked down the alley and another worker, who spoke English, explained what they served.  The guy was trying to get us to go in and was so nice about it, we thought, sure...we&#39;re hungry, it beats walking around more.  They cleared off a larger table for us and we were set.<br><br>Our waitress was very friendly and spoke &#34;un poco&#34; English, but we managed to order several dishes: jamon on toast, sausage with potatoes, grilled vegetables, and mixed paella with chicken and seafood.  The partner isn&#39;t a big seafood fan so I had to compromise.  Everything came out as ordered.  We ordered the house wine at 11E a bottle.  This was a temparillo which was very good.  We&#39;ve noticed that most places serve very good wines with a limited wine menu, which is a very good thing.<br><br>The jamon was good.  We thought the potatoes with the sausage could&#39;ve been a little more flavorful, I mean they was a spice to it, but perhaps a little more.  The grilled vegetables were great!  Tomatoes, zucchini, eggplant, and red and green bell peppers.  We didn&#39;t eat the green ones because they&#39;re not our favorite.  The paella was delicious! Flavorful rice with mussels, claims, baby prawns/shrimp, and chicken, some pieces with the bone in.  Of course, we needed another bottle of wine.  It was a very enjoyable meal.<br><br>While we were at the end of our meal, three women came in that spoke English and sat at a table across from us.  They were all single because they were talking about meeting men in bars.  One kinda gave the partner the eye several times.  One of them asked us where we were from because she heard us speaking English, which sparked a lively conversation.  They were from Nashville, and it was nice to speak to someone from the states.  They were headed to Barcelona, so there might be a chance that we&#39;d run into them.  That tends to happen when we travel.<br><br>The service was excellent and everyone was very friendly.  I would definitely be back, but maybe on a return trip since there&#39;s so much to see, try, and experience.  Our meal was half of what it cost us at La Cueva, so I recommend venturing outside the comforts of the hotel area.",

"reviewcomment":"This was going to be a great breakfast. After what seemed an eternal flight from Sydney via a day in the Forbidden City in Beijing, being served warm beer and cat food masquerading as beef with rice on the plane, any food short of dog turd iced in marzipan would instantly elicit a rousing cheer.<br><br>This place was just around the corner from our fab Madrid apartment. It looked like a cathedral of ham, what with dead legs of pig of varying ages and quality hanging proudly from the roof. We had the English breakfast, consisting of bacon, eggs, crusty bread, coffee and freshly squeezed orange juice.<br><br>The service from the bar was quick and efficient. We loved the buzz of Spanish people just hanging around (not unlike the ham in that regard). And the low cost of our meal, at just 4.50 EU a serve, made even my cheapskate partner, Patrick, smile. So began my usual &#39;why! why! why! can&#39;t we get places like this in Sydney?&#39;<br><br>Where everything costs more than an arm and a leg. And the servers are generally so rude that even cracking the barest of smiles is well beyond them.<br><br>After an absence of seven years, our tasty kiss with Madrid had begun...",

"reviewcomment":"Excellent Asian buffet for EU 8.50 (excluding drinks).  This AYCE is Chinese/Japanese food combined.  I was extremely surprised how good the food was.  The quality of the food is not bad at all.  This place uses a revolving conveyor belt versus hot trays like your normal buffet restaurants.  The servings of the food were in small dishes, tapas style.  The servers closely monitor each small plates on the revolving conveyor belt to ensure that the dishes were fresh and hot.  They pick up and discard any food that is no longer hot.  The servers are all Asian who only speak Spanish.  They were all friendly and attentive.  With the buffet, it includes dessert i.e. flan, cake, hellado (ice cream) or cafe (coffee).  The interior is nicely decorated with modern Asian decor.  The place is kinda small for American standards but big for Euro standards.  My family and I truly enjoyed our dining experience at Xake.<br><br>p.s. The street or alley this restaurant is located is a hangout for women who sell their bodies for sex (sorry didn&#39;t want to use the terms &#34;hookers&#34; or &#34;prostitutes&#34;)",

"reviewcomment":"The bread at this place is so addictive, I seriously think I had 10 little loaves with butter and was happy. But of course, you know me, we didn&#39;t stop there. <br><br>This is a great restaurant for families; a little more expensive than most, but that&#39;s because it&#39;s a white glove/white tablecloth kinda joint. I had the squid a la plancha and it was fantastico. I also had this baked pastry with egg and some other goodness inside that was filling and amazing with the bread I couldn&#39;t get enough of. <br><br>The waiter was regal and helpful; the waitress ran around getting us stuff and really didn&#39;t rest once (mainly because I kept asking her for bread).<br><br>I don&#39;t understand why other folks didn&#39;t enjoy it here but we had a blast at lunch and my huband&#39;s family comes here frequently.",

"reviewcomment":"My love affair with La Casa Escondida goes back many a year, to when I was first studying abroad in Spain. Our host mom regularly took us here and it was like Christmas came early each time. Since then, I haven&#39;t stopped going back. I&#39;ve taken friends, family, significant others, etc, and it always seems to hit the spot.<br><br>I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if you&#39;ve completely walked past it before... it&#39;s one of those places you have to know of beforehand. (Hence, I guess, the name...?) I&#39;d recommend having a reservation unless you&#39;re one of those people that likes living on the edge. <br><br>The service is great and there&#39;s one little waitress in particular who warms up your day when you see her. She&#39;s got an impressive memory and a sunny/attentive disposition. The owner will often come up to your table and ask how everything is going, which of course adds to the restaurant experience.<br><br>As far as the food itself, it&#39;s got quite an eclectic, worldly menu. Something for everyone. Prices are high but you&#39;re really paying more for the cozy, classy ambiance. The mango salad is exquisite and so is the grilled provolone. <br><br>Invite me to La Casa Escondida and my heart is yours!",

Sure but  beware if u didn&#39;t notice they r the small beer bottles not terrible but makes more sense with the price. <br>On the Tapas we tried 1) Croquetas de Jamon , delicious nice creamy taste loved it (2) Llagrimas de Pollo aka tiny chicken fingers good with the dipping sauce (3) Allitas de Pollo (chicken wings) very good nice &amp; crispy good flavor to them (4) Carne Mechada thing slices of ham with bread shaped crackers these were pretty good as well. <br>The place itself is nothing special with the decor , fast service &amp; since we passed it more than once seems to stay pretty packed specially later in the evening. <br>Although everything was pretty much fried &amp; it wasn&#39;t my initial choice it ended up being good enough.",

"reviewcomment":"I&#39;ve been to a handful of Thai restaurants in Madrid, and this is the best. I&#39;ve been to a few that had Thai/Chinese/sushi so I was happy to find a place that specialized in Thai but wasn&#39;t crazy expensive. I went here for my birthday, and I&#39;m glad I picked this place because it is decorated very nicely and we all loved the food. The price is a little higher but not unreasonably so.<br><br>We ordered the &#34;surtido&#34;, which is a little sampler. It was too small for three people, but it might be OK for two people who like seafood. For the main course, we got the green curry (the best- it was a nice level of spicy and very flavorful), yellow curry (very mild and nothing exciting) and a duck curry (great flavor and meat quality). Portion sizes were spot on.<br><br>On the weekend, a reservation was required for lunch. I will return.",

"reviewcomment":"La Playa de Lavapiés is a perfect place for a lazy Sunday afternoon drink after stuffing your face in my favorite Senegalese restaurant nearby. The drinks are affordable, and the terraza is quite large, stretching past the good part of the sidewalk. Bathrooms are hit and miss for cleanliness, but that&#39;s to be expected, I&#39;d say. Just be careful not to get too much sand in your shoes when you&#39;re inside! It&#39;s a nice way to do a &#34;staycation&#34; in Madrid and still get some sand on your toes.",

"reviewcomment":"After traveling for over 2 weeks now, I started to crave eating Asian food and our next city was Madrid so the first thing I did was research where can I eat at?? I found this place close to where we were staying at and ran here once we drop off our bag. I didn&#39;t eat all day until around 10ish at night because I had the biggest hang over ever. We open the door and this place was pack but lucky we found a table to sit at right away. I look over the menu and wanted to order 6-7 items for 2 people and my gf look at me if I was crazy so I trim down to 4 items which was still alot but I didn&#39;t care. First came the kim chi and it was very salted but tasty so I ate like first. Next came the bimbebio and that was actually pretty tasty. The rice was crispy and burnt and gooey in the middle. The beef rib came after that and we cook it up ourselves. It was half fatty but tasty pretty good. Later on came the spicy noodle soup and the broth was very good but the noodle tasty and look exactly like pasta lol...It was gross!<br>Plus they have red and green bellpepper in it and that obvisely the Spanish influence in it. I just drink the soup and threw away everything in it. My gf has a beer w/this dinner and I just had water. The meal was good but i think the quality is just ok. I was extremely hungry for not eating all day so that made the food taste better then it suppose to. The price of this meal wasn&#39;t really cheap, it cost around 42 euro for korean. Would i come back here, yes but for only certain things.",

"reviewcomment":"On our second night in Madrid, we decided to find a nice sit down restaurant where we could enjoy a more refined Spanish meal. After some research, we settled on La Tasquita de Enfrente, a small but well reviewed restaurant run by Chef Juango Lopez Bedemar. The restaurant is located just north of Calle Gran Via and from the outside, other than the numerous Michelin rating stickers from over the years in the window, you really wouldn&#39;t guess this was much of a restaurant. However, if there&#39;s anything I have learned from my trip in Spain regarding restaurants, it&#39;s don&#39;t judge a book by its cover.<br><br>Our waiter presents himself and explains that there is no menu at this restaurant. The chef changes everything daily based on what it gets from the market. We were recommended the tasting menu where you are at the whim of the chef - although you can make some requests and he will adjust for them - or if you want, you can go &#34;a la carte&#34; where the chef consults with you and makes a few dishes based on that. We naturally went with the tasting menu to truly experience what this restaurant is about. One member of our party requested no meat so we all ended up with no meat throughout our tasting. Ended up not being an issue - even for a meat lover like myself.<br><br>First up, a Mushroom cream soup that my camera decided didn&#39;t like its look so I have no picture of it. Very smooth texture with wonderfully earthy tones. You could taste the freshness of the mushrooms throughout. A very nice way to start the meal. Next up, a king crab salad with homemade crisp. As it would be throughout the meal, the Chef prepares his dishes very simply - he allows the freshness of the ingredients to do the talking. Here, wonderful crab meat with a bit of binder, some bread crumbs and a little bit of roe on top. A great appetizer.<br><br>Third course now, we got a cold Spider Crab soup. Great seafood broth with hints of tomatoes in the base. The crab meat itself was delicious and added a nice texture to the soup. I am not a big cold soup fan but this one worked for me on all accounts.<br><br>Next up, egg fried sardines with some bacon bits on top. When one thinks of sardines, one tends to think about sardines in a can which I absolutely hate. This was nowhere near that. Nice crisp of both the skin and the coating around the sardine. The meat inside was nice and flaky. Overall, there is a nice richness to the dish without any oiliness or being too heavy which was a good thing given we were only halfway through the meal!<br><br>To counter that richness, the Chef then presented us with a very simple but again wonderful dish of mixed mushrooms. Just a few different varieties of mushroom presented in different ways (chopped, shaved, sliced) and tossed in a little oil. Amazing how many flavours one can get with such a simple dish. Great follow-up to the sardines.<br><br>The next 2 dishes were truly new experiences for me. First, we got fried Hake necks with a aioli of mayonnaise, garlic and Hake neck broken down. The fried necks were wonderful - very rich and fatty texture. Our server described them as the best part of the Hake and I would agree. The aioli didn&#39;t work for me though. While a very unique idea of incorporating the neck into the sauce, the aioli was devoid of any real flavour to add to the fried necks. It ended up just being an textural addition to the dish. It was the one thing over the course of this meal that really didn&#39;t work for me.<br><br>The final pre-dessert course was brown butter stingray. I had no idea what to expect from stingray. It ended up being like ribs but instead of red meat, you got flaky white fish in between each rib. Great quality of fish here and the brown butter sauce was perfectly executed. Nice richness added to the white fish.<br><br>On to dessert, we each got 2 items - a pistachio tiramisu and a spanish pain perdu. Given my hatred of coffee, tiramisu tends not to be something I enjoy but this one worked for me. The pistachios added a nice nutty flavour which helped to dull the coffee for me. The pain perdu was quite good as well. Very sweet richness with the crispy sponge cake on top for a nice textural crunch. A good way to cap off a wonderful meal.<br><br>It didn&#39;t look like much walking in but boy was this a great meal! The cool thing throughout was seeing the chef come around numerous times to see how we were enjoying things and at the same time, seeing how each table had slightly different dishes one to the other. There truly is no pre-set menu - even for one night! If ever you go to Madrid and are looking for a way to truly experience Spanish cuising outside of the usual Tapas fare (which are amazing don&#39;t get me wrong), you won&#39;t go wrong checking this place out.<br><br>Cheers!",

"reviewcomment":"Let me just preface this by saying that I grew up in Nebraska, so part of my rating may be rooted in nostalgia...<br><br>I was studying abroad in Spain when I first spotted Cafeteria Nebraska, and I knew I wanted to return when my dad came to visit me. <br><br>We were delighted to be there...Nebraska doesn&#39;t get much glory in the states. We sat down at a table next to a big wall mural of what looked like a northern woods landscape. We told our waiter that we were from Nebraska, and he asked us if it looked like the picture. We chuckled and said it more closely resembled somewhere like Wisconsin or North Dakota,  but I&#39;m pretty sure he wasn&#39;t familiar with those states. Not that I expected him to.<br><br>It was my dad&#39;s first night in Madrid, so I suggested he get something iconic. Or iconic with Americans. Churros y chocolate! They were tasty, I had a few nibbles. The chocolate was perfect, a nice thick consistency almost like pudding. Great for dipping!<br><br>I ordered a sanwich mixto (ham and cheese toasted) and a draft beer. The sandwich was hot and satisfied my craving for manchego cheese. <br><br>Overall, I&#39;m glad to finally have written this review, even if it was a few years late. I can still remember it very clearly, which is a great testament to the restaurant and its owners :)<br><br>[Quiero escribir esta critica en espanol, pero mi teclado no funcionara...]",

"reviewcomment":"Colleagues and I were staying at a local hotel for access to the congress Center and airport, and this restaurant was primarily chosen for its location but also based on good reviews. The restaurant was in a suburban/business area but they have done a nice job of creating a pleasant, lively ambience with a lot of plants, greenery etc, a very large open deck etc. The restaurant is overall big and can easily handle a very large group. We sat on the deck, which is covered so fine for wet weather and the evening was warm. Specialities of course were the variety of seafood, especially the different preparations of octopus, boiled or grilled and both were delicious. We also had a few meat dishes, and a part cooked egg flan with ham. All great. Prices were reasonable for the quality and quantity. So it&#39;s not a fine dining experience but it is tasty, good value, different to typical cuisine, and close to airport or congress center if that is where you happen to be.",

"reviewcomment":"While this wasn&#39;t my favorite restaurant in the area, I think I frequented more than any other. WHY? Cafe con leche and Jamon Serrano on a bun during lunch for 3 EUR - Just can&#39;t be beat! In terms of their lunch specials, they cook very traditional or home-made Spanish food and therefore, the food can be quite awesome at times. With that said, sometimes the dishes are just off, but its more of the dish itself, rather than they way they prepared it. <br><br>In the warmer months they also have limited outside seating which is nice for having a coffee. This isn&#39;t the nicest outside seating spot by any means, so if you are looking for a nice terrace, I wouldn&#39;t recommend Ursula. Finally, in terms of service, the staff members are quite friendly and food always comes out on time!",

Yes, please. <br><br>There are dogs running around the square! <br>*Watched the dogs prance in the square, enjoyed my coffee and cava. <br><br>La Terraza del Mercado de la Reina is a pop-up patio cafe steps from Hotel Oscar, situated in a square that is full of sun, pups and people. With an hour or so to burn before meeting my colleagues and with a bit of work to do, I decided to enjoy a few drinks here. The service was pleasant, the crowd enjoying their papers and morning coffees and breakfast plates. Casual (the tablecloths are plastic after all), easy, lovely. <br><br>The cava pour was beyond generous -- nearly bubbling over. My kind of guy. <br><br>Out for under 10 euros with a few freckles and a buzz.",

"reviewcomment":"Yes, eating at the Plaza Mayor in Madrid can be a little expensive.  And there are plenty of alluring sidewalk tables and competing waiters trying to grab our attention.  They&#39;re all attractive and probably similarly priced.  We picked ours based on its location in the shade on a hot, July day.  We started with mineral water with gas since we had just eaten, and it wasn&#39;t until two hours later that we ordered some beer and tapas.  We stayed for about 5 hours with no one rushing us or pushing us for a table.  People watching as locals and tourists sat, drank, ate, laughed, and conversed with strangers and friends alike.  What a pleasure!!!!  Coming from NYC and other large cities throughout the US where table space seems to be at a premium and your check is being brought to while you&#39;re still chewing, this is truly refreshing and reminded us of why we loved living in Europe all those years ago.  We proceeded to order granizados, which are similar to lemon flavored snowcones, only served in a much more elegant manner, pulpo a la vinagreta (octopus in a vinaigrette), chorizos con patatas (traditional Spanish sausage with potatoes).  Servings are very generous and service is friendly and relaxed,  For about 80 euros for all that time, it was a pleasure if a little costly.",

"reviewcomment":"Muy fantastico!  This place is walking distance from my hotel.  This place serves traditional and modern Spanish cuisine.  They have a nice bar with big selection of beers, local and imported wines and hard liquor.  Our party (3 peeps) ordered 6 types of tapas sandwiches (I have forgotten the name since they are in Spanish), a bottle of local wine and a huge pot of lobster paella.<br><br>Tapas sandwiches with chips - 5 stars - absolutely delicious, each one tasted different so it was a fiesta of flavors in my mouth. <a href='http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hR6Cz8Kui_Ddnq_v6AMIqg?select=l5z6EcMwWBBCHsyXlOSwbA'>yelp.com/biz_photos/hR6C…</a><br><br>Lobster Paella - 6 stars - BOMB!!!! So delicious, the lobster was so sweet and fresh, the mussels and other shell fish were perfectly cooked, the rice and paella sauce was so creamy and flavorful. <a href='http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hR6Cz8Kui_Ddnq_v6AMIqg?select=uO0NwA_AjV5FLXRaFZLZ5Q'>yelp.com/biz_photos/hR6C…</a><br><br>Misc.: fried fish <a href='http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hR6Cz8Kui_Ddnq_v6AMIqg?select=aHU6bnjjxq79VFeoLV1p7w'>yelp.com/biz_photos/hR6C…</a> , local white wine, after dinner shot (dunno what they are but  got me tippsy, we just kept saying SI to the server <a href='http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hR6Cz8Kui_Ddnq_v6AMIqg?select=qLO6Cdd_Ml-cLc5z66pJpg'>yelp.com/biz_photos/hR6C…</a><br><br>Excellent service although none of the servers spoke a word of English, that is not a problem for me.  Everytime I travel, I always have a mindset that I am the visitor and should not expect my host to bendover  backwards for me.  A smiley face and a friendly gesture is all I need to get impressed.  I give them 5 stars for service.<br><br>The decor is modern, the bar is very attractive, they display fresh octopus, sausages, ham, etc on top of the bar.  Medium size place for US standards, but big for European standards.<br><br>Price wise, I thought it was reasonable.  For a party of 3, we spent EU 96.00 (currency exchange in Madrid is $1 = EU 0.60.<br><br>IMO:  Las Bovedas de Cibeles is an excellent place to go if you want an authentic Spanish Paella outside Valencia.",

For those looking for a cafe with wifi, this is an excellent choice- just don&#39;t come during lunchtime, they don&#39;t like people to use wi-fi at lunch. :/<br><br>They&#39;re also one of the few places where you can find really healthy freshly-made juices in combinations like apple and carrot, etc. <br><br>Great selection of teas and good coffee as well!",

"reviewcomment":"When visiting Chinatown in San Francisco or NYC, I like to seek out those hole in the wall dim sum places that filled with elderly Chinese. In the search for authentic tapas experience, I was drawn towards La Orje de Jamie for the same reason. <br><br>My boyfriend and I visited this place twice during our 4 days visit in Madrid, and enjoyed unaccountable amount of La Orje de Jamie&#39;s house wine - Vino Rebeiro, a type of unfiltered Galician white wine. It was very easy to drink, and not overly acidic or sweet. We also loved the fact that Jamie kept bring us free appetizers to honor the old tapas tradition since we kept ordering rounds of Rebeiro.<br><br>One must-try racione is Jamie&#39;s house special - pig ears. Those deep fried pig ears were crispy outside and tender inside, a perfection I must say. It was also generous in portion for the cost of €5.",

"reviewcomment":"Stumbled by this gem while wandering through Madrid. Very near the Royal Palace. While I was there I don&#39;t think there was one tourist so I enjoyed being immersed in the Spanish culture. I was greeted by David the head waiter. He made the experience complete. Very knowledgable about absolutely everything in the restaurant. Sat in the beautiful down stairs dinning room that used to be used as a secret tunnel for the Royal Palace. Ordered a steak and my girlfriend ordered the pork &#39;presa&#39;. The &#39;presa&#39; was the best pork cut that I have ever had. Highly recommend. The cuts of meat were amazing and perfectly cooked. They offered a 1 kilo t-bone that I would have definitely ordered if I had been more hungry. They have an excellent selection of wine to pair with your meal. They also offer the iconic Jamon Iberico which is on display throughout the bar area. Prices were very reasonable for the quality of the food compared to some the other restaurants I ate in the previous couple of days of my trip in Madrid. Can not wait to go back and visit this outstanding restaurant in the center of Madrid. Make sure you ask for David and you will not be disappointed. A++",

I&#39;m so hungry let&#39;s just go somewhere close!&#34; <br>&#34;I know a place! Follow me.&#34;<br>&#34;Hey it&#39;s closed!&#34;<br>&#34;But Yelp says it&#39;s open!&#34;<br>&#34;That&#39;s the way it is in August in Madrid.&#34;<br>&#34;Ok. I know another place.&#34;<br>&#34;Can&#39;t we just go to that Chinese place right there?&#34;<br>&#34;No. That place is no good.&#34;<br>&#34;Follow me!&#34;<br>&#34;This is so far.&#34;<br>&#34;How long are we going to be walking.&#34;<br>&#34;I&#39;m SO hungry.&#34;<br>&#34;What is this place called?&#34;<br>&#34;La Farfalla.&#34;<br>&#34;That&#39;s Italian for Butterfly.&#34;<br>&#34;That&#39;s right.&#34;<br>&#34;The George Clooney character&#39;s girlfriend in The American calls him Senor Farfalla.&#34;<br>&#34;Oh... That&#39;s right...&#34;<br>... kind of summer evenings in Madrid.<br><br>Once we got there it was like one of those happy scenes in a Fellini movie. Food and wine coming from all directions feeding into a big table full of conversations.<br><br>Good sausage. Good pizza. Good steaks. Good salads. Good wine. Good beer.<br><br>Worth the wait. Worth the walk.",

"reviewcomment":"The service in this restaurant is not the best.  There are many tables in the dining salon, upstairs and downstairs and it&#39;s popular and the times when I have been I&#39;ve only noticed one waiter attending a nearly full house.  Said waiter is usually frenzied, absent-minded and dismissive.  My opinion is that it would take a true master and saint to be able to handle all of the demands with grace and aplomb, so, we go with patience and an empty stomach.  <br><br>On the one hand, empty stomach is recommended because regardless of what you order you are going to get a large portion.  On the other hand, if you are hungry, you are going to have to wait.  However, a quick solution to that would be ordering a beer.  Then before you know it you will have a massive plate of hot, delicious food in front of you.  It smells good, it looks good and it tastes good.  <br><br>The Pescado a lo Macho (macho fish) kind of blows my mind.  Seriously, the portion is enough to properly feed three medium size adults.  There&#39;s fish, lots of it, and it&#39;s topped with a seafood sauce that includes mussels, clams, prawns, squid and potatoes.  And on top of that they serve it with a large dish of white rice!  OMG it&#39;s gluttonous.  But delicious.  <br><br>I&#39;ve also had the ceviche, and it&#39;s good.  It&#39;s different than mexican ceviche- it&#39;s very limey, fresh and tasty.  My husband always orders the the roasted half chicken dish which comes with fries and a small salad.  He always takes home leftovers as well.  <br><br>The price is moderate.  It&#39;s a true value, really,when you consider the quantity and the taste.  The location is central-  right next to Plaza España.  Just remember to go prepared.",

"reviewcomment":"A  place with high potential to bump into a celebrity. They told me before. I didn&#39;t believe. Not that I care about a celeb but if it is Sean Penn, let&#39;s hold on there for a sec. And yes I was lucky enough to meet  him and he was sharing the table with Javier Bardem, Penelope Cruz and a big group of people. It was a surrealistic experience until the idiot waiter brought me back to the lame reality running towards me like a baseball player going for touchdown.<br><br>Well food! Sorry but I haven&#39;t eaten anything here :) but only joined my friends who were dining that night.  However, there were quiet satisfied with everything and I can assure you those girls have good taste in food. <br><br>On the other hand, it is a posh restaurant bar and therefore not my cup of tea. So depends on the person and what you like. On the first floor there was a DJ and many girls on high heels. You can picture better now right? So again it is your call whether you go or not.",

Fast service, not pretentious at all and the best part was the servers attitude.

The ambiance is great as it&#39;s very well decorated to its Arabian cuisine.

"reviewcomment":"While I was spending a couple weeks in Portugal and Spain recently, I had a serious craving for a burrito.  Luckily, while I was in Madrid, Tako Away was right across the street from my hotel.<br><br>The place is set up similar to a Qdoba or Chipotle restaurant, and had burritos, tacos, and a few other &#34;Tex-Mex&#34; items.  They had ground beef, shredded chicken, shredded pork, and a wide variety of vegetables, cheeses, and sauces available.  I got a pork burrito with the spiciest salsa they offered, and a bunch of vegetables.  Unfortunately, my Spanish language skills are pretty poor, so I ordered a few toppings by pointing at them, but they were patient with me.<br><br>The result was not the best burrito I&#39;ve ever had, but certainly a decent burrito.  In general, my experience with food in Spain, both in quick-service restaurants and in higher-end restaurants, is that Americans prefer more assertive seasoning.  I felt most of the food I had could have used more salt, and things that were advertised on the menu as being spicy were not spicy.  That being said, I&#39;ll say again that it was a pretty good burrito and gave me a taste of home that I was missing.",

Wasn&#39;t too crowded, but the fact that there were any people at all at that late lunch hour probably speaks highly of the restaurant. They had two different menus, one slightly more expensive than the other. My boyfriend and I each got one, hoping to try a bigger variety of food. And the food was pretty good! We had  miso soup, a (small) sampling of sushi, teriyaki beef, and chicken and fried rice. It wasn&#39;t exceptionally delicious food, but completely decent. Service was prompt enough. <br><br>Basically, I d come here again but I wouldn&#39;t write home about it. And I&#39;d keep my eyes peeled for another Japanese restaurant in the area.",

"reviewcomment":"I visited Madrid this past weekend, and searched high and low for the best food.  On our last night in Madrid I found El Labriego on Tripadvisor and Yelp and was excited to see it since it was just up the road from our hotel.  We walked in late in the evening as a football match was playing.  We were immediately led to the back of the establishment, where there were zero patrons and past the bar area full of locals.  We requested to sit up front instead.  My boyfriend ordered a beer and was brought a goblet (no one in the bar was drinking from this particular glass everyone was drinking Canas, first strike) I ordered Tinto Verano.  Our waiter brought our drinks and a free tapa consisting of pasta and seafood.  I was extremely excited because I&#39;d been searching for locations that provided free tapas with drink orders (If you research the history of tapas it explains that is how tapas originated). We ordered several tapas consisting of mussels, grilled prawns and fried chorizo (Food was pretty good overall). We were brought a basket of bread which I declined(Bread isn&#39;t complementary in the majority of restaurants in Spain, you&#39;ll later see the charge on your bill) After our first round of drinks, I ordered a Cana for my boyfriend(So we could hopefully remove the flashing tourist sign from our foreheads SN: I am of Hispanic descent and speak Spanish and hoped the lack of language barrier would&#39;ve justified equal treatment) as well as another Tinto Verano for me, the waiter then provided us with a free cheese plate (again wonderful).  However, what really bothered us was that when we received our bill it included gratuity.(It is not common practice for gratuity to be included on your bill in Espana)  Being from the US we always tip on our meals, but for the waiter to include it on our bill was extremely tasteless.  This was our last meal in Madrid and it truly left a negative impression.We enjoyed every meal we had with the exception of this one, and for it to be our last meal in Spain it really disappointed us. Though I am grateful to have received the tapas with our drinks, I am extremely disgusted with this restaurant.",

"reviewcomment":"Came here for dinner tonight because I am staying in the area.  As I am here by myself, I wanted a dinner where I could sit and eat alone -- and here was the place! Cocina Asiatica Xin -- which is located in Chueca -- is run by very friendly Chinese gals (as one could guess by the name &#34;xin&#34;).  If I could describe the food here in a few words, I&#39;d describe it as &#34;Iberic Asian Fusion&#34;.  Asian fusion usually caters to the tastes of the nation in which the restaurant is housed.  For example, American Asian fusion would be described as heavily soy- and sweet/sour-based.  Iberic Asian fusion, as exemplified by this restaurant, seems to play on &#34;sour&#34; theme.  This restaurant had a lot of lime, tom-yum, Thai flavors, which surprisingly tasted really good with baked sea bass (&#34;lubina&#34; in Spanish) with mushrooms.  It was perfectly steamed with lime, ginger, cilantro, lemongrass, green onion, and probably a touch of tom-yum -- it was pleasant, aromatic, and delectable. The sea bass had just the right texture - soft, supple, and fresh-tasting (&#34;xin-xian&#34;).<br><br>I didn&#39;t order any other items as I was by myself, but I was full off this one dish (I also ordered steamed rice and an Asahi).  The service is typical of Europe -- &#34;slow&#34; -- but that&#39;s considered as good service.  I got seated pretty late in the evening (around 9:30PM) but yet I finished my dinner faster than the other people who got seated way before me.  My American mentality kicked in -- get in and get out.  <br><br>This place is great for dates as many couples came here for their *late* evening dinner.  It&#39;s also pretty good for a late dinner for one -- and was pretty reasonable, taking into consideration the high standard of living in Europe.  All in all -- my meal with rice/beer costed 15.60 euros = 21.49 USD.  The food hit the spot, and got me full - so I was very content.<br><br>If you don&#39;t speak Spanish, but speak Chinese-- you can use Chinese with the people who work there.  My Spanish is so-so, so instead I communicated in Chinese instead :)  They also accept VISA, despite their doors saying they only accept Diner&#39;s and AMEX.",

"reviewcomment":"This is one of three locations for this restaurant, my comment below is almost identical to the one I wrote for Lupita II.<br><br>The service is not great (but certainly better than their Gran Via location) but the portion sizes and the food certainly more than make up for it. The portions are enormous! So be careful when ordering, you might just order double what you can eat. Although, it&#39;s not really a big problem because you can just ask to take it to go, they have no problem giving you take out boxes. The chicken is their most ordered dish and it is delicious! It comes with a side of salad, french fries and two delicious spicy sauces. A large group could eat here very cheaply. All the dishes i&#39;ve tried here have been great, from the appetizers to the desserts. Sometimes we just sneak in to have one of their huge portions of chocolate cake. It is rich and always cures my sugar cravings. They have all kinds of cakes and pies, they vary depending on the day and on the time of day. If you can get over their lack of customer service you will certainly be a very happy diner here.<br><br>I forgot to mention they have delicious smoothies, try one!",

"reviewcomment":"Our happiest night in Madrid.<br><br>We stopped at the Prado, the cathedral behind it, then another cathedral on a Friday evening during Lent. We were tired &amp; hungry.<br><br>El Diario looked beautiful from the outside and there was space in the marble-topped window seats.<br><br>Our first round of Cana &amp; Rioja came with a snack of pickles, fries, and grilled peppers, which the kids devoured. We ordered a canapé with Brie &amp; anchovy, heated &amp; cut into 3 pieces with more fries, which was amazing. Our son loves potatoes &amp; we like it when he&#39;s happy while we are eating (aka NOT SCREAMING). Another round &amp; another free plate of something amazing while I ordered the eel canapé, also served with something extra. We thought the word for eel was gula, which means gluttony, though it was something completely different. We do feel like gluttons here in Spain, however, and I&#39;m pretty sure I will develop the rich man&#39;s problem of gout, as discussed in Poor Richard&#39;s Almanac, by the time we return, thankfully tomorrow. <br><br>We ended with a plate of some cured pork product which was incredible. <br><br>5 stars for gorgeous ambience, a friendly &amp; prompt staff, delicious food. 33EC for at least 6 plates of food, 3 rounds, and shots of aguardiente, the Spanish version of grappa. <br><br>Bonus: there is a kid&#39;s park across the street.",

"reviewcomment":"For dinner last weekend, Mexican was what everyone wanted and so we were determined to find it. I remembered passing by this place en route to other locales many times and always thought it looked promising so decided to give it a try. We were dining on the early side, but the staff was willing to flip on the light switches of their back dining room and allow us to be the first customers for the night! <br><br>I liked the atmosphere from the start. It fit the Mexican theme yet was cozy and comfortable unlike some other restaurants. We were promptly given menus and gave our order. A couple of us got the chicken tamales while another at the table got the chicken burrito. It actually ended up being beef but we were all too hungry to complain and send it back. My order of tamales came alongside delicious guac, fresh pico de gallo and an actual spicy sauce that I layered on top. They were filling but definitely did not put me over the edge. Thankfully, my friend&#39;s burrito was HUGE and so I eagerly helped her finish it. <br><br>The service wasn&#39;t overwhelmingly kind but we left feeling full and happy. It is not on the cheap side but when you just need to satisfy that Mexican craving, it fits the bill.",

After searching for different places to eat in spain for my sisters birthday we settled for this location. <br><br>I&#39;m glad we did everything was tasty and serves was on point. We started with a foie gra appetizer which tasted amazing.  I had a fish with shrimp entree very fresh and the flavors were on point. My sister had a steak iberico which was to die for. The desert was amazing a cake with a white chocolate sauce and ice cream. <br><br>The waitress was very attentive.  Had such a great meal and serves we went back again before ending our trip.<br><br>This visit to this restaurant was in the summer of 2012. <br><br>I have to add we stayed in the hotel and it was a great choice with great service and location.",

"reviewcomment":"After many failed attempts to find a tapas bar, we stumbled upon Cafe del Principe. Food, beverages &amp; a table on the circle; we&#39;ll take it! Our server showed up quickly &amp; we ordered our drinks while we perused the menu. <br><br>I decided on the jamon croquettes &amp; my husband ordered the plata del dia. My dish was meant to be an appetizer &amp; definitely would have been better if I would have shared it. The ham flavor just became so strong towards the end that I was overwhelmed. My husband had a large bowl of soup and a mixed meat plate. He was quite satisfied with his order and sees why all the tourist books recommend ordering the &#39;plate of the day&#39; for lunch when traveling abroad. It was a lot of food for small amount of money so he DEFINITELY got his money&#39;s worth. <br><br>The people watching for this corner bistro was fabulous. It was on the corner of two streets that approached a major traffic circle. So between the cars, the cabbies &amp; the pedestrians, we had plenty to entertain us.",

"reviewcomment":"La Ccava is a beautiful decorated location which is open and ready to serve customers all day long. <br>At the morning they have the unbeatable breakfast offer: Coffee however you like it with pan con tomate, fresh tomato, toast, olive oil and salt - the tipical southern spanish breakfast. And all this for 1.40 EUR only - incredible!<br>Staff is very friendly, also early in the morning (you can get breakfast from 8 o&#39;clock on). They offer a relatively cheap daily menu and in the evening you can have food &#34;a la carte&#34;. In the evening the restaurant turns into a nice bar - there can be quite a lot people on the weekends. Then interior design is very nice, especially downstairs! <br>It&#39;s for sure worth have a look there! And perfect for good and cheap breakfast for people living aroung there!",

The food we saw looked typical Madrid stodgy fare, all deep fried and oily. Which was strange as they had carpaccio and sashimi type things on there too. <br><br>We ordered the crepes with dulce de leche and they were lovely but small. The mojitos had so much sugar that I had to leave mine behind. <br><br>However, the service was friendlier than you&#39;d expect at most places in the  area. <br><br>If you&#39;re looking for a break from the tourist Spanish restos around the square, then give Tartufo a try. But it&#39;s only alright.",

"reviewcomment":"Sometimes you get suspicious when a place has people standing outside handing out flyers.  But this place has delicious food.  It is not overly crowded for whatever reason and you get a great meal.  For starters they gave us bread and green olives.  I am not a fan of olives but these beautiful green olives I devoured because they were mildly flavoured with vinegar and all you taste is the actual olive, which is bright.  Afterwards we got our gambas a la plancha (grilled shrimps). Oh my giddy aunt they were delicious, lip smacking goodness with hints of charred salt.  For our entree, we shared seafood paella and the steak.  The paella was tasty with monk fish, calamari, shrimp and some vegetables.  The steak with perfectly cooked potatoes was textbook delicious.  Charred and righteously medium rare and all the fat inact!  I am proud to say I was the one who gnawed on the bone and the server gave me a surprised look when he cleared out my plate with a shiny bone.  We were so full afterwards that we bowed out of dessert.  But they gave us complimentary bottles of liquor and mini ice creams.  We were happy and sated.  Ready to do it all over again!!<br><br>The steak can be shared between two people and the presentation of the paella and steak were awesome:)",

"reviewcomment":"I like the idea of menu del dia. You get a cheap, well rounded meal with a beer, glass of wine or soft drink. For me, that instantly begs comparisons to back home in Sydney, where finding even a bread roll for which you do not have to sell your soul for has become quite the impossible feat. Moreover, in Madrid, unlike Sydney, the hospitality is genuine and generous, even for cruddy oaths like me and Patrick.<br><br>My pasta entrée was steeped in olive oil and fried garlic, my fish main was tasty (although as a tip, I would suggest not serving it silver skin side up) and my dessert was this lush concoction of cream cheese and ice cream. Patrick had the cold salmon soup, lamb stew and ice cream. His only gripe (and the pile of bones on his plate proved this to be true) was that his lamb stew was virtually meatless.<br><br>Undoubtedly, the best aspect of menu del dia is the temporary refuge from the hot Spanish sun and the perfect excuse to drink ice cold beer. If we did not have such a jammed packed schedule we could have happily retreated to the front bar to hang out with the locals and reflect on our well-considered views about the great political challenges facing this city, if not the world...",

Because I couldn&#39;t interpret the menu (all in Spanish) and it seemed expensive I chose to wander elsewhere after having a drink. Google maps pulled up La Creperie, and I love crepes, so I headed straight there (even though average reviews were a 3 star).<br><br>Packed quaint, small 2-room restaurant. All (or what appeared to be) locals in groups 4-5 or couples present along with some families. Service was quick and thorough. I was able to ask for a glass of water in Spanish and they actually brought a whole pitcher! (nice! free water in Europe is rare). <br><br>A large menu of crepe options (regular and sweet(dulces)). I enjoyed the Roma and it was quite filling. I liked the vibe and culture and hope to go back before I leave Madrid!",

"reviewcomment":"We stopped here for a quick breakfast before exploring the city. I ordered a cafe latte and my boyfriend had a coffee of the day (they served them in mugs which was a really nice touch - do they even do that in the US? they even asked us if we wanted warm milk for Nathan&#39;s coffee). We also ordered breakfast sandwiches: jamon york and queso on croissants, which they toasted for us. DELICIOUS. The service was good and so was the food. We enjoyed our breakfast at the outdoor seating area on Gran Via! Perfect for people watching - they also have an upstairs lounge which is a pretty nice hangout. 14 Euro for breakfast for the two of us (a little pricey but still delicious). I wanted to stay away from &#34;American&#34; restaurants when I went to Spain but you really can&#39;t go wrong with Starbucks :).",

"reviewcomment":"We got into Madrid a little late and wanted something close to the hotel for tapas and drinks to wind down the evening and plan for the days ahead. We ordered some beers and then tapas. The flavor was great and even the non-seafood eater tried some of the seafood dishes (still didnt take to it tho but tried) we ordered pinchos frios variados, bocadillo de tortilla, bocadillo de queso manchego, pincho de solomillo, mini hamburger, jamon iberico, huevo con gam, and dessert. We tried ordering flan and the server told us that the tarte de lemon was the recommendation so we ordered both. The tart was the winner. The flan was not recommended.",

My friends and I had the menu del dia. All the dishes sounded great in theory but were actually just not good at all. To start I had a clam and bean soup which was average- not too bad, not too good. However after the &#34;ternera&#34; was absolutely subpar meatloaf. The only thing that tasted fine were the fries on the side, but like how can you mess up fries anyway? If you&#39;ve ever had relatively above average cuban food, don&#39;t stop here, because its just not good.",

"reviewcomment":"When in Madrid, do as the Spaniards would do.  In Spain there are many complaints of slow service, however that is a standard and should not be considered an insult.  Waiters were always polite and if I needed something, would simply smile at one and hold up my index finger.  <br><br>This was my favorite place to have a drink.  Why?  Cava was less than 5e, the view and location were excellent and the tapas were always above average.  One time the tapas were a plate of chocolate covered peanuts and mini gum drops! Once it was a small plate of paella.  <br><br>I ate lunch once, and while it is something I would never order again (I typically don&#39;t eat fried foods and it was fried calamari), it was very good.  The waiters will not rush you even if you want to linger over a drink for hours.  <br><br>I&#39;ll give this warning in all restaurants in madrid.  You will be charged 1e for bread whether you want it or not so expect it.",

"reviewcomment":"This is my first review of establishments in Spain. SB and I came here tonight in search of a quick bite and ended up staying for quite a while. The two plates of tapas that we had were both delicious, and the pinchos they served with our drinks were simple but very tasty. They didn&#39;t seem to mind our mangling of the Spanish language, and to top it all off, the manager (who was seriously nice) sent over two free glasses of wine (with accompanying pinchos)! I wish we were in Madrid more than just a couple nights, because I would definitely go back. Pleasant ambiance, nice people, tasty tapas. What more do you need?<br><br>Please give them a try!",
