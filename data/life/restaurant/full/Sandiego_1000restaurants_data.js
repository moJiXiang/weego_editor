"reviewcomment":"This place is the best Indian/Himalayan restaurant in SoCal! I used to live in LA/OC and now SD, so I feel pretty strongly about that statement. <br><br>Ambience - simple, not too fancy, just right<br><br>Food - The food is the main story here! It&#39;s is delicious, all of it! First things first, they give everyone a bowl of daal to start which is delicious. Really a home made taste, just like my mom makes. Their main dishes are all good. This isn&#39;t like any other place, because they have unique flavors that are different from other Indian restaurant. That himalayan touch really makes a huge different. My favorite is the paneer tikka masala (note: I&#39;m vegetarian). It&#39;s creamy but balanced and appropriately spicy if you ask for it. And you have to get the garlic naan with it. But I also love the momos. They are really unique, light, and flavorful. Similar to dumplings. My husband loves the Chicken Makhani and the Goat when they have it. <br><br>Price - really reasonable. It makes for an affordable night out with big portions.",

Hard to get in and out.<br><br>I wouldn&#39;t call the menu here &#34;cheap&#34;, especially for breakfast food but the portions are giant and easily feed two people in most cases.<br><br>I had the tower of waffles with the fried chicken.

LOL, while walking through OB on vacation and craving sushi we walk past Hodad&#39;s, this place is POPP&#39;N, I have NO idea what it is, but the delicious smell of grilled onions and sound of music and laughter fill the streets as the crowd of people visit with one another waiting in line. My husband and I glance at each other in wonder...&#34;What do you think it is&#34;  &#34;I don&#39;t know, it smells good and it must be amazing look at the line!&#34;.   We pop into a gift shop and wander around, hubby pulls Hodad&#39;s up on yelp, he sees the word &#34;hamburger&#34; and my dream of sushi is over; and Thank God!  <br><br>We head outside, and the line is down to maybe 5 deep.  It&#39;s not long before we are greeted by the host like we are old friends, instantly you feel at home!   The place is busy in the most intoxicating way, you feel like you&#39;ve grown up in this town, the menu is easy and clear, the walls are posted with stickers and surf boards and everyone seems to be having a great time, there is even an old VW bus made into a booth inside!    <br><br>We sat at the long bench like seating in the center of the room which is great for visiting.  Promptly our drink orders were taken, their beer selection is good with lots of local flavors.  I ordered the Blu Jay and my hubby ordered the Guido, his with fries and mine with the INCREDIBLY good onion rings, the kiddos split their BLT.  Awesome thing is, they split the kids plate with no extra charge and filled each of their plates with fries!  WIN!  The customer service was AWESOME, they even came by and gave the kids a huge handful of stickers...I LOVED my burger but the Guido was to DIE for!  JUCIY, TASTY, TANGY, MEATY...everything you love in a burger.  The shakes were huge also.  <br><br>This place is the stuff burger dreams are made of!  See you next time we are in town!",

"reviewcomment":"We ended up here by accident because another restaurant we had wanted to go was closed (though said it was open on yelp) and I&#39;m so glad we did. This was hands down one of the BEST restaurants we have ever been too. <br><br>Me being a vegetarian, was excited to find a good solid meal and multiple choices. I had a quinoa plate that was the best quinoa I&#39;ve had in a long time, and my boyfriend had a burger in a lettuce wrap that he claims is the best burger he&#39;s ever had.<br><br>Our waitress was incredibly friendly, and joked with us a couple time, she had long beautiful dreadlocks and I can&#39;t remember her name- but she was not only super friendly but very familiar with the menu and the drinks. The manager checked in with us half way through our meal and when we told him how great not only the service was but our food, he comped our desert. <br><br>Would totally recommend to meat lovers and veg heads alike. We plan on going back there when we can.!",

"reviewcomment":"WHAT. I&#39;m surprised I haven&#39;t written a review for this place yet! Amazing food but long waits. At least there&#39;s complimentary coffee and water while you wait and ping pong as well!<br><br>Located in Hillcrest, Snooze is probably my favorite breakfast place in San Diego! I loved everything I tried on their menu and so does everyone else apparently, evident in the long waits to eat here!<br><br>Some menu items I&#39;ve tried:<br><br>OMG! French Toast - Like heaven, best french toast I&#39;ve ever had. The toast is just the right thickness and fluffy &amp; crisp. The combination of the mascarpone cheese, vanilla creme, salted caramel, strawberries &amp; shredded coconut all meld together amazingly. I always HAVE to get a side of this when I come here.<br><br>Breakfast Pot Pie - A modern take on pot pie, rosemary sausage &amp; gravy in a puff pastry sheet topped with an egg any way you want it cooked.. AND it comes with a side of hash browns. The portion doesn&#39;t look too big but its definitely delicious and filling!<br><br>Snooze Spuds Deluxe - Hash browns covered in cheese, scallions and any two veggies  or meats you want. I went with spinach and sausage and added a Niman egg on top as well. Definitely a must try if you like hash browns.<br><br>Service is always good, I just wish the waits weren&#39;t so long!

It&#39;s close to home and great place to have a weekend breakfast. <br><br>The cons: The Wait and parking. It&#39;s understandable though, especially living in SD you have to wait for most places to eat. They do turn tables pretty fast so I guess that&#39;s a plus.<br><br>The pros: while you wait they they provide sample coffee and coffee cake. THE FOOD.<br><br>To start, I ordered the Mexican hot chocolate laté, one word &#34;wow&#34; the little Mexican inside me started to jump from excitement ). Man did this take me back, way back, to abuelas hot chocolate on Sunday mornings. <br><br>I also ordered the scone which was scrumptious. I settled for  the crab cake Benedict&#39;s, which was very tasty especially the hollandaise sauce.  I shared the stuffed French toast with my bf and after the first bite, we both looked at each other and nodded, without having to say a word.",

I also love the fact that all of their pizzas are on the thinner crust side (my fav). They sell by the slice or whole pizzas. Of course all of the super combo, veggies, sausage, pepperonis, etc. But for a pescatarian, always ordering a mixed veggie or plain cheese gets a little boring. My friend ordered two peps, I ordered a mushroom with ricotta and a margherita (with thinly sliced tomatoes, ugh, so perfect). <br><br>It&#39;s also a lot bigger than you&#39;d think from the street view!

"reviewcomment":"This place is the best Indian/Himalayan restaurant in SoCal! I used to live in LA/OC and now SD, so I feel pretty strongly about that statement. <br><br>Ambience - simple, not too fancy, just right<br><br>Food - The food is the main story here! It&#39;s is delicious, all of it! First things first, they give everyone a bowl of daal to start which is delicious. Really a home made taste, just like my mom makes. Their main dishes are all good. This isn&#39;t like any other place, because they have unique flavors that are different from other Indian restaurant. That himalayan touch really makes a huge different. My favorite is the paneer tikka masala (note: I&#39;m vegetarian). It&#39;s creamy but balanced and appropriately spicy if you ask for it. And you have to get the garlic naan with it. But I also love the momos. They are really unique, light, and flavorful. Similar to dumplings. My husband loves the Chicken Makhani and the Goat when they have it. <br><br>Price - really reasonable. It makes for an affordable night out with big portions.",

"reviewcomment":"This is the place to take out of town guests EVERY TIME! My fiancé and I moved here from LA a few years ago and whenever we have visitors come down its a no brainer to take them here. I know that every time we come here the service will be great, the food is always amazing, drinks are great, the ambience is trendy but intimate and everyone will have a great time. Prices are reasonable especially when you consider the amount of food you&#39;re getting. <br><br>The drinks are very good but the wine list is a must. Everything is &#34;at cost&#34; and there&#39;s a large selection. <br><br>Favorite foods to recommend are the polenta ragu, beet salad, short rib pappardelle (drool just thinking of it), brussel sprouts, and stuffed zucchini blossoms. Most of those dishes are very rich and heavy but not overwhelming. <br><br>Things to know before you go: make a reservation well in advance! They book up quick. You can find them on opentable, but they ask for a credit card so it&#39;s better to call. They have valet but there&#39;s usually street parking.",

"reviewcomment":"When friends and family visit San Diego, they have a mistaken pre-conception of Gaslamp being a culinary nexus of interesting restaurants, enticing gastrolounges, and charming wine bars. I struggle to justify to them why they should leave downtown for the better dining experiences in the city. Luckily, with Searsucker, I have at least one worthy Gaslamp restaurant to recommend to my visitors.<br><br>Searsucker is in the heart of Gaslamp, on the super-busy 5th and Market intersection. It is a stylish-looking joint that demands attention of passers-by.<br><br>Inside, the restaurant is based on a wide-open theme and uses living room furniture to build a &#34;comfortable and accessible&#34; feel despite its swish accents and intimate lighting. I&#39;d recommend sitting on the sidewalk patio for people-watching, except that the cool kids are inside Searsucker, not outside.<br><br>In all of my experiences, service at the bar and from the waitstaff has been awesome (and damn well better be for Searsucker&#39;s premium menu prices). Searsucker hires professional servers with fun personalities.<br><br>Some of the food and drink I&#39;ve consumed there over multiple visits includes:<br><br>Cheddar Puffers - These chewy, cheesy mini-pastries are a delightful way to start a meal, and come to the table complimentary (despite also being listed on the menu as a paid item). I&#39;ll take these over most bread any day.<br><br>Habanero Pickle with Coriander - a single spicy pickle spear sliced with coarsely-ground coriander. It is simple and small, but delicious. Getting the coriander bits stuck between your teeth is inevitable, so have toothpicks on hand.<br><br>Scallops &#34;East Coast&#34; - Three diver scallops served with braised leeks, pea shoots, and bacon jus. Solid plate featuring a nice fond/crust on the scallops, but not sure it was worth the $35 I paid for it, especially for just three scallops (albeit they were larger scallops, they were not &#34;over-sized.&#34;) There are much cheaper and better scallop dishes in San Diego that provide more substance. If you&#39;re in a splurging mood, I&#39;d recommend ordering this as an appetizer rather than an entree.<br><br>Jalapeño-Chorizo &#34;Corn Off the Cob&#34; - Large side of corn with chorizo. Spicy, sweet, and addictive. Honestly, this side was much-needed to make up for the small amount of food delivered on my scallop entree plate. Fantastic side.<br><br>Roasted Eggplant - Deliciously firm and seasoned eggplant covered with a TON of yummy mozzarella cheese and light basil-infused red sauce served in a hot cast-iron pan. Think eggplant parm on steroids, HGH, and blood doping. This is the favorite item I&#39;ve had at Searsucker but unfortunately it was not on the menu the last time I dined there, so perhaps it&#39;s a seasonal dish. I last had it in September 2013.<br><br>S&#39;mores Bar - a graham cracker cake &#34;bar&#34; layered with chocolate, caramel sauce, whipped marshmallow, and crispy chocolate crumbles accompanied by a scoop of dark chocolate ice cream. A solid dessert, but not a memorable one. Nothing particularly bad about it, just not a standout for this S&#39;mores lover.<br><br>Cocktails - Searsucker&#39;s infusions are solid and cheaper than their normal cocktails. I recommend their 5-pepper and vanilla-infused vodkas. Occasionally when I&#39;m hanging around Gaslamp, I&#39;ll pop in for their Honeybadger (rye, lemon, and honey), which gets a lot of mileage out of its simple ingredients.<br><br>If you&#39;re looking for a trendy &#34;gourmet casual&#34; establishment with good food in Gaslamp, this is one of very few spots to consider. The ballcap crowd from Barley Mash (across the street) surprisingly tends to mostly stay clear of this place at night, but you should still avoid the bar on weekend nights if you&#39;re prone to claustrophobia. That said, it is a popular bar &amp; restaurant for good reason, and although &#34;great for Gaslamp&#34; sounds cynical, I mean that in the best way possible, as this establishment&#39;s presence in the neighborhood provides a superb option for adults who enjoy nice things.",

I can&#39;t say that this is the best ramen I&#39;ve ever had, but it is my go-to in my hometown, and does the job when I have a craving.<br><br>Nitty Gritty: Much more spacious, so coming with groups isn&#39;t nearly as bad as it was before. The beer selection is decent and well-priced, especially during happy hour! The staff is friendly and you can bet that there is always a wait here. The ramen dishes are always served steaming and flavorful, although they don&#39;t really have a commendable vegetarian/vegan option due to the traditional nature of the dish&#39;s broth. The noodles are good here, and is probably one of the reasons I keep coming back. The fact that they stay open late, provide good service, and stay consistent earns them 4 stars at the very least.",

"reviewcomment":"This place is the best Indian/Himalayan restaurant in SoCal! I used to live in LA/OC and now SD, so I feel pretty strongly about that statement. <br><br>Ambience - simple, not too fancy, just right<br><br>Food - The food is the main story here! It&#39;s is delicious, all of it! First things first, they give everyone a bowl of daal to start which is delicious. Really a home made taste, just like my mom makes. Their main dishes are all good. This isn&#39;t like any other place, because they have unique flavors that are different from other Indian restaurant. That himalayan touch really makes a huge different. My favorite is the paneer tikka masala (note: I&#39;m vegetarian). It&#39;s creamy but balanced and appropriately spicy if you ask for it. And you have to get the garlic naan with it. But I also love the momos. They are really unique, light, and flavorful. Similar to dumplings. My husband loves the Chicken Makhani and the Goat when they have it. <br><br>Price - really reasonable. It makes for an affordable night out with big portions.",

"reviewcomment":"So we had a quite an adventure that lead us to Babycakes. We were supposed to meet friends for brunch before we headed back to Pasadena. Somewhere in the communication lines there was an error because we ended up at the wrong place (same name, different location). Instead of hoping into the car and driving for 20+ minutes to get to the right location we decided to just go somewhere nearby. <br><br>I pulled up Yelp and quickly found babycakes. As soon as I saw red velvet pancakes I was sold. It was also Memorial Day so most places were packed. Thankfully for us Babycakes had plenty of room for us.<br><br>Right away I liked it. The decor is very eclectic and worn (in a loving way) so that it feels inviting. The space itself is also deceptively large but somehow maintains that friendly charm. It felt like you were over at an old friend&#39;s house having a fun brunch. Just really good vibes.<br><br>The service was also super friendly (and cute). Even though it wasn&#39;t technically a weekend they still extended their brunch deals to us, so I ended up with two Mimosas (heavy on the champ, the way I like it) for the price of one. <br><br>We all ordered breakfast and took a seat on their very nice patio. Our friend got a cupcake to start and that just got me so excited for the main course. I of course got the red velvet pancakes. It was exactly what I wanted, why more places don&#39;t have this is beyond me. A perfect meld of cake and pancake texture with a frosting that was just the right level of cream cheese to not make me feel like I was being too unhealthy. <br><br>Everyone else also loved their meals. My boyfriend had the Cha Cha Chilaquiles which he raved about, and our friend got the corny cakes which blew us all away. The fact that they could make such a range at that quality is impressive. <br><br>What I liked most about this place is that it reminded me a lot of the places I liked to go to (and still do) when I would visit the castro or the local gay bar near my college. There is a sense of joy and fun here that you just can&#39;t find in many places. There are no pretenses, no judgments, just a sense of welcome to everyone and a spirit of good times. <br><br>This place went above and beyond in food, decor, and service in my mind. <br><br>29/100",

Be prepared for a wait, but know that the wait is worth it, and can be mostly killed off with some creative cocktails from the bar. <br><br>The wife and I managed to hit up C&amp;C twice in the same weekend in San Diego and we were not disappointed. I loved the fried chicken, but the macaroni and cheese with its hint of lemon was also really special. The biscuits are also dangerously delicious, especially with the cheese fondue. <br><br>Finally, the &#34;ice cream sandwich&#34; dessert was a sight to behold: a crumbly, bacon-and-chocolate-and-marshmallow-and-graham cracker indulgence that I could not stop eating. A definite high point in our trip, and worth recommending.",

I&#39;m glad my boyfriend had parked fairly close to the finish line and I just happened to remember bookmarking this place for brunch.<br><br>We walked right in, no wait and had a lovely table outside. Very cute, romantic corner café. If I lived in the area I could see being here very often.<br><br>I enjoyed a latte and my boyfriend had a regular coffee. Both were so satisfying. <br><br>I ordered the croque madame with french ham &amp; gruyere. My boyfriend had the zucchini &amp; chèvre omelette. He did mention to me his boudin blanc sausage was a bit cold. I enjoyed my choice more so than his.<br><br>I also ordered the pommes frites with trio of dips. Soooo yummy!<br><br>I managed to get out of here without trying one of their weekend sticky buns but all of the pastries on the counter indoors looked fantastic. I also skipped on a mimosa, so I&#39;ll definitely need to return in the future :)<br><br>Great, friendly service and generous refills on coffee.<br><br>They do only have one restroom, so I wasn&#39;t able to make it in here because it seemed often in use but since we were chose to sit outdoors I&#39;m sure my lack of freshening up post run, didn&#39;t offend anyone.<br><br>Lovely atmosphere, I&#39;d highly recommend stopping off here for any meal of the day.",

They have a few different drink specials that change I believe every few hours so be careful about reordering the same drink since my waitress didn&#39;t tell me it had. They also didn&#39;t seem to be on their &#34;A&#34; game today but I wasn&#39;t here for the service. I was here for the fish tacos.<br><br>Now onto the reason I came here, the tacos. They were good but I don&#39;t think they are the best in town. I had one of the Mahi tacos which was just ok and I didn&#39;t think it had that much flavor. The second taco I had was the Baja Fish and that one was actually really good. It was nice and crispy and had a lot of flavor to it. The tacos actually did have a lot of fish in them but they weren&#39;t good enough for me to go out of my way to come back here.  I believe Shoreclub in PB has better tacos and normally is a lot less crazy busy compared to South Beach.",

"reviewcomment":"Solid Solid Solid Xiao Long Bao (Shanghai Dumplings in either pork or other meat choice).   It&#39;s like a super steamed and moist pot sticker, or even a steamed wonton without the soup.   <br><br>Love their Seabass with black bean sauce too...the sample I had was a tad on the salty side, but it was still darned good.   The orange chicken is a bit spicier than what I&#39;m used to, and don&#39;t expect it to be like that popular food court fast-food mall type brand of orange chicken.  The house noodles was very good too, long thick flat noodles with shrimp and big chunks of beef.  <br><br>Definitely would come back just for the XLB.  It&#39;s that good. <br><br>(BTW - we did take-out since the place is small and the wait times for a table are said to be too long).",

But this place was beyond delicious!<br><br>I ordered the house fried rice which is usually okay in any regular place but here it is booming with flavor ! There was a little bit of sweet and a little bit of spicy. Nonetheless it&#39;s definitely a must when coming here. <br><br>I got the rare steak pho. The broth was amazing. They provide A good amount of steak and noodles which I appreciate ! (And I personally like to add a heaping load of sriracha to my pho!! I love spicy food)<br><br>Overall the experience was awesome but you might want to call ahead of time to get your name in because this place gets packed !!!",

I used to live in LA/OC and now SD, so I feel pretty strongly about that statement. <br><br>Ambience - simple, not too fancy, just right<br><br>Food - The food is the main story here! It&#39;s is delicious, all of it! First things first, they give everyone a bowl of daal to start which is delicious. Really a home made taste, just like my mom makes. Their main dishes are all good. This isn&#39;t like any other place, because they have unique flavors that are different from other Indian restaurant. That himalayan touch really makes a huge different. My favorite is the paneer tikka masala (note: I&#39;m vegetarian). It&#39;s creamy but balanced and appropriately spicy if you ask for it. And you have to get the garlic naan with it. But I also love the momos. They are really unique, light, and flavorful. Similar to dumplings. My husband loves the Chicken Makhani and the Goat when they have it. <br><br>Price - really reasonable. It makes for an affordable night out with big portions.",

"reviewcomment":"Came in yesterday night about 40 min before closing. They promptly seated us and told us last call would be in a few minutes. The service was friendly, the craft beer selection was solid, and the food was overall pretty good. <br><br>We got 2 orders of sweet potato fries, monkey brains, pad Thai, spicy tuna roll, black cod roll, spicy scallop roll, and 2 of the hoisson smoked salmon entrees. The monkey brains was delicious, as was the salmon entree. The pad Thai was a little bland for my taste, and the dressing and beet purée on the salmon plate was a bit too salty. The sushi was pretty good. Portion sizes are pretty small. <br><br>Only complaint would be that the salmon plates came out wayy after everything else, after everyone else at the table was already done.",

"reviewcomment":"Old town mex is my favorite place to eat when I come home from college. Love the chips and we also get extra guac and it is amazing. The place is so reasonably priced I can&#39;t get over it. I usually get chicken fajitas when I eat mexican and it can be from 16-20 dollars. it&#39;s only $12! the seasoning for the chicken is so good too. Their tortillas are made from scratch. I  have had their corn and flour and their corn is good but their flour tortillas are better. The corn ones are thicker than the typical corn tortilla. They also have specials every day. <br><br>My mom swears their carnitas are the best in town and she is a carnitas cone suer. The waiter was very good as well and brought us fresh chips. Overall love old town mex",

"reviewcomment":"I love me some Crab Hut!!! I love shrimp and anything sea food. If I have to compare this place to Boiling crab I will definitely go here instead of there because <br>First, Boiling crab is too too far. Second the taste of their shrimp mix is better and Third I have friends that work here.<br><br>Couple of things I think they should work on is that the quality of the food has diminished. Just by looking at the sauce for the shrimp there seems to be no more garlic, and I know because I always order rice with the shrimp and i always put the sauce on my rice. I can say that the flavors that they use is not completely there compared to how it was before. Sometimes when I order crawfish it seems like they were frozen when it specifically says that they were suppose to be fresh. Maybe they expect us to not know the difference. The servers are always busy so it is hard to get their attention. The prices of this place has gone up, so don&#39;t expect to pay the same as what you did a year ago. <br><br>When it comes to the plaza in general it is always hard to find parking and make sure you know that you will have to wait for a seat at crab hut. Something I realized was that the line for the restaurant wasn&#39;t as bad as it was before. So maybe that shows you that the food isn&#39;t as great as it was before. <br><br>I assume that the Crab Hut in downtown is a lot worse when it comes to parking and finding a seat because it has a bar to order drinks and it is in downtown.",

"reviewcomment":"This place is the best Indian/Himalayan restaurant in SoCal! I used to live in LA/OC and now SD, so I feel pretty strongly about that statement. <br><br>Ambience - simple, not too fancy, just right<br><br>Food - The food is the main story here! It&#39;s is delicious, all of it! First things first, they give everyone a bowl of daal to start which is delicious. Really a home made taste, just like my mom makes. Their main dishes are all good. This isn&#39;t like any other place, because they have unique flavors that are different from other Indian restaurant. That himalayan touch really makes a huge different. My favorite is the paneer tikka masala (note: I&#39;m vegetarian). It&#39;s creamy but balanced and appropriately spicy if you ask for it. And you have to get the garlic naan with it. But I also love the momos. They are really unique, light, and flavorful. Similar to dumplings. My husband loves the Chicken Makhani and the Goat when they have it. <br><br>Price - really reasonable. It makes for an affordable night out with big portions.",

I&#39;m not usually a fan of all you can eat restaurants, however the reason why I do enjoy this steak house is because it isn&#39;t about stuffing your face, but getting the opportunity to have a little bit of everything. <br><br>The decor is somewhat passé, but this is not because its an old or a shitty restaurant.

Apparently, the Adams Avenue location has a warmer ambiance w/ wood tables, etc.<br><br>Drinks: guava mojito and mango minto mojito were excellent, but the star of the night was the spicy drink w/ cilantro on the bar menu; I think called Mercado - so delicious and unique; tasted like a spicy garden in a glass! <br><br>They have happy hour daily, too, 3-6 pm -- 21 tapas for $4, plus sangria for $4.50, or 21% off cocktails or bottles of wine.  Great place; check it out!",

"reviewcomment":"11 years ago, I came to this restaurant because a friend said it was the best one in Little Italy; it held true to the statement back then, and it still does today. Everything is delicious--from the fresh tomato and herb sauce they serve with their warm bread, to their wine selection and their weekly specials, it is fantastic.<br><br>Though I have strayed, (only twice) to try different restaurants in Little Italy, I always come back. In fact, since my sister moved here 6 years ago, and one visit and she was hooked; we, have since, celebrated her birthday there every year.<br><br> I tend to stick to the same dish, their Ossobuco entrée is perfect every time with veggies or mushrooms and risotto. Their filet mingnon  is another go to and for a starter you can never go wrong with their carpaccio of the day. Love, love, love this place, a crowd pleaser in my book!",

"reviewcomment":"This hole-in-the-wall restaurant is one of the best finds in SD for Indian food. It&#39;s located in a weird business complex, but every time I go it&#39;s always packed despite it&#39;s weird location.<br><br>I first experienced Punjabi a year ago and I haven&#39;t had the time to come back until just last week! And through that year, the great quality and price has not changed at all. I normally get the 2-entree w/rice, naan, and kheer and it&#39;s just so tasty! I normally stick it safe and get my two favorites: mushroom masala and tikka masala. Both curries are super flavorful and creamy, and it hits the spot, especially on a cold day.<br><br>I think my favorite part is the FRESH, HOT naan! It&#39;s baked to perfection and is so fluffy and just accommodates whatever you get. You really can&#39;t go wrong with fresh, homemade naan. <br><br>I have yet to hear of anyone having a bad experience at Punjabi and I honestly don&#39;t think I will anytime soon. I came here with a group of 20 and their service was still exceptional. They got all our orders out one after another and didn&#39;t mess up on any!<br><br>TL;DR:<br>Food: 5/5 -- everything is so tasty!!<br>Price: $",

If you don&#39;t like diner food... not the place for you.<br><br>Food: 5 star: I ordered the samson steak sandwich. I enjoyed the crunch of the bean sprouts with the juicy beef and melted cheese. Delicious!!! My husband had the monte cristo.... he liked it. It is definitely on the sweet side. Tasted more like dessert to me. He had a cookies n cream malt shake... I ordered coffee malt shake. I guess I don&#39;t like malt... it was gross to me. So the waitress gave me a regular coffee shake. It&#39;s coffe flavored. I&#39;ve had better coffee shakes... but it was prerry good<br><br>Service: 5 star: Amazing. Wow... I wish I remembered her name. She has great customer service. All I rememberes is that she had piercings on her face. She had one of those earrings that you can see a hole through. Anywho... she was very helpful and nice. Had a smile om her face the whole time. Thank you for the great experience. Servera can make a difference on how u enjoy the restaurant.<br><br>Cleanliness: 5 star: clean tables and utensils. Floors look clean also.

I used to live in LA/OC and now SD, so I feel pretty strongly about that statement. <br><br>Ambience - simple, not too fancy, just right<br><br>Food - The food is the main story here! It&#39;s is delicious, all of it! First things first, they give everyone a bowl of daal to start which is delicious. Really a home made taste, just like my mom makes. Their main dishes are all good. This isn&#39;t like any other place, because they have unique flavors that are different from other Indian restaurant. That himalayan touch really makes a huge different. My favorite is the paneer tikka masala (note: I&#39;m vegetarian). It&#39;s creamy but balanced and appropriately spicy if you ask for it. And you have to get the garlic naan with it. But I also love the momos. They are really unique, light, and flavorful. Similar to dumplings. My husband loves the Chicken Makhani and the Goat when they have it. <br><br>Price - really reasonable. It makes for an affordable night out with big portions.",

This is easily hands down the best all you can eat korean bbq joint in San Diego (not that there&#39;s many to compete with).<br><br>The restaurant is clean and spacious. Servers, though some can&#39;t understand perfect English, but are all very friendly and attentive. Quality of the meat is good, banchan (the little side dishes) are delicious, salad is refreshing, and steamed egg is my absolute favorite! There are three tiers to choose from, A2 (basic $20), A1 (with seafood), and S1 (I never even bother looking at what S1 offers cus A2 already has more than enough options to choose from haha).<br><br>We always start off with brisket, then work our way through marinated short ribs, beef tongue, sometime bulgogi, then sum up everything with spicy pork belly. Don&#39;t forget to ask to change the grill once or twice throughout the meal!<br><br>Everything is all you can eat, so come starving!<br><br>Tip: You can also get half order of meat so you can try more of the different ones.",

Moreover, a lady in a cocktail dress looks even more amazing, when accompanied by a gentlemen in a jacket and tie.  For those who find this offensive, they can rest easy in the fact that there are hundreds of establishments that are willing to welcome them any way they may be attired.",

"reviewcomment":"This place is much much more than pho joint. I mean, you can get pho here and vermicelli noodles and the rest of the usual suspects. However, they offer a treasure trove of traditional Vietnamese dishes, all of which, I cannot comment on. I guess I need to make some legit Vietnamese friends so I know what to order.<br><br>However, I will say that the beef cubes and fried rice are really good and something that you can&#39;t really get at other nearby pho places. The beef is always really tender and flavorful. Not the mention, the portions are very generous. The other item that I think really stands apart from other vietnamese places is their fried egg rolls. Super delicious! And they always come out piping hot (maybe a little too much so, as I&#39;ve burned my tongue more than once.) <br><br>The service is usually very nice! The one thing that is slightly annoying is the two credit cards per table rule, which can get kind of tricky when you have a big group, but hey, you can&#39;t have everything right?",

Food came out about 10 minutes after ordering and we got a seat outside right away. <br><br>Shared the smoked fish sandwich and fish plate. Smoked fish sandwich was SOOOO GOOD! Sourdough bread, mayo, amazing tartar sauce and I added hot sauce to it as well. I only got a tiny bite of the fish plate - must have been good ;) -  which was basically fish &amp; chips.<br><br>Also, they serve beer and wine and you can sit outside. <br><br>It&#39;s a nice, super relaxed place that&#39;s dog friendly.

This may seem silly to those of you who hail from metropolitan areas, but the little Central Valley town where I grew up only had Denny&#39;s as a breakfast option. Perhaps in large part to this, Broken Yolk made a great impression on me.<br><br>In hindsight, Broken Yolk pales in comparison to other breakfast places in terms of quality of food (in my opinion, Broken Yolk is more about the quantity... SEE: Man vs. Food). With that said, the airy rooftop patio provides a lovely venue to enjoy a mouthful of food in the San Diego sunshine.",

I used to live in LA/OC and now SD, so I feel pretty strongly about that statement. <br><br>Ambience - simple, not too fancy, just right<br><br>Food - The food is the main story here! It&#39;s is delicious, all of it! First things first, they give everyone a bowl of daal to start which is delicious. Really a home made taste, just like my mom makes. Their main dishes are all good. This isn&#39;t like any other place, because they have unique flavors that are different from other Indian restaurant. That himalayan touch really makes a huge different. My favorite is the paneer tikka masala (note: I&#39;m vegetarian). It&#39;s creamy but balanced and appropriately spicy if you ask for it. And you have to get the garlic naan with it. But I also love the momos. They are really unique, light, and flavorful. Similar to dumplings. My husband loves the Chicken Makhani and the Goat when they have it. <br><br>Price - really reasonable.

"reviewcomment":"This has been my favorite Vegan restaurant in San Diego and I have been coming here for I believe almost 10 years? On my last visit a couple things threw me off but not enough to not come back. I still am a fan and love Sipz. <br><br>What I love=they are very generous with their vegetables! I hate ordering vegetarian food elsewhere and getting lots of fillers such as bell pepper or celery--yucccck! Sipz is very generous with the portion size and the amount of veggies. I asked for broccoli and was charged $1 more for it. $1 is not a big deal,  and I had told him I drove all the way from Vegas and come to visit every time I am in San Diego. I ordered the basil Thai &#34;chicken&#34; and loved every bit of the flavor. My hubby got the crispy chow mein with &#34;beef&#34; and he is a big meat eater and he enjoyed it. <br><br>Why the minus 1 star? The crab rangoon was oily and I could have done without it. The dessert (brownie with cheesecake) was recommended by someone working there and it was soooo not good. What is up with everyone saying their desserts are good? I must have got the wrong thing. The &#34;brownie&#34; was a fluffy cake that tasted like nothing. I have had plenty of vegan brownies and this was by far the worst. <br><br>What will keep me coming back is getting a healthy meal with lots of veggies, the brownie cheesecake I would stay away from. <br><br>We tried convincing the owner to open up a location in Vegas but for now we will have to drive to San Diego for some Sipz!",

"reviewcomment":"I came here a few weeks ago with my boyfriend in the search of good gelato. I had high expectations because we were in Little Italy, after all. I was NOT disappointed!! <br><br>I walked in to a cute, small store with ready-to-go pastries in a display case filled with both savory and sweet. (Seemed convenient enough to grab something on a 15 min work break) <br><br>Finally-the gelato...was amazing!! I tried almost all of them and felt a little bit guilty about asking for so many samples but the workers were so nice! I got Pappalecco(which was my fav) and pistachio. The gelato wasn&#39;t too sweet and it was the perfect creamy consistency. I shared a small size with my boyfriend and it was just the right amount. I would definitely recommend this place!",

The music is a great music setter. Great for dates if you want to make a classy impression. There are many vegetarian  appetizers, props because they are tasty as well. I came here for happy hour and dinner with a friend on two separate occasions as she&#39;s always raving about how wonderful the place is (I totally agree).<br><br>Notable specials: <br>Happy hour is as follows: <br>Su-Th 5-630p &amp; 9:30-11p.<br>Fri &amp; Sat 4-6p &amp; 10-11p.<br>I remember really enjoying the Moroccan kiss ($5 I think), very sweet and bubbly drink. The tomato &amp; cucumber and potato salads were very tasty too.  <br><br>Meatless Mondays: 25% off vegetarian dishes. The vegetable tagine is kickass. Very flavorful with earthy spices (so it&#39;s not spicy). It had a very strong tomato base to the curry used. I also really like the spiced carrots that come with the meal. <br><br>Definitely coming back.",

"reviewcomment":"This place is the best Indian/Himalayan restaurant in SoCal! I used to live in LA/OC and now SD, so I feel pretty strongly about that statement. <br><br>Ambience - simple, not too fancy, just right<br><br>Food - The food is the main story here! It&#39;s is delicious, all of it! First things first, they give everyone a bowl of daal to start which is delicious. Really a home made taste, just like my mom makes. Their main dishes are all good. This isn&#39;t like any other place, because they have unique flavors that are different from other Indian restaurant. That himalayan touch really makes a huge different. My favorite is the paneer tikka masala (note: I&#39;m vegetarian). It&#39;s creamy but balanced and appropriately spicy if you ask for it. And you have to get the garlic naan with it. But I also love the momos. They are really unique, light, and flavorful. Similar to dumplings. My husband loves the Chicken Makhani and the Goat when they have it. <br><br>Price - really reasonable. It makes for an affordable night out with big portions.",

Massive restaurant, plenty of room, cold A/C, cold beer, EXTENSIVE (shall I say exhaustive?) beer options, and GREAT food. <br><br>I&#39;m a meat eater but even the vegan wings were awesome. I couldn&#39;t even tell that they were meat-free. (RARE!) so if you&#39;re vegetarian, definitely check out the vegan wings. For me, I had a chicken sandwich which was amazing. The fries were decent, although they are so skinny that they lose heat, so tackle the fries before the chicken.<br><br>The beer list is to die for. Brew from every corner of California, hell, every state it seemed like. The cocktails were awesome as well, quite a list.

They have strange hours so I don&#39;t get to come here as often as I&#39;d like but if you&#39;re free during their hours of operation you should definitely give it a try! <br><br>I recommend the crunchy tacos which are made to order. They are deliciously crunchy and full of meat. Be sure to grab some salsa! They also have amazing beans so I usually get a side of rice and beans. I think they only offer tamales on Saturdays. I tried one. They&#39;re not the greatest but if you have a tamale craving they will do the trick. Also, make sure you get a side of fresh tortillas! There is nothing better than handmade tortillas!! <br><br>After you order and pay you take your tray and grab a seat in one of two rooms. Usually the line outside is lengthy but the food is worth it!",

"reviewcomment":"Came to the restaurant about 9:15 am on Memorial Day weekend. 20 minute wait, no big deal. Ended up being about 15. <br><br>We sat at the bar inside and were greeted immediately to take our drink order. Then when we placed our food order, it came out really quick. <br><br>Food was delicious! We got the banana French toast and Jose&#39;s special (basically scrambled eggs with veggies and potatoes). Loved them both!! Will absolutely come back for the food :)<br><br>The reason why it&#39;s 4 stars? I don&#39;t know if it was because we sat at the bar in the middle of all the action, but everyone was running around us so fast, I felt rushed. I was scarfing my food down like it was timed. The check was given less than 5 mins after we got our food, and everything was happening so quickly, I didn&#39;t feel like we got the chance to relax and enjoy our food. When I looked at the clock when we left, we were in and out of this place in less than 30 mins. I didn&#39;t realize until we left just how stressed I felt from the chaos.",

I used to live in LA/OC and now SD, so I feel pretty strongly about that statement. <br><br>Ambience - simple, not too fancy, just right<br><br>Food - The food is the main story here! It&#39;s is delicious, all of it! First things first, they give everyone a bowl of daal to start which is delicious. Really a home made taste, just like my mom makes. Their main dishes are all good. This isn&#39;t like any other place, because they have unique flavors that are different from other Indian restaurant. That himalayan touch really makes a huge different. My favorite is the paneer tikka masala (note: I&#39;m vegetarian). It&#39;s creamy but balanced and appropriately spicy if you ask for it. And you have to get the garlic naan with it. But I also love the momos. They are really unique, light, and flavorful. Similar to dumplings. My husband loves the Chicken Makhani and the Goat when they have it. <br><br>Price - really reasonable. It makes for an affordable night out with big portions.",

I can&#39;t write a detailed review of the food because i haven&#39;t tried it all, but the concept of the restaurant is pretty cool.<br><br>Every order is placed on ipads. Shortly after, a waitress shows up to your table to make sure everything went smoothly. <br><br>I love the build your own everything idea that they&#39;ve got goin on here! I tried the salads &amp; customized it on the device, without the guilty feeling of being difficult. ;) The salad was delicious, and I love the huge assortment of dressings! I was trying to eat light today, but my next visit will def be a carb feast! <br><br>The best part about my dining experience was not having to wait for the bill. Nope.. you just pay on the little ipad. If you&#39;re splitting the tab, it even lets you pay your own portion easily. <br><br>I just love this place &amp; will def be back for more carbalicious eats soon!",

"reviewcomment":"This was my first time trying Louisiana food and it was pretty darn good! We got here on a whim and brought two dogs with us (we were dogsitting). As soon as we walked up to the establishment someone met us outside and took us to the outside seating immediately! Super thoughtful! They also brought out two separate dog bowls so they wouldn&#39;t fight. <br><br>We started off with the jalapeño cornbread and soft shell crab appetizer. I have to say I wasn&#39;t a fan of either but my boyfriend happily ate my share. For my entree, I ordered the BBQ Shrimp Po Boy and my boyfriend got the Shrimply Delicious special. The Po Boy was fantastic! I even got more shrimp than my boyfriend did muhahaha. The side of fries that it came with were nicely seasoned.<br><br>I would probably give this place 4 stars because I wasn&#39;t too crazy about the food but the service was welcoming and friendly which bumped them up to 5 stars. The atmosphere was very chill and the music made me feel like I was in an authentic restaurant in Louisiana. Well, at least what I think it would feel like since I&#39;ve never actually been there. Anyway, I&#39;ll definitely be back to find an entree that I truly enjoy.",

"reviewcomment":"Beautiful restaurant! I&#39;ve been here multiple times on various occasions. The second level bar/restaurant area is great for happy hour or just a casual dine with friends on the weekend, and the terrace upstairs is absolutely stunning for a sunset dinner, with ocean views and breezes.<br>The menu is seasonal, so although I liked everything I ate there, I can&#39;t make any particular recommendations. But i definitely enjoyed their gnocchi dish and salmon dish- the salmon tasted much fresher than any I&#39;ve had at area restaurants.<br>Note that it&#39;s cheaper to eat on the second level- their drinks and food are marked down somewhat. Also, it&#39;s going to be crowded pretty much all the time, regardless of where you&#39;re seated, so don&#39;t expect too much of an intimate meal.",

"reviewcomment":"Good service, affordable prices, and good Mexican food. What more can you ask for?<br><br>I finally came to Casa Guadalajara on the recommendation of my brother -- he&#39;s been to this place a lot of times, and is always raving about the seafood. Well I&#39;m not a seafood person, and really wanted to have a Mexican breakfast, so I decided to visit CG and try out their breakfast. <br><br>My friend and I decided to go on a Saturday around 10am. The restaurant itself is charming and  has character. It&#39;s just feels very welcoming and comfortable. Like I said, we went around 10am, and it was starting to get kind of full, so the hostess offered us a table in the bar... I&#39;ll take it! <br><br>Since we&#39;re the only people seated in the bar area, our server is on it. He comes over immediately and takes our order. My friend has the chilaquiles with chicken, and I get the huevos rancheros with a mango margarita on the side (It was Saturday, don&#39;t judge me!) :)<br><br>The chips and salsa alone were pretty darn good -- and I know that sounds dumb, but that&#39;s the first thing you should focus on at a Mexican restaurant. If their chips &amp; salsa suck... Get outta there!<br><br>Our breakfast came out promptly. My friend&#39;s plate was huge! They did not skimp on the chicken. My plate was hands-down the bomb. The huevos rancheros were cooked over-medium (and they did it!), and it also came with beans (smothered in cheese) and rice (in a tostada bowl!). The MEDIUM mango margarita was enormous, but it was so delicious. <br><br>I&#39;ll definitely be coming back here. I can&#39;t wait to try this place out for lunch and/or dinner!",

I used to live in LA/OC and now SD, so I feel pretty strongly about that statement. <br><br>Ambience - simple, not too fancy, just right<br><br>Food - The food is the main story here! It&#39;s is delicious, all of it! First things first, they give everyone a bowl of daal to start which is delicious. Really a home made taste, just like my mom makes. Their main dishes are all good. This isn&#39;t like any other place, because they have unique flavors that are different from other Indian restaurant. That himalayan touch really makes a huge different. My favorite is the paneer tikka masala (note: I&#39;m vegetarian). It&#39;s creamy but balanced and appropriately spicy if you ask for it. And you have to get the garlic naan with it. But I also love the momos. They are really unique, light, and flavorful. Similar to dumplings. My husband loves the Chicken Makhani and the Goat when they have it. <br><br>Price - really reasonable. It makes for an affordable night out with big portions.",

"reviewcomment":"The following review will consist of two for one deal..because I didn&#39;t get a chance to write a review on my first experience.  If reading is a daunting task for you, please just read my dessert review, which is in caps below.<br><br>First time: <br>I came here for restaurant week ages ago, and the coca cola ribs were so tender, buttery, and delicious.  Perfectly paired with the pool of grits.  The candied onions that it came with provided a wonderful contrast in flavor and texture.  Why should you trust me when I say this entree was definitely worth it?  Because I came here two years ago, yet still &#39;member being so blissfully happy with my dish.  The dessert was also wonderful, decadent, and not too sweet.  It was a variation of dmc 2.  The service at the time had been excellent--very warm server and Keegan had walked around to entertain all the guests, checking up on everyone.<br><br>Second time (2 weeks ago?)<br>So when I came here, I had already stuffed my face with tacos that my friend had cooked...So my appetite wasn&#39;t as big as usual.  However, being the foodie fanatic that I am, I convinced my date to order the App Attacker.  The set of appetizers that we got were the dates, carne asada tostadas, and crue fries.  The dates were absolutely savory and delicious--definitely caught me off guard that something so small could be so satisfying.  (x  The carne asada dish was meh, I didn&#39;t think the breading used for it was that great because it was doughy and dry.  The crue fries though...although it was on the salty side, it was hands down so worth it.  You get a hefty portion of heart attack goodness and the most bang &amp;&amp; happiness for your buck.<br><br>My date and I had split the chicken &amp;&amp; waffles and the d bar burger.  I personally preferred the chicken &amp;&amp; waffles because the chicken was so succulent.  My date preferred the burger, which was cooked medium rare.  Either way, it was definitely a close call...But...in comparison to the ribs, the ribs win.  No competition.  The ribs that my tongue palette can recall 2 years later,...that definitely says a lot.<br><br>Drinks were okay.  I was rather bummed that the mimosa wasn&#39;t refrigerated.  The you say mule, i say donkey drink was also good if you like gin &amp; tonic/skinny ginnys.<br><br>DESSERT: ORDER THE BYO SUNDAE!!!  I know my review is lengthy, but pleaseeeee do yourself and your tummy a favor and order this!!   It was so much better than Extraordinary Dessert&#39;s sundae and it&#39;s so cool how the dessert comes with such a wide array of options--there were fresh, sweet &amp;&amp; tart raspberries, creamy caramel sauce, fudge sauce, a fat dollop of dense whipped cream, brownies, waffles, candied fresh bananas...Ahhh, it&#39;s driving me crazy just thinking about it.  THIS IS THE TAKEAWAY MESSAGE.  Order this, and my review shall be considered a success.  That is all.  (P.S. Please come back and love me &amp;&amp; my review after.)",

"reviewcomment":"My friend took me here for a birthday dinner and it was an absolute hit. If you&#39;re into the gay scene (or just have a good appreciation for it) than this place is amazing. You have to be comfortable with penis-shaped, everythings though! I had a penis shaped balloon and dessert--but it was all in good fun :)<br><br>The waiter was delightful, there was a variety of margarita flavors, the dessert was delicious, and hey--I&#39;m not TOO picky but I loved my shrimp quesadilla as well :)<br><br>If you are comfortable in this environment, I would absolutely suggest doing a birthday here. You could do what my friend did and not warm the person too--it makes for a fun surprise :)",

Crispy, lobster-filled  egg rolls with jasmine rice and sweet chili sauce for dipping.  (Btw, an order of 4 is cut into halves, so more like 8 pieces).<br>-Garlic Butter scallop plate - About 5 pieces of fresh scallop, seared with garlic butter; I chose seaweed salad an onion rings as my sides (the house onion rings are huge!).<br>-Sculpin beer - no need to explain<br><br>SERVICE:  Friendly and fast!<br><br>*TIPS*<br>-To order combos:<br>1) choose your fish of choice<br>2) What kind of sauce do you want it cooked in (I chose garlic butter)<br>3) What kind of entree (in a taco, on a plate, etc).<br>- To order oysters, go inside and tell them how much you want.  Pay there, then they give you tickets and you go outside to the oyster bar to redeem them =)<br>-Line starts to get long after 5pm-ish<br><br>One more note.  I ordered up a storm at the counter....24 oysters and 2 scallop plates.  Came up to about $75.00!  So beware....there are no prices listed for the fish ;)",

"reviewcomment":"Great place to bring the kids, but what made the trip 5-star worthy was the stellar service that our waitress, June, provided!  We heard mixed reviews about Corvette&#39;s, that the staff would be rude all for fun, but June was so intuitive and helpful, and sweet, probably because she saw the difficulty we&#39;d be having dining out with 4 littles, 6 yo, 3 yo, and almost 2 yo twins.  She sat us in the perfect booth for our wild ones, divvied up the kids&#39; drinks to manageable portions, soothed our 6 yo&#39;s tummy ache, and was so patient with our twins&#39; urge to dance their little selves all over the area in front of our booth (when they hear great, upbeat, loud music, they just HAVE TO DANCE, they can&#39;t help it!)...too many great things, and I can go on and on.  We visited, thinking it would be a one-time experience to take the kids to Corvette, but because of all this, we plan to be back again the next time the kids want fries and shakes :)<br><br>Food:<br><br>Chicken strips we ordered for the kids tasted great!  We loved them, and were happy to find that they were not dried out as some restaurants tend to do.  Didn&#39;t even need the dipping ranch for them.<br><br>Reuben was just right, flavor was perfect, better than our flavor experience at DZ Akins.  We prefer flavor and quality over quantity, any day!<br><br>Waffle fries tasted good with the bbq sauce, not too greasy.  Fries were ok. Potato skins also ok.<br><br>Hawaii 5-0 burger was good, I would have preferred less wasabi mayo and more teriyaki flavor to the burger to make it pure deliciousness.  The patty was ok, moist, and next time I will add a sprinkle of pepper.<br><br>Cookies N Cream shake--can&#39;t go wrong with that :)<br>Pineapple shake--yummy, and would be awesome-er if it had coconut flavored ice cream mixed in...just my preference!<br><br>Overall wonderful experience, loved the loud music, the theatrical staff with their amazing wigs and singing/dancing performances, decor, ambiance, food, and June.  We loved her!!  5 stars! There isn&#39;t really a way to dine with our 4 littles stress-free, but our experience was as good as it gets, thanks to lovely Ms. June!",

The aroma of place was off-putting for me at first, but I&#39;ve grown to not mind it.<br><br>My boyfriend swears by their broth for a feel-better-from-all-sickness remedy. We always get the half spicy - half not spicy soup base. The spicy side, despite being filled with red peppers isn&#39;t all that spicy. But not to fear fellow spice-lovers: you can request for more spicy soup base and they&#39;ll bring you extra chili peppers in oil, and you can adjust the spicyness level by the spoonful. The boyfriend also always requests the three sauces you can get on the side, and then he mixes all of them, which is something not really to my taste, but hey he loves it! Hahaha. <br><br>The food options are pretty straightforward and are what you would expect. Sometimes they run out of watercress, my favorite veggie on the menu.",

We read that this place gets packed so we made our reservations as soon as possible.<br><br>Make sure you call in 2 hours before to make your reservation, then show up in an hour and 15 minutes so they know you are serious. That is what we did, cause we ended up getting there faster than we thought. We ended up waiting 20 more minutes after that.  This was really nice because people who ended up just showing up there without a reservation were still there when we left.<br><br>We got their mac n cheese dish as an appetizer, that was soo good. Afterwards I still wish i got the brussel sprouts and a pizza, because tables around us got those and they looked amazing. Everything honestly looked amazing.<br><br>My wife ordered some type of stuffed pasta, (it was orange) soo good and delicious. I ordered the steak frites... MMMMMMM it was an amazing cook on everything. All of our food practically melted my mouth. The steak was so tender, the pasta was cooked perfectly through and was not mushy anywhere.<br><br>Best anniversary dinner ever!!! We both agree we should make this restaurant an annual (if not more) destination for our anniversary.",

"reviewcomment":"Farm to Table upscale mall eatery.<br><br>Organic, seasonal, and health conscience friendly.<br><br>Ordered the Grass Fed Bison Burger. Wheat bun, unami, watercress, and mushrooms with a caramelized onion spread. Sided with a choice of sweet potato hash or kale salad. Opted for the hash which was essentially O&#39;Brien Potatoes with sweet potatoes guest starring in the lead role. Hearty but not heavy lunch.<br><br>For sweets, I ordered the flour-less chocolate cake. A common dessert player on many menus, TFK&#39;s stood out with the use of organic 72% cacao woven into the cake, riding on a wave of sinful salted caramel. Rich decadence and an epiphany to chocoholics.<br><br>Fairly guilt free meal to fuel a shopping excursion.",

"reviewcomment":"Truluck&#39;s was located literally right across the street from my hotel. After numerous San Diego yelpers recommended it, I knew I needed to try it. <br><br>Let me just say, this meal was PHENOMENAL.  It definitely was a great way to introduce myself to pacific coast seafood. <br><br>Upon entering, it had a loungy type feel. There was live music that was a nice touch. Nothing overbearing. <br><br>I was seated in a cozy booth in the bar area and immediately my server brought over a bottle of water. <br><br>After perusing the menu and asking for his recommendations, I went with the mussels appetizer, the mesculin greens and the miso glazed seabass. All were fantastic and exactly what I was looking for, but the seabass is where it&#39;s at. In fact, I&#39;ve contemplated going back again to have the exact same meal. <br><br>The seabass was atop a bed of crab fried rice. This too was fantastic and complimented the seabass. On top of the seabass was a cucumber salad. It sounds like an odd combo but the flavors blended very well together. <br><br>My server told me Truluck&#39;s is from the Naples area. I&#39;m excited to look them up upon my return to florida so I can recreate my exceptional meal.",

The place has a very chic hipster vibe, with unique art all around, big stable-style doors and a really nice patio with a vertical garden.<br><br>We sat at the bar first and ordered a few cocktails from the main bartender, Christian. He was telling us all about his travels throughout the world and what the different ingredients in each drink represented; there&#39;s a lot more there than meets the eye! For dinner I went with the BANKERS HILL Burger and WOW was it good! Like a butter burger with great flavor. I had to fight my girlfriend off from stealing bites. The truffle fries were so rich, too. She ended up eating most of those...<br><br>BANKERS HILL seems to have a cool growing vibe and I&#39;ll definitely try to return next time we&#39;re in town. Great place to take a date, gather with a few friends or even go solo and hang with my guy Christian at the bar.",

"reviewcomment":"This place is the best Indian/Himalayan restaurant in SoCal! I used to live in LA/OC and now SD, so I feel pretty strongly about that statement. <br><br>Ambience - simple, not too fancy, just right<br><br>Food - The food is the main story here! It&#39;s is delicious, all of it! First things first, they give everyone a bowl of daal to start which is delicious. Really a home made taste, just like my mom makes. Their main dishes are all good. This isn&#39;t like any other place, because they have unique flavors that are different from other Indian restaurant. That himalayan touch really makes a huge different. My favorite is the paneer tikka masala (note: I&#39;m vegetarian). It&#39;s creamy but balanced and appropriately spicy if you ask for it. And you have to get the garlic naan with it. But I also love the momos. They are really unique, light, and flavorful. Similar to dumplings. My husband loves the Chicken Makhani and the Goat when they have it. <br><br>Price - really reasonable. It makes for an affordable night out with big portions.",

"reviewcomment":"Holy F if I could give this place more stars I would! We went here today after our zoo trip on a recommendation from my friend who lives in S.D. and we were so glad we did. I don&#39;t normally write reviews right after I go somewhere but I was so happy about everything about this place I felt compelled.<br><br>Ok enough yapping. So we got to this place and it&#39;s a seat yourself situation. So we waited awhile and stalked a table and stared at them for a good amount of time. One of the ladies that worked there saw us waiting so she came and put a reserved sign on the table so we could get the table as soon as the people left. Awesome GREAT customer service considering people were waiting everywhere. <br><br>Riki was our server and she was great! We started with some beers we got Ballast Point Calico and The Coronado Brewing Company Golden Pilsner. Great Beers! Their special for the night was the Chili Cheese Tots and those were spectacular! The tots had a perfect crunch to them the chili was so flavorful and it was so yum. I got The Farmers Market Salad and I can&#39;t stop thinking about how friggin good this salad was! It had everything in it! Beets, Carrots, Cucumbers, etc in a homemade Thyme Vinaigrette! So amazingly fresh and delicious! The rest of my family ordered either the salad or cheese burgers and everyone was so happy! Not only did this place have great customer service, great beers and great food it was extremely kid friendly! And the prices were so cheap! You would never be able to get food that good and that cheap in Orange County!!! A++++++ across the board!",

"reviewcomment":"This place is pretty spacious. Good music and good vibe.  <br><br>The only thing that sucks ls that they get super selective with their customers at night.. If you are just slightly drunk or appear to be then there&#39;s a good chance you will be kicked out so that they can let in more people and make more money through their expensive cover charge (about $30 on weekends). Last time I went I stumbled a bit in the bathroom and the employee working inside handing towels and things told on me and there was a security guard waiting outside the door for me to walk me out.  LAME!! I&#39;ve heard from friends who have gone through the same or some that have gone out for a cigarette or to meet someone outside and then not being let in because they were &#34;too drunk&#34;.. so this is obviously a card they play often to let more patrons in.

"reviewcomment":"I&#39;m so behind on reviews it&#39;s ridiculous. Just had to get that out of the way.<br><br>I was apartment hunting like a month ago and one of the complexes we checked out was right by Sab-E Lee and my soon to be apartment suggested we eat there &#39;cause it&#39;s delicious! So we did.<br><br>PARKING:<br>It&#39;s in a little plaza. Kind of small, We didn&#39;t have any issues with parking.  Though we did show up RIGHT before they opened for their dinner hours.  We didn&#39;t know they had a one hour gap where they were closed.<br><br>AMBIANCE:<br>Super tiny place.  Probably can seat like 15 people max.  It&#39;s not the cleanest but I don&#39;t mind.<br><br>SERVICE:<br>The lady at the cash register was nice.  I believe they ONLY TAKE CASH, so make sure you got some.  <br><br>FOOD:<br>I decided to get some red curry. Spicy level 5.  They suggest 3 as medium I believe and 5 they say is really spicy.  I wonder what 10 feels like.  It definitely had some heat but it was a good heat. I enjoyed it.  I love spicy food.  Maybe each time I go back I&#39;ll raise the level by 1 haha.  <br><br>The flavor overall was nice.  Good balance, veggies were nice in there.  Rice is extra unfortunately.  We also got our food to-go but it was no big deal and didn&#39;t really affect the quality.  <br><br>If we move down here, I will definitely visit more often!",

"reviewcomment":"This place is the best Indian/Himalayan restaurant in SoCal! I used to live in LA/OC and now SD, so I feel pretty strongly about that statement. <br><br>Ambience - simple, not too fancy, just right<br><br>Food - The food is the main story here! It&#39;s is delicious, all of it! First things first, they give everyone a bowl of daal to start which is delicious. Really a home made taste, just like my mom makes. Their main dishes are all good. This isn&#39;t like any other place, because they have unique flavors that are different from other Indian restaurant. That himalayan touch really makes a huge different. My favorite is the paneer tikka masala (note: I&#39;m vegetarian). It&#39;s creamy but balanced and appropriately spicy if you ask for it. And you have to get the garlic naan with it. But I also love the momos. They are really unique, light, and flavorful. Similar to dumplings. My husband loves the Chicken Makhani and the Goat when they have it. <br><br>Price - really reasonable. It makes for an affordable night out with big portions.",

When you walk in you see these fabulous over the top gold mirror mosaics and I know it&#39;s a little much but I LOVE them. Our waitress was prompt and very nice. <br>      I ordered my meal to be a level 7 heat and it was pretty good. I love spicy so I could go hotter myself but 7 wasn&#39;t too shabby. My husband ordered his meal at heat level 8 and said the same, could but we could handle hotter. Since this was our first time we ordered conservatively on the heat level. <br>      The lunch quantity was very good. It had a small salad with a sweet dressing, a cup of soup and a spring roll to go with your main meal choice. I felt the prices were very good for the meal I received. I will definitely be back.

Happy hour happens 7 days a week.<br><br>That said, you may not always get the beer you ordered, and you may not always get the meat that you prefer in your food. My mom and I shared beef nachos and had a bit of shrimp on our plate, which makes you wonder if they are pre-making food to have ready to go out quickly. We ordered three different draft beers that didn&#39;t end up being what we ordered. The waitress acted completely oblivious the first time, so we went directly to the bartender the 2nd and 3rd times. Both of those times, the bartender just said &#34;oh yeah, we are out of that so I just poured you something similar.&#34; Wouldn&#39;t that be good to share with the waitress so she can inform the customer upon delivery?",

"reviewcomment":"ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!?!?!?<br>Okay, so I saw good review here on Yelp and thought, &#34;sure, let&#39;s give it a shot&#34;, but being a vegetarian for 20 years now, I am sure it&#39;s not going to be anything to blow me away.  Ranchos Cocina BLEW ME AWAY!!!! <br><br>So, this place is not a dedicated vegetarian restaurant, but they offer a vegan or veg option to damn near everything on their HUGE menu...and I mean HUGE!   And I&#39;m not just talking the, &#34;yeah, we&#39;ll leave the meat out and maybe put a few extra beans in there for you,&#34; vegetarian options. I am talking full-on really good meat substitute vegan option. You are getting damn near the same dish, but vegan. Exact same dish, different protein.  It has a bigger veg selection than most veg restaurants. Anyone who has been veg for a long time knows how hard it is to find  a true mexican restaurant that has even half way decent veg options. Your search has ended.<br><br>There were so many things to choose from on the menu, but I had to narrow it down to just a few, so I went with a Carne Asada taco, chipotle chicken taco and...damnit, I forgot the enchilada I got, but it too was amazing...covered in vegan mole sauce and so damn good.  The Carne Asada taco was by far my favorite, though. Everything about it was insanely good, like a Mariachi band in my mouth.  However, you would be doing yourself a huge disservice if you left this place without trying the vegan Horchata! WOW!  Hands down the best Horchata I have ever had in my life!! Made to order, not dispensed from some plastic machine. <br><br>I don&#39;t normally write reviews quite like this, but this place blew me away. I cannot wait to go back and bring others with me.  No doubt, this will be a standard place to visit every time I am in San Diego.  Vegan heaven has been found and that heaven was found in a taco.",

"reviewcomment":"I like this place because of their hot pots (obviously). They may not give as much sides as your normal Korean restaurant, but you get what you pay for.<br><br>I came here during the afternoon for a late lunch. I had one of their specials: meat party and seafood. FYI, the hot pots are never filled up and usually half-empty. Also, please make sure you use only one to two eggs. I&#39;ve seen someone add more than five...I am just suggesting since eggs have high cholesterol.<br><br>Anyways, enjoy the food!! :)",

"reviewcomment":"I came for the Coffee. Then I came back for the coffee. Then, again, I returned for more coffee. It&#39;s rich, deep, and chocolatey and the espresso when consumed by itself has a full body and finishes with a dark berry sweetness. We didn&#39;t try any of the food as we tended to show up just before closing, but the smell of the pizza coming out of the oven made us contemplate a second dinner.<br><br>I tried a double espresso, small americano, and a cappuccino, and my wife had a large iced americano (with cream and sugar) and a small iced decaf mocha. Every drink was made with careful attention to detail and it showed. I would recommend milk-based drinks as the dark and smokey espresso really shines and tastes strongly of chocolate when combined with milk. <br><br>The restaurant itself has a nice ambiance; it&#39;s am upscale establishment but lends itself well to casual conversation. The service was outstanding - Jonathan, a barista that works evening shifts at the end of the week gave my wife and I first class treatment and delivered some amazing espresso drinks. Definitely a caffe not to be missed!",

"reviewcomment":"Jake&#39;s deserves five stars for the view alone. Who doesn&#39;t enjoy a gorgeous, panoramic view of the sun sinking into the Pacific Ocean? <br><br>I recently visited Jake&#39;s for date night and was amazed that I&#39;ve lived in Del Mar for three years and yet to step foot into this restaurant. My date and I were immediately led to a gorgeous crescent shaped booth that overlooked the ocean.<br><br>We started with a couple glasses of wine, the Kung Fu Girl Riesling, to be exact. I like my wine sweet and although it&#39;s not quite moscato-level of sweetness, it was quite good. <br><br>I have to admit that I&#39;m a picky eater and my first glance at the menu made me a little nervous. There is a lot of &#34;fancy&#34; food and I&#39;m typically a steak and potato kind of girl. But ultimately, we ended up selecting a few of the &#34;safer&#34; options. <br><br>We started with a bowl of seafood chowder, which in addition to clams included salmon and other fish, and an Artisan Romaine salad, which was a fancy way of saying Caesar. Since the waitress knew we were splitting the dishes, she kindly informed the kitchen to plate and portion our food separately and we received two bowls of soups and two salads. The chowder had a delicious flavor and, as a big fan of salmon chowder, I loved this enhanced version. The salad was nothing special though.<br><br>After a slight communication error, my date ordered the BBQ ribs for an appetizer. We briefly discussed what kind of meat they were but I didn&#39;t get to the point of the conversation (that I don&#39;t eat pork) fast enough and the waitress came back and took our order. He seemed to enjoy the ribs though. :)<br><br>For our entree, we split the Surfing Steak, which included a 5 oz. New York steak and shrimp atop truffle mashed potatoes, sauteed spinach and sweet cream corn. It was as close to steak and potatoes as we could find on the menu. The steak was cooked to a perfect medium rare and was absolutely delicious. The mashed potatoes and sweet cream corn were also flavorful. I&#39;m not a fan of spinach so I quietly brushed that off to the side of my plate but everything else was superb!<br><br>I&#39;d definitely recommend Jake&#39;s for a date night. It&#39;s sure to impress!",

"reviewcomment":"Memorial Weekend: CHAOS! But... I almost felt like VIP because I greeted by the host and less than one minute, we were seated down with a waiter waiting to take our drink orders! Wait!! Do we look like celebrity look-a-likes?! Don&#39;t think so, but got outstanding service!!<br><br>The hardest and most frustrating thing about Cheesecake is deciding on WHAT TO EAT! When you&#39;re starving, everything sounds delish, but I settled on the Spicy Chicken Chipotle Pasta! I laughed when he brought the plate because it looked like one of those giant salad bowls filled with pasta galore!! The difficult part about the pasta was trying to not make yummie noises while eating it because it was delicious! It was something different, but amazing! <br><br>You would think that would be enough!! But we decided to save our leftovers for a midnight snack and get the Chocolate Brownie Sundae! We didn&#39;t order any alcoholic drinks, but we got chocolate wasted from this! I took a few bites and I was done, a bit too much for me! I would rather have something light and fluffy, not really dense considering I just gorged myself on carbs! <br><br>If you&#39;re a SoCal resident, everyone knows Cheesecake is just a classy version of BJs &amp; better!",

"reviewcomment":"This place is the best Indian/Himalayan restaurant in SoCal! I used to live in LA/OC and now SD, so I feel pretty strongly about that statement. <br><br>Ambience - simple, not too fancy, just right<br><br>Food - The food is the main story here! It&#39;s is delicious, all of it! First things first, they give everyone a bowl of daal to start which is delicious. Really a home made taste, just like my mom makes. Their main dishes are all good. This isn&#39;t like any other place, because they have unique flavors that are different from other Indian restaurant. That himalayan touch really makes a huge different. My favorite is the paneer tikka masala (note: I&#39;m vegetarian). It&#39;s creamy but balanced and appropriately spicy if you ask for it. And you have to get the garlic naan with it. But I also love the momos. They are really unique, light, and flavorful. Similar to dumplings. My husband loves the Chicken Makhani and the Goat when they have it. <br><br>Price - really reasonable. It makes for an affordable night out with big portions.",

"reviewcomment":"If you&#39;re looking to have a delicious breakfast with great service that does not involve going to your traditional chain restaurants, give this place a try!<br><br>The Pros:<br><br>The service... 10/10! The server and the manager were extremely kind and made sure that we were being taken care of, even during the busy Sunday morning rush.  The server was very knowledgeable with the menu and the manager personally came over to us and asked if he could get us anything. <br><br>The food... WOW! We had the Soy Chorizo Con Papas and the Papas Loco.  The food is simply amazing.  Every bite is so tasty that you never want it to end. Then there is the portion size... they definitely serve up A LOT of food per plate, which is great because the food is so good! Also worth mentioning is their house coffee, PERFECT! It is just the right temperature to where you can actually enjoy it upon first receiving it.  It also tastes better than other surrounding house coffees in my opinion.<br><br>The Cons:<br><br>Wait time.  It was myself +1 and we waited a little over 30 minutes to be seated. However, that was on a Sunday morning at 11am and they did make up for it with quick and great service.<br><br>The parking. Parking near the beach on the weekends can be a headache to begin with. Unless you&#39;re lucky enough to catch a street parking spot nearby or are willing to pay for the lot across the street, be prepared for a decent walk... but it&#39;s not that bad given your walking by the beach!<br><br>HIGHLY recommend this place and I will be back again in the future.",

I finally tried them out last weekend.

I had a Stella Cidre (not spelled cider) cuz ... you know ... I felt like it. <br><br>I had the Guido burger. Honestly they&#39;ve got portion-to-heaviness ratio down to an art. Any bigger and the burger would have been too much. It was just right ... tasty ... well cooked ... just a whole bag of yum. <br><br>We also shared the Frings (giant pile of fries and onion rings) between the four of us (and it didn&#39;t even finish). <br><br>Next time I have to try the shakes - they look Ah-Mazing!<br><br>Definitely stop here for a burger next time you&#39;re down in SD ... but be forewarned, they close at 10pm. <br><br>That&#39;s all for now, <br>Stay Cheerful ;)",

"reviewcomment":"Food and the view is really the best of the best.<br><br>We ordered gnocchi that were amazing and light. Penne pasta definitely looked like something you do not expect to get, but was delicious...not a typical penne dish! Shortrib panini was tasty and beef burger was just like it supposed to be. <br><br>Strawberry shortcake dessert was very fruity, almost felt like you&#39;re eating something healthy. Chocolate cake is the best - so moist like a lava cake. <br><br>I only made this reservation because of the Fish Ceviche I was craving since last year, and I was happy to confirm that it is still delicious. <br><br>Ocean view is amazing, definitely put some sunscreen on before you sit down. I wish that the next time we visit, we will get the table closest to the ocean - that is so hard to get unless you want to wait for an hour +",

"reviewcomment":"I like it!<br><br>A large array of Japanese food options, with a friendly and honest staff. All the restaurants in this area have lots for parking, but as you might now it gets packed during lunch and dinner. However you can normally find at least one spot!<br><br>Got seated for lunch quickly, and had quick service as well. We were about to order the seaweed appetizer, but our server told us that she doesn&#39;t recommend it because it tastes really bland -- yay! Love it when this happens.<br><br>The crunchy roll was REALLY good, possibly one of the most flavorful ones I&#39;ve ever had. Gyoza was gyoza, typically good. The chicken and calamari katsu was good, and surprisingly moist on the inside which is good. These entrees come with a bowl or rice and miso soup, both of which are really good as well! <br><br>I recommend this place for an affordable Japanese meal.",

"reviewcomment":"We arrived on a Monday morning at 10:00 am. We were greeted &amp; welcomed to sit anywhere we wanted to. Multiple people stopped by to check on us, take our order, deliver our food &amp; re-fill our coffees. Service couldn&#39;t have been any better. <br><br>I wanted pancakes but ended up ordering chilaquiles and chose beans vs. potatoes. The chilaquiles arrived at the table already seasoned to a medium-hot. If you can&#39;t take the heat, you may want to ask for a side of sour cream. In perfect form, some of the chips were still a little crunchy. It was a really delicious &amp; lively plate of food. I couldn&#39;t finish it all. <br><br>I tried to talk the Mr. Into ordering the 2x2x2 for $7 but he wanted potatoes, so he chose the mega breakfast. Holy moly that&#39;s a kit if food! We struggled to got everything on the table. I got to steal half of his pancakes and my oh my, they were tasty! I wish I could figure out how to make pancakes like that. <br><br>It&#39;s a semi-classy little place. I wasn&#39;t in the mood but they were concocting some tasty looking drinks at the bar. I think this would be a fabulous stop just about any time if the day or night!",

After spending two weeks in Tahiti for my honeymoon I fell in love with this beer, so I always get one here. Love it!<br><br>- I&#39;ve attended large events on the back patio and it&#39;s a great space with amazing view. I really wish they had more than one bar location since the line gets backed up waaaasy too far!<br><br>- I&#39;ve met friends here after they just flew In to town and they loved it too. <br><br>- limited gluten free menu, if that&#39;s your thing. <br><br>We know it will be good if we go here.

The customer service experience took the whole thing to a solid 5 stars.<br><br>Our waiter Caesar A. was very friendly and interested in what we were all about. He quickly found out that I was planning a trip to Madrid in the near future. Later in the meal he sent over some chorizo stuffed, bacon wrapped dates free of charge to get us &#34;introduced to the food in Spain&#34; which apparently hast he best sausage int he world. <br><br>That&#39;s not where he went above and beyond, though already that was pretty good. Later he asked for my email address because it just so happened he is very familiar with Madrid and ahd recently written a quick guide for his brother or a friend. He was going to forward it on to me... my first thought &#34;yeah right, nobody ever follows up on stuff like that&#34;<br><br>I received the guide yesterday, with an invitation to come back and tell him all about the trip. <br><br>That type of service rarely exists any more, he was genuine and he followed through. For that alone I&#39;ll keep coming back even if he&#39;s not my server, any restaurant that highers that quality of people deserves my business.",

I used to live in LA/OC and now SD, so I feel pretty strongly about that statement. <br><br>Ambience - simple, not too fancy, just right<br><br>Food - The food is the main story here! It&#39;s is delicious, all of it! First things first, they give everyone a bowl of daal to start which is delicious. Really a home made taste, just like my mom makes. Their main dishes are all good. This isn&#39;t like any other place, because they have unique flavors that are different from other Indian restaurant. That himalayan touch really makes a huge different. My favorite is the paneer tikka masala (note: I&#39;m vegetarian). It&#39;s creamy but balanced and appropriately spicy if you ask for it. And you have to get the garlic naan with it. But I also love the momos. They are really unique, light, and flavorful. Similar to dumplings. My husband loves the Chicken Makhani and the Goat when they have it. <br><br>Price - really reasonable. It makes for an affordable night out with big portions.",

"reviewcomment":"Wow, talk about huge portions. My girlfriend and I started off with an order of the Carne Asada Nachos and they were great. Huge amount and very tasty. We couldn&#39;t even finish all of them. For our main we got the Flat Iron Chimichurri and we could not have been more satisfied. We got it cooked medium which was the right amount in my opinion and it comes with so much. On the plate was a salad, tomato and cucumber pico de gallo, black beans, chili honey glazed quesadilla and am amazingly tasteful Chimichurri sauce which paired perfectly with the streak. All this food was plenty for us to share and we were pretty hungry when we walked in too but our server blain convinced us to get a dessert so we went with the most popular one which was the Chocolate Caueta Vulcan. What a huge dessert and so perfectly and beautifully prepared. A table of 4 could easily share this brownie, ice cream concauction. <br><br>The Food was great and the service was even better. Our server Blain took great care of us and was on top of everything. Cant wait to be back.",

If you&#39;re an East-coaster, have an affection for Seinfeld or just love gramma&#39;s soup, God wants you to eat here. What I love more than anything is munchin&#39; on them pickles while I wait for the main dish to arrive! And those dang jars are never empty! Ya just kinda feel the love when u walk in ya know? Like pullin into gramma&#39;s kitchen after a 5 year hiatus. Warm broth aroma&#39;s and everyone&#39;s just happy to see ya.<br><br>The menu is more like a storied novel of delicious items so vast and deep, only the most loyal elderly customer could have eaten his/her way thru it. DZ is probably best enjoyed around lunch time, but the dinner specials are delectable too. And don&#39;t fret, the pastrami is every bit as good as Katz&#39;s in NYC. And the cooks arrive around 3am just to make the bread every day! Come on man! just the sight of the bakery would make any toddler do a backflip<br><br>I got the tongue sandwich with mac salad. YES tongue. Try it. It&#39;s like pastrami but ever more buttery and delicious. You can box up the rest. For dessert my server was nice enough to whip up a chocolatey shake creation (who&#39;s name escapes me at the moment) but ask your server about it as it&#39;s not on the menu and is a must have!<br><br>Try:<br>Matzo ball soup! Pastrami!<br>Tongue, pickles.<br>Secret chocolate shake.<br><br>Parking is rough.",

One of the best in San Diego in my opinion and they always come out piping hot! <br><br>The last time I was here I actually got the broken rice with bbq pork and meatloaf and it was amazing!

I made reservations ahead of time and they put us on the patio in the back under an awesome decorative tree. Then when we got there earlier than the reservation time, they still seated us right away on a busy night. Sat down at the table and they gave us menu&#39;s that said &#34;Happy 1 Year Anniversary&#34;. <br><br>Now for the food...The bread &amp; sauce they give you to begin with is AMAZING. I couldn&#39;t stop eating it. Next, I ordered the cavatelli pasta w/ homemade sausage and my gf ordered the homemade parpadelle pasta. It was SO good. I recommend both dishes, and they fill you up too. Lastly, the waitress gave us tiramasu on the house because it was our anniversary.<br><br>They seriously went above and beyond, and I would come back here 10 out of 10 times. Just awesome.",

"reviewcomment":"This place is the best Indian/Himalayan restaurant in SoCal! I used to live in LA/OC and now SD, so I feel pretty strongly about that statement. <br><br>Ambience - simple, not too fancy, just right<br><br>Food - The food is the main story here! It&#39;s is delicious, all of it! First things first, they give everyone a bowl of daal to start which is delicious. Really a home made taste, just like my mom makes. Their main dishes are all good. This isn&#39;t like any other place, because they have unique flavors that are different from other Indian restaurant. That himalayan touch really makes a huge different. My favorite is the paneer tikka masala (note: I&#39;m vegetarian). It&#39;s creamy but balanced and appropriately spicy if you ask for it. And you have to get the garlic naan with it. But I also love the momos. They are really unique, light, and flavorful. Similar to dumplings. My husband loves the Chicken Makhani and the Goat when they have it. <br><br>Price - really reasonable. It makes for an affordable night out with big portions.",

Ambiance is good for a fun date, although the noise level is a bit louder than their larger Del Mar Highlands location and the room is a little darker here. Still, your dinner is by romantic candlelight if you come at night, and that is always a lovely thing.<br><br>We have tried real Italian food in Italy, and Davanti does a pretty solid job with their Cacio e Pepe (simple pepper and cheese pasta). We highly recommend that.<br><br>Their pizza is also pretty good, and all the vegetables in our meals taste very fresh. Service has always been excellent.

I never know what to expect with vegan fast food places but this one exceeded any expectation I had. I ordered the Bacon Cheeseburger with regular fries - I believe it came with Daiya, Vegenaise, tomato, lettuce, etc. - and my friend ordered the South of the Border Burger with sweet potato fries. We paid at the counter and proceeded to the dining area (it was huge) and found an outdoor patio to sit at - we really enjoyed the patio and appreciated the beautiful flowers surrounding it. I have no complaints about my burger because it was GREAT!!! The patty and toppings went together very well and left me wanting more (but there was no way I could eat another burger). My friend also enjoyed her burger and loved her sweet potato fries, which looked more like chips to me. To top it off, the food was soooo cheap! I definitely recommend EFF for your next vegan fast food fix!",

"reviewcomment":"FIRST IMPRESSIONS:<br>Loved the host stand at the entry; it was a shell of an old radio/hi-fi system. Attentive + friendly staff. Quick to be seated. Interior is moderately loud, but not overpowering to be unable to hear your companions.<br><br>Nifty perk: If you come here before a show, you get direct access to the Birch Northpark Theatre!<br><br>THE EATS:<br>Kale Caesar -- bright, light, dressing + toppings don&#39;t overpower the flavor of the baby kale. Some might prefer covering the woodsy kale flavor more, but I find it very pleasant + refreshing<br><br>Veggie sliders -- Smokey, savory, full of flavors from their fantastic house-made veggie patties + topped off with arugula, tomato + a chipotle aioli adding just a hint of heat. Definitely a favorite I&#39;ll order every time I come here.<br><br>All this was washed down with a delectable Belching Beaver Peanut Butter Milk Stout. Can&#39;t complain in the slightest. Lucky me for getting here just before Happy Hour wrapped up!<br><br>Ashley is sweet as can be + attentive. I wasn&#39;t sitting waiting for long before she&#39;s magically reappear to check on me.<br><br>THE VERDICT:<br>GO! -- Great food. Fantastically friendly servers. Great ambiance, decor, + decidedly &#34;West Coast&#34; vibe.",

"reviewcomment":"I went here on Mardi Gras because Betty&#39;s was too packed, but I&#39;m sure glad I did! <br><br>Here are some highlights:<br><br>1. The salsa bar is delicious and has a creamy tomato jalapeno salsa that is the condiment version of crack.<br><br>2. They have steamed tacos.. wasn&#39;t sure what these were until my friend Matt ordered them, but they&#39;re basically like corn tortilla enchiladas and they are DELICIOUS!<br><br>3. The potato taco is sinful. Straight up mashed potatoes enveloped in a crispy tortilla shell.<br><br>4. The guac is fresh and tangy. Delicious as an app.<br><br>The lowlight... was probably the queso fresco tasted a bit off, but I could be biased because I&#39;m not a fan of that type of cheese or oaxacan cheese. <br><br>Friendly staff, $3.50 beers on Tuesday and Cumbia playing overhead, what more could ya want?!",

New York strip ($38), both also accompanied by the same mashed potatoes and broccolini.  All cuts of meat turned out superbly.<br><br>Ample varieties of breads/rolls were offered before and during the meal, which were also deliciously prepared.<br><br>Imported beer, (Stella Artois) ($6), and Ferrari Carano Chardonnay ($13), were enjoyed with the meal.<br><br>The dining decor of Cowboy Star was tasteful an inviting.  Parking was a bit scarce, however.<br><br>All in all, I highly recommend Cowboy Star.  -- A bit pricey, but you get what you pay for.",

"reviewcomment":"This place is the best Indian/Himalayan restaurant in SoCal! I used to live in LA/OC and now SD, so I feel pretty strongly about that statement. <br><br>Ambience - simple, not too fancy, just right<br><br>Food - The food is the main story here! It&#39;s is delicious, all of it! First things first, they give everyone a bowl of daal to start which is delicious. Really a home made taste, just like my mom makes. Their main dishes are all good. This isn&#39;t like any other place, because they have unique flavors that are different from other Indian restaurant. That himalayan touch really makes a huge different. My favorite is the paneer tikka masala (note: I&#39;m vegetarian). It&#39;s creamy but balanced and appropriately spicy if you ask for it. And you have to get the garlic naan with it. But I also love the momos. They are really unique, light, and flavorful. Similar to dumplings. My husband loves the Chicken Makhani and the Goat when they have it. <br><br>Price - really reasonable. It makes for an affordable night out with big portions.",

Not only was the food amazing but the service was SUPER-B.<br><br>We walked in on a Tuesday, apparently one of their busiest nights and were asked if we had a reservation. Surely we didn&#39;t but that didn&#39;t stop the server, he seated us right away next to a nice window booth seat. <br><br>Our server (I can&#39;t remember her name - but was so vivacious and bubbly). My friend is allergic to a multitude of things that the dishes have so we have to substitute or ask for it on the side. The server made notes of all the allergies, double checked with the chef that nothing would be cross contaminated and made sure none of the meats would be marinated in any of her allergies, and special made her margarita so that it safe for her to drink. <br><br>Once we ordered, our food was out in exceptional time and so were our drinks. The drinks were amazing and diverse, but I am sure you read it in a lot of other reviews or seen the photos.. so I won&#39;t get into that.<br><br>Food: STEAK, marinated in a this yummy juicy teriyaki marinated, the salmon taco was to die for in this thai miso salad topping. Those two tacos were my show stoppers and I am practically salivating writing this review talking about them.<br><br>I only tried the tacos for food but I definitely give it 5 stars, I would like to come back for maybe breakfast and try it out as I see my fellow Yelpers who have only tried breakfast and not their tacos. <br><br>Service: 5 stars - if you had a bad experience, I highly recommend you come again and give it another try.<br><br>Ambiance - retro, funky, colorful, Mexi-style.

The regular garlic bread is amazing too. Don&#39;t be fooled by the cheap prices because the food is delicious! They have a great menu and the food tastes authentic. Staff is also friendly in both the restaurant and market. Daniella from the restaurant took care of us last time, she was awesome. <br><br>At the market I love grabbing their fresh rolls! They also have a great selection of Sicilian olive oil, my absolute favorite!",

"reviewcomment":"So I&#39;m a huge huge fan of cheeseburger. If I hear about a good burger place, I always make it a priority to visit the place next time I eat out.<br><br>My first impression of the Lounge burger was that it seemed too healthy for my taste. I like my burger greasy and juicy, dripping with the patty grease. Well, it wasn&#39;t juicy enough. But what actually impressed me was that the aftertaste of the burger was very good. It didn&#39;t overwhelm my taste bud too much with he flavors. The burger also did not put me to sleep after I finished them. Everything is organic and the beef is supposed to come from grass-fed cows.<br><br>If you like to enjoy a burger without worrying too much about the calories and the grease, this is a good place to give it a try.<br><br>note: Hard to find a seat during busy hours. This place is packed with people.",

"reviewcomment":"DELICIOUS!!!!! Born and raised in the OC, I had my fair of Vietnamese food/restaurants. I must say that I am quite impressed.  This place blows them out of the water. First of all, the ambience was not your typical Vietnamese restaurant. The people here are friendly. They chatted with us, asked how the food was and the service was excellent (I got refills on water without asking!!!). As I said, not your typical Vietnamese restaurant. We ordered a few drinks and you&#39;ll definitely get your money&#39;s worth haha. The drinks were really strong but at least you&#39;ll know they aren&#39;t skimping out on the alcohol.  <br><br>Now onto the more important matter...the food. We ordered a lot of dishes because we were hungry and we finished everything....it was that good. We got the crab cakes, coconut shrimp, garlic shrimp, 360 beef, creamy basil sea bass, lo mein, and another chicken dish with veggies. The crab cakes, lo mein, and the chicken dish were good. It tasted like what you would expect from any other Vietnamese place. The coconut shrimp came out in a coconut and it was really good. The coconut sauce was sweet. The garlic shrimp remind me of a honey walnut shrimp. It was crispy texture. The 360 beef was cooked perfectly. It was soft and tender. The creamy basil sea bass was soooo good we got another order right after we devoured the first one.",

I discovered this place after getting bored with my old sushi place. <br><br>The breakdown: <br>- beer and sake specials <br>- miso soup (so good)<br>- garlic edemame and fish cakes <br><br>The sushi is amazingly good with an assortment of mouthwatering rolls to satisfy everyone&#39;s palate. <br><br>My favorite of course is the  Ziggy Roll combo which gives you a taste of everything. <br><br>They are surprisingly filling if you are starving. Another cool thing is this place is Bob Marley/ Rasta themed which is pretty cool.",

Perfect balance of orange juice to champagne for $9 from breakfast to 2 p.m.! Not even light handed on the pours!<br><br>Oatmeal comes with dried currants, brown sugar, and candied walnut. Super hearty and good. <br><br>Two egg special is fantatic. Not too greasy but still flavorful. The bread looked dry, overly healthy, and nutty but was actually super delicious!<br><br>Wedge salad is normally not something I rec, but this place has a fantastic wedge salad. The dressing to bacon to bleu cheese ratio was perfect!<br><br>All of the food is super fresh and super well balanced in flavor. Our table of 6 had no complaints for anything! Other than we couldn&#39;t take Adrian home with us...<br><br>Super nice ambience, connected to the Sofia hotel, walkable from the train station. Would love to come back for dinner!",

"reviewcomment":"So three part review here. First off. The look of the place. At first glance, seeing it from the outside you may think it&#39;s not that nice looking. But when you walk in, totally different vibe. Very nice looking and unexpected. Legit seating and booths. Their cups and plate don&#39;t look like your typical restaurants. So it&#39;s a really nice feel to it.<br><br>As for the restaurant itself. Now I can&#39;t say for all waitresses but ours was very nice. She didn&#39;t bug us while we ate. She got our ordered and drinks after we settled down. And even cleaned a booth for us so we can have more room. After we got our stuff. She came back at an appropriate time to ask if everything is okay and if we need refills and didn&#39;t constantly bother us like most places do.<br><br>And now. The main stuff. Food. <br>It was good. The meat was very tender which was a definite positive, it was very juicy but the bbq sauce did over power the taste a bit. The fries had a great if not perfect amount of seasoning to the point you don&#39;t even need to add ketchup or salt. <br><br>Overall a very good establishment. Would recommend it to anyone who enjoys a fine burger. And if you hurry there is a groupon for it right now which&#39;ll save you a lot. Happy eating.",

The decoration may be outdated but the quality of the pie dinner is amazing.  There so much food for a small price! I always get the pie dinner which comes with: chicken pot pie, mash potatoes, Clow slaw,  side of veggies and two buns of bread.  Also you can add soup for 50 cent more. Oh yeah and to finish the entired meal you get pie for dessert! <br><br>This place alway remind me of my dad. If he was still alive, I bet he would love this place as much as I do.<br><br>Service is okay. Lol I honestly dont pay much attention to the service.

"reviewcomment":"This place is the best Indian/Himalayan restaurant in SoCal! I used to live in LA/OC and now SD, so I feel pretty strongly about that statement. <br><br>Ambience - simple, not too fancy, just right<br><br>Food - The food is the main story here! It&#39;s is delicious, all of it! First things first, they give everyone a bowl of daal to start which is delicious. Really a home made taste, just like my mom makes. Their main dishes are all good. This isn&#39;t like any other place, because they have unique flavors that are different from other Indian restaurant. That himalayan touch really makes a huge different. My favorite is the paneer tikka masala (note: I&#39;m vegetarian). It&#39;s creamy but balanced and appropriately spicy if you ask for it. And you have to get the garlic naan with it. But I also love the momos. They are really unique, light, and flavorful. Similar to dumplings. My husband loves the Chicken Makhani and the Goat when they have it. <br><br>Price - really reasonable. It makes for an affordable night out with big portions.",

"reviewcomment":"Came in for brunch on a weekday and was sat right away. Cute place with high ceilings and interesting decor. Service was friendly and very efficient. <br><br>Started with lattes which were surprisingly good for a restaurant. Espresso was perfectly pulled and milk was steamed well- great taste! <br><br>Ordered the Soy Chorizo Scramble which was delicious. A great breakfast with Mexican flavors (black beans, salsa, etc). I&#39;m sure all their scrambles are as good. Portions are huge and indulgent! My companion ordered the Carnitas stack which he was equally as pleased with. <br><br>Would definitely return and would want to try A LOT of other menu items!",

"reviewcomment":"This place is different than all the other AYCE korean bbq spots because you have to get up and grab your own meats, seafood, veggies AND make your own sauces instead of it being ordered. I prefer grabbing my own amount of food versus being brought a large amount of meat on a plate and being forced to eat it all cause i like to eat a little bit of everything!<br><br>My favorites are the marinated short ribs, intestines and fried pancakes! I use the sesame sauce and salt with sesame oil as well. Ive always thought their meats were slightly sweeter as well. <br><br>The only con is that the waitress is not prompt on refilling your waters and you have to wait a while before a waiter comes by to ask them for a grill change.",

"reviewcomment":"Tea station has always been my go to place for legit authentic Boba. Once I had boba in Taiwan, nothing in San Diego could even come close except for tea station.<br><br>They use quality tea here and you can really taste the difference. Their drinks aren&#39;t as sweet as compared to tap ex but that&#39;s what I love about this place. Not only is is the perfect sweetness already you can adjust your sugar level from no sugar to even 1/4 sugar. Their food is pretty standard Taiwanese fare. I rarely eat here so I can&#39;t really comment on the food.<br><br>Only problem is how expensive the drinks are here. Close to $5 for a regular milk tea with boba. Again since this is my favorite boba place I don&#39;t really mind paying that much. If you buy one of their plastic reusable cups, you can get a discount on drinks every time you come. I think the discount is like $.25.",

"reviewcomment":"3 1/2 stars but I bumped it up 1/2 just cause I liked the music they were playing &amp; the pajun was soo good.<br><br>Me and two other girls came here after a long drive from Vegas back to San Diego. We were all craving some Asian food and this was one of the only places open at around 10 PM on Memorial Day. We ordered the chicken wings, boodae jjigae, and seafood pajun (korean pancakes).<br><br>It&#39;s about a plate of 12 chicken wings which are pretty meaty. The sauce was good and it was just basically standard Korean style wings. Since BBQ Chicken closed down it&#39;s been hard to get some good chicken wings in Convoy but this place did the trick. The boodae jungol was good as well. It was pretty big, I think it could serve around 4 people give or take. However I think I like the boodae jjigae at Do Re Mi more. <br><br>My FAVORITE thing here was definitely the pajun.. I usually never order korean pancakes but boy am I glad we did. It comes out on a sizzling hot stone plate and it is just sooo good. It&#39;s thick and the top is crunch while the inside is so fluffy. All three of us liked this dish the most and would definitely get it again if we came back. I think it really made our meal and pulled everything together. Everyone should get this! I don&#39;t even really consider myself a big fan of pajun, especially cause the one my mom makes is thin and doesn&#39;t have that much texture. But this changed my perspective on how good it could actually be!<br><br>Finally, the service here is basically non existent. They never checked up on us and I felt like it took us 15-20 minutes just to get our check. But since they were open in our desperate time of need I guess I will let them slide..",

"reviewcomment":"We had out of town guests, and we decided to try a new(for us) place on the waterfront for lunch on a Saturday. <br><br>We started with wine and cocktails. Tom Hams has a nice selection of wines, local craft beers and cocktails.  We chose Cakebread Sauvignon Blanc, a Chardonnay, a Bloody Mary and a Captain Idiot.  The drinks were all tasty and refreshing (side note: their bar has a nice view of the Harbor - think Happy Hour in the future).<br><br>Two of us ordered the Crab Louis Salad which had fresh-tasting crab and was the perfect amount for lunch.  I tried the lobster roll, and it was quite good as well, although I would have skipped the finely chopped red bell pepper.  The Crab BLT and the Lighthouse French Dip rounded out our orders, and all of them were tasty, unique and the right amount for a solid lunch.<br><br>A few of us had a little room for dessert and we split the Blondie sundae and a special that day which was essentially a tiramisu bread pudding.  The desserts were wonderful, and a great finish to a nice lunch for the family.<br><br>The view was spectacular on a sunny San Diego day.  We would recommend this to anyone (visitors and locals alike).  We will be going back soon.",

Everything tasted great.  The main course has ground chicken, onions, green and red peppers and some spurt of soy sauce based sauce.  The ground chicken threw me off because I prefer bite sized pieces of chicken instead of ground.  I liked that the dish wasn&#39;t so spicy that the flavor was masked by heat like most Thai food restaurants I&#39;ve eaten at.  The fried rice was good as well.  Finally the restaurant serves big enough portions to have a good amount of leftovers.  I only ate about half of my food.<br><br>I prefer traditional Thai food restaurants, but this place is worth at least trying because the food is good and reasonably priced.",

"reviewcomment":"This place is the best Indian/Himalayan restaurant in SoCal! I used to live in LA/OC and now SD, so I feel pretty strongly about that statement. <br><br>Ambience - simple, not too fancy, just right<br><br>Food - The food is the main story here! It&#39;s is delicious, all of it! First things first, they give everyone a bowl of daal to start which is delicious. Really a home made taste, just like my mom makes. Their main dishes are all good. This isn&#39;t like any other place, because they have unique flavors that are different from other Indian restaurant. That himalayan touch really makes a huge different. My favorite is the paneer tikka masala (note: I&#39;m vegetarian). It&#39;s creamy but balanced and appropriately spicy if you ask for it. And you have to get the garlic naan with it. But I also love the momos. They are really unique, light, and flavorful. Similar to dumplings. My husband loves the Chicken Makhani and the Goat when they have it. <br><br>Price - really reasonable. It makes for an affordable night out with big portions.",

"reviewcomment":"Such a great brunch place. I&#39;ve been here a couple of times, but i&#39;ll base this review off my last visit. I love that this place takes reservations because there are a lot of people who love to go to this place. The only downfall is their parking. Their parking lot can only accommodate a few cars (people who like to dine for hours. . . so it seems). While they have street parking available, they can fill up quickly too. <br><br>This visit, we tried the fruity pebbles pancakes and pigs in a blanket (2 sausages wrapped in one pancake). I don&#39;t know what people were raving about with the fruity pebbles pancakes. . . It&#39;s pancakes with a huge of butter and sprinkled fruity pebbles all over. The butter all over the fruity pebbles killed it (not in the good way. killed it as in i&#39;m surprised i wasn&#39;t killed with a heart attack). After scraping the overly buttered cereal bits away, the crunch mixed with the pancakes was appetizing. Although really, you don&#39;t need a lot of syrup for this because then you&#39;d lose the crunch. My favorite dish was the pigs in a blanket--carbs, meat, more carbs (they serve it with potatoes) so that was delicious. Be sure to order the Gm Honey Mule to make your meal even cuter (aside from that, the mule was really delicious). <br><br>Side Note: If you plan on trying the maple bacon donuts. . .be sure to go with friends so you can all share. It&#39;s so heavy but it&#39;s good. #whyAmericaisfat.",

"reviewcomment":"YUMMY!!!<br><br>I&#39;ve been here a couple times during lunch with coworkers and once on the weekend. Lunch during the week, it can be a little bit crazy, but you can also order online or call in ahead of time and just pick it up.<br><br>I&#39;m not much of a meat/seafood person, but my coworker got the meatloaf once and it was delicious and I had the dijon salmon which was also delicious. Perfectly cooked!<br><br>As for the sides, everything is terrific and most of it is healthy. The mac and cheese here is to die for. SO GOOD. I love the brussel sprouts here and I don&#39;t even like brussel sprouts. Rosemary roasted potatoes, broccolini, carrots, and their mixture of onions, mushrooms, and red pepper -- ALL DELICIOUS. I haven&#39;t had a salad, sandwich, or pizza, but we did sample the portabella &amp; pesto pizza and there were nothing but good emotions that came from it. The price isn&#39;t bad for what you receive, I&#39;ve never left feeling like I wasn&#39;t served enough food. My go to is the 4 Up plate, 4 hot or cold sides and a piece of bread.  With the four sides, I feel like you get more food than if you get an entree and 2 hot or cold sides. When we went this afternoon, I couldn&#39;t even finish my plate (mushrooms/onions/red peppers, mac &amp; cheese, brussel sprouts, rosemary roasted potatoes, and a piece of bread). I took 1/4 of it home.<br><br>Every time I have been, everyone is very friendly. The staff walks around and collects your finished plates. There was a couple next to us and the husband didn&#39;t like the broccolini he had, the staff who was collecting plates asked if there was something wrong with it or if he simply did not like the broccolini. He replied that he had just been telling him wife that he didn&#39;t think it was that great. The staff who was attending to him asked if he could get him another side or soup. Talk about great service! I will pay for great service any day. The restaurant puts a high priority on taking initiative when it comes to their customer service. The husband didn&#39;t have to complain about his food, the staff noticed and offered him something better. <br><br>There is a sign that asks to not hold tables until you get your food. The turn around is fast enough that I&#39;ve never had to wait for a seat.",

"reviewcomment":"So, my Boyfriend Cecil and I came here around Eleven on the day of his Birthday. Right away we were greeted and sat. On the way to our table it seemed like everyone in the Bar knew it was his Birthday with everyone shouting it and greeting him. We were greeted by Fabian. (I hope I remembered his name right.) He was very nice and helpful. I didn&#39;t know what to order alcohol wise and he told me not to worry about it that he&#39;d bring me something great. (And he did!!) We also tried the Chipotle Fries and the Sliders which both dishes were superb! We then were waited on by a different girl, I think her name was Stephanie. She was amazing and attentive also.<br><br>Overall, they have great food, and drinks.<br>I will definitely be back. I will definitely be telling people about The Waterfront. <br><br>Oh yeah, and I appreciated the fact that everyone in the Bar took care of my Boyfriend on his 21st Birthday and made him feel special. He had a great experience and a great start off to his Birthday! You took care of us and I really appreciate that. And for that reason alone I will be back. <br>Big shout out to Lauren too!",

"reviewcomment":"This place is great. I love the atmosphere and the Pho is amazing. I have a few go to around where I live in San Carlos but whenever I am in the Kearny Mesa area I stop here. Found this place because I love the crepe place right next to it. My girlfriend and I go to get massages and then go get crepes after whenever we can and now we&#39;ve added Pho into the mix. <br><br>The broth is perfect. It is not to salty like some places have it and it&#39;s not overpowering.. They give the option for an egg, which I do, it give it a lot of flavor. I go for the filet mignon and get the steak on the side so I can put it in the broth myself. It makes me feel like a chef for a minute. I also like my steak on the rare side so that could be it too. Anyways, the regular size it huge and the large size is ginormous and only for $1 more. Not to bad. They have some pretty good happy hour prices during their happy hour which I&#39;ve only been to once. <br><br>They seem to be busy when it&#39;s time for lunch and dinner. If you are like me and crave Pho at random hours of the day say like 2:34pm you might have the resturant to yourself but don&#39;t let that fool you they get pretty packed during lunch time hours of normal working people (12pm-1pm) and around dinner time (5-5:30pm). <br><br>The pho section is in the back and the some of the other entries and menu items have funky names, which i thought was clever but other people focused on to complain about, not sure why but hey to each their own. <br><br>I highly recommend this place and if you are not sure what you want or what something means on the menu.. just ask! The server will be more than happy to guide and/or educate you!",

"reviewcomment":"I&#39;ve had ramen in Tokyo, Japan &amp; San Fransisco&#39;s Japan Town and I by far still think this place has the best ramen I&#39;ve ever tasted. I give them 5 stars stictly on their food alone. <br><br>It&#39;s located in Mitsuwa&#39;s Japanese Market but they should really open up an actual restaurant of their own. Their shopping center&#39;s parking lot has the tiniest spaces. They have a cafeteria type of feel set-up where you have to find your own table and sometimes even stand next to people who are finishing their food just so you can reserve a place to sit. Cash only and no to-go orders. The only ATM machine they have in the market is Bank of America.<br><br>Now, back to their food. Their ramen has so much flavor that I always leave the place with a burnt tongue because I can&#39;t wait for it to cool down to start eating. I love their Shoyu and Spicy Ramen with a side order of rice and pork. The rice can sometimes be a hit and miss, some days its deliciously soft, other days you can tell its from the bottom of the rice cooker and crispy. They have a free water fountain on the side which is always nice to clean your palate with.",

"reviewcomment":"This place is the best Indian/Himalayan restaurant in SoCal! I used to live in LA/OC and now SD, so I feel pretty strongly about that statement. <br><br>Ambience - simple, not too fancy, just right<br><br>Food - The food is the main story here! It&#39;s is delicious, all of it! First things first, they give everyone a bowl of daal to start which is delicious. Really a home made taste, just like my mom makes. Their main dishes are all good. This isn&#39;t like any other place, because they have unique flavors that are different from other Indian restaurant. That himalayan touch really makes a huge different. My favorite is the paneer tikka masala (note: I&#39;m vegetarian). It&#39;s creamy but balanced and appropriately spicy if you ask for it. And you have to get the garlic naan with it. But I also love the momos. They are really unique, light, and flavorful. Similar to dumplings. My husband loves the Chicken Makhani and the Goat when they have it. <br><br>Price - really reasonable. It makes for an affordable night out with big portions.",

I actually thought Donovan&#39;s beat my all time fav filet mignon from Ruth Chris..<br><br>Second time was for CE dinner.. N that&#39;s when the steak taste went down hill =\. <br>At third time.. Was so disappointed.. I ordered the same thing as the first time, but my filet mignon was not tender and not flavorful as first time.. :( so disappointed.. Also my potato wasnt not too cheesy.. n bacon wrapped scallop was aight- still delicious- Maybe becuz I came with high expectation.. Lol this happens to me every time errrrrr...=\<br><br>Also, the scalloped potatoes. Man I remember the first time I had it.. It was a...m...a...zing! It was so creamy, cheesy.. Mmmmm mmmmph mmmmph! But at my third visit here.. Errrr it was bad..=\ <br><br>I guess many people bought the u pay $40 for $80 deal- the three couples around us all had that deal.. Lol - and for Wednesday, the restaurant was pretty darn packed for fancy pancy restaurant!<br><br>I will still give this restaurant 5 star despite ok experiences from my 2nd n 3rd time.. Becuz my first experience was so yummy- I still remember how my filet, scallops, potato n mushroom tasted.. Lol<br><br>I&#39;m planning to come back here next month, so hopefully the chefs will be graceful with putting more cheese in my potato scallop and cooking my steak n scallops like the first time.. :)~",

Sooo delicious and worth the money.<br><br>My mom got the seafood pasta, I got the yellowfin tuna, my boyfriend got the salmon, and my stepdad got the mahi mahi and they were all fabulous and SO SO fresh! The only complaint I would have is that the yellowfin needed a little salt or a little more seasoning but other than that it was absolutely a lovely dinner.<br><br>It was my moms birthday and they gave us a delicious creme Brûlée as well! It was so great! I would definitely recommend this place even though it&#39;s extremely pricey because the food and the view is fabulous.",

"reviewcomment":"I had a huge breakfast one hour before I came to this place but we made a plan to meet a relative here so my fat ass reported in for a second before we went to San Diego Zoo.<br><br>On a Monday around 12:30pm, the parking was not easy to find but manageable. So I had to walk one block but that&#39;s nothing to be complaining with. Once we got in, we were told to sit anywhere, so I grabbed a window seat. The menu was attractive and it actually made me want to eat more... too bad my tummy told me to go f myself. Since I don&#39;t want our company to feel like the only fatty, I ordered a tomato soup with a side order of ham. i know. That just bumped my fatty status as well.<br><br>Now, when I ordered the soup, I was thinking your everyday cup sized soup that you can chug it within roughly 74 seconds. But nooooooo~~ it was one huge ass bowl filled with tasty tomato flavor goodness with cheese and chopped basil spread around, PLUS 4 pieces of toasted bread. Holy cow. The side order ham was about the size of a hand with 2 pieces as well. The grilled mark was beautifully done and no way you would think that&#39;s just a side order.<br><br>As the result, you probably guessed, I couldn&#39;t finish them... it was ok though because it totally saved my ass later when I went into the zoo. I would also like to mention the service here was fantastic. The guy was helpful and always made sure we had enough water in our glasses. At one point, I even asked for a band-aid because my dumb ass cut my finger earlier. The guy did not hesitate and rushed to the back to find one for me. I love you buddy, you just saved a life! (Can you image having open wound in the petting area in the zoo? I would totally get something and die.)<br><br>Overall, I like my soup and ham, I also like the guy. So i am giving it a 5 stars.",

With no line and a staff service focused on making your pizza the way you want it, I was quickly enjoying my oven roasted pizza with a smile on my face. <br><br>You can make your own pizza from scratch, or you can choose a pizza template suggested and add/subtract from there. If you go with a friend, it might be a good idea to split a sweet and savory pizza together. After a while of eating the sweet pizza with berry and nutella, I was getting a bit tired of chewing a lot more dough than fruit. <br><br>If you are like me and usually get water at restaurants because you are being economically conservative, I suggest purchasing a drink this one time, as their unique soda is worth the taste and the calories!<br><br>The place was hip, cool, and had a great vibe.

"reviewcomment":"Just writing this review makes my stomach growl for some amazing Ponce&#39;s chicken tortilla soup... Or chicken enchiladas and rice and beans...or ceviche, oh so delicious! <br><br>While I appreciate a good taco shop, I had been looking for a great Mexican restaurant in San Diego that compared to anything I had back home. Finally a friend of mine took me to Ponces and I have been hooked ever since. <br><br>Ponces has a great atmosphere. The servers are friendly, and the food...oh the food! It make the hour plus waits on Friday nights totally worth it! If you ask, you can get chips and salsa while you wait. Sometimes I go for lunch during the week. They have great lunch specials and are rarely ever busy at that time! <br><br>What to order:<br>Chicken Tortilla soup: shredded chicken, veggies, slices of avocado, and a delicious flavorful broth base. (* I get the tortilla chips that top this soup on the side, since I don&#39;t like too many chips soaking up my broth...)<br><br>Ceviche: fresh and delicious! <br><br>Chicken Enchiladas with rice and beans: fantastic and the rice and beans are not merely side dishes, they complete the meal! Sometimes I get just a side of rice and beans...seriously, they&#39;re great!<br><br>Margaritas and/or Sangria: cause duh-lish! <br><br>Carne Asada tacos: tender meat, not over seasoned, warm tortillas, and pico de gallo, sour cream, and great guac to top them off. <br><br>Parking: it&#39;s pretty much street or neighborhood parking. They have a little lot, but if you go around dinner time don&#39;t expect to get a spot.",

"reviewcomment":"I went here for lunch during last week&#39;s heatwave.  After reading the reviews of the fish and chips I decided I really needed to try it.  I&#39;m happy to report that the reviews were all right!<br><br>The portion size was right, I even had some chips/fries leftover.  My friend had the same thing and finished it, so it was good for an average-apettite having dude, too.  The fish was cooked perfectly and the breading was to die for.  Ask for the fries on a separate plate as it can get pretty crowded and messy otherwise.  The tartar sauce was a highlight.  They clearly make it in house and it has a dilly flavor that wonderfully compliments the fish.  The fries are nothing special, but when are steak fries special?<br><br>The place was empty at 11:30 on a weekday so the service was great.  The one thing that bugged me that there was no a/c.  I&#39;m not going to fault them for that because come on, this is San Diego.  They had all their windows open though so there was a nice breeze floating through.  <br><br>They have a few good lunch specials for 8.95.  <br><br>I&#39;ve been here a couple times in the past for drinks and trivia.  The trivia nights are great - great service despite the huge crowd.  The  paté and toast was a yummy hearty snack as well.  I would go back for that alone.  Not a lot of restaurants serve paté in these parts.",

It was really light but filling.  The fried chicken was something I could&#39;ve done without.

"reviewcomment":"Going here tonight with a group of friends! Love this place. It&#39;s by far one of my favorite sushi joints. Their tuna tar tar is the best and the atmosphere is nice. They moved to a much bigger and better location than where they were before. I&#39;m guessing that because of this the prices went up a little, but it is still worth it. They are kid friendly as well and always give the kids little trinkets, pencils, or lights for their fingers. The presentation is always appealing and pretty. I&#39;m trying to think of a bad dish that I had there and I can&#39;t! I recommend this place to everyone and really enjoy it. The decor is nice. They have spoon sculptures and a samurai that looks like Darth Vader. They do play loud music so if you&#39;re not into that, be prepared. <br>One downside is if you have a large party they will split checks but only two people can pay with a CC, everyone else has to pay cash, and they add 18% gratuity when there are 6 or more rather than the normal 8 or more.<br><br>Other than that, this place is awesome and I highly recommend it!",

"reviewcomment":"Vallarta&#39;s, i swear, owns the holy grail...which comes in the form of christian fries and carne asada fries...it&#39;s sought after by everyone.  Seriously, I come here AT LEAST once a week and gym so hard in order to make sure I can eat without becoming extremely fluffy.  Sober or not, I love Vallarta&#39;s, and Vallarta&#39;s loves me.  I even befriended the employees here because I come so often.  Taken to go, these fries are still bomb because the cheese becomes melted.  Eaten there, still bombdotcom because the fries are still amazingly hot and crispy.  If you dare to go big and the get christian fries, prepare yourself for crispy fried chunks of bacon and eggs.  How can you not love their fries--it&#39;s smothered in thick, fresh guacamole sauce, heavy sour cream, topped with grilled carne asada, and a fat layer of cheese?  If heaven promised me these fries for eternity, I&#39;d give up my life of debauchery and be on the best behavior possible... ( :0<br><br>Tip: order grilled onions (technically deep fried, but oh wells--go big or go home) they&#39;re complimentary.  <br><br>Hehe, sorry for the long message.  My passion is genuinely real.",

Overall, we loved our Alchemy experience....foodie fun!<br><br>Ate at bar and received top notch service....great conversation by some pretty girls managing our area. Food was prompt and served by knowledgeable kitchen staff who explained each dish.<br><br>Ambience: Decor was interesting....books of interesting titles nailed to ceiling (hmmm...I don&#39;t know why, but why not). South Park hipster feel.<br><br>Would have enjoyed a larger selection of IPA. The Alchemy mule is the highlight.<br><br>Food was 3-3.5 starts. Our gnocchi was a little too salty, but beautiful texture. Our quinoa burger didn&#39;t hold together. Needed a binder. Loved the aioli and curry ketchup. Loved the bun and butter lettuce.<br><br>But the real winner of the evening was the miracle berry dessert. Soooo fun. the berry has proteins that block your bitter and sour taste buds. We tried lemon, sugarless lime cheesecake, vinegar shots....it was a fricken blast. <br><br>We will definitely go back.",

"reviewcomment":"I&#39;ve been coming here for years, can&#39;t believe I haven&#39;t written a review yet. I&#39;ve mainly come here for their happy hour and their sunday brunch. You really can&#39;t beat their happy hour, its 7 days a week (including holidays) and they offer it twice a day, from 3-6pm and 10pm-midnight. You can choose from a selection of amazing appetizers and a variety of tacos, everything priced under $6. That goes for their drinks too!<br>Highly recommend the table-side guacamole, which tastes so much better than the pre-packaged/pre-made guacamole you find at most mexican restaurants. Overall the food is really good here. Tacos are traditional favorites you would find from across the border, no deep fried chicken and ranch tacos here.  Just your choice of protein in corn tortillas with cilantro, onions and sauce. <br>The drinks are well made, great balance of flavors so none of them are too sweet or too tart. Service is also very helpful, they&#39;ve always been attentive and quick on taking our orders and checking in on us. Their outdoor patio area is great to lounge out on during the summer, though it can get a little busy. I&#39;ll be back here for sure!",

"reviewcomment":"I wouldn&#39;t change anything about our experience here or the food that we tried (except for maybe wishing my stomach had more room so we could have ordered and tried more!). After reading some SD food blogs and yelp reviews, we decided on the Chicken Tawook and the Soujouk flat breads with Aaysh Essaraya for dessert. The flat breads were a good size and splitting two could either leave you with leftovers or feeling overly full but so happy. We couldn&#39;t pick a favorite because they were so different - the Tawook was flavorful and light, the Soujouk was spicy and delicious. I could probably eat more of the Tawook if it came down to it. Gotta love that garlic paste! <br><br>How to describe the dessert... Sort of a custard base with a mochi-type layer then pistachio crumbles, all sitting in rose water/syrup. Sounds kind of adventurous, but after splitting a piece, the bf and I were lamenting that we hadn&#39;t gotten a piece each.<br><br>The prices were also very reasonable! One of my favorite meals in SD so far and all the hype was warranted. I would definitely come here again.",

Tender and lightly battered, it was a stellar incarnation of calamari. <br><br>Ni - Lobster Dynamite Roll. Fresh, and popping with spicy mayo and eel sauce.<br><br>San - Hakata Ramen Bowl. Thin sliced pork, dehydrated mushrooms, scallions, and noodles in a miso ginger broth. Delicate comfort food.<br><br>Saisyuu Hakai - Black Sesame Ice Cream and Cinnamon Apple Spring Roll. Velvety Ice Cream and Warm Crisp Sweet Roll - awesome flavor and texture contrasts. A really unique treat.<br><br>The food was perfect and I was transported by my senses to far away lands...the epitome of a 5 star experience.",

We were seated outside which is my favorite spot because you can see their beautiful pond and waterfall. I love the scenery outside and the bridge you have to cross over to enter.<br><br>Our server was very friendly, loud, and helpful in choosing our alcoholic drinks.

The Living Room has a good selection of tasty teas. <br><br>My first trip here and I was able to sit outside in the seating area in front of the cafe. The front of the cafe is right at a busy intersection so it is great to sit and watch the cars rolling by and the people strolling by.<br><br>I was able to enjoy their pastrami sandwich which was fair. It came with a small bag of chips and a pickle. Nothing outstanding. However, over all my experience was enjoyable. The seating area inside was largely available for groups of three or more. Since I was in a party of two, we were limited to our choice of seating.<br><br>The bathroom is a co-ed restroom. It could use a little help in the cleanliness area, however we were there on an busy Saturday and it is entirely possible that the staff was busy. <br><br>I really enjoyed the tea that I had here. It was a flavorful. I would go back for the tea dn the people watching.",

"reviewcomment":"If you are 21 and up you should go here. it is a fun place to go to because it has games, food and drinks :) It is definitely a grown ups Chuck E. Cheeses. You can also win prices. <br><br>The drinks are half off after 10 PM and on wednesdays they have half off ticket games and free game plays. They have all the new games that you can actually play through a smart phone. It seems to me that every time I go there is always a new game that they put up which is great because you get to play it. There are also 3D games which is pretty cool. <br><br>The food here is pretty decent. Better than your average denny&#39;s and the drinks are pretty strong. Sometimes the bartender hooks you up. Last time my friend went and she said she got a beer tower of IPA and she only paid 9 dollars for the whole thing.<br><br>The prices here are actually pretty cool. From all the tickets you win through the games you can get something at the gift shop. I have gotten certain dolls from there like a giraffe doll and a unicorn doll from despicable me. There are a lot more things you can get, even a george forman grill. If you want a small souvenir you can get a shot glass that has the dave and buster logo on it. <br><br>They also have reservations for banquets and big parties, so if you are wanting to have a gathering you can always reserve rooms and what not<br><br>The location for the Dave and Busters in San diego is actually really tricky to find and finding it through google maps isn&#39;t really helpful too. I always get lost going so i tend to not drive there. But the dave and busters throughout california is pretty much the same. Ive been to the on in irvine too and its as good as the san diego one. They just have small rule differences such as having your ID at a certain time.<br><br>Make sure when you go you have your ID or passport. And if you are 21 and younger you can go in with a person that is 25 and older.",

"reviewcomment":"First time to dim sum and I&#39;m a fan! Hence the 4 stars.<br><br>Best way to do it is with a large group and just order as you go. They come around and serve pretty rapidly. It&#39;s hard to describe each dish because we had so many, but for the most part, everything was fresh and hot(for the hot dishes). Place gets crowded, so reserve a table if you have a large group. <br><br>The price didn&#39;t seem so bad, but then again, it was my first time to dim sum. <br><br>Ambiance was a bit like an oriental hometown buffet, but who cares as long as the food is good. <br><br>2 thumbs up for their soups and teas.",

"reviewcomment":"The lovely evening began when my girflriend and I arrived at Prepkitchen, and David the owner was at the host/hostess stand ready to meet and seat us. We asked if we could blend our reservation with that of Mercy B and her friend, which was no problem at all! We decided to dine in a scenic and cathartic area outside, which was a great choice. The weather was warm and pleasant, and we could also people-watch.<br><br>Our server, Jen, served us water that has essence of cucumber, which adds a nice touch. Then I ordered a glass of Zinfandel, and didn&#39;t even notice until afterwards that it&#39;s made by Boneshaker (I ride a boneshaker, btw). It was so good that I ordered another one rather than changing to another wine. My girlfriend had the Peach Mimosa, which was very tasty.<br><br>Our group started with the charcuterie board, which was fantastic! It comes with house-made cuts of meat, three cheeses, raisins, sliced cucumber, a variety of olives, and three sauces - whole grain mustard, dijon mustard, and an olive tapanade. There was also a generous portion of french bread, which I used as the base for the ingredients. No matter what I mixed together, the result was yummy!<br><br>We also had the bacon-wrapped dates, which is basically adult candy! This is such a delicious combination of savory and sweet that I could have it for dessert! The last appetizer our table had was the mussels, which were perfectly cooked and served in a tasty broth suitable for dipping.<br><br>On to the entrees! My girlfriend had the chicken, which was tender and juicy with a nice crispy skin on top. It was served on garlic mashed potatoes with the most flavorful fresh peas that I&#39;ve ever had! I ordered the lamb shank over polenta with braised kale and golden raisins, and it was so tender that it fell off the bone! We were more than satisfied with these awesome entrees!<br><br>For dessert we shared the Goat Cheese Torte with Huckleberry Compote and Key Lime Curd. I really liked how it was very flavorful without being overly-sweet! One of the other desserts ordered was the chocolate brownie with salted caramel. She added a scoop of vanilla gelato, which made is like a decadent sundae. It was very rich, but not overly chocolaty, which let the other flavors shine on their own.<br><br>All in all, this was a truly epic night of decadence that this foodie will remember for a long, long time! I will definitely go back for many meals in the future!",

"reviewcomment":"Great dinner experience and favorite steakhouse in San Diego thus far! (Donovan&#39;s doesn&#39;t hold a candle to Flemings.)<br><br>Came during this past Memorial day weekend for the $30 prime rib special (3 courses; app, main, desert) which was as available during the three day weekend instead of when prime rib is served just on Sundays. I had a caesar salad and my boyfriend ordered lobster bisque, which he enjoyed greatly. <br>Our large prime ribs came perfectly medium rare, with three sauces (typical au jus and horseradish, but a third mustard one which wasn&#39;t my favorite). Super juicy and tender, one of the best cuts I&#39;ve had to date. <br>We ordered sides of garlic mashed potatoes and asparagus which were delicious, but when they say one side is enough for two they are not joking around.<br>Ordered cheesecake and creme brulee for dessert, the former being better than the latter. Cheesecake was not overly dense or sweet and completely satisfying, while the creme brulee had good custard but something tasted off on the torched sugar top.<br><br>Would highly recommend; though pricier, the service and food was pretty impeccable. Boyfriend also enjoys going for their great happy hour, $6 cocktails and food options.<br>Validation for parking at the Hyatt garage is available, but darn that downgrade hill you need to hike up and down if in heels!",

I used to live in LA/OC and now SD, so I feel pretty strongly about that statement. <br><br>Ambience - simple, not too fancy, just right<br><br>Food - The food is the main story here! It&#39;s is delicious, all of it! First things first, they give everyone a bowl of daal to start which is delicious. Really a home made taste, just like my mom makes. Their main dishes are all good. This isn&#39;t like any other place, because they have unique flavors that are different from other Indian restaurant. That himalayan touch really makes a huge different. My favorite is the paneer tikka masala (note: I&#39;m vegetarian). It&#39;s creamy but balanced and appropriately spicy if you ask for it. And you have to get the garlic naan with it. But I also love the momos. They are really unique, light, and flavorful. Similar to dumplings. My husband loves the Chicken Makhani and the Goat when they have it. <br><br>Price - really reasonable. It makes for an affordable night out with big portions.",

The Kebab Shop has some of the best Kebab and related dishes I&#39;ve ever experienced... The Doners are pretty huge, so keep your stomach empty before coming here one of those...<br><br>This is definitely my top suggestion to anyone looking out for really good Mediterranean food...

You walk in, smell the smokey, meaty flavor and immediately get the feeling that you&#39;re going to enjoy some delicious BBQ.<br><br>We&#39;ve always sat at the bar and been taken care of by Gray. Dude is on point. He anticipates your needs and sees things that other waiters don&#39;t. The  guy knows the food, the drinks, and what to order.<br><br>Let&#39;s get down to the discussion at hand, the BBQ. It&#39;s solid. We usually get the sampler platter of a few different meats and sides. This last time it was brisket, chicken and shredded pork. All three were great. The chicken had a perfectly flavored crispy skin while being super moist and flavorful on the inside. The brisket was a bit light on flavor, but we managed to put some of the house smokey BBQ sauce on top and it was awesome. I don&#39;t know what to say about pulled pork. I love me some pulled pork and this did not disappoint. Flavorful, moist and a few crispy ends on it to give it some texture.<br><br>We chose the small salad and fries for our sides. Our fries were perfectly cooked and seasoned with a BBQ-y/smokey salt of some sort. They were delicious. The small side salad was just enough to finish off the meal.<br><br>They have a pretty solid selection of San Diego beers with a few out of town choices as well. <br><br>Anytime we&#39;re in Hillcrest and want a solid place for lunch, it&#39;s hard to turn down Brazen.",

"reviewcomment":"My first House of Blues (HOB), San Diego concert and its got it all !  What an intimate venue, in which I can&#39;t believe Cypress Hill could play.  As I&#39;m too old to do the mosh pit standing in front of the stage at floor level I paid for the Elwood balcony (a corner seat).  This balcony is perfect and worth the extra admission, with its own bar and rest room.  You also have a super fast get-away after shows end as it&#39;s street level.  Next time I&#39;ll get the center balcony section, though...as the right speaker set blocked good views of the percussion set.  Got here by 630 to lock in a Happy Hour dinner, and the bartender Eileen (??) totally helpful in recommending the Jamaica seasoned chicken wings and a nice Stella draft.  ONE thing to remember is that if you spend $20 the night of shows you get automatic head-of-line entry to the auditorium and skip the entry line -- which is REAL slow due to extra security pat down checks of all patrons.<br><br>JOINT REVIEW FOR CYPRESS HILL BAND:<br>This joint totally blew me (and audience) out.  .  As the HOB is a basic small stage setting there is no real space for prop set up (i.e., their inflatable Budda); but who cares ?  It was the music and artists we wanted.... and the bare bones set showcased them.  <br>Did they deliver !!  I was really blown away by Breal&#39;s physical conditioning...at least 30 pounds lighter than he looks on video, BReal TV, the Smokebox, etc.  And man did he move....prowling that stage without stop.  The voice was better than I could imagine too.  These guys seem to have frozen time in place, as Sen-Dog is strong as ever and his baritone voice kept the dominant punch to foil B&#39;s nasal tone to perfection all night.  <br>Set opened with  G-themed 90s tunes (Could killa man, Cock the hammer, Homie I&#39;ll wet-cha, When the Shit goes down &amp; Ain&#39;t going out like that).....then led into the early placement of Insane in the membrane. This caught me by surprise, but I totally see making the finale Rock Superstar now.  After this was a mini-stoner set of Wanna get High, Hits from the bong, Dr Greenthumb and Illusions that was sweet too. <br> My only wish was that they could add a reprise verse to Tequila sunrise--one of my favs....it was just too short.<br>Another cool thing was the L.A. to S.D. coastal vibe....pure Cali connections going on for this native southern California state band from up the I-5; with no LA /SD disrespect going on.<br>Sure hope B keeps the promise to make San Diego an annual stop (at HOB !!)....especially with the new album coming out.",

"reviewcomment":"HOW I LOVE CRAB CATCHER OMG!<br>I am from Arizona so...seeing fresh seafood is justttt a dream. anywho!<br>I was on a road trip with my 2 girl friends and we made a very careful plans about where to go. <br>Crab Catcher was our dinner the first night. La Jolla is a beautiful area and the location of the restaurant is just perfect. We came in during Happy Hours and got at least 10 oyster shooters ( excuse us AZ girls just loveeee oyters), some martinis at the bar and then we moved to the table on the patio that directly faces the beach. the sunset was gorgeous. BUT this is the best part: FOOD!<br><br>My 2 girlfriends one got grilled salmon and the other one ordered grilled sea bass. I, on the other hand, don&#39;t like any type of grilled fish (I know, I&#39;m crazy), ordered CITRUS &amp; GARLIC BAJA TIGER SHRIMP, and let me tell you, one of the best dishes I&#39;ve had in my life. Just something about the citrus and garlic combined with grilled tiger shrimp create perfection. <br><br>Though my friends also said that their grilled fish were phenomenal too. And we&#39;re planning to make a trip to SD sometime this summer, and when we do. Crab Catcher is on our list again.<br><br>After I went back to AZ, I&#39;ve been trying the similar dish at any seafood restaurant I go to and none of them comes even close. <br><br>If you&#39;re a shrimp fan like me and have a chance to come to this place, you have to try it.",

Was super exited that Pb finally had a place with craft and classic cocktails! <br><br>Went in yesterday, with my sister, both of us coming from cocktail bars in SF, we loved it! I&#39;m so happy we have this as an option, rather than just another beach bar in PB. <br><br>They have an awesome cocktail list, spirit list, and amazing food. We tried the beet arugula bruschetta. It was delicious. I had several cocktails off their &#39;Cool Cocktails&#39; list: all of them very tasty. My favorite was &#39;The Paper Airplane&#39; with rye, Aperol, and sweet vermouth. Simple, but sooo good! <br>Our server, Andy, was also very attentive and sweet. All of the staff was pretty helpful, and also very attentive. I don&#39;t think I ever had an empty water glass in front of me.<br><br>The atmosphere is very chill, and they have a beautiful patio with greenery you can sit at. Beautiful and awesome decor. <br><br>Thanks guys for bringing The Patio to PB, you guys are definitely doing something right over there. You&#39;ll be seeing me again soon!",

I used to live in LA/OC and now SD, so I feel pretty strongly about that statement. <br><br>Ambience - simple, not too fancy, just right<br><br>Food - The food is the main story here! It&#39;s is delicious, all of it! First things first, they give everyone a bowl of daal to start which is delicious. Really a home made taste, just like my mom makes. Their main dishes are all good. This isn&#39;t like any other place, because they have unique flavors that are different from other Indian restaurant. That himalayan touch really makes a huge different. My favorite is the paneer tikka masala (note: I&#39;m vegetarian). It&#39;s creamy but balanced and appropriately spicy if you ask for it. And you have to get the garlic naan with it. But I also love the momos. They are really unique, light, and flavorful. Similar to dumplings. My husband loves the Chicken Makhani and the Goat when they have it. <br><br>Price - really reasonable.

"reviewcomment":"I love this place first and foremost because the upstairs patio has a spectacular view. Anytime of the day that you come here, its going to be an amazing sight. In the morning for brunch, in the evening for dinner, but especially during sunset when its happy hour. If you know anything about San Diego, you know it&#39;s got incredible pink, orange, purple, and blue sunsets that literally take your breath away. <br><br>The food is also really good - great burgers, juicy, big portions, crispy fries, lightly breaded calamari...really can&#39;t complain. Bring your sunglasses and a jacket for when it gets cold. Eat on the patio, seriously. If you&#39;re eating downstairs in the cave that is indoor seating, there is something seriously wrong with you (or you&#39;re a vamp). <br><br>The guys at the door checking ID are always really genuinely friendly. Their attitude, the amazing view, and the good food makes this place really easy to recommend to people visiting San Diego and looking for a good &#34;San Diego&#34; type place to eat and drink. <br><br>My only qualm is that they didn&#39;t honor happy hour on Memorial Day this Monday.

"reviewcomment":"Mo&#39;s has something for everyone, that&#39;s what I love about it. They are a gay establishment and truly give so much back to the LGBT community. 2nd reason I support Mo&#39;s, after the food. <br><br>They have good food--everything from burgers &amp; steak fries to low calorie chicken sandwiches to generous salads. I was pleasantly surprised when I ordered the salmon special!  Well prepared, tasty and a generous serving. <br><br>This place has deadly strong drinks! Not for the weak, that&#39;s for sure.  You think you&#39;re a hardcore drinker?? Try the fishbowl! $17 and you get the strongest AMF served in a fishbowl, includes a toy pet fish. <br><br>Sunday brunch is usually a very American style breakfast buffet. Pancakes, waffles, omelettes, etc. Note that the price &amp; wrist band includes bottomless mimosas!",

"reviewcomment":"Pork larb, spicy noodle, pad thai, mango sticky rice and thai ice tea - the regular dishes that comprises our dinner when we dine at Bangkok. The friendly, fast, efficient staff also makes for a great dining experience.<br><br>Pork larb is sooooo flavorful and spicy and is great in contrast with the lettuce wraps and cucumbers they give you to eat with. I love their Thai ice tea - not to sweet, even though it&#39;s a little heavy on the condensed milk for me. Spicy noodle is spicy and is loaded with your choice of meats. As for the mango sticky rice....I could come here and eat just that. The rice is the perfect blend of warm and sweetness and the mango is soft and juicy. Obviously the mangos taste better when the fruit is in season, so...grain of salt! <br><br>Generally speaking, portions are very generous and they don&#39;t skimp on quality. I&#39;ve come back here several times, and will continue to dine here. Great service, great food, and great prices.",

I had a party of 16 women and we all had such a wonderful time. <br><br>the owner and his wife rika had been in contact by email and phone to reserve the space and coordinate details. they allowed me to pre select the menu for my guests and provided a very special personalized menu that matched the decor of my party!<br>I was able to show up two hours beforehand to set up my decorations. that was awesome. <br>the food was great. esp the tot pots. <br><br>the service was exceptional. we had one male waiter can&#39;t remember his name ugh but he was very attentive and accommodating. <br><br>thank u so much empire house for helping us celebrate this special occasion!",

"reviewcomment":"I have actually eaten here on occasion, whenever there&#39;s time or whenever there&#39;s a birthday among my friends. I really enjoy their crepes, Belgian waffles, but especially their gelato.<br><br>Whenever I go here, I always order my usual white chocolate Belgian waffle with black sesame gelato. At first it seems like an odd combination, but it&#39;s really good and delicious! It doesn&#39;t hurt to try something new, right? Pricewise, Cafe Hue is okay. Most people would say it&#39;s cheap, but I say that it&#39;s just so-so because you can technically make all of their desserts yourself (except certain gelatos, unless you&#39;re a chef of some sort).<br><br>Overall, I think I wouldn&#39;t get sick of it, since that&#39;s the only good place with great tasting gelato. I wish there was more seating available as well, but I guess they have what they can work with.",

"reviewcomment":"GREAT EXPERIENCE!<br><br>I made a reservation for 24 people to celebrate my sisters bridal shower. We were seated immediately inside and our sever was fantastic! Victor was hilarious, friendly and made out brunch experience a breeze. He went above and beyond any service I&#39;ve ever had. <br><br>At brunch they offer a cappuccino machine for customers but my mom and aunts really wanted black coffee. Victor simply heard them utter the words coffee, and the next thing you know he says in his happy, positive and booming voice, &#34;You want coffee? I&#39;ll get you coffee!&#34; Not to mention he called himself &#34;The Candy man as he poured endless amounts champagne in our glasses throughout the 2 hours we were there. Victor clearly loves his job and enjoys making your time there the best. He also will give you a good history lesson on the WWI themed decor, with one little secret about the bathrooms.<br><br>The food was great! I was only craving waffles but lets be honest, my eyes were hungrier than my stomach! The desserts tasted homemade, but in the great way! Nothing store bought or bland! The plates are heavy and my mom dropped hers due to an hand injury, so if you&#39;ve got weak hands be sure to brunch with a buddy! My mom was so embarrassed but they were so kind and assured her that it was no big deal. Anyone who is kind to my mom wins big points with me!  <br><br>The outside area was the perfect place for photos and also kept my nieces entertained. Not only with the airplanes on display, the live ducks in the pond and the hills to run on. But also with the airplanes constantly landing and taking off from Montgomery Field. It&#39;s not at all annoying, it&#39;s actually quite incredible and the perfect addition to a beautiful clear day in San Diego!<br><br>Overall a great place. Make a reservation so you won&#39;t have to wait. It was a busy weekend due to SDSU graduations but our reservation saved us from waiting.",

Every one is friendly and seem happy to be working there. <br>If you&#39;re going to eat here and have never been here before order the Lamb Burger. Has pickled beets and mint jelly that BLOW YOUR MIND with flavor. Super delicious. Get some fries! The sweet potato are really good but the regular ones have sugar, salt and pepper on them! <br>Overall one of my favorite places to eat and drink. Try it.

The dishes are extremely fresh, flavorful, and spiced just the way you want (we have one &#34;zero&#34; and one &#34;3-4 medium&#34; in our house - and each time it&#39;s perfect).<br><br>The menu is a little limited - and that&#39;s actually a good thing imho - they don&#39;t try to have &#34;everything&#34; but focus on doing a smaller number of dishes to perfection. The monthly specials keep things interesting. We eat there at least once if not twice a week and it&#39;s always wonderful. Pad Ped (beef) is so tender and flavorful, Bai Grapow (chicken) has a perfect kick to it. The spring rolls are so crispy and fresh - without any kind of &#34;heavy&#34; or &#34;greasy&#34; feel. I could go on, but now I&#39;m too hungry to type :) <br><br>The seating is definitely limited - but not an issue for us as take-away customers. <br><br>The owners and their staff are not only great restaurateurs, but great friendly neighbors - we are so happy to see the success that they are having!",

For dinner, my husband ordered the Cajun pasta, he was in love with it. And I had the beer chicken (I can&#39;t remember what the exact name is) but it was great too. I love that they did not skimp on the food portions... like most restaurants (ex BJs). Lastly my husband and I shared 1 of each of the mini desserts, they were all great! Our favorite was the apple bread pudding! Next time, I&#39;m just ordering that!<br><br>I will gladly come here again!",

"reviewcomment":"Came her one night for restaurant week with my boyfriend. This place has the cutest decor, vintage and whimsical lighting with cool designs on the wall (mini painted bookshelf! So cute) <br><br>Our waiter was really helpful in suggesting what to order once we heard our likes and dislikes in certain foods. We ordered a wine flight, great selection! I ended up getting the lamb which was delicious! I like lamb but normally don&#39;t order it myself, but I&#39;m glad I did. We also had the Vietnamese meatballs, stew, and my favorite part dessert: bread pudding and the Brooklyn girl brownie. Both delicious! The brownies super chocolatey for all you chocolate lovers. <br><br>I docked a star however because the seats are way too close and you could hear other people&#39;s conversations or people were always bumping into each other&#39;s tables which is kind of bothersome. I&#39;m all about the entire eating experience so the proximity of other groups was definitely a downer.",

"reviewcomment":"This place is the best Indian/Himalayan restaurant in SoCal! I used to live in LA/OC and now SD, so I feel pretty strongly about that statement. <br><br>Ambience - simple, not too fancy, just right<br><br>Food - The food is the main story here! It&#39;s is delicious, all of it! First things first, they give everyone a bowl of daal to start which is delicious. Really a home made taste, just like my mom makes. Their main dishes are all good. This isn&#39;t like any other place, because they have unique flavors that are different from other Indian restaurant. That himalayan touch really makes a huge different. My favorite is the paneer tikka masala (note: I&#39;m vegetarian). It&#39;s creamy but balanced and appropriately spicy if you ask for it. And you have to get the garlic naan with it. But I also love the momos. They are really unique, light, and flavorful. Similar to dumplings. My husband loves the Chicken Makhani and the Goat when they have it. <br><br>Price - really reasonable. It makes for an affordable night out with big portions.",

"reviewcomment":"Sandwich heaven. What if you&#39;re not even craving a sandwich? You&#39;ll crave one all the time after you experience Board &amp; Brew!<br><br>It was a bit hard to find parking since it&#39;s located off the main street, so we had to park in a nearby neighborhood and walk ~5 minutes. I got here around 12:30p so the line was out the door. I wasn&#39;t too sure what all the hype was about but I knew that the line out the door definitely meant I was about to experience something legendary.<br><br>I checked Yelp and the consensus seemed to be the Turkado sandwich so I ordered that! While I was ordering, the cashier asked if I wanted the sauce on the side. Naturally, as a first timer, I hesitated and before I had time to answer, he responded &#34;I think you do. You won&#39;t regret it&#34; and so I went with it. <br><br>Despite the line out the door, I got my sandwich in under 8 minutes! My friend and I luckily found some seats out in the back and when I finally got to my sandwich, it was surprisingly LOADED. There were LAYERS UPON LAYERS of thinly-sliced, extremely tender and juicy turkey with a thick slab of fresh avocado on top. They do NOT skimp out on anything here. The orange sauce was tasty and just enough sweet so that it  complemented the savory flavors of the sandwich perfectly. <br><br>TL;DR:<br>Food: 5/5<br>Price: $<br>Service: 5/5",

"reviewcomment":"I&#39;d been to Bombay Restaurant 3-4 times prior to my wedding, impressed each time, great menu, great atmosphere, however it&#39;s my experience with their catering that really impressed me.<br><br>We hired the Monsoon Group, owners of Bombay Restaurant to cater our wedding and I can&#39;t relay how happy I was with our choice. Rakesh Popat may be one of the nicest people I&#39;ve ever met, the tasting meetings to select our menu were presented very professionally, the food was amazing, hard to narrow down all the choices.<br><br>Quick story to illustrate how much Rakesh wants your event to go off well, my printer flipped out so we were trying to print last minute replacement table cards for our wedding happening the next day, running around town, no print shop would do it due to issues with the type of card stock, and in a conversation regarding something else, he heard our dilemma and he offered to let us swing by and use his restaurant printer which he uses to do this same task for his events, before they were even open!<br><br>The wedding itself went flawlessly, one major thing I wanted people to remember was the food, that will leave a favorable impression about the whole experience in my opinion. The food was amazing, everyone raved about it, and nothing ran out.  We went buffet style and were impressed by how many people came back for 2-3 passes. The fact that a largely Indian crowd were impressed definitely means something.<br><br>One thing you need to keep in mind before trying this place is that it&#39;s largely a non-traditional menu, if you want the same Indian food that every restaurant serves and tastes the same way, you might be disappointed. They put their spin on traditional recipes, it&#39;s very unique, has a professionally trained chef sort of feel, in my opinion it&#39;s amazing and my favorite Indian style restaurant.<br><br>I don&#39;t review often, so you know it&#39;s warranted when I do, good or bad.",

"reviewcomment":"Best Japanese restaurant in San Diego. <br><br>The first two times I came here were both for dinner. Definitely pricier compared to their inexpensive lunch menu, but you can try a wider range of items.<br><br>This place is small and the seating is very cozy. They have a bar area, which you are usually seated in if you come with just one or two people. Plus side: Wooooo, party of one!!! You don&#39;t look sad and lonely eating at a table by yourself. <br><br>GET THE BLACK SESAME ICE CREAM. This is homemade and you can really taste the density and richness of the sesame flavor. It&#39;s so good I was obnoxious enough to ask if they would sell me a tub despite knowing that answer would probably be no. (Yeah, no bulk orders.) This is also served during lunch.<br><br>The most memorable item on their dinner menu was their quick seared beef. I&#39;m a pretty fast eater, but I made sure to close my eyes in between slow bites of this dish to really try and stop time. So. Good. <br><br>For lunch, the menu is more bento style as you pick the main dish which comes with two sides (random), miso soup, and rice. No worries, this is still very authentic and doesn&#39;t come with the fake grass and slice of orange. Lunch is closer to a 4/5 as it&#39;s still really good, but it doesn&#39;t pack the extra punch to take it to 5 stars like certain items on their dinner menu. My favorite for lunch is their Japanese Style BBQ beef. I also hear mackerel is really good. Don&#39;t forget to get the black sesame ice cream after! Note: Lunch is cash only! <br><br>The only item here I would not recommend personally is their pudding with black honey. I&#39;ll get anything with the word honey in it, but this tasted cheap and kind of funny to me. <br><br>I need to end this review on a high note, so YES, try their beef and black sesame ice cream! If you&#39;re on a budget, the lunch is good and inexpensive!",

I&#39;ve tried soondubu at least in 5 different restaurants but none is better than convoy tofu house. I also love their banchan that they served. My favorites are definitely the picked cucumbers and potatoes. For less than $10, you get endless banchan, soondubu of your choice, egg and steamed rice. They also serve my favorite barely tea (cold) free of charge. The other items here are a bit pricey but I mainly come here for their soft tofu. <br><br>Highly recommend:<br>- Mixed soft tofu stew that contains beef, clams, shrimp and mushrooms<br><br>You have the option of choosing how spicy you want it. Just letting you, their spice level are not too spicy. I usually can barely handle mild at other restaurants here but I get the regular/medium spice level here and its perfect for me. When you get your soondubu, you might think &#34;oh this is not going to fill me up&#34; but trust me, it will with all the endless banchan and steamed rice! <br><br>Service is great.

I pictured it around a park, somewhere you can walk after eating. <br><br>The food portions are big. I had the eggs bennies and he had the skillet (I think thats what he had). You need to have a BIG appetite to come here. The bennies needed a bit more hollandaise sauce but I got more as soon as I asked.<br><br>The place is small with limited outdoor seating so make sure to reserve a spot-- there were a couple of people lined up after we left.  We had our reservation at noon and were about 15 min late and there was no fuzz at all, we did not wait to be seated. <br><br>The place is cute, the food is great, and service is on key.

"reviewcomment":"South Bay born and raised, so I have some standards for both Mexican and Vietnamese food. There used to be a little hole in the wall place off of Broadway in Chula Vista that made the best broth for pho tai nam gan sach, and the noodles never stuck together in that annoying way that makes them break into chunks if you take it to go. This place reminds me of them.<br><br>There&#39;s a hundred other reviews on here saying the same thing- pho is largely about how they make the broth, followed by the quality of their meats. Pho Hoa gives you huge quantities of good quality beef (can honestly say I like it enough that I&#39;ve never tried the chicken, though the tofu is enjoyable if unsurprising), and the broth is both unique and excellent. <br><br>There are a dozen other pho shops around this part of town, but this is my favorite. Stop in and enjoy.",

"reviewcomment":"This place is the best Indian/Himalayan restaurant in SoCal! I used to live in LA/OC and now SD, so I feel pretty strongly about that statement. <br><br>Ambience - simple, not too fancy, just right<br><br>Food - The food is the main story here! It&#39;s is delicious, all of it! First things first, they give everyone a bowl of daal to start which is delicious. Really a home made taste, just like my mom makes. Their main dishes are all good. This isn&#39;t like any other place, because they have unique flavors that are different from other Indian restaurant. That himalayan touch really makes a huge different. My favorite is the paneer tikka masala (note: I&#39;m vegetarian). It&#39;s creamy but balanced and appropriately spicy if you ask for it. And you have to get the garlic naan with it. But I also love the momos. They are really unique, light, and flavorful. Similar to dumplings. My husband loves the Chicken Makhani and the Goat when they have it. <br><br>Price - really reasonable. It makes for an affordable night out with big portions.",

"reviewcomment":"This is definitely not the most quiet hotel. We were on the 18th floor and I continued to here noise throughout our entire stay. It wasn&#39;t horrible and partially to be expected but not quiet.<br><br>The valet parking proved to be exceptional and totally worth it. We used the text option to obtain the vehicle and each and every time (and there were many) the car was down stairs and waiting for us just as we exited the front of the hotel. This service was superior and credit should really be given to the gentleman working out there. Very much appreciated!<br><br>Check in was easy, our room was tidy - the hallway and some of the mirrors could have used additional cleaning on the way to the room.<br><br>We checked in for one night, in town for the Rock n Roll marathon event and I must say of all the hotels I&#39;ve stayed in while traveling for races this hotel was the most attentive to runners needs. Sunday morning upon exiting they had bottled water, granola bars and safety pins out front. I surely could have used the granola bar since I skipped my pre race brekke but I passed. I did need water to fill my running water bottles with so for that I was so grateful. At other times, other than after 9P there was fresh water with cups, green apples and the local paper. I like that they also had an ipad connected to a printer in the lobby for printing boarding passes (not that I needed to use this, this trip but easier than having to go to a business center just to check in/ print).<br><br>When we checked out later Sunday afternoon, they had runners results color printed with and stamped with a Congrats stamp. This was a very thoughtful touch which I appreciated. When a hotel takes those extra steps while you are traveling for a purpose or with children etc. it really does go a long way.<br><br>I wouldn&#39;t rule out staying here in the future. Decent rate, great King beds, hip lobby, good looking clientele, small pool, decent workout room. <br><br>I&#39;d recommend this location for sure.",

I don&#39;t really recommend bringing the kiddos because people are walking back and forth between the *extremely hot* grill with knives, forks and hot plates.

I really love coming here for the lunch special, which is just under $8 before tax and tips for 1) free lentil soup 2) two items/curries 3) rice and 4) naan. I mean, what a deal! I have also gotten the food to-go before and they still honor the deal even if you don&#39;t dine in. BTW the portions for lunch are HUGEEEEEEE. I always manage to make two meals out of one combo order (so basically it&#39;s like two $4 meals... awesomeeeeee)...<br><br>The only downside is that dinner pricing goes up dramatically from the lunch price, and the portions and options are really not that different from lunch.

It really is. <br>I asked myself if I would host my reception here, and in the privacy of my own mind, I said no. <br>I didn&#39;t like the room lay out, much. The bride had 130 in attendance and their was a 1/2 wall dividing the better half of the room, we couldn&#39;t really see anything ie- the speeches or the first dances. The crowd thickened around the spotlight dancers and their wasn&#39;t an easy way to see. I want to be the center attention on my day and not have my guests standing on chairs to see me.  - we couldn&#39;t hear for that matter, either. maybe it was the speakers I don&#39;t know. I wasn&#39;t impressed.<br><br>The servers were incredibly kind and polite. I enjoyed a lobster bisque and seafood crepes. . The bisque wasn&#39;t as pleasing as previous reviews quoted. The chef went too heavy on the nutmeg (maybe)? <br>I only knocked down one star as the room was not fitted for a large crowd, in my opinion.

"reviewcomment":"O.M.F.G.<br><br>I was in town on business, and my friend was trying to get us into Sushi Ota for a same day reservation, but they only had 5:30 and 9:30 available.  He knew that Yoshi was originally a chef at Sushi Ota, so we were able to get seats at the bar at 7:30pm no problem.<br><br>I can&#39;t explain how happy I am that we got this reservation.  This was easily one of the absolute best sushi experiences of my life.  I&#39;ve had sushi all over the US from business travel, have been to Nobu, Morimoto, and more places in between than I can remember, but this is one that will never be forgotten.  <br><br>Yoshi was our chef for the evening (we had seats right in front of him).  We started off with the jalapeno yellowtail, and from there, we just told Yoshi to make us whatever he wanted and we&#39;d eat it.   We had amberjack (a little salty), octopus carpaccio (never had it raw before and it was great), another jalapeno/cilantro topped roll with a spicy green sauce, another roll that was topped with diced jalapeno (I put some pictures up).  Another that was crab/avocado surrounded by tuna and salmon, with big ball of avocado wrapped tuna and salmon in the center (Yoshi Special?  Many pics up here of it, including mine).   Everything was great, and that&#39;s putting it mildly.  I wish I knew the names of everything we had, but we just ate what he gave us.<br><br>We had ordered a full bottle of Geikkeikan sake, and were drinking it with Yoshi, when we asked him for something crazy off the menu.  We simply specified no mackerel or uni.  So, out he comes with two live shrimp, takes the tail out and prepares is as sashimi, and decoratively puts the still kicking heads on our plates.  After eating the tail, they take the head to the back and flash fry it, and bring it back to be eaten in some sauce, eyeballs, guts, and all.   Cross that one off the bucket list.<br><br>Usually at most sushi places, I get a miso, but we never bothered with that here.  The wasabi was barely touched.  Yoshi was telling us to not use soy sauce with what he was serving us, and he was not wrong.  Only one thing we got did he say to use it, and that was the one time the soy sauce and wasabi got touched.<br><br>Fantastic meal, chef, and ambiance.   Like Shiro in Novi, MI, this is a place I would always come back to.",

"reviewcomment":"This place is the best Indian/Himalayan restaurant in SoCal! I used to live in LA/OC and now SD, so I feel pretty strongly about that statement. <br><br>Ambience - simple, not too fancy, just right<br><br>Food - The food is the main story here! It&#39;s is delicious, all of it! First things first, they give everyone a bowl of daal to start which is delicious. Really a home made taste, just like my mom makes. Their main dishes are all good. This isn&#39;t like any other place, because they have unique flavors that are different from other Indian restaurant. That himalayan touch really makes a huge different. My favorite is the paneer tikka masala (note: I&#39;m vegetarian). It&#39;s creamy but balanced and appropriately spicy if you ask for it. And you have to get the garlic naan with it. But I also love the momos. They are really unique, light, and flavorful. Similar to dumplings. My husband loves the Chicken Makhani and the Goat when they have it. <br><br>Price - really reasonable. It makes for an affordable night out with big portions.",

The quinn roll. It&#39;s supreme. Also try the veggie gyoza (pockets of deliciousness). But really, honestly, I&#39;ve never been disappointed by anything here at Ebisu.

I was a little disappointed by the menu. This place is a lot like a Fridays or red Robin with a raunchy, crass feel...which is cool.<br><br>I guess the deal is that the servers are all rude...but our guy was pretty tame. In fact I&#39;m ruder to my customers on a daily basis! I wanted him to be ruder. In my thinking, if I was rude back, then he would get ruder...it didn&#39;t work. Much to my disappointment. To his defense he was a food server and a lot of fun. <br><br>Would be nice if the food was a bit more &#34;upscale&#34;. <br><br>Everyone should go here at least once!",

"reviewcomment":"So I was preparing my yelp review in my head as I sat in the restaurant - and it seemed a solid 4 stars. Cute decor, attentive waitstaff, varied menu and drink options. I was a bummed about the pricing - drinks a couple bucks more than I&#39;d have preferred, and entrees for close to 30 - so my group decided to do a bunch of appetizers and treat it like tapas. <br><br>What a surprise when the apps came out and they were all huge! One of those could definitely make up your main course, and bumps them up to five stars. I can only imagine how big the entrees are! We got the duck (delish), shortrib agnolotti (solid), burrata and tomato salad (so excellent), scallops (melt-in-your-mouth) and baked brie (decadent). Was full and happy by the end of the meal, so I&#39;ll have to come back to hit up the chocolate bread pudding.",

"reviewcomment":"This place is the best Indian/Himalayan restaurant in SoCal! I used to live in LA/OC and now SD, so I feel pretty strongly about that statement. <br><br>Ambience - simple, not too fancy, just right<br><br>Food - The food is the main story here! It&#39;s is delicious, all of it! First things first, they give everyone a bowl of daal to start which is delicious. Really a home made taste, just like my mom makes. Their main dishes are all good. This isn&#39;t like any other place, because they have unique flavors that are different from other Indian restaurant. That himalayan touch really makes a huge different. My favorite is the paneer tikka masala (note: I&#39;m vegetarian). It&#39;s creamy but balanced and appropriately spicy if you ask for it. And you have to get the garlic naan with it. But I also love the momos. They are really unique, light, and flavorful. Similar to dumplings. My husband loves the Chicken Makhani and the Goat when they have it. <br><br>Price - really reasonable. It makes for an affordable night out with big portions.",

I walked in and noticed the menu only had a few items on it. But I decided to still try it out since it had 4.5 stars. <br><br>I ordered the avocado BLT. The sandwich comes grilled and on sourdough. The owner (who was amazingly helpful) asked me if I wanted to make it a combo. He said they are known for their teas and let me try two. Both amazing, I got the green tea. He outer options were sesame slaw or fruit!! <br><br>When I received my order I was amazed by the quantity and quality of the food. Everything was so delicious and fresh.

We were able to be seated by the window and our order was taken quickly and our food arrived within 15 minutes! Buddha burger- amazing! The salad was a wonderful medley of shredded beets, carrots, cucumbers and fresh greens and the lemon tahini was to die for! The pea curry was a delicious and filling entree, and it also comes with a choice of soup or house salad. <br><br>The prana tea was awesome and invigorating, and you get on free refill on drinks! Lastly the chocolate mousse cake -- woo!! so rich and melting in your mouth. Good to share for two. <br><br>I had a coupon from pilgrimage of the heart yoga studio, and the staff even gave us an extra 10 percent off for being part of the local wellness collective! All in all, I was very impressed and I will happily go back! Bravo :)",

I ordered a salmon on rye, which was one of the best seafood sandwiches I&#39;ve ever had -- the salmon was freshly grilled (and not overcooked), the rye bread was warm and soft inside while crunchy on the outside, and the sauerkraut eliminates the filling-feeling of fish oil which was a perfect combination. =)",

"reviewcomment":"I took my sister here for her birthday.  I took her to a lot of places during her birthday week, but she wanted to try something new for the exact day of her birthday.  So I went online, joined Club Fondue, and I called in ahead for the birthday package.  Someone told me this place was for special occasions, and it was!  She came to her table with beautifully handwritten letter made out to her from the Melting Pot, with balloons, streamers, and the whole package.  They even had a rose prepared for her as she came in!  <br><br>The service was great from the moment we entered, and we tried the four course meal.  We had to eat slowly so we could eat everything, but we slowly had the new garlic and Herb Quartet Cheese Fondue.  I have to recommended this item on their &#34;Fondue Features&#34; menu.  Then we had our Fouse Salad and Caprese Salad, both which were welcomed after having as much cheese fondue as we could.  We needed to take it slow, or we would be stuffed before the 3rd course!  We then chose our entrees, the Land and Sea and The Classic cooked in the Caq Au Vin, which was perfect for our main entree.  I loved how they gave us the &#34;search and rescue&#34; spoon, which definitely came in handy!  Everything tasted great with the Presecco bubbly we had throughout the night.<br><br>We then had the Dark Chocolate Marscarpone, which tasted great with everything!  As we started our dessert, they came with chocolate covered strawberries and a candle on the plate, which my sister shared with me.  They are to good enough to die for!  Since I was a Club Fondue member, they also gave her a package of 6 chocolate covered strawberries to take home, which made the night even better.  As we walked back to the hotel, everyone wished her happy birthday thanks to the beautiful balloon arrangement they made, and it was surely a night she wouldn&#39;t forget.  To top it off, they gave her us a military discount since she was heading to see her husband who was stationed overseas.  He couldn&#39;t be there, but The Melting Pot and I made sure she had a great night.  <br><br>If you&#39;re looking for a place to go for a special occasion, look no further.  All around us during the night, we heard servers say &#34;Happy Birthday&#34; or &#34;Happy Anniversary&#34; so we knew that we were not alone in celebrating her big day.  I will definitely come back here again, and try their 5 for $5 happy hour deal, which looks too good to pass!",

Obv beef is the traditional thing but for me a chicken pho is equally comforting.... <br>The meat is ample and they give enough basil, sprouts, jalapeños and ginger sauce... <br>The best when San Diego get a little too chilly to handle... Or if I have a cold... <br>Have tried pho at other places in La Jolla and in Kearny Mesa but this one is my fav...<br><br>PS: I have tried their main dishes too but did not find them so amusing...

"reviewcomment":"This place is the best Indian/Himalayan restaurant in SoCal! I used to live in LA/OC and now SD, so I feel pretty strongly about that statement. <br><br>Ambience - simple, not too fancy, just right<br><br>Food - The food is the main story here! It&#39;s is delicious, all of it! First things first, they give everyone a bowl of daal to start which is delicious. Really a home made taste, just like my mom makes. Their main dishes are all good. This isn&#39;t like any other place, because they have unique flavors that are different from other Indian restaurant. That himalayan touch really makes a huge different. My favorite is the paneer tikka masala (note: I&#39;m vegetarian). It&#39;s creamy but balanced and appropriately spicy if you ask for it. And you have to get the garlic naan with it. But I also love the momos. They are really unique, light, and flavorful. Similar to dumplings. My husband loves the Chicken Makhani and the Goat when they have it. <br><br>Price - really reasonable. It makes for an affordable night out with big portions.",

They put very generous amounts of salmon on top which i really enjoy. <br><br>Customer service was good and the girls have a lil bit sense of humor by stating out loud that the table was too small for such big plates.

"reviewcomment":"I&#39;m a Benihana fan. It&#39;s a chain, but it&#39;s a chain that definitely knows how to appeal to the intrigue of white America. We&#39;re easily suckered by bastardized Asian fare and cheesy circus-like performances.<br><br>I recently visited this location for a friend&#39;s graduation celebration. Reservations are highly recommended, otherwise you will undoubtedly be waiting outside for an undetermined amount of time (likely until after the height of prime-time dinner rush). Teppanyaki meals are usually entertaining. While waiting for our chef to arrive we were watching the chef at another table perform, for a lack of a better word. That chef had to contend with a table full of douchebags, but I realized he had no issues with that because he was as a big of a douche as they were. Part of the suspense and entertainment value is not necessarily what tricks the chef will perform; rather, it&#39;s who, exactly, will you be getting as your chef.  <br><br>Our chef arrived. While he was a nice enough guy and cooked everything well, he seemed to lack a little enthusiasm. Perhaps he was a bit tired/jaded. Nevertheless, everything he put out in front of me was gobbled up. I finished everything on my plate.<br><br>The CHICKEN FRIED RICE is one of my favorite parts of the meal. It&#39;s an upgrade option from steamed rice,  but well worth the modest difference in price.<br><br>I had the HIBACHI SALMON with AVOCADO TARTAR SAUCE. Superb. Again, salmon was cooked nicely, and the accouterments were lovely. I would certainly order this again.  Large portion.<br><br>I believe all of the entrees come with soup, salad and a shrimp appetizer (very small portion). The soup, as Brian K. indicated, was not very memorable; near flavorless. The salad, however, while out of a bag, makes up for the lackluster soup with its superb ginger dressing. Slathering that ginger dressing on anything will make it palatable. <br><br>Overall, a nice experience. It can be a little pricey, but the entertainment value makes it well worth it.",

I have also tried their fried shrimp po boy sandwich and waffle fries, which were delicious. The outdoor seating has a great San Diego ambiance especially before a Padres game. <br><br>I will definitely be back soon :)",

"reviewcomment":"Came to this spot after checking out some prints a few stores down at Aztec graphics. <br><br>This spot has a killer happy hour every day from 3-6 pm $2.50 pints (Tower Ten IPA is where it&#39;s at) and 2$ appetizer specials. Phial poppers, and curry puff are both excellent. I decided to go with their katsu curry option (Hot), and I was not disappointed. <br><br>I like their presentation. A pyramid of rice (white or brown) then you have a nice curry moat around it, with sliced chicken katsu on top. I especially love it since their curry has chunks of carrots and potatoes. It has plenty of spice, and flavor, a must have. I stop by now every time I go to Aztec graphics, a new ritual of mine.",

During a recent visit, I tried the Western Burger that had a veggie patty topped with onion rings, bacon and barbecue sauce... SOOOO good. I almost felt like I was cheating eating this! <br><br>The food is a little pricey (my burger was $10+), but in my opinion, definitely worth it. I haven&#39;t tried anything like the burgers here at similar establishments. <br><br>Service was friendly; the restaurant has surfer-bohemian type decor and a really nice vibe -- the little Buddha and stick of sage in the bathroom may have had something to do with that. ;-) <br><br>It definitely will be on the top of my list whenever I&#39;m in the mood for burgers.",

I used to live in LA/OC and now SD, so I feel pretty strongly about that statement. <br><br>Ambience - simple, not too fancy, just right<br><br>Food - The food is the main story here! It&#39;s is delicious, all of it! First things first, they give everyone a bowl of daal to start which is delicious. Really a home made taste, just like my mom makes. Their main dishes are all good. This isn&#39;t like any other place, because they have unique flavors that are different from other Indian restaurant. That himalayan touch really makes a huge different. My favorite is the paneer tikka masala (note: I&#39;m vegetarian). It&#39;s creamy but balanced and appropriately spicy if you ask for it. And you have to get the garlic naan with it. But I also love the momos. They are really unique, light, and flavorful. Similar to dumplings. My husband loves the Chicken Makhani and the Goat when they have it. <br><br>Price - really reasonable. It makes for an affordable night out with big portions.",

"reviewcomment":"The best NY Style in San Diego!  When I moved her 3 years ago from the East Coast, I found my regular pizza joint at Bronx Pizza (see my review).  I thought that was the closest SD could get to what I am accustomed to in NJ and NY, and I still go there frequently when I want to change things up, but this is my #1.  The pizza is always baked to perfection, great sauce, and great toppings.  At Bronx, you can&#39;t get pineapple and other things I like as a change up on occasion, but Luigis has everything.  My favorite specialty pies are the Capone and Leonardo, but let&#39;s break it down by the numbers:<br><br>Value: 7.  $14.50 for a cheese pie.<br>Atmosphere: 9. cool art and decor, and they have a wall of current concert flyers<br>Speed: 9.  Never more than 20 minutes for it to be ready, but sometimes the line at the counter can be slow when walk-ins try to decide what slices they want.<br>Appearance: 10.  See exhibit A.  Doesn&#39;t that slice look delicious!<br>Taste:<br>- Sauce: 8 - full flavor, not sweet.  I don&#39;t like sweet tomato sauce.<br>- Cheese  - 8. Stretches when hot, and doesn&#39;t slide off the pizza!<br>- Crust - 9.  Bakes up crispy, and doesn&#39;t become a soggy mess.  You often have to break it to fold it.<br><br>Luigi&#39;s also has a great beer selection.  And when they messed my order a couple weeks ago, they gave me the mess up pie, and the one I ordered, for less than the price of 1!  And offered me a drink while I waited!  Now that&#39;s how you earn long term customers!",

The service is great and the food is even better. My roommate and I both eat gluten-free and for only $2 more, we can get our pasta dishes gluten-free (they only have a gluten-free penne). The restaurant is decorated like a little Italian village (hence the name). Our friends say that the bread and olive oil they give you at the dinner table is absolutely amazing. Mimmo&#39;s is our go-to place when we have friends and family visiting because we know that we will always get a delicious dish. My roommate&#39;s boyfriend thinks that his mother makes the best Chicken Piccatta but after eating at Mimmo&#39;s, he says that Mimmo&#39;s is pretty darn comparable!

That&#39;s how good they are. Wait times can get pretty lengthy so best to make reservations. <br><br>Curries: Thick, and packed full of flavor like you would expect. Serving size is adequate, you may need to order an extra bowl of rice though as it really opens up your appetite.<br><br>Noodles: All their noodles are on the sweeter side so you may want to up your spicy level by 1 to offset their brown sauce. <br><br>Their mango sticky rice is awesome, the coconut milk they use isn&#39;t too sweet and the rice is always the right texture.<br><br>Food is amazing, service is great. This is my go-to Thai place even though I live 40minutes away.",

"reviewcomment":"My girlfriend took me here for his birthday and we sat on the outside patio. The view was amazing but it did get kind of windy and need the heaters on. <br><br>We started off with the Jumbo Lump Crab Cake and the Fiji Apple Salad, split the Filet Mignon, and got a side of Truffled Macaroni and Cheese and Brussels Sprouts. The food was great but what really blew me away was the amazing service we had. Right when I sat down they handed me a birthday card and all the busboys and expo&#39;s that helped us throughout the night  all said happy birthday to me at least once. Danielle was our server and she did an amazing job and really did make me feel special on my birthday. I highly recommend this restaurant for any special occasion or just a beautiful night out.",

"reviewcomment":"I love coffee shops in old houses/buildings and this is another favorite. Great vibe in there and lovely and quiet out on their little patio. We didn&#39;t attempt to bring our dogs on the patio, so I&#39;m not sure if they&#39;re allowed, but it&#39;s a fairly small area so maybe better to leave them at home for this one. <br><br>Both our coffees were delicious. We stopped by in the evening so all the &#34;good&#34; pastries were pretty much sold out. I mean, they still had brownies and cookies that looked delicious, but we wanted something a little different and the guy said they&#39;d sold out earlier in the day. No problem. No worries. Totally our fault. <br><br>I&#39;d love to come back again for another relaxing Sunday evening on their porch. I can&#39;t wait.",

The portions are a good size and it&#39;s a very intimate, QUICK place to dine at before seeing a nearby movie.<br><br>The best thing is the customer service - we came recently prior to a film and the owner is just fantastic. He&#39;s funny and very customer-service oriented. He seated us by the best seat in the house - by the window.  And, he also helped me supplement with non-soy based meals due to soy sensitivities. My favorite is the chicken and plum sauce and my bf loved the potatoes. When trying to figure out where to go on a Saturday, definitely go local and go here!",

It was literally ONE happy hour because I get off at 5. LOL. <br><br>Buttt, I ordered the flat bread (which changes in toppings on a daily basis), and the fish tacos. Both were amazzzzzing! Full of flavor and even better knowing that it comes fresh from their very own little farm! Both were pretty good prices. And I also got a $5 glass of chardonnay. <br><br>THE best part? The desssserrt! We ordered the mini banana cream pie and let me tell ya, it&#39;s not mini. It&#39;s a good portion of dessert. It was sooo good, and mind you, I&#39;m not big on bananas or majorly sweet desserts. This dessert was PERFECT!<br><br>The service was awesome. The staff was super friendly. You guys get five stars!

"reviewcomment":"This place is the best Indian/Himalayan restaurant in SoCal! I used to live in LA/OC and now SD, so I feel pretty strongly about that statement. <br><br>Ambience - simple, not too fancy, just right<br><br>Food - The food is the main story here! It&#39;s is delicious, all of it! First things first, they give everyone a bowl of daal to start which is delicious. Really a home made taste, just like my mom makes. Their main dishes are all good. This isn&#39;t like any other place, because they have unique flavors that are different from other Indian restaurant. That himalayan touch really makes a huge different. My favorite is the paneer tikka masala (note: I&#39;m vegetarian). It&#39;s creamy but balanced and appropriately spicy if you ask for it. And you have to get the garlic naan with it. But I also love the momos. They are really unique, light, and flavorful. Similar to dumplings. My husband loves the Chicken Makhani and the Goat when they have it. <br><br>Price - really reasonable. It makes for an affordable night out with big portions.",

"reviewcomment":"Yum yum soul food! Bonnie Jean&#39;s was one of my Yelp bookmarks ever since I moved to SD in 2010. My bf and I came here for dinner one night and we were very happy with our fried chicken meal! It&#39;s a little hard to find when it&#39;s dark but when you walk in, you step into a happy place of chicken yumminess. <br><br>We came in around 6ish pm. No one was in the restaurant and the staff looked like they were preparing to clean up. However, the sign says open till 7pm so they seated us and took our order. Even though we were the only ones there, service never made us feel rushed and our food came out at a reasonable time.<br><br>The chicken and waffles were tasty and we liked all the sides we ordered. Def recommend this place for affordable and great fried chicken in SD!",

Try the &#34;make you own&#34; California burrito and breakfast burrito, either way you go you&#39;ll be happy. In the mood for a taco, the hard shell tacos are awesome! <br><br>If your in the area and want some good Mexican food, then Taco Surf is the spot for you! Check it out, surfs up!<br><br>Nick",

"reviewcomment":"We had lunch here the other day when we ventured down to San Diego. We were looking for a place to eat while we were roaming around Old Town, and decided to stop by. The decor is cute and cultural, and the waitress we had was very attentive to our needs. When you sit down, they start you off with a basket of chips and salsa, and if you&#39;re not careful, you&#39;ll get full off of those because they are absolutely delicious. We had to ask for seconds.<br><br>I ordered two cheese enchiladas, and my boyfriend got a carne asada burrito. The tortilla on both of our meals were a little overcooked, but the meat in the burrito was very tasty, and the cheese and red sauce on my enchiladas were pretty good. The rice and beans didn&#39;t really stand out from any other mexican restaurant, though.<br><br>We&#39;ll probably come back here next time we&#39;re in town for the chips and salsa.",

We weren&#39;t dressed that good but saw on Yelp that it was casual. Not a problem, we were welcomed warmly. <br><br>They bring out bread that is stuffed with fresh melted mozzarella with a dipping sauce. Oh my goodness. So good. They also brought out water glasses with thinly sliced cucumber. Very different. Gives the water a nice taste. <br><br>We started out with Minestone soup. Fresh vegetables and pasta. What can I say but really good. I had the orecchiette Bosco with minced fresh sausage and a really good red sauce.  Excellent. Very tasty. My wife had the spaghetti con Polpette with two huge meatballs and fresh mozzarella. The meatballs were melt in your mouth goodness. Very good dish. <br><br>The service was really good. Water cups were filled promptly and our food came in a timely manner. I would have to say that was probably one of the bet Italian meals I&#39;ve had. <br><br>Only problem with this place is that there is no parking. Only street parking, but free. <br><br>Good food and good service. Enjoy and indulge.",

I used to live in LA/OC and now SD, so I feel pretty strongly about that statement. <br><br>Ambience - simple, not too fancy, just right<br><br>Food - The food is the main story here! It&#39;s is delicious, all of it! First things first, they give everyone a bowl of daal to start which is delicious. Really a home made taste, just like my mom makes. Their main dishes are all good. This isn&#39;t like any other place, because they have unique flavors that are different from other Indian restaurant. That himalayan touch really makes a huge different. My favorite is the paneer tikka masala (note: I&#39;m vegetarian). It&#39;s creamy but balanced and appropriately spicy if you ask for it. And you have to get the garlic naan with it. But I also love the momos. They are really unique, light, and flavorful. Similar to dumplings. My husband loves the Chicken Makhani and the Goat when they have it. <br><br>Price - really reasonable.

I dunno something was missing or extra or spoiled... But it really killed the yearning for Bloody Mary for a few months at a stretch!!!<br><br>The appetizers were also just Ok... I have had much better at other places and for much better prices... <br><br>I think we ll just stick to beer at this place!",

"reviewcomment":"Nice mini-like shops and street performers with a SF Fisherman&#39;s Wharf kind of feel. Their military-themed windmills and outdoor decor shop are my favorites. I would have to return to the village to buy a U.S. Navy windmill. Check out their souvenir shops especially the small giftshop with the cool military patches and flags.<br><br>I haven&#39;t dined in their eateries but I always come to this tourist location just to eat Ben and Jerry&#39;s ice cream after taking a long walk around their marina walkfront towards the SD Convention Center. <br><br>There&#39;s a limited metered parking lot further down from this village. It is nice to park near the USS Midway Museum and take pictures of the Unconditional Surrender &#34;Sailor&#39;s Kiss&#34; statue. <br><br>I think it is better to park outside of the Seaport Village parking zone. It allows you to enjoy the scenary more than the shops and entertainment. You should also consider stopping by this village during ComicCon. It is interesting to watch cosplayers dine here with their cool outfits and weapons. ^_^",

"reviewcomment":"Yay Taiwanese food! :)<br><br>I&#39;ve never actually eaten here in the daytime but it&#39;s always looked packed when Ive been shopping in 99 Ranch. It&#39;s located on one end of 99 Ranch and there seems to be a pretty good amount of take out orders.<br><br>I, being an avid night owl, have only been here probably past 9PM, which brings me to my first great point-OPEN LATE!! It&#39;s so hard to find places besides Mexican food that is open late here so this is always a life-saver when I need to satisfy my asian food cravings late night.<br><br>Second best thing, it&#39;s totally affordable. It&#39;s pretty cheap. You can always share food and probably spend less than $10/person! They have all kinds of seafood, rice, and noodles dishes. NOTE: don&#39;t go buy the pictures because I don&#39;t think those are actually pictures of food they make there.<br><br>Also, this is a CASH ONLY place. Yes, a downfall but come prepared! :) Also, especially during late night, it can get a bit crowded and there was literally only 1-2 servers but they typically do a great job at checking up on you. <br><br>Definitely recommend this place for those of you that get that late night craving and maybe I&#39;ll see you there!",

It was refreshing to have so many low-calorie options to choose from, and it was obvious that all of the incredients were fresh and healthy.  It takes a lot of imagination, talent, and skill to bring out the wonderful taste of food without adding fat-based sauces, and they&#39;ve got what it takes. Plus, the variety of choices on the menu is impressive.<br><br>If you are looking for really large portions, lots of fat and calories. this restaurant probably is not your best choice.  If, on the other hand, one or more members of party would appreciate being served a healthy, seasonally fresh, delicious meal, this place fits the bill.  <br><br>The service was great!<br><br>Attire is casual or dressy; I&#39;d feel comfortable either way. Definitely not formal.<br><br>As another reviewer pointed out, it&#39;s probably not the place for most kids, but it depends on the kid.  My parents took me to all kinds of restaurants, and I was fine with it as long as they served American dishes, but maybe that was because I was the quiet bookworm type.<br><br>I&#39;ve already started recommending this restaurant to my friends.  Very enjoyable, and the prices are neither higher nor lower than what I&#39;d expect to pay at a place like this.",

I used to live in LA/OC and now SD, so I feel pretty strongly about that statement. <br><br>Ambience - simple, not too fancy, just right<br><br>Food - The food is the main story here! It&#39;s is delicious, all of it! First things first, they give everyone a bowl of daal to start which is delicious. Really a home made taste, just like my mom makes. Their main dishes are all good. This isn&#39;t like any other place, because they have unique flavors that are different from other Indian restaurant. That himalayan touch really makes a huge different. My favorite is the paneer tikka masala (note: I&#39;m vegetarian). It&#39;s creamy but balanced and appropriately spicy if you ask for it. And you have to get the garlic naan with it. But I also love the momos. They are really unique, light, and flavorful. Similar to dumplings. My husband loves the Chicken Makhani and the Goat when they have it. <br><br>Price - really reasonable. It makes for an affordable night out with big portions.",

"reviewcomment":"Well, hello there YELP.  I have not felt compelled to write a review of joy like this for quite some time.  Why - because everything here from walking in to walking out was superb!<br><br>Dined here with friends and hubby on 5/20/14 for Sustainable Seafood Dinner.  A Collaboration with Gregory Chavez (The Wine Vault &amp; Bistro), Executive &amp; Consulting Chef Tim Kolanko of Blue Bridge Hospitality Group, and Leroy&#39;s Kitchen Chef de Cuisine Ronnie Schwandt.  Our waiter was Jacob - who turned this amazing meal into an amazing experience for everyone of us!<br><br>The Wine Dinner was paired beautifully, but my two dear friends do NOT drink Wine, and my hubby doesn&#39;t drink alcohol period.  So upon sitting down I thought - I have to ask if we can do something for them - after all they are joining me because they love seafood and me of course :)  Well, Leroy&#39;s Bar and our waiter Jacob and the Chefs did not disappoint.  Quickly they created beer pairings for my friends amongst bartender and chef.  Then they created pairings of non-alchoholic drinks like Mojitos, and Watermelon/Basil, and Orange and Mint drinks.  I mean really - this was impressive and not once - did I ever see an eye flicker at the request for maybe something different.<br><br>Now, onto the treat for our eyes and our pallet with food:<br><br>Bites from the Sea - a trio of delights and surprises.  Swordfish corndog - was melt in your mouth amazing.  Salmon Bacon BLT - hit every note with the right amount of smokey salmon, to the texture of the bun and the salt onto of the roof of our mouths to seal the deal.  Then the avocado, seaweed, and shiso with a brilliant addition of acid grapefruit and blood orange supremes - made for a  crisp ending.  Paired with Sea smoke sea spray 2011 blanc de noir, estate vineyard, santa rita hills, califonia.  My note is bubbly and not too sweet - champagne like but not as dry.<br><br>First Course - chilled asparagus soup with local spot prawn creme fraiche, spring herbs.  The best part was that this dish was served with deep fried spot prawn heads.  All four of us gobbled them up with giddy smiles!  I would have liked to try the soup warm - but maybe that&#39;s why I&#39;m not in the kitchen!  This was paired with weingut tegernseerhof 2012 gruner veltliner.  My note is crisp and sweet.<br><br>Second Course - my favorite!  Black cod, sunchoke puree, chinese celery, kohlrabi, warm bacon vinaigrette.  This dish was my favorite because first I love black cod!  I enjoyed its moist flakes dancing in my mouth with a bit of the warm bacon vinaigrette and the greens.  When I really love a dish I slow down my eating to linger with the flavors.  I was the last to finish this one at the table.  It was paired also with my favorite wine of the night!  ciro picariello 2012 greco di tufo, compania, italy.  This is one of the best white wines I&#39;ve enjoyed - so very smooth, it was neither sweet or bitter.  It was light and enjoyable.  I&#39;d like it again with a fish like cod again.  Even a swordfish or halibut.<br><br>Third Course - California King Salmon, green garlic, farro, crispy mushroom.  This very simple description doesn&#39;t do this dish justice.  It was a delight nutty and deep dish with the salmon cooked to near perfection.  I prefer my salmon a little less cooked than my portion, but I know it is SO very difficult to get everyone&#39;s coming out at the same time for over 100 people.  It still was a great balanced dish and paired with a sweeter red wine.  Broc Cellars 2013 valdiguie, green valley, solano county, california (a little too sweet for my liking, but it did balance out the nuttiness dish flavors.<br><br>Dessert course - served on a plate similar to the amuse bouche a trio of delights.  The trio was a lovely rich sherry, date shortbread and vanilla bean ice cream and a dark chocolate bark.  The liqueur was too much for me at this time in the meal.  I would have loved it any other time and finished with a nice espresso and perhaps I can do that another time.  The sherry was to pour over the ice cream.  I was us too full.  Pedro Ximenez &#34;affogato&#34;.  Learn something new every meal.  Next time I see this on the menu - I will not be intimated and will plan accordingly. <br><br>Every chef and the manager came to our table and checked in with us.  Thanked us for coming.  This is what marketing cannot ever buy you.  A simple thank you for coming and us having the opportunity to tell them that we loved their work is what makes dining out so much more than just grabbing food out.  If you want to be in my budget and get me to spread the word - you nailed it!  The customer service and the smiles on the employees made all the difference.<br><br>Note to owners:  I did not hear music over my conversation with my friends and my husband.  THANK you so much for that!  When I eat beautiful food, and enjoy drinks, I want to be able to hear the voices of the people I&#39;m spending the evening with.  No sore throat this morning.  <br><br>I cannot wait to come back and bring more friends!",

But I was full and didn&#39;t need the added 12000000 calories, ok it&#39;s only 1200 but still.",

"reviewcomment":"Great dinner experience and favorite steakhouse in San Diego thus far! (Donovan&#39;s doesn&#39;t hold a candle to Flemings.)<br><br>Came during this past Memorial day weekend for the $30 prime rib special (3 courses; app, main, desert) which was as available during the three day weekend instead of when prime rib is served just on Sundays. I had a caesar salad and my boyfriend ordered lobster bisque, which he enjoyed greatly. <br>Our large prime ribs came perfectly medium rare, with three sauces (typical au jus and horseradish, but a third mustard one which wasn&#39;t my favorite). Super juicy and tender, one of the best cuts I&#39;ve had to date. <br>We ordered sides of garlic mashed potatoes and asparagus which were delicious, but when they say one side is enough for two they are not joking around.<br>Ordered cheesecake and creme brulee for dessert, the former being better than the latter. Cheesecake was not overly dense or sweet and completely satisfying, while the creme brulee had good custard but something tasted off on the torched sugar top.<br><br>Would highly recommend; though pricier, the service and food was pretty impeccable. Boyfriend also enjoys going for their great happy hour, $6 cocktails and food options.<br>Validation for parking at the Hyatt garage is available, but darn that downgrade hill you need to hike up and down if in heels!",

What would make this a 5 star rating for me is for them to have a more consistent stock of pastries. An example was when I bought the sausage bun and it was basically a half sized sausage in a big bun, so it&#39;ll be better if they made the ratio of bread and filling to be more even. <br><br>Overall, it beats the other asian pastry stores!",

"reviewcomment":"This place is the best Indian/Himalayan restaurant in SoCal! I used to live in LA/OC and now SD, so I feel pretty strongly about that statement. <br><br>Ambience - simple, not too fancy, just right<br><br>Food - The food is the main story here! It&#39;s is delicious, all of it! First things first, they give everyone a bowl of daal to start which is delicious. Really a home made taste, just like my mom makes. Their main dishes are all good. This isn&#39;t like any other place, because they have unique flavors that are different from other Indian restaurant. That himalayan touch really makes a huge different. My favorite is the paneer tikka masala (note: I&#39;m vegetarian). It&#39;s creamy but balanced and appropriately spicy if you ask for it. And you have to get the garlic naan with it. But I also love the momos. They are really unique, light, and flavorful. Similar to dumplings. My husband loves the Chicken Makhani and the Goat when they have it. <br><br>Price - really reasonable. It makes for an affordable night out with big portions.",

Let me tell you, the Brussels sprouts were the best! They infused citrus with sweet, I just couldn&#39;t stop eating em! <br><br>My main course was the beef brisket with a bacon stuffed cake. I was weirded out with the combo at first but once I dug in, I finished the entire plate! <br><br>You could tell this bar/restaurant has a lot of locals but its also good for outsiders--something new something different. They have a good size front patio to enjoy the scene on the streets or you can enjoy your drink in the back Beer Garden.<br><br>One last thing, my girl actually new the head chef. He came out, talked to us and made sure our service and food was good. Chef Jon is a really nice guy, he also gave us a dessert on the us.

($3.50)<br><br>It&#39;s great for many reasons. 1) It&#39;s FLIPPIN&#39; DELICOUS! 2) It&#39;s affordable &amp; 3) It&#39;s an extremely portable, carefree dessert for walking up and down the boardwalk and strips in PB.<br><br>It&#39;s both a good &amp; bad thing I don&#39;t live in PB.

"reviewcomment":"SO GOOD! I came here for lunch last week and was not disappointed. We got the pitcher of sangria right when we sat down. It was so delicious, fruity, and refreshing. It was just what we needed on the hot day that we went. I ordered the burger which came with bacon, over-easy egg, and some special sauce on top. It was so yummy and the bun looked delicious too but I passed on it. I split the burger with my bf who got the caesar salad. I know he was a little disappointed in his meal but I think it might have been just because I opted for the delicious, unhealthy heart-attack on a plate. Needless to say, he got his fair share of burger and fries and we were both very full afterwards.<br><br>The service was great and our waitress was so attentive. She always made sure our sangria cups were full as well as our water glasses. The decor is really cute and the music was great. <br><br>I will definitely come here again, considering it was delish and it&#39;s right down the street from my house!",

"reviewcomment":"This place is the best Indian/Himalayan restaurant in SoCal! I used to live in LA/OC and now SD, so I feel pretty strongly about that statement. <br><br>Ambience - simple, not too fancy, just right<br><br>Food - The food is the main story here! It&#39;s is delicious, all of it! First things first, they give everyone a bowl of daal to start which is delicious. Really a home made taste, just like my mom makes. Their main dishes are all good. This isn&#39;t like any other place, because they have unique flavors that are different from other Indian restaurant. That himalayan touch really makes a huge different. My favorite is the paneer tikka masala (note: I&#39;m vegetarian). It&#39;s creamy but balanced and appropriately spicy if you ask for it. And you have to get the garlic naan with it. But I also love the momos. They are really unique, light, and flavorful. Similar to dumplings. My husband loves the Chicken Makhani and the Goat when they have it. <br><br>Price - really reasonable. It makes for an affordable night out with big portions.",

"reviewcomment":"I have been to PB Sushi a few times and I am never disappointed. They have a happy hour daily from 12-7 where you get 20% all the rolls except ones on special and their usually a few dollars off their beer.<br><br>Their services was pretty good and the rolls didn&#39;t take that long to receive. I had the Spicy Crispy Roll and the Philadelphia Roll. Despite it saying it was extra spicy, it wasn&#39;t actually that hot. However, it was very rich in flavor and a small kick at the end. The Philadelphia Roll was the perfect combination to go with the Spicy Crispy Roll. The big chunks of cream cheese and avocado cooled my mouth with every bite and tasted delicious.<br><br>If you are looking for a quite small place to enjoy some good sushi in the PB area, I would give this place a try.",

I live in La Jolla, but come down here to eat when I&#39;m in the area.<br><br>First off, their spring rolls are super-sized while priced the same as normal size spring rolls. I would say the two spring rolls you get are 3/4ths a meal! Also, they&#39;re just delicious - the meat to noodle to lettuce proportion is just right. Definite recommend. <br><br>Just by the smell of this place, you could tell that it authentic Vietnamese food, which is always a plus in my book.<br><br>I would describe customer to wait-staff interaction as being fed by your busy uncle. Our interactions were always distantly friendly. Although, I had to call them once or twice - they never seem to be bothered. Also, my water glass was never empty, which I can&#39;t say about most of the Vietnamese restaurants I know. <br><br>Highly recommended.",

"reviewcomment":"I&#39;ve been here twice for lunch and once for dinner and have not been disappointed! There doesn&#39;t seem to be a need to make a reservation for lunch even if you want to eat outside but that doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s empty. If you have a large group then yes, make a reservation. It gets crowded here for happy hour and dinner.<br><br>The food here is amazing. Their fish tacos, in my opinion, are better than some I&#39;ve had in ocean beach (which people really raved about). I also tried their BBQ salmon which sat on top of mash potatoes and had a side of string beans and boy was it delicious. I ate every single piece of it. For dinner I ended getting a burger once at the bar and that was amazing too. <br><br>I love that my company likes to come here for lunch occasionally and I&#39;m looking forward to coming back to try the yellowtail next time. <br><br>Oh and the view here is spectacular. It&#39;s on the second floor so you can see the ocean. Lovely.",

"reviewcomment":"This place is the best Indian/Himalayan restaurant in SoCal! I used to live in LA/OC and now SD, so I feel pretty strongly about that statement. <br><br>Ambience - simple, not too fancy, just right<br><br>Food - The food is the main story here! It&#39;s is delicious, all of it! First things first, they give everyone a bowl of daal to start which is delicious. Really a home made taste, just like my mom makes. Their main dishes are all good. This isn&#39;t like any other place, because they have unique flavors that are different from other Indian restaurant. That himalayan touch really makes a huge different. My favorite is the paneer tikka masala (note: I&#39;m vegetarian). It&#39;s creamy but balanced and appropriately spicy if you ask for it. And you have to get the garlic naan with it. But I also love the momos. They are really unique, light, and flavorful. Similar to dumplings. My husband loves the Chicken Makhani and the Goat when they have it. <br><br>Price - really reasonable. It makes for an affordable night out with big portions.",

It will be more then likely packed. They have lots of TVs throughout the restaurant and bar that always have sports events on. They have a pretty decent selection of beers on draft and have a nice happy hour 7pm to 10pm daily. They have a basketball hoop that you shoot hoops when it isn&#39;t crazy busy as well as a 4 person Pacman and other fun games.<br><br>The food is a little on the high side, $10.5 for a basic hamburger, but they are pretty big and come with your choice of fries, tots or a side salad. What they&#39;re famous here for is their tots. They have a full paged dedicated to 9 delicious and very different skillet tots that even Napoleon would dance his @$$ off for. They even have a dessert tot called the I Scream Tot, which I am very curious about. My favorite, so far, has been the Tater Skin Tots but I plan on coming back to try each and every one.",

Beware, though, happy hour means no leftovers can be taken. <br><br>Here&#39;s what I settled on:<br><br>Garlic parm - my fave of the bunch. No sauce, just butter and crispy garlic goodness....Mmm<br><br>Dirty ranch - my second fave. Buffalo and ranch mixed together in a perfectly delicious sauce<br><br>Lemon pepper - 3rd fave. Crispy and delicious. <br><br>Teriyaki - really tasty sauce, but a little too much of it for my taste. Once I dabbed some of the sauce off they were perfect. <br><br>3-Pete BBQ - doused in BBQ and buffalo. These seemed a little salty to me, or maybe just a little too vinegary. Not sure. They were good, but I would probably skip them next time. <br><br>There are so many more flavors I wanna try! And tots, fries, Mac and cheese balls...everything!<br><br>If I lived within walking distance I&#39;d probably frequent this place. Nice little dive with good music and music videos",

"reviewcomment":"Love this place. Everything is organic and the burgers are top notch and simple.  They make the patty crispy crusty. I like their house made 1000 island sauce on the lounge burger.  There aren&#39;t a bunch of options for toppings except for bacon but I might ask next time (you never know... They might have an egg or some avocado back there in the kitchen).  <br><br>We always get the half and half fries and onions rings and although they are totally awesome (especially with their creamy ranch) we can never finish them because they&#39;re huge.  Guess I better choose one or the other next time... But always with the ranch! <br><br>What I love most are the drinks.  They&#39;re all natural and one of the cashiers was a genious and had an awesome mix: half pink drink, half orange dream, splash of ginger root beer.  So freaking good... And who knew?!  Definitely my fave burger place downtown.<br><br>We&#39;ll have to try their brownie next time and if we have room, their shakes.",

We decided to try it again after all this time, its still good as it was back then.<br><br>The service is great here, servers are very attentive and friendly. The prices are amazingly good for such quality food you get. The selection of food is also massive, the menu is pretty big for a breakfast lunch place.<br><br>This time I tried the coffee cake and one massive pancake. The coffee cake was great, had walnuts and a great sweet flavor to it that went good with a morning cup of coffee. <br><br>The pancake was massive, huge. I finished the whole thing, but felt very stuffed afterwards. The texture of the pancake was perfect, nice and fluffy. Once you pour their melted butter on, its good enough without syrup. <br><br>My friend ordered a vegetarian omelet, and to her surprise they used a large variety of veggies that were cooked great. The omelet its self, was also very big.<br><br>When going to breakfast at this place, bring an empty stomach! Also bring cash, because they only take cash.",

"reviewcomment":"I came here on a Memorial Day Monday evening for dinner.  My girlfriend and I were quickly seated on the large patio seating area.  We brought her Min Pin dog with us after we spent much of the afternoon walking around the Embarcadero, Seaport Village, and the Marina.<br><br>This bar and grill is the famous spot in the film, &#34;Top Gun,&#34; where Goose plays the piano as he and Maverick, played by Tom Cruise, sing &#34;Great Balls of Fire.&#34;  The decor inside the place is somewhat cluttered with authentic Naval aviation and &#34;Top Gun&#34; memorabilia.  It&#39;s also dark inside, but what bar isn&#39;t.<br><br>The staff were incredibly friendly.  We ordered a combo where you choose 3 meats and 2 sides.  Pork baby back ribs, pork spare ribs, beef brisket, baked beans, buttered corn on the cob, and two large slices of white bread.  $17.  I found this to provide way more food than two people can eat.<br><br>The standouts for me were the pork spareribs and the baked beans.  The former were hearty, meaty, tender, moist, and had the perfect amount of fat.  The baked beans are thick, have a sweet barbecue sauce flavor, and have a fair amount of pulled pork mixed in them.  <br><br>The food here was good, not great, but I give this place a 4 instead of 3 because it&#39;s also the &#34;Top Gun&#34; bar, domestic beers are regularly priced at a reasonable $3.50, and you won&#39;t find much better authentic southern barbecue restaurant in San Diego.  Put this place on your bucket list.",

"reviewcomment":"This place is the best Indian/Himalayan restaurant in SoCal! I used to live in LA/OC and now SD, so I feel pretty strongly about that statement. <br><br>Ambience - simple, not too fancy, just right<br><br>Food - The food is the main story here! It&#39;s is delicious, all of it! First things first, they give everyone a bowl of daal to start which is delicious. Really a home made taste, just like my mom makes. Their main dishes are all good. This isn&#39;t like any other place, because they have unique flavors that are different from other Indian restaurant. That himalayan touch really makes a huge different. My favorite is the paneer tikka masala (note: I&#39;m vegetarian). It&#39;s creamy but balanced and appropriately spicy if you ask for it. And you have to get the garlic naan with it. But I also love the momos. They are really unique, light, and flavorful. Similar to dumplings. My husband loves the Chicken Makhani and the Goat when they have it. <br><br>Price - really reasonable. It makes for an affordable night out with big portions.",

Boom, baby.<br><br>The original Smashburger is essentially: American cheese, ketchup, leaf lettuce, tomato, red onion, pickles, and their signature smash sauce on a bun. When you&#39;re starving, this is the best thing since sliced bread. Wow. Juicy, and full of flavor from the burst of pickles and onions - this was gone in under 15 seconds. No joke.<br><br>I requested the Smash Fries, instead of regular french fries, which is an interesting blend of fries that are tossed with rosemary, olive oil and garlic. Wow. And if you request chipotle sauce, it brings the flavor come to that much more &#34;UMPF!&#34; No but seriously, get some of these Smash Fries. They&#39;ll make you feel &#39;healthy&#39; while you&#39;re downing your meal, especially if you go fat boy/girl mode with a shake to boot. ;)",

"reviewcomment":"We chose the Melting Pot for our one year wedding anniversary dinner. We both have heard nothing but gleaming things about the place and let me tell you, it lived up to the hype!<br><br>We showed up about 15 minutes early for our reservation but they seated us right away with no delay. I told them about our anniversary and it seemed the entire staff wished us well. We met Luke, our server, who was an absolute hero! He broke down the menu (albeit a little fast) and was able to guide us each step of the 4 course process. We chose cheddar first for our cheese dish. Delicious, lovely beer base with mixed bread and apples. We both chose the California salad next, heavy on the blue cheese but lovely otherwise. For our entree I chose the classic, since Yelp recommended it, and my wife went for the Pacific Rim for the dumplings. Next time though I am definetely going Steak lovers. Everything was good on both of our plates but the steak was out of this world! They have a large craft beer list and a fun cocktail list so my Stone IPA went great with dinner. For dessert we went Yin and Yang and not only that but they brought us a decorated plate and a signed card for our anniversary. My wife was blow away by the little touches and we almost had to be rolled out of there by the end of the night. One of the best dining experiences I have ever had.<br><br>The meal was 101 bucks for two before tip. I figured as much and didn&#39;t mind tipping big, Luke more than earned it. It was a popular spot on that night as it was prom night but we got a good seat and was made welcome from the time we walked in to the time we left. I would recommend this place to anyone and we will definetely return!<br><br>Pro Tips:<br>-We used OpenTable for the booking since they give you a place to write out messages and special requests for the night and give phone follow-up calls to make sure the meal will go well.<br>-The bathroom is confusing to get to but there is a secret one up the stairs behind the bar that was easier and more convenient for us to use.<br>-4 course is the only way to go for the money but pace yourself, treat it like a sprint and you will not make it to the end.<br>-Bring a watch or have a phone charged as you will need to time your food cooking for the entree portion and you need to have someone staying vigilant so no food goes overcooked.",

This place will give you the sea food over dose you would want. really flavorful and mouth watering cuisine.<br><br>Shrimp in a bag is a very unique style of cuisine and they have a very unique way of having your meal. You get a table and butter paper is rolled over the same and that exactly is your plate. You get your orders in a bag. If you are in for some citric flavor, I would  suggest to get few lemons, drop them in your bag and mix your dish, before eating the same. Be careful while you order the spice level for the dishes. The XXX is not for the weak at heart folks. I would suggest to even think of it once after you have done a Mild, which in itself is HOT. <br><br>It gets a bit messy while eating so be prepared for that. <br><br>They do accept cards and they have parking available as well.",

"reviewcomment":"This place is the best Indian/Himalayan restaurant in SoCal! I used to live in LA/OC and now SD, so I feel pretty strongly about that statement. <br><br>Ambience - simple, not too fancy, just right<br><br>Food - The food is the main story here! It&#39;s is delicious, all of it! First things first, they give everyone a bowl of daal to start which is delicious. Really a home made taste, just like my mom makes. Their main dishes are all good. This isn&#39;t like any other place, because they have unique flavors that are different from other Indian restaurant. That himalayan touch really makes a huge different. My favorite is the paneer tikka masala (note: I&#39;m vegetarian). It&#39;s creamy but balanced and appropriately spicy if you ask for it. And you have to get the garlic naan with it. But I also love the momos. They are really unique, light, and flavorful. Similar to dumplings. My husband loves the Chicken Makhani and the Goat when they have it. <br><br>Price - really reasonable. It makes for an affordable night out with big portions.",

Grounds are lovely, the room was very spacious (king bed, separate large living room area, and jack-and-Jill bathroom), and the furniture was new. Overall very clean. <br><br>I didn&#39;t use the pool, but spent a lot of time on the beach. Pool did have a lovely set-up when I walked by.  <br><br>The location is very nicely situated. There are views of Mission Bay everywhere.

Their sauce is just amazing! <br>Be sure to get there before 7 to reserve a spot. Sometimes the crowd gets crazy- and you end up with an hour wait!! No drink specials either during special wing times (happy hour ends at 7) <br>I tried their mango pineapple vodka drink last night... wasn&#39;t that impressed. Small glass- super strong- not an appealing flavor for 6 bucks! Uhhhh......<br>Our waitress didn&#39;t give us a water refill until we were waiting on our check!!

This one looked really promising. <br><br>I made reservations through open table and was promptly seated upon our arrival. <br><br>The inside of this restaurant is so unique. The building use to be an Oldsmobile dealership back in the day so the old exposed brick is prominently displayed. There are real, live olive trees growing inside.  The building has a barn/warehouse like feel to it and the attention to detail with the lighting is incredible. <br><br>Our server, Matt, was great. He suggested some wonderful items for us and was very pleasant throughout the evening. <br><br>I ordered the corn chowder, the baja corn as a side and for my main dish I had the seasonal fresh pasta and added scallops. This dish was so divine and full of intense flavors. <br><br>For dessert we shared the sundae and the raspberry filled donuts. The sundae stole the show. <br><br>If I&#39;m ever in La Jolla again, I will definitely stop in for a wonderful evening.",

It&#39;s one of our favorite places, due to the staff friendliness, pricing, and service. Sometimes, if you&#39;re as frequent as a customer as we are, (2-4/mo) you will find the complimentary chips rushed out and not completely as good as they could be. <br>However, in all honesty, this is a type of restaurant that makes good food, has good service, and cares about their customers. On one occasion, the manager paid for our food simply because of our continued business with them. A small touch, he didn&#39;t have to, but he did. There are bad and good reviews, but even with their flaws I would give them 5 stars. No business is perfect for everyone. The amount of reviews they have just means they cater to more people than most places. The main problem I would suppose might be their business model and/or upper level admin. Their ground level, waitress and waiter, kitchen/food, is great.",

"reviewcomment":"This is my go-to taco spot. I LOVE the tacos, I&#39;ve tried all of them - they&#39;re all delicious. You really can&#39;t go wrong. It&#39;s street tacos style except the restaurant is super clean! Lots of seating, although it does get pretty crowded particularly on Taco Tuesday (they have a $1 off taco special so that it&#39;s about $2 per taco). Their horchatas are pretty great too.<br><br>Try out Puesto and you will most likely be back very soon for more! Another great thing about Puesto is that it is a very short 5 to 10 minute walk to the shore.",

"reviewcomment":"I can&#39;t believe how teeny-tiny this place is! You&#39;ll literally be bumping into people if you try to navigate your way to one of the indoor tables towards the back, but that doesn&#39;t take away from their charm.<br><br>My husband was craving a Mexican-style breakfast one morning, so off we went to Mystic Mocha. Their menu is on a chalkboard above the register, and you have options for savory or sweet food items, and a ton of different drink varieties. They have four different chilaquiles options alone!<br><br>We placed our order - blue corn chilaquiles and a blended Vietnamese coffee for me, and chorizo chilaquiles and a large soy latte for him - and then snagged the only open table inside the restaurant. It was kind of crammed into the corner, and we did a lot of bumping into chairs and people, and said &#34;excuse me&#34; a couple times before we were fully settled in, but once we were there, it was nice! It was right by a screen door, so we had a view of the quiet neighborhood and a nice breeze coming through.<br><br>Our food came out long before our drink orders were called (she was busy back there!), and I was surprised by the sheer amount of food we were given. It may not look like a lot in the picture, but let me tell ya, it was a ton of food. I couldn&#39;t finish my plate, but even more shockingly, neither could my husband! The food was hot and delicious, and they sure didn&#39;t skimp on the ingredients, which I appreciate. Seriously - less than $8 gave us a mound of food that filled us up for a long while.<br><br>Our drinks were called a few minutes after our food was brought to our table, and those were just as delicious. I&#39;ve never had a blended Vietnamese coffee before, but it made a fan out of me! And, my husband loved his latte (he often decries the lack of &#34;good&#34; and cheap lattes in San Diego).<br><br>We&#39;re definitely fans of this spot, and love that it&#39;s a small, local place. The people were all friendly, and they have a nice little outdoor seating/eating area for those who can&#39;t find a seat inside, or choose to enjoy the beautiful sunny weather.",

"reviewcomment":"This place is the best Indian/Himalayan restaurant in SoCal! I used to live in LA/OC and now SD, so I feel pretty strongly about that statement. <br><br>Ambience - simple, not too fancy, just right<br><br>Food - The food is the main story here! It&#39;s is delicious, all of it! First things first, they give everyone a bowl of daal to start which is delicious. Really a home made taste, just like my mom makes. Their main dishes are all good. This isn&#39;t like any other place, because they have unique flavors that are different from other Indian restaurant. That himalayan touch really makes a huge different. My favorite is the paneer tikka masala (note: I&#39;m vegetarian). It&#39;s creamy but balanced and appropriately spicy if you ask for it. And you have to get the garlic naan with it. But I also love the momos. They are really unique, light, and flavorful. Similar to dumplings. My husband loves the Chicken Makhani and the Goat when they have it. <br><br>Price - really reasonable. It makes for an affordable night out with big portions.",

Exactly the way that I like it made. Years ago I thought Chinese food was Chinese food no matter where you go..... until I ran across some Chinese eateries that I didn&#39;t like for one reason or another. So to make a long story short, Hong Kongs food is delicious and perfect!!<br><br>The service was great. It seems like everytime I go in I see the same staff which is great because it makes me feel like I&#39;m eating at a friends house. <br><br>They also have parking validation too. They will offer it rather than you have to ask for it. <br><br>I want to share a little story that happened the last time I was there. I was talking to the waitress who probably is the owner or the wife of the owner because she was older. I know that&#39;s a stretch to guess that but I just got that feeling. Well we were talking about how tasty the food is and that I like to have my &#34;whole&#34; plate of shrimp friend rice to myself and if I&#39;m there with someone they have to get there own plate. I don&#39;t share. I went on to describe how I like it with the soy sauce. In an excited voice as if she is ready to share something profound with me she says (in chinese accent) &#34;your people love it that way!&#34; I waited a couple of seconds to see if she was going to try and back track but no.. she said it again. This led me to believe that she didn&#39;t know any better. My friend and I just started cracking up and that was the topic for the rest of the dinner &#34;you people&#34;. <br><br>She was just a little old chinese lady that didn&#39;t know any better. Because of who it came from I took no offense. it was more funny than anything. <br><br>I think everyone will love this place.!",

It&#39;s located in the same shopping center as Pancake House off of Convoy. <br><br>First off, I love going here for some authentic Japanese eats. The quality of the fish is top notch. The main sushi guy isn&#39;t always there, so call first! <br><br>Some of my recommendations include: the spicy tuna don, chirashi don, karaage, ramen, and the uni don. <br><br>The sushi chef takes his time perfecting each dish, so it takes a while to get your food. When it finally does arrive to your table though, it is always perfect! <br><br>Parking is easy to find in the shopping center, &amp; I give the service an A!",

I used to live in LA/OC and now SD, so I feel pretty strongly about that statement. <br><br>Ambience - simple, not too fancy, just right<br><br>Food - The food is the main story here! It&#39;s is delicious, all of it! First things first, they give everyone a bowl of daal to start which is delicious. Really a home made taste, just like my mom makes. Their main dishes are all good. This isn&#39;t like any other place, because they have unique flavors that are different from other Indian restaurant. That himalayan touch really makes a huge different. My favorite is the paneer tikka masala (note: I&#39;m vegetarian). It&#39;s creamy but balanced and appropriately spicy if you ask for it. And you have to get the garlic naan with it. But I also love the momos. They are really unique, light, and flavorful. Similar to dumplings. My husband loves the Chicken Makhani and the Goat when they have it. <br><br>Price - really reasonable. It makes for an affordable night out with big portions.",

This place is GENUINE, the real deal... an &#34;old-timey&#34; (not &#34;fancy shmancy&#34;) steak joint and piano bar that serves the kind of steak dinner you might find in a small Midwestern town. <br><br>That is, the baked potato in the aluminum foil, the iceberg lettuce salad, the &#34;well done&#34; veggies (not &#34;al dente&#34;, and probably frozen), and the slice of cheesecake to top it all off. My one itty-bitty complaint is that the crab cakes are mostly filler - but the remoulade sauce they come with is to die for - tip: ask for some and smother it on your steak.<br><br>Nothing fancy, nothing gourmet, nothing pretentious.<br><br>But this place doesn&#39;t pretend to be anything other than what it is. The waitresses are sharp, sassy, seasoned ladies who do a fine job of serving your dinner quickly and efficiently. The decor is oldschool and kitschy (but not in a cutesie, &#34;on purpose&#34; way), dark and weathered, with large comfy booths. The piano bar is just over the top, the icing on the cake that makes this place... well, SPECIAL!<br><br>Go to the Red Fox if you want to experience a bit of San Diego that is not the overpriced, tourist-trap, commercialized, &#34;beachy&#34; sort of place it has (for better or for worse) become.",

After a long day out in the hot weather, smoothies at Senor Mango&#39;s was honestly the best way to wind down and enjoy the rest of the evening. If you like papayas definitely give the papaya mango smoothie a go! You won&#39;t regret it. My girlfriend normally goes for the ice cream watermelon smoothie which has a lighter and more mellow flavor. Watermelon, banana, strawberry and vanilla ice cream is not the most conventional combination, but it is pretty darn delicious. <br><br>The tortas also hit the spot. Upon a recommendation of one of the people who worked there, we tried the Lomo and have been hooked onto it since. Good blend of flavors and  big portion size. <br><br>Because my girlfriend has never had acai, in a previous visit, we got the acai bowl to share. Although it&#39;s not really my thing I was impressed at how well balanced all of the flavors were. For her it was like eating chocolate, strawberries and granola....except a whole lot healthier.",

In contrast, we find dining at Zensei to be a leisurely affair.  <br><br>The salmon belly nigiri is a favorite of ours, as is the Dream Roll. I prefer the miso to many other places in the city. As you might expect, the later in the night that you order (after 8ish) the more likely that they will be out of something or that you will get a less desirable cut of fish. <br><br>I was compelled to write this review because I feel that the recent one-star reviews of this restaurant are terribly unfair.  No, this is not the finest sushi in the city, but it is very satisfying and I&#39;d rather sit here than many other places because the atmosphere is relaxed and neighborhoody.  Also, if you are trying to rush through sushi, then you are not doing it right.",

Kahn&#39;s is one of those places you can always find your drunk-ass coworkers sulking about the boss they hate... It&#39;s kind of entertaining actually. Amazing<br><br>Anyhow back to why i&#39;m here. Nice big place, lots of seating. No real wait. Food is solid 8 out of 10. They have great rice bowls and appitizers. The bar tapas have delectible little bites offered right up next to your cold brew. <br><br>Try there Asian flair specials.. Great when you can&#39;t decide what you want and nothing really jumps out on the menu.<br><br>Service is great and always quick.. <br><br>Keep it up KAHN!!!!!",

"reviewcomment":"No pictures! Food was devoured upon arrival. Every time I try to come here the wait is long and I&#39;m usually too hungry to wait so I venture across the street. I&#39;ve been making a mistake this whole time! I should&#39;ve waited!! So many missed opportunities and regrets I must live with!!!<br><br>I&#39;m a thai girl that loves her food spicy! I read the reviews and saw that things tend to be extra spicier here, but I was feeling bold and daring! I ordered drunken noodles with &#34;chicken&#34; spice level 7 and even that was just too spicy for me. I still enjoyed my food, but behind tears and a runny nose. Sorry for the image! So here is your warning. THEY DON&#39;T PLAY WITH THE SPICE LEVELS. Proceed with caution. We also ordered &#34;chicken&#34; satay and flower cups as an appetizer. Both great things to start off with. We wanted to end our meal with mango and sticky rice, but they were all out of mangos!!! WHAT THE WHHHHAAAAT!!! I was incredibly sad, but I quickly hid my disappointment and picked the sticky rice and coconut ice cream. It&#39;s no mango and sticky rice, but it satisfied the need of something sweet and it was a great second choice.<br><br>The staff was really attentive and made sure we had everything we needed. My water cup was filled and that&#39;s all I really ask for in the end... water and great food. I can&#39;t wait to come back!",

I think it&#39;s a great addition to the University Heights neighborhood.",

"reviewcomment":"Inexpensive food that is way better than most take away Mexican food establishments. I really like the California burrito. The fries are always crispy and the meat never is packed with that chewy cartilage, maybe a spot every 20 burritos or so.<br><br>The food is consistent and I always get what I expect, decent for the price. The customer service is great! Quick, polite, and no mistakes. I&#39;ve never had an order that was wrong.<br><br>The only negative point for me is that the doors are very hard to get in and out and nobody ever offers me help. But, I never ask for help so I can&#39;t say they don&#39;t help. I just hate asking for help when they are working their bums off trying just to make a living. I feel bad taking away from their potential tips just so they can let my crippled butt out the door :-)<br><br>I keep coming back for more. Keep up the good service guys, you&#39;re doing it right.",

"reviewcomment":"This place is the best Indian/Himalayan restaurant in SoCal! I used to live in LA/OC and now SD, so I feel pretty strongly about that statement. <br><br>Ambience - simple, not too fancy, just right<br><br>Food - The food is the main story here! It&#39;s is delicious, all of it! First things first, they give everyone a bowl of daal to start which is delicious. Really a home made taste, just like my mom makes. Their main dishes are all good. This isn&#39;t like any other place, because they have unique flavors that are different from other Indian restaurant. That himalayan touch really makes a huge different. My favorite is the paneer tikka masala (note: I&#39;m vegetarian). It&#39;s creamy but balanced and appropriately spicy if you ask for it. And you have to get the garlic naan with it. But I also love the momos. They are really unique, light, and flavorful. Similar to dumplings. My husband loves the Chicken Makhani and the Goat when they have it. <br><br>Price - really reasonable. It makes for an affordable night out with big portions.",

How could we not have heard of it before? Well it is a little strangely located for a place of its caliber. <br><br>This is a Godfather themed high class Italian restaurant. The Italian food here is very good and the prices reflect that. It&#39;s definitely a pricier place to go, but worth it when you can make it. <br><br>Great service that makes you feel like royalty, despite a rather casual atmosphere as far as dress goes. We noticed other dinees were wearing khakis and the like. <br><br>This is the type of place that recommends the best wine and appetizer for your entree with accuracy and does it with class.<br><br>I love the decor, love the food and love the service. <br><br>We will definitely be back again, when we get paid :)",

"reviewcomment":"This was my first trip to San Diego and I&#39;m glad we made our first stop Ocean Beach and Shades Restaurant for breakfast.  The restaurant is open and airy with the sounds of the ocean and happy customers visiting.  We requested a window table and within minutes were seated.  The view of the beach is nice and it&#39;s a great spot to people watch.  On the weekends this is the place everyone gathers with their dogs. <br><br> They have children&#39;s menus and a great selection of items.  I am a huge fan of Eggs Benedict and they serve it a bunch of different ways!  HUGE SCORE!  We started our meal off with Bacon Bloody Mary&#39;s for the adults and yummy smoothies for the kiddos (we are officially on vacation!) <br><br>The kids had pancakes that were served with a hint of almond; I don&#39;t care for pancakes but these smelled delish.  I had the eggs benedict with crab cakes, the hollandaise was creamy and tangy and they add a nice visual effect with some kind of salsa on top, stunning to look at and loaded with crab.  My husband had the Filet Mignon Eggs Benedict, it was served with what tasted like masa and delicious steak in a Mexican style flavoring with traditional hollandaise on top, and it was to die for!  He hardly shared but I got to sample it and it was unlike any other Eggs Bene I&#39;ve ever had with complex levels of flavor.  <br><br>The mimosas were yummy and the house hash browns perfect.  The service was spot on throughout our time there and they handled the &#34;crowd&#34; well. We never felt unattended too despite the fact that they were busy.  For delicious food and a great view, this place is highly recommended.",

"reviewcomment":"My boyfriend and I visited San Diego about a month ago and ate here on a Saturday night.  We did not have a reservation and must have walked in at just the right time because we got a table right away and at least four on her people were turned away after us.  <br><br>My advice - call ahead.<br><br>We ordered crab cakes as an appetizer and they were large and very well seasoned.  They had just the right amount of peppers so you got the flavor but didn&#39;t burn your mouth from the heat.  <br><br>They had Tacones on display and they looked so good we both ordered those as our meal.  I got shrimp and my boyfriend ordered the fish.  The tortilla is grilled so you get a hint of charbroiled flavor that mixes wonderfully with the slaw and seafood.  The Tacones are huge so we definitely didn&#39;t go hungry.  <br><br>We will definitely come here again next time we&#39;re in San Diego.",

"reviewcomment":"another gem in little italy.<br><br>was hanging out w/ a friend and checking out her new place in the Aleggro building (the red striped building above Craft and Commerce). originally we planned to do dinner and drinks at C&amp;C but seeing as the wait was 40ish minutes and we weren&#39;t able to find anything at the bar, we decided to check out Isola nearby and then go back for more drinks (of course).<br><br>i love everything about this place. there&#39;s outside patio seating with heatlamps under the cool little italy night, the interior is spacious and trendy. true-to-form with many authentic and classic (yet modern and hip) italian spots, there were wine bottles and other spirits adorning the shelves, low accent lighting above each of the tables, a mini flower vase (aka mason jar) with a few tea lights and daisies. i was impressed. we were seated immediately and the wait staff were friendly and helpful in selecting our dishes.<br><br>the pizzas each were more than enough for one person, so it&#39;s nice to be able to have lunch already boxed up for tomorrow haha. they have other italian cuisine staples, an assortment of wines, etc. the dessert was killer as well: some sort of dark chocolate mousse with sea salt and whipped cream something or other. we loved it.<br><br>adding Isola to the list. definitely coming back to this place again!<br><br>-civilities.",

I used to live in LA/OC and now SD, so I feel pretty strongly about that statement. <br><br>Ambience - simple, not too fancy, just right<br><br>Food - The food is the main story here! It&#39;s is delicious, all of it! First things first, they give everyone a bowl of daal to start which is delicious. Really a home made taste, just like my mom makes. Their main dishes are all good. This isn&#39;t like any other place, because they have unique flavors that are different from other Indian restaurant. That himalayan touch really makes a huge different. My favorite is the paneer tikka masala (note: I&#39;m vegetarian). It&#39;s creamy but balanced and appropriately spicy if you ask for it. And you have to get the garlic naan with it. But I also love the momos. They are really unique, light, and flavorful. Similar to dumplings. My husband loves the Chicken Makhani and the Goat when they have it. <br><br>Price - really reasonable. It makes for an affordable night out with big portions.",

"reviewcomment":"Is there such a thing as efficient sushi? For a sushi restaurant with no flares and typical looking interior, it would be tempting to pass by this restaurant like its another burrito shop amongst the hundreds.<br><br>I don&#39;t exactly remember how we found this place, but it sure didn&#39;t wow us when we first sat down. Prices were reasonable in what we observed in the menu, and seating was easy to find - which worries me usually when I check out new sushi places.<br><br>I&#39;ll start with the bad:<br>- mediocre ambiance. The decor isn&#39;t the main attraction, and it shouldn&#39;t be when coming here.<br>- somewhat hard parking: That huge parking lot in the mall is surprisingly hard to find a spot within. Many of the spots closest to the shops are reserved for specific businesses, which make it even harder. <br>- I dont know... umm, old, worn out chairs and tables? I can&#39;t think of much else!<br>- Oh, thats right. Their sashimi were a lot thinner than what I&#39;m used to. It didn&#39;t really satisfy because of how thin they were cut.<br><br>The good:<br>- my goodness, cheap cheap sushi. Some of the best deals and prices I&#39;ve seen. Their maki, soft shell crab roll, and other basic rolls gets you pretty far for what you pay. <br>- fast, fast, fast. Very fast services. For some reason, I feel like cheap sushi places substitute their prices for how long you&#39;d have to wait for your food. None of that nonsense here. I feel as if I&#39;ve never waited more than 10 minutes after ordering our food. Sometimes even quicker.<br>- Good place for your typical california-based rolls. No funky business with ingredients, and taste as they should.<br><br>Easily the go-to places for a quick, cheap, and efficient sushi fix. I don&#39;t mind paying for good sushi, but I am glad to have found a shop to fill my craving needs for cheap.",

I used to live in LA/OC and now SD, so I feel pretty strongly about that statement. <br><br>Ambience - simple, not too fancy, just right<br><br>Food - The food is the main story here! It&#39;s is delicious, all of it! First things first, they give everyone a bowl of daal to start which is delicious. Really a home made taste, just like my mom makes. Their main dishes are all good. This isn&#39;t like any other place, because they have unique flavors that are different from other Indian restaurant. That himalayan touch really makes a huge different. My favorite is the paneer tikka masala (note: I&#39;m vegetarian). It&#39;s creamy but balanced and appropriately spicy if you ask for it. And you have to get the garlic naan with it. But I also love the momos. They are really unique, light, and flavorful. Similar to dumplings. My husband loves the Chicken Makhani and the Goat when they have it. <br><br>Price - really reasonable. It makes for an affordable night out with big portions.",

"reviewcomment":"The fiancé and I love Tender Greens when we are craving something on the healthy end. The service is quick as you just order up front and walk through a cafeteria type line and come out with your food at the end. Tender greens is a farm to table concept and everything seems really fresh. <br><br>We both order the platter. We both like to either get the fried chicken (okay maybe not so healthy) or the steak (hey at least it&#39;s pretty lean..). The fried chicken is nice, crispy, tender on the inside, and seasoned well. The steak is pretty amazing tasting for the price in my opinion and cooked really well. It&#39;s cooked medium rare, it&#39;s tender, and is flavorful. For my salad I get the spinach/goat cheese salad. It&#39;s not the best salad I&#39;ve ever had, but it&#39;s pretty good and is the most appealing to me. It comes with some kind of nuts as well. I just wish they&#39;d keep the goat cheese separate and use a more prominent dressing because the dressing just tastes like goat cheese. I like goat cheese, but It would be great to have more than one flavor on the salad. I&#39;ve had the platter with steak on a sandwich and this was pretty tasty. The bread/foccacia is soft and crispy and the bell peppers and aioli pair well with the steak. My fiancé has has the mash potatoes with his platter and they are just average to me. He got the arugula salad which he enjoyed. <br><br>The prices are reasonable here for the quality and freshness. It&#39;s $11 dollars for the platter with meat and a salad. It&#39;s seat yourself here, so pretty casual but the ambiance is crisp and modern. Never had a problem finding seating or parking in the UTC plaza. <br><br>Overall, Tender Greens is definitely one of our go to places when we want something a little healthier or are craving our veggies. We&#39;ll definitely be back.",

"reviewcomment":"Let me preface this review with some quick background. I&#39;m Italian, and have one of the best cooks in the world as a mother. So yes, we&#39;re a llittle food snobby when it comes to Old Country style cooking, and make it a practice of NOT eating at Italian restaurants because they almost always pale in comparison to Mama&#39;s cooking. But last weekend, I was staying with friends in their sailboat in SD and wanted to treat them to dinner as a thank you for their hospitality.  I told them to pick the type of food they wanted and I&#39;d let Yelp do the research. We stumbled across this tine gem and I have to say thank you to Yelp because it was one of the most memorable, delicious meals I&#39;ve had in forever.<br><br>We were greeted by our awesome server (I am terrible with names, but he had a lovely Italian accent and I&#39;m assuming from his red hair, was from northern Italy) who seated us promptly at a patio table and brought out warm crunchy/soft bread along with a menu chocked full of fantastic, reasonably priced options. We opted for the fresh house made mozzarella over a bed of sautéed fresh spinach and slivered garlic, and a generous helping of cut cherry tomatoes that were as bright as the sun. When we cut into the mound of warm cheese, the center reminded me of a creamy egg yolk - only it was white and so delicious! Amazing, yet such a simple appetizer - winner! <br><br>We followed with a huge Salmon filet stuffed with fresh crab and small scallops over a bed of Linguini and steamed veggies, and one of the most ginourmous heaps of amazing lasagna I&#39;ve ever seen. I was too busy snarfing down my perfectly cooked salmon to get in on the Lasagna, but from the moans of ecstasy coming from across the table indicated my dinner companion was not only very happy with their meal, but I&#39;d probably lose a finger if I inched over for a bite. No worried, I was too busy enjoying the show my taste buds were being treated to. The fish was cooked perfectly and swam in an appropriate dousing of some sort of amazing browned butter sauce.<br><br>We finished with house made Cannolis and Tiramisu - to die for! I felt like I was eating at Grandma&#39;s house...and all, including drinks, only ran $77 for three people! I will be back - well worth the drive from Newport Beach, even if it&#39;s just for an intimate, casual but amazing meal.",

"reviewcomment":"Three reasons I gave this place 4 stars:<br><br>1) Prices were good. I paid 10 bucks for my breakfast (Chicken Fried Steak n Eggs), and that was on the expensive end of the menu. You can definitely get other entrees for around 8 bucks. The chicken fried steak didn&#39;t have too much flavor, but it wasn&#39;t anything a little salt n lots of gravy couldn&#39;t fix. <br><br>2) Two words for you: biscuits. and. gravy!!! The waitress was a doll and suggested that I sub out my side of toast for a side of biscuits and gravy (because I was going to order the side of BnG separate). It was only a buck extra to sub it, and it was well worth it. One biscuit with gravy took up a significant portion of my stomach (and a whole side plate). Two would have been WAY too much. Deee-lish.<br><br>3) Service was great. The restaurant was decently busy and we didn&#39;t have to wait too long for our food. Our waitress was super attentive and friendly, constantly coming by to make sure we had enough coffee and water.",

I sliced the pickle into thin strips and ate some with every bite of hummos and pita. Yum!!<br><br>We shared the chicken cous cous and it was awesome! It consisted of a large slow-roasted chicken breast on the bone and generous portions of zucchini and carrots over cous cous. The sauce was delicious and the chicken was juicy and flavorful.

"reviewcomment":"Pizza Tuesday happened on Wednesday, as my wife and I returned from the airport. Pizzeria Bruno Napoletano is on Park Boulevard, and we drove through Balboa Park on our way to dinner, a pleasant way to begin the evening. <br><br>Our waitress was personable, competent and interesting, and was knowledgeable about the restaurant&#39;s operation and its menu. There&#39;s something about great service that relaxes me before I ever put a bite into my mouth, that makes the meal so much better.<br><br>We started with tasty Herb-Infused Olives. These aren&#39;t as good as those served at Blind Lady Ale House, but they&#39;re not the same thing, either, and they&#39;re excellent for what they are.<br><br>As we waited for our pizza, I enjoyed a luscious glass of Montepulciano d&#39;Abruzzo, and my wife had a Montalcino, which she enjoyed.<br><br>For dinner, my beloved had her usual, a Margherita pizza, and I continued my search for the Thing-I-Haven&#39;t-Had-That&#39;s-Better-Than-Everything-­I&#39;ve-Had-Before... this time topping a standard pizza (dough, sauce, mozz) with smoked scamorza, portobello slices and crème fraiche. <br><br>To be fair, and to avoid confusion as I go on, let me say plainly that there was nothing wrong with our pizza. Both pies were cooked just right, a bit wet in the middle and pleasingly charred at the edges, with adequate amounts of evenly-spread toppings on both.<br><br>The Margherita was succulent and delicious, bite for bite every bit as good as any pizza we&#39;ve had in Naples or at Buona Forchetta.<br><br>But I should have thought my order through to the end, where all the flavors I combined made a dense, overly rich sensation in my mouth that, as the meal continued, became more burden than blessing. I&#39;m a big guy, and generally clean my plate, but there was no way I was getting through that pie. <br><br>The problem I experienced was self-inflicted. Like the people who move near the airport and are bothered by the noise, like the guy who marries the cute one instead of the smart one (and is bothered by the noise), my dissatisfaction was my own fault, and I take responsibility. <br><br>And the upshot is that Bruno offers great service, excellent execution by the kitchen and quality ingredients. I say,&#34;Five Stars!&#34;... and next time, I&#39;ll just order from the menu.",

The servers are really friendly and they have limited nice outside seating with fire lamps in case you need heat... <br><br>Had gone there vegetarian friends so ended eating veg but still was totally amazing... You can try their sampler plate if you wanna get yourself to taste a major chuck of what they have... A must have is their Saganaki / Flaming cheese (Pan Seared Greek Kassari Cheese finished with Metaxa Brandy and Fresh Lemon Juice)... A really unique and very cheesy dish but totally worth an experience.... I loved their Spanakopita, and Fiery Feta Mac &#39;n Cheese... The presentation of the food made the same just wonderful...<br><br>No matter what you have, make sure to save room for the Baklava. Their Baklawa was out of the charts and a must have according to me... It is the best I have ever had...<br><br>I would highly recommend this to all...",

"reviewcomment":"This place is the best Indian/Himalayan restaurant in SoCal! I used to live in LA/OC and now SD, so I feel pretty strongly about that statement. <br><br>Ambience - simple, not too fancy, just right<br><br>Food - The food is the main story here! It&#39;s is delicious, all of it! First things first, they give everyone a bowl of daal to start which is delicious. Really a home made taste, just like my mom makes. Their main dishes are all good. This isn&#39;t like any other place, because they have unique flavors that are different from other Indian restaurant. That himalayan touch really makes a huge different. My favorite is the paneer tikka masala (note: I&#39;m vegetarian). It&#39;s creamy but balanced and appropriately spicy if you ask for it. And you have to get the garlic naan with it. But I also love the momos. They are really unique, light, and flavorful. Similar to dumplings. My husband loves the Chicken Makhani and the Goat when they have it. <br><br>Price - really reasonable. It makes for an affordable night out with big portions.",

Then he suggested I check in on Yelp to get 2 free garlic knots. Sadly, the wifi didn&#39;t work. <br>Second time I went in the guy behind the counter was obviously new and not very helpful - no sausage pizza for me. Settled for a slice of plain cheese pizza and 2 free garlic knots with marinara. Still yummy but slightly disappointing. <br>ps: slices are gigantic so order one, maybe two with the $9 deal, but don&#39;t let your eyes order or your stomach will probly burst!",

"reviewcomment":"I personally love Bj&#39;s, their jalapeño burger and pizzas are my favorite! Although the salad wasn&#39;t my favorite (which I now mainly order due to my diet) I would give the food here overall 4 stars.<br><br>However, when I went here on Monday with my sister and brother in law, I was SO impressed by the service we got. Our waiter was Mike, who was extremely kind, patient, and did all he can to give us the best service. My brother didn&#39;t really like his pizza but didn&#39;t say anything. Mike came over, and instead of ignoring the fact that my brother wasn&#39;t eating like most waiters would, he asked how can he make it better for him? Was there anything else he wanted? What can I do to make this better for you?<br><br>We were incredibly impressed by such wonderful service, I&#39;ve rarely ever seen that. It&#39;s such a simple gesture that most people tend to ignore, but Mike really did go above and beyond. Our waters were promptly filled, he brought my brother a side of marinara to go with his pizza which my brother said made it MUCH better, and apologized for not recommending me the grilled chicken for my salad since he saw that I peeled off all the deep fried goodness of the crispy chicken that was in my salad, which was completely MY fault for not thinking about it! We were so impressed by the end of the meal we asked to speak to his manager to tell her how much we enjoyed our experience that day and how great Mike was! We will definitely be back!",

Never a &#34; congrats &#34; just super negative.

Great place to try some really good quality and rare beers. Last it&#39;s just a great place to hangout. It&#39;s very casual and everyone there is just there to hang out and have a good time. <br><br>The bartenders have always been great. They know their beers and really make the Beagle what it is. <br><br>Same as last time, try the various sausages (Moroccan lamb is the best) and just go down the list and try each. Have not been disappointed yet. They have 7 different mustards on hand which you can use with the usages or their pretzels which are a great snack (it&#39;s more like a meal). <br><br>Go there if you want to eat. Got there if you like beers/ales, or if you want a great place to just hang out. <br><br>Next time I&#39;m in SD I&#39;ll stop in....again!",

"reviewcomment":"This place is the best Indian/Himalayan restaurant in SoCal! I used to live in LA/OC and now SD, so I feel pretty strongly about that statement. <br><br>Ambience - simple, not too fancy, just right<br><br>Food - The food is the main story here! It&#39;s is delicious, all of it! First things first, they give everyone a bowl of daal to start which is delicious. Really a home made taste, just like my mom makes. Their main dishes are all good. This isn&#39;t like any other place, because they have unique flavors that are different from other Indian restaurant. That himalayan touch really makes a huge different. My favorite is the paneer tikka masala (note: I&#39;m vegetarian). It&#39;s creamy but balanced and appropriately spicy if you ask for it. And you have to get the garlic naan with it. But I also love the momos. They are really unique, light, and flavorful. Similar to dumplings. My husband loves the Chicken Makhani and the Goat when they have it. <br><br>Price - really reasonable. It makes for an affordable night out with big portions.",

God was truly on my side! Harhar.<br><br>We got there at a little after 8 am on a Saturday morning.  Surprisingly, they weren&#39;t as busy as I expected.  They had tables outside on the patio available immediately, but we were able to get seated inside within 5 minutes.  I got the OMG! French Toast and OMG was it delicious!  My taste buds were rejoicing at every bite. I also got a cup of cappuccino to perk me up for the day ahead &amp; wash down all the french toasty goodness.  My husband enjoyed his plate (corn beef hash?) &amp; coffee as well.<br><br>We were in a rush &amp; was able to get in&amp;out within 45 minutes. My husband even got a comfy t-shirt as a souvenir. Overall, the place is really trendy with employees to match ;) I love the vibe and can&#39;t help but reminisce about a favorite childhood show of mine, The Jetsons, everytime I&#39;m in there. I love Snooze!",

Go up to register- pay, sit &amp; wait for your name to be called by the robust looking cook. You know what they say... If the cook is eating the food, it&#39;s goooood! BBQ ribs are large. BBQ sandwich full of your choice of meat-- order mild, medium, or spicy. I ordered medium and added more Sriracha! Special dinner of chicken thigh and leg comes w two sides. 5.99$. Awesome deal. Cash only. Paid about 20$ for 3 amazing tasting BBQ dinners served on a plastic cafeteria tray. No frills here, but you&#39;re here for the food! Went back twice the same week while on vacation. Take out is good too. Packaged sauce proof so no leakage in your car. Sides to order-- cole slaw, potato salad, beans, fries. I didn&#39;t try the other sides of Mac cheese. <br><br>Kiddo ordered corn dog- she ate it. All smiles. I didn&#39;t taste it, but I guess it&#39;s &#34;fine.&#34; Parking in street or Lot. Free parking. Market night tonight on Wednesday... So I ended up walking 3 blocks to get to eat BBQ items that used to have a face. For those veggie Tarians--- they have BBQ veggie platter too.",

Made my decision to move to SD that much easier. <br><br>I got a vegetarian sandwich (don&#39;t remember what it was called but it was the only vegetarian one on the list) and I thought it was amazing. It was my first time trying the SD beers as well and the waitress was wonderful in allowing me to sample a bunch before actually deciding on one. Almost got 4 stars but I&#39;m going with 5 because the side of pickled veggies rocked. <br><br>Next time I&#39;m going to try the pizza because I&#39;ve heard great things about them!",

"reviewcomment":"We were in for wings last night. All you can eat on Tuesdays.  Can&#39;t go wrong.  Right?   The hostess was very accommodating seeing we requested a booth (the only one left) that could have sat 6 even though we were only a party of 2. (Our bad). What started off with five stars quickly diminished to 1 star.  We were on our way out the front door after waiting at least 3-4 minutes to even be greeted by a waitress who stated that &#34;she wouldn&#39;t be taking care of us but she would be glad to get us started on some drinks before our server could help us.&#34;  But we waited about another 5 without seeing our drinks for another server to tell us our beers would be right up. Finally, after a few more minutes, our ACTUAL server approached the table (without our beers basically to verify that we had already placed our drink orders and that she would be right back with them.)  She wasn&#39;t right back...  We waited  as long as we could before we decided it was time to walk out and grab a beer and a bite elsewhere. This was the worst part about our dining experience here.  <br><br>     I want to thank the manager Nick for rectifying this situation quickly.   He caught us on our way out the door and provided quick resolution to the service and our experience.  I probably would say this particular experience deserved 3 1/2 stars max, solely due to the lack of initial service. (I&#39;ve never felt the need to walk out of a spot simply because I waited too long for some drinks...)  There were some other snafus along the way... Like never getting our waters until we had to ask again from another waitress and the wait time on our initial order of wings was a bit long.  I didn&#39;t want to leave 3 stars due to the fact that the manager took good care of us the rest of our stay and I believe her name was Katherine, but she was very helpful while relieving our actual server during her break (who we never caught the name of). The wings were great!   All in all, we left satisfied.  Thanks again Nick!",

"reviewcomment":"Let me start off saying this was my FIRST time visiting this place and have deemed it a perfect place to eat some amazing Mexican food. I will DEFINITELY RETURN, and the following downsides are simply because I was a first timer and went in knowing nothing about this place except it was Mexican food. Ok, so the downsides for me about this place: <br><br>1) I checked in on yelp and noticed we qualified for the 15% off a party of 6+ and after letting the waitress know (who was otherwise extremely attentive) she figured out a way  for us to all be on the same check while all paying for our own orders----that was for nothing, we didn&#39;t get the 15% off and by the time we were leaving we were all tired and ready to go so we didn&#39;t think to make sure on our receipts. (We had 3 children with us, the youngest was asleep in my arms, she&#39;s 6) <br><br>2) As I said, we had 3 children with us, and while there is a children&#39;s menu which is also pretty nice, I&#39;m not sure I would take my daughter back, it&#39;s mainly a bar type place, the decor is pretty much adult humor. We went on a Friday night so I&#39;m assuming this is why they were thrown for a loop a bit to see children with us. You don&#39;t really see many kids hanging out in this area of PB on a Friday night, but I had gone to pick up a friend from work and we decided to walk to dinner since we were all so hungry. <br><br>3) Depending on your definition of a good margarita this place could be the worst or best place for these drinks. For me, it was alright, not great. My friend and I ordered the classic margarita on the rocks for $6 and it was mainly alcohol and very little margarita flavor, I decided to keep mine since the salted rim complimented it well enough for me. My friend send hers back, ordered the Cucumber Margarita at like $11 (which was boasted as a customer favorite) and then sent that back as well because despite letting them know the first one was too strong and requesting less in the next one it was also mainly alcohol and very little flavor. Again, we have a certain taste for Margaritas and this could very well be great for others.  <br><br>Now for the GOOD stuff:<br><br>1) I DEFINITELY got my money&#39;s worth with regards to the main dish. I ordered the Chipotle Beef Braised Burrito and it was DELICIOUS. The Oaxaca cheese, cabbage slices, and sauce slathered on top made this beef burrito taste that much more delicious---my mouth is watering just thinking about it! Good thing I brought home half of it! The burritos are $8 but they are HUGE, mine came with everything the Chipotle Beef Braised Tacos offered AND they added rice and pinto beans. <br><br>2) The waitress was GREAT and had an awesome attitude with us, she was very understanding of us when my friend let her know about the margarita. At first my friend didn&#39;t want to say anything but it was thanks to the extremely attentive waitress that she felt comfortable enough to say something.<br><br>All in all the service was GREAT, food was AMAZING, LOVED the TVs so we can watch a good game while eating, and I will definitely be back--just may decide to not take my child, depending on the time.",

I do not believe that made a difference in my service. <br><br>What we ordered for appetizers were at the sweetbread and the escargot. As for the entrées I went with the beef tenderloin and mashed potatoes. My daughter went for the lamb shank with a white bean confit. And the grand finale was our desserts.

"reviewcomment":"This place is the best Indian/Himalayan restaurant in SoCal! I used to live in LA/OC and now SD, so I feel pretty strongly about that statement. <br><br>Ambience - simple, not too fancy, just right<br><br>Food - The food is the main story here! It&#39;s is delicious, all of it! First things first, they give everyone a bowl of daal to start which is delicious. Really a home made taste, just like my mom makes. Their main dishes are all good. This isn&#39;t like any other place, because they have unique flavors that are different from other Indian restaurant. That himalayan touch really makes a huge different. My favorite is the paneer tikka masala (note: I&#39;m vegetarian). It&#39;s creamy but balanced and appropriately spicy if you ask for it. And you have to get the garlic naan with it. But I also love the momos. They are really unique, light, and flavorful. Similar to dumplings. My husband loves the Chicken Makhani and the Goat when they have it. <br><br>Price - really reasonable. It makes for an affordable night out with big portions.",

"reviewcomment":"I feel bad for Rei do Gado or whatever tthe other Brazilian churrascaria is down the street.  Fogo de Chao is just so top notch for the same price.  Everything is cooked perfectly medium+rare and the service is on-point.  Both times I&#39;ve been here it was a team of servers taking care of us with a head waiter/waitress supervising us, personally.  <br><br>Food was great - I stick with all the beef options and the linguica just because lamb can sometimes be stinky and as for chicken... Meh. No one cares about chicken at a churrascaria - sorry not sorry.  The filet with bacon and the salted sirloin are my top favorites.  <br><br>Salad bar is awesome too.  I load up on the manchego, mozzerella, prosciutto, marinated tomatoes, and artichoke hearts.  I tend to stay away from the beans and other dishes because I need stomach real estate for the meats and CHEESE PUFFS.  Ohhhhhh the cheese puffs... The best thing about Brazilian churrascaria is the existence of cheese puffs.  They have no problem keeping them coming here too.  <br><br>Dinner is served with caramelized plaintain, polenta match sticks and mashed potatoes which are excellent too.  Again, gotta take it easy with these because stomach real estate is valuable. <br><br>Dinner is expensive but worth it.",

"reviewcomment":"So glad we tried this place, although we were on the bar side and the restaurant side looked a little stuffy. The patio was closed, which was a bummer because it feels like summer. They have it decorated really cute with a bunch of foliage and little white lights in just a touch of Midsummer&#39;s Night&#39;s Dream whimsy. <br><br>We sat at the bar and the bartenders were great, I can&#39;t believe they could hear our orders over the live band and other patrons. The band was really fun and played great music, people were dancing so it was a lively scene. The crowd itself was a nice change from a lot of the drunken 20-somethings that frequent nearby OB and PB. These were adults more in late 30s and into their 40s so they were fun and not out of control.<br><br>We got some great apps at the bar, including the raved-about Magic Mushrooms. They were pretty good but probably my least favorite of the appetizers we ordered. They had quality seafood (crab and shrimp) but when it&#39;s chopped small and smothered in cheese it&#39;s good but in a been-there-done-that way. The Roasted Garlic Clove and Brie was insane! They had a creamy, rich hunk of brie cheese served with a whole roasted garlic clove. We squeezed all the warm, caramelized garlic out onto the brie plate as a rich, decadent dip for our garlic bread. Yum! The absolute best thing that I can&#39;t wait to try again is the Sauteed Shrimp and Artichoke Hearts. I love big, succulent  and these were cooked and served better than I imagined. They had a rich and flavorful sauce, salty with capers but also richly flavored with garlic, wine and basil. The artichokes were a perfect partner, and they served us more hunks of garlic bread to dip in the delicious sauce. We completely cleaned our plate.<br><br>I can&#39;t wait to come again to try some entrees. They have great specials during the week including Wine Wednesday with half-price bottles. Will definitely be back.",

Go during the crawfish season, which is typically from March - June.  If you go on an off season, be prepared to give a bad review about their overpriced, small, and frozen crawfish.  <br><br>2. Crabs, clams, corn, crawfish, whatever it may be, get it with their full house sauce and if you&#39;re a weakling and can&#39;t stand spice, don&#39;t get anything above mild. <br><br>3. Park at the Horton Plaza parking lot.  Free for 3 hours and it&#39;s only a 5-10 min stroll.  If a few blocks is too far for you, you can go ahead and circle around downtown and spend countless minutes looking for parking.  <br><br>4. Go during their happy hour M-F 3-7PM to enjoy their cheap alcohol, $1 oysters, and $.50 wings.  <br><br>If you want to further optimize your dining experience, use gloves.  Seriously, I used to look at people using gloves as ridiculous because who wears gloves to eat?  Yes, I do and I have no shame.  Unless you want the lingering taste and smell of crawfish for the rest of the night, put your pride aside and do your fingers and nostrils a favor, just ask for gloves. <br><br>You&#39;re welcome.",

"reviewcomment":"This place is the best Indian/Himalayan restaurant in SoCal! I used to live in LA/OC and now SD, so I feel pretty strongly about that statement. <br><br>Ambience - simple, not too fancy, just right<br><br>Food - The food is the main story here! It&#39;s is delicious, all of it! First things first, they give everyone a bowl of daal to start which is delicious. Really a home made taste, just like my mom makes. Their main dishes are all good. This isn&#39;t like any other place, because they have unique flavors that are different from other Indian restaurant. That himalayan touch really makes a huge different. My favorite is the paneer tikka masala (note: I&#39;m vegetarian). It&#39;s creamy but balanced and appropriately spicy if you ask for it. And you have to get the garlic naan with it. But I also love the momos. They are really unique, light, and flavorful. Similar to dumplings. My husband loves the Chicken Makhani and the Goat when they have it. <br><br>Price - really reasonable. It makes for an affordable night out with big portions.",

They work their butts off but are always lovely, no matter how busy it gets in there. They make the trip worth it! <br><br>All of their sushi is fresh and flavorful. Their roles are creative and delicious. Their hot food is worth a mention too. Its pretty good.

It&#39;s funny because we really like the food here, the Kung Pao Scallops, Mongolian Beef and Honey Shrimp are all favorite entrees and the Salt And Pepper Calamari and the Lettuce Wraps are great starters.<br><br>But for some reason, all the food tastes similar and it&#39;s not really authentic Chinese or even Asian. It&#39;s kind of its own thing with its own distinct taste. Everyone I know comments on this. And,while the food is great, it really is, it has such a distinct taste that I can&#39;t go there very often or I get bored with it.<br><br>So, if you&#39;ve never been try it out. You&#39;ll probably love it. Oh, and the drinks are amazing, especially the Key Lime Martini&#39;s, Nutty Uncle Chang and Buddha&#39;s Dream.<br><br>It&#39;s a very noisy, bustling place so don&#39;t go if you want a quiet or romantic dinner, but if you&#39;re looking for a fun, happening place, it&#39;s perfect.",

"reviewcomment":"It is a very cool concept and different. The atmosphere is amazing- you really think that you may be in a strip club yet... you actually feel comfortable eating there. Check out the bathroom in the mirror- pretty sweet!<br><br>The food:<br><br>Happy hour chicken and waffles were great and so different. Obviously it&#39;s not as good as Roscoe&#39;s but for a steak house I&#39;m pretty impressed. <br><br>The drinks:<br><br>We each went for a fruity martini- $7 each during happy hour. They also had a great selection of local craft beer- always appreciated. <br><br>The food: <br><br>I went for the guinness and garlic steak- it was for sure lacking on the seasoning and i wish i had seasoned it more on the grill but alas i didn&#39;t think i would have to since it was already seasoned in the name. my bad. <br><br>The hubby got the Porterhouse. He liked it as well but for sure had to season the heck out of it. <br><br>The reason for my 4 star instead of 5 is probably just more of a personal preference. My husband has ruined me in that we have a Big Green Egg at home which basically makes the most perfect steak in the entire world. So my expectation for an expensive steak at a restaurant is quite high. <br><br>The provided cooking times are not correct that they give you. I like my steak medium-rare and sometimes on the rare side but when following the times they provided by steak was still mooing. I actually ended up doubling the time and it was still pretty raw. Also, by the time i ate the steak it was charred/burnt on the outside. Probably because I suck at grilling... but it is quite a disappointment when you are paying so much for a meal and you screw up your own food.  *Sidenote the garlic mashed potatoes are HUGE and amazing. <br><br>The service was great- props to Alex our server. All in all i would return if we had people coming in town that wanted this sort of experience but otherwise i would probably just grill at home. Glad to have been there for the experience.",

Period. <br><br>Great lattes, great desserts, very cute ambiance, and always great people to talk to. <br><br>I used to come visit my girlfriend from Irvine when she lived in little Italy, and I loved walking to this cute coffee shop - Cafe Italia. Now, I&#39;ve lived in San Diego for two months and have been to at least 10 other coffee shops in and around San Diego. None of them compare to Cafe Italia. I come to Cafe Italia at least 3 times a week even though I live in East Village. <br><br>Cafe Italia has excellent lattes and cappuccinos. I don&#39;t know how they do it, but their froth is so thick, so creamy, and so damn tasty!! <br><br>Their biscotti&#39;s are to die for. It goes perfectly with anyone of their amazing drinks. Also, I would definitely try their gelato, especially their pistachio gelato. <br><br>Oh! What&#39;s great is that all the old Italian men in town also come to this coffee shop, and they all sit around and speak Italian with their crazy hand gestures.

Just thinking about it right now makes my mouth water! <br><br>Everything was excellently cooked, spiced exactly the way I asked for it to be and the flavors just came together real well. Other Indian restaurants I&#39;ve been to don&#39;t seem to put enough of a mix of spices to make the dish really come alive. Eating the food here is quite truly a treat for my palate. Everyone I&#39;ve brought here has been hooked. I can&#39;t even compare their food to the other Indian restaurants in SD which I have been to. I would rather eat here.<br><br>No the decor isn&#39;t as nice or fancy, the parking lot sucks balls when it&#39;s peak business hours for the strip mall, and for me living in Chula Vista and having to get stuck in rush hour traffic for an hour just to get a fix is always totally worth it. <br><br>If you&#39;re new to Indian or just love good deals and trying lots of food, their lunch buffet is pretty legit. My sister and I discovered the butter chicken this way... however nothing was spicy, to me anyway. I always order everything as spicy they could possibly make it.",

"reviewcomment":"Here&#39;s is how you do it when it comes to Buona Forchetta. <br><br>Do: Plan your dinner in advance. Assemble a group and pick a date and time. <br>Don&#39;t: Show up on a whim. This is not an audible type meal or an afterthought.<br><br>Do: Bring a group. Going back to planning your dinner in advance, groups of six or more can make a reservation. Trust me, this will pay off!<br>Don&#39;t: Show up at peak hours with a party of four, which seems to something half the neighborhood does. You&#39;ll be waiting a while...<br><br>Do: Order family style! The menu decisions are going to be tough so if your group is on board to share, it&#39;s your best bet.<br>Don&#39;t: Refuse to share. You&#39;re going to want to try their food and they&#39;re going to want to try yours - sharing is caring.<br><br>Do: Throw everything on one bill and split it evenly amongst your group. <br>Don&#39;t: Ask for the server to split your six meals six ways. They&#39;re old school here with paper checks and splitting your order up is not only going to screw your table, but the entire restaurant... seriously. <br><br>Do: Order the specials! They&#39;re constantly changing and anything seafood is sure to be a hit.<br>Don&#39;t: Come here looking for spaghetti and meatballs.<br><br>There are so many reviews raving about the food, which are all true, so I found it important to share these simple recommendations to make life a bit easier on everyone when visiting Buona Forchetta.",

"reviewcomment":"After an intense gym sesh downtown I realized just how freaking hungry I was and needed food NOW. I also realized &#34;The Stepper&#34; is my worst enemy and best friend... Anyways, I was craving some quality fish proteins. It was getting late and Morton&#39;s was open till 11pm so the decision was a quick one. <br><br>I don&#39;t even eat steak, but if there is shrimp cocktail on the menu then chances are I have already ordered it before there are drinks on the table. And if it is good shrimp cocktail... we are already off to a great start. Not only was the &#34;jumbo&#34; ( boy they aren&#39;t kidding) shrimp cocktail good, it was served under dry ice!! I was amused by this presentation to say the least. <br><br>It was late so we sat at a table in the bar by the window. Was fun to watch the downtown party-going stragglers stumbling around outside. (I&#39;m into people watching, okay). The bar was cozy and the seats were filled  happy older patrons who had probably had a glass of wine (or 8) by this time. The restaurant itself is actually HUGE and very elegant, though pretty vacant at this hour.<br><br>Service was SUPERB and very friendly... I ordered the BEST lobster I have ever feasted upon! Okay, I haven&#39;t ordered that many lobsters in my lifetime, but it was definitely exceptional.<br><br>Would love to come back on a Friday or Saturday, and would probably omit the Nike&#39;s and throw on a dress next time. Classy place!",

"reviewcomment":"This place is the best Indian/Himalayan restaurant in SoCal! I used to live in LA/OC and now SD, so I feel pretty strongly about that statement. <br><br>Ambience - simple, not too fancy, just right<br><br>Food - The food is the main story here! It&#39;s is delicious, all of it! First things first, they give everyone a bowl of daal to start which is delicious. Really a home made taste, just like my mom makes. Their main dishes are all good. This isn&#39;t like any other place, because they have unique flavors that are different from other Indian restaurant. That himalayan touch really makes a huge different. My favorite is the paneer tikka masala (note: I&#39;m vegetarian). It&#39;s creamy but balanced and appropriately spicy if you ask for it. And you have to get the garlic naan with it. But I also love the momos. They are really unique, light, and flavorful. Similar to dumplings. My husband loves the Chicken Makhani and the Goat when they have it. <br><br>Price - really reasonable. It makes for an affordable night out with big portions.",

"reviewcomment":"One of the nicer taco shops in town. The quality of the mexican food here is a step above the others. Its cleaner and located in a plaza by the chase bank across rhor park. There is a lot available and shared with the other businesses in the plaza. The service is fast, and the staff is nice enough.<br><br>Their california burrito is a lot smaller than others in the area but the quality of meat is much better. The fries come crispy and their pico de gallo is great as well. Their rolled tacos come with guacamole, shredded cheese and sprinkles of cotija cheese. I always ask to add sour cream and pico de gallo on top. The rolled tacos are fried perfectly, and thoughtfully put together. Their carne asada fries and chips are always satisfying both visually and in flavor. The fries come shoestring style, and the chips are fried fresh. They have a salsa bar here with both the red and green hot sauce as well as radishes, carrots, and green onions.<br><br>I can only speak for myself, and i feel that this shop produces above average mexican food. It&#39;s fresher, of better quality, and flavors never disappoint me. I give this place 4 stars.",

"reviewcomment":"I live in OB and this is one of my favorite local spots! Great atmosphere and generally a great crowd of people too, not as many douche bags as you find at Sunshine, Gallagher&#39;s, etc. Their burgers are outstanding (some of the best I&#39;ve had in San Diego) and the&#34; Dirty Jerz&#34; chicken sandwich is frickin&#39; amazing! They have a great beer selection, lots of craft brews, and they also have some good craft cocktails (try the Pisco Drink). If the food and drinks don&#39;t keep you coming back, the staff definitely will. The bartenders rock, super friendly, always willing to pour you a taste of something if you can&#39;t decide what to get, and all the waitstaff are also always awesome. And if you STILL need a reason to go it&#39;s dog friendly on the patio!<br><br>The only downside to this place is that it&#39;s a little on the small side so it&#39;s sometimes a little crowded, but that&#39;s not their fault, it just means it&#39;s a good spot :)",

"reviewcomment":"My husband and I had our wedding at Bamboo Lounge. We held the ceremony in the back terrace and had the reception in their private room. This was followed by dancing and drinks in the main restaurant/bar. The terrace fit about 50 people, and there were 90 who came for the reception. I had so many guests compliment on the delicious appetizers and entrees, which were served buffet style. The ambience in the terrace was romantic, intimate, and classy. The event occurred at sunset and we decorated with flowers, candles, string lights, table cloths, and plate settings. There&#39;s a sound system back there for us to play our own wedding music for the backdrop to the ceremony. The only tip I have is to close the door between the main restaurant and private room because the noise from the restaurant will travel out, I just wished I would have realized this earlier. <br><br>The staff were very accommodating about letting us come early to setup, and making the space our own. They even gave us a complimentary champagne toast! I couldn&#39;t have asked for a more beautiful wedding.",

"reviewcomment":"This place is the best Indian/Himalayan restaurant in SoCal! I used to live in LA/OC and now SD, so I feel pretty strongly about that statement. <br><br>Ambience - simple, not too fancy, just right<br><br>Food - The food is the main story here! It&#39;s is delicious, all of it! First things first, they give everyone a bowl of daal to start which is delicious. Really a home made taste, just like my mom makes. Their main dishes are all good. This isn&#39;t like any other place, because they have unique flavors that are different from other Indian restaurant. That himalayan touch really makes a huge different. My favorite is the paneer tikka masala (note: I&#39;m vegetarian). It&#39;s creamy but balanced and appropriately spicy if you ask for it. And you have to get the garlic naan with it. But I also love the momos. They are really unique, light, and flavorful. Similar to dumplings. My husband loves the Chicken Makhani and the Goat when they have it. <br><br>Price - really reasonable. It makes for an affordable night out with big portions.",

"reviewcomment":"Wow, where do I start?  Well, let me start by saying...  If you&#39;re doing a first date type of thing.  This place is very comforting.  The gf and I spent a nice sunny day at the Birch Aquarium (only about a mile away) and came here for a late lunch.  So glad we did!  <br><br>We were greeted near the entrance by Keith, who also ended up being our server.  Our table was clean, and I was reafy to grub!  With so many beautiful yelp photos, and various menu descriptions that shouted &#34;TRY ME, or no TRY ME, or wait I&#39;m DELICIOUS&#34;.  I just couldn&#39;t decide.  <br><br>For starters, we ordered:<br>~ Salmon Tartare ($12.95) with a glass of Bogle wine ($7.50), a blend.   The tartare had a mix of fresh organic salmon with capers, olive oil, and a hint of lemon.  It was served a la bruschetta-style with small bread triangles and a side salad that I used as a topping.  A real treat, only I prefer the ever common &#39;tuna&#39; tartare instead.  It had capers, in which I liked. Only I can possibly hear opinions saying, &#39;capers make it too salty&#39;. But I still think it&#39;s a good choice!<br><br>~ Pizza Max (15.95) with smoked salmon, crème fraiche, and chives.  Straight from their wood fire oven, this pizza was soft and crispy goodness!  Loved the  crust, and the toasted chives on the salmon was fantastic!  My only thought was, &#39;dayam, I ordered two salmon items already&#39;.  Regardless, it&#39;s also an item worth trying.  <br><br>~ Barbarella Burger with cheddar cheese ($14.45), split in half for the gf and I. Ordered medium-rare, now this was a winner! The bun was good, and the burger was real thick and juicy and had a nice char flavor. Topped with grilled red onion and butter lettuce this burger was near perfect!  Not to mention how good the fries were, with sea salt!  <br><br>~ Chocolate and coffee gelato ($6.95) for dessert. What a way to end a great meal with an expresso and gelato.  Even the expresso cup itself was fancy looking. <br><br>As it got chillier and dust approached, the servers were nice enough to close the collapsible windows. They even turned on the fireplace and offered some old ladies next to us some blankets. So once again, no issue with service.  Our water glasses were always refilled, and Keith was helpful from beginning to end!<br><br>Thank you fellow Yelpers for this &#39;way cool&#39; find!  I already can&#39;t wait to try the French Onion Soup and deep fried donuts next time. Ciao for now, and enjoy!",

"reviewcomment":"I was pleasantly surprised by the food here. I have done vegan cooking in culinary school, but this is on another level. The food was very flavorful and appealing to the eye. Portions were served nicely and the cost was very small, especially with the 10% discount for the yelp check in.<br><br>We started with the summer rolls and wontons. The tofu in the rolls were very firm and sweet, full of flavor that blended well with the vegetables. The wontons had a nice crunch with a chewy, meaty flavor. Great portions for a great price.<br><br>Our entrees were the drunken noodles, a dish that looked like breaded shrimp, and a spicy dish with sautéed vegetables and soy protein - all of which were very good. All of the dishes tasted amazing. Drunken noodles tasted like normal drunken noodles with a soy protein that looked like sliced beef and tasted like beef too. And the breaded &#39;shrimp&#39; also tasted exactly like shrimp, but you could see that they weren&#39;t actual meat because of the texture. The spicy sauté dish was very sweet and flavorful for such a simple dish.<br><br>For desserts, we had the blueberry cheesecake, lemon cheesecake, and pandan cake. I would&#39;ve preferred the cakes be served a bit colder, but they were fruity and tasty.<br><br>Very cozy atmosphere with a nice ambience, until it gets loud and busy haha.<br><br>Our servers were very friendly, except the busser who seemed like she was having a bad day. We got to meet the manager. And made a friend eating here.<br><br>Overall, nice place to get a bite to eat, great food, and great prices. I will probably be coming here again soon to show other friends the delights of vegan food.",

This place has hands down the best hummus I&#39;ve ever tasted. I wanted to sit there and eat it all day but they brought the feast and wow it was huge!! Everything was delicious--the beef kabob was the best. I didn&#39;t care for the cream chop (fried chicken  patty) but everything else was amazing. Chicken kabobs, shwarma, chicken, rice...im drooling now and i just hada big meal. The pita bread was fresh and warm. They&#39;re bigger than your face so if you need a quick facial...the steam will clear out your pores instantly. But I recommend eating it. Just sayin&#39;.<br><br>I came here a couple days ago and every day I&#39;ve thought about it. That just goes to show you how much this place rocks!! it is a discouraging 20 miles away from my place so I will need to convince people to go with me or find some reason to go to the area. :(",

"reviewcomment":"This place is incredible. Not only because it is Greek Food, but because it is All You Can Eat Greek Food! Wow! Been to many Greek Restaurants on both coasts, but have never encountered an AYCE Greek place. Not even in Tarpon Springs, FL (Which happens to be home to the largest Greek community outside of Greece in the US)<br><br>The restaurant is on a street that is mainly car repair shops. There is one right across the street from this restaurant. Their parking lot is behind the restaurant. It is tiny, but serves the purpose. From Broadway, turn on D street right behind the restaurant to park your car. And then you&#39;ll need to walk around towards the front for the entrance, which is facing Broadway. <br><br>The food is incredibly fresh. Their salads especially were crispy. There were some items I&#39;ve never seen before. Like the Tabouli, which is Parsley Salad. The country of Greece consists of many tiny islands, and depending on which Greek restaurant you pick, you might find items that are different than other Greek restaurants. I&#39;ve even been to Kentro Greek Kitchen in Fullerton and they didn&#39;t have the Tabouli. (I&#39;ll have to write a review for that restaurant as well.)<br><br>Their self-serve food area is kept clean and the food is replenished as soon as possible. The best time to go would be around 6 pm. It gets busy very quickly. The staff was working hard in cleaning the tables and getting them ready for the next round of customers. The drinks aren&#39;t included in the price of $12.95 per person which is more than reasonable for the quality of food you get. <br><br>They even have the food serving area &#34;Greek Themed&#34; with beautiful arches and pillars built into the wall structure, paying homage to the beautiful historical landmarks in Greece. The dessert/chocolate fountain area has a gorgeous mosaic tiled art depicting traditional Greek dancers performing a folk dance. Not a lot of people pay attention to such things.  I do. Because this whole restaurant is decorated pleasantly, and without a doubt, the owner hoped to give the customers a unique dining experience, in which the customers can appreciate not only delicious Greek food; but also appreciate the rich cultural and historic heritage of Greece too!<br><br>Well done indeed! I will; without a shred of a doubt, return to this restaurant on my next visit to SoCal.",

"reviewcomment":"This place has definitely earned it&#39;s fifth star from me.<br><br>- Dive, dive, dive, but with the lights on it&#39;s surprisingly clean. No rips or tears in the booths or stools - well maintained with an old school vibe. <br><br>- Drinking on a dime. Hard to find these days but Nunu&#39;s keeps it real.<br><br>- That damn fried food! Healthy no, but one of their grilled cheese sandwiches or their sampler platter will add a few extra hours to your drinking schedule.<br><br>- The bloody is a must on a Saturday or Sunday morning. Took a while for me to order it, but it didn&#39;t disappoint. Half meal, half drink, all good.<br><br>- Now with windows! So, they added a window, which I think takes away from the dive bar experience, but it&#39;s always closed and there&#39;s a big black shade over it making it virtually invisible. Defeats the purpose? Nah, adds to the charm.",

"reviewcomment":"This is a review for the weekend brunch. We came last Sunday around 11:45a to a fairly empty restaurant. My first impressions were that it was very cute, cool neighborhood, open patio, beautifully decor&#39;ed (it is a wine bar after all) and $8 bottomless mimosas are a real bargain. The menu is limited during brunch but frittatas and waffles were excellent and reasonably priced. Even long after we paid our bill, our waiter still came around refilling our drinks. I would absolutely recommend it for a casual weekend brunch date. Minus one star for no air conditioning inside and the no substitutions rule even if you are willing to pay a little more. <br><br>TIP: Everyone in your party must be 21! The waiter asked to see everyone&#39;s IDs and I told him I wasn&#39;t drinking since I was the DD. He said it didn&#39;t matter- it&#39;s a wine bar.",

"reviewcomment":"Took my girlfriend here for dinner a few months back and it was intimate, friendly, and the food was great. If you&#39;re into healthy food and cannot stomach rich, luxurious food, then this is not the place for you. But if you can take a break from the kale salads and carrot sticks for a night and just revel in life and french food, make a reservation and go to this restaurant. The waiter made us feel like we were in our own personal restaurant with his humor, suggestions, and happy, professional demeanor. We ordered too much food of course, and enjoyed the bottomless sparkling water that just kept coming to our table magically during the entire course of the meal.  I have honestly not seen better service at any other restaurant since I started doing this yelp review thing.. :) <br>This is a perfect date-restaurant, guys, and a wonderful place to share with your husband/wife, you married couples out there...<br><br>The bagettes here are also something worth coming for: my suggestion is to actually find out when they&#39;re coming out of the oven and wait in line and buy a few when they&#39;re still warm.",

"reviewcomment":"This is the first Korean restaurant my husband and I have gone to since recently moving to San Diego, thanks to Marc&#39;s recommendation over at the nearby LensCrafters. <br><br>We didn&#39;t realize until we got there that lunch prices do not apply during the weekend, but we ended up ordering a combo that has the same lunch and dinner price. (around $22.99) It was hard to decide what to order, since there are so many delicious items on the menu!<br><br>As for our combo, the bulgogi, seafood tofu soup, and all of the refillable side dishes were incredibly delicious - comfort food to the max! It came with two bowls of rice, which is nice. I was surprised the server didn&#39;t ask us what level of spiciness for the soup we&#39;d prefer, but maybe there aren&#39;t different levels of spiciness. <br><br>We enjoyed the cozy atmosphere and appreciate the friendliness of our server. Another staff member welcomed us when we first walked in and happily brought us a second set of side dishes when we asked. (although she cleared away the other dishes even though we hadn&#39;t finished everything yet) <br><br>We plan to return in the future!",

"reviewcomment":"This place is the best Indian/Himalayan restaurant in SoCal! I used to live in LA/OC and now SD, so I feel pretty strongly about that statement. <br><br>Ambience - simple, not too fancy, just right<br><br>Food - The food is the main story here! It&#39;s is delicious, all of it! First things first, they give everyone a bowl of daal to start which is delicious. Really a home made taste, just like my mom makes. Their main dishes are all good. This isn&#39;t like any other place, because they have unique flavors that are different from other Indian restaurant. That himalayan touch really makes a huge different. My favorite is the paneer tikka masala (note: I&#39;m vegetarian). It&#39;s creamy but balanced and appropriately spicy if you ask for it. And you have to get the garlic naan with it. But I also love the momos. They are really unique, light, and flavorful. Similar to dumplings. My husband loves the Chicken Makhani and the Goat when they have it. <br><br>Price - really reasonable. It makes for an affordable night out with big portions.",

The restaurant wasn&#39;t packed but they do have quite a few customers.<br><br>She sat us at the bar, which allowed us to see our sushi chef work his magic. Drinks were served &amp; we ordered our sushi rolls.We ordered entirely from the happy hour menu, which is from 4-6PM. For the first round we shared the California roll, Golden roll, AKA roll, &amp; Windy Roll. We loved the golden &amp; aka! In fact, we loved it so much we had to order it again the 2nd round. We also got the Philadelphia roll, which was just okay but the golden &amp; aka takes the cake. By the way, the beer here is cheap during happy hour! Where else can you get get a Sculpin for $2?<br><br>Overall, great place! Friendly servers &amp; chefs, who constantly checked up on us and good food at a great price. Parking was empty when I got here around 5, but it was pretty full after we left -- which is no surprise here at Convoy. Anyways,  give this place a shot.

"reviewcomment":"Lorna&#39;s is as comfortable and reliable as an old friend. Where else can you get a generous and steaming hot mountain of  Fusilli Roma Pasta to go for $12.75? This entree includes mushrooms, spinach and pancetta in Lorna&#39;s homemade fresh tomato sauce, plus fusilli pasta. My to-go order came with some mozzarella melted on top. The sauce is so full of flavor that I forgot to add Parmesan cheese. <br><br>Lorna&#39;s marinara sauce currently beats Filippi&#39;s, and many other restaurants. Sometimes I&#39;m in the mood for the chicken florentine for $15.75, which has a tender boneless chicken breast &amp; spinach in a tomato wine sauce, with melty provolone. A surprisingly satisfying vegetarian entree is the linguini primavera with fresh veggies, olive oil, garlic, herbs &amp; shallots for $13.50. <br><br>The Italian sub for $9 is great, with salami, pepperoni, mortadella, ham, provolone cheese, tomato &amp; lettuce, all baptized in an excellent Italian vinaigrette.<br><br>They have Neapolitan style pizzas, and sometimes we&#39;re in the mood for the Golden Triangle special pizza, with fresh garlic &amp; basil, and artichoke hearts, broccoli and ricotta cheese. Anchovy lovers, notice they have these babies on their list of ingredients. <br><br>The actual pasta for Joy&#39;s Tortellini isn&#39;t what&#39;s homemade here, but the filling is home-made, and the tortellini is stuffed in house. The sauces are homemade as well. <br><br>Look for Homemade pumpkin tortellini accented with brown butter and sage sauce in the fall, on the specials board. It&#39;s a delish seasonal specialty. <br><br>Look for Lorna&#39;s coupons on their paper menus. Currently, with a coupon you get a 1/2 price bottle of wine or beer on the nights of Tuesday through Thursday. <br><br>Lorna&#39;s is a casual neighborhood restaurant where the owner and staff will recognize you and remember you if you become a regular. <br><br>Sexier restaurants have come and gone since Lorna&#39;s opened in 1988. And still Lorna&#39;s remains, surviving the economy and many changes. What&#39;s their secret? Is it in the tasty homemade marinara or tomato sauce? Maybe customers appreciate their generous portions. <br><br>Tonight I discovered Lorna&#39;s curled up in the corner of my heart like a purring kitten. Why? Because unlike some other &#34;fancy&#34; restaurants, you&#39;ll never leave Lorna&#39;s hungry. And because I&#39;m remembering one dinner when we were celebrating the New Year, and the owner recognized us and generously gave us a bottle of wine, which made our evening special. And guess what? Those were the days before I started yelping.  <br><br>Lorna&#39;s is in a little strip mall with Vons and Rite-Aid, at the corner of Genesee and Governor drive. I&#39;ve been revisiting Lorna&#39;s over the years since they opened. If you are in the area, give them a try. It&#39;s a mile or 2 south of the Westfield UTC mall.",

"reviewcomment":"Pho-tastic!!<br><br>Great spot with parking lot and tons of yummy food. And it&#39;s right in PB! What else can you ask for?  <br><br>There are only two vietnamese places in PB and this one is definitely the winner. Their menu is extensive. It seems to be a  family run place. Service is lightning fast. You pick, you order and in less than 5 minutes, your order will be in front of you. Big giant portion of it!<br><br>This place wins in every way. For a good $6 , you can get a massive bowl of pho! For $1.50 more, you can have double the meat! Or spend one more dollar and go for a large bowl. Two of us shared the regular pho and bun salad. There were so much left overs! <br><br>First time around we did pho and bun!<br>Pho- I got the special beef. It was light, tasty and all around delicious.<br>Bun- Bun salad with shrimp and fried tofu. The sauce has peppers in it. Gives it a nice little kick.  This was a little more on the pricier side of the menu but still great.<br><br>Second time was the take out- <br>I had the pork chop com diet (rice plate) with pork skin and soup to go. And extra noodles on the side for $1.50. <br>Rice- harder than rock pebbles and stone crab claws. It was not edible!<br>Grilled pork strips - they gave me pork strips instead of the pork chop that I ordered. Oh well. It was still tasty though. And that pork skin noodle salad was kind of amazing. They also forgot to give me the soup but I&#39;m glad they didn&#39;t forget my extra noodle order.<br><br>Over all, this place is good. Cheap good food with fresh ingredients. They are perfect when dining in. Taking out, just make sure to double check your order. I&#39;d definitely go back when I&#39;m in PB next!",

"reviewcomment":"I love love love the vegan options here. I&#39;m not a vegan, but when vegan food is that good, I can&#39;t resist.<br><br>I first tried this because they have a booth at the SDSU farmers market on Thursdays, serving a few great options. I spent a semester buying their food every single Thursday. Finally, I decided to try the full restaurant and I&#39;m so glad I did. <br><br>First, we ordered the iced tea, and it was unlike any iced tea I have ever had. It had a strong flavor of cloves which I normally associate with hot drinks, but it was so refreshing in the iced tea!<br><br>My favorite food is the nyoyo, a vegan hominy dish. That&#39;s what I always got at SDSU, so I ordered it there, with a side of wali (rice). The waitress said that if I picked out a third side, we would end up saving money. I didn&#39;t really believe her, but I went with it and ordered the dengu (lentils). My hubs wasn&#39;t super hungry so we decided to share, since we figured three things would be plenty. It was. After what seemed like no time at all, we got a big, full plate of the three things, with a delicious piece of flat bread served with it. We ate every bit. <br><br>When we got the bill, it was just over $8. $8! For all that food, and the iced tea?! I was shocked. I would go back again, any day. <br><br>Delicious, quick, inexpensive, filling, flavorful. I can&#39;t think of a reason to not give it 5 stars. I would eat here constantly if I lived closer.",

"reviewcomment":"This place is the best Indian/Himalayan restaurant in SoCal! I used to live in LA/OC and now SD, so I feel pretty strongly about that statement. <br><br>Ambience - simple, not too fancy, just right<br><br>Food - The food is the main story here! It&#39;s is delicious, all of it! First things first, they give everyone a bowl of daal to start which is delicious. Really a home made taste, just like my mom makes. Their main dishes are all good. This isn&#39;t like any other place, because they have unique flavors that are different from other Indian restaurant. That himalayan touch really makes a huge different. My favorite is the paneer tikka masala (note: I&#39;m vegetarian). It&#39;s creamy but balanced and appropriately spicy if you ask for it. And you have to get the garlic naan with it. But I also love the momos. They are really unique, light, and flavorful. Similar to dumplings. My husband loves the Chicken Makhani and the Goat when they have it. <br><br>Price - really reasonable. It makes for an affordable night out with big portions.",

Everything I had was awesome! <br><br>Best carne asada fries ever!!! Well, actually, I got surf n turf fries, which were basically carne asada fries with giant, garlicky shrimp. I&#39;m pretty sure they also use some sort of garlicky white sauce that you would find on a fish taco, rather than sour cream. It was awesome. For the first time ever, I actually ran out of fries. Yes, there were that many toppings. I just got these yesterday and I&#39;m already thinking about eating them again. <br><br>The pork chile verde burrito was to die for. Big chunks of pork that have the flavor of being fried or grilled on the flat top. Seriously, delicious. <br><br>Highly recommended.",

I like Buca because I know my food will be hot, will taste good and will receive great service.<br>However this location is quite terrible especially on Saturday nights cuz gaslamp is cray cray. Expect to pay $15 for valet from buca because you aren&#39;t gonna find any street parking. <br>Celebrated my birthday here and made reservations for 9ppl<br>We found all day public parking for $20 about 2 blocks away and decided that would be best since we were going bar hopping afterwards.<br>Everything here is &#34;family style&#34; portions meaning if you ordered the &#34;large&#34; size you could probably feed ~4 people. We were a party of 9 and ordered the ziti (cheesy baked pasta), stuffed chicken, supremo pizza and cheesy garlic bread $10. Every entree was about $30-35. They didn&#39;t charge us gratuity so that was nice.<br>They do a lot of cute things: souvenir birthday card, sing for you (cookie for your birthday?), souvenir pictures ( you get a small pix for free but the rest you must pay for!)<br>Service is wonderful!

The things that really sold me were the garlic sauce and turkish coffee lol. Those two things instantly reminded me of my travels. The garlic sauce is a certain texture and consistency that I have had trouble finding in the US for years!<br><br>Prices are a little high, but the portions are large and the food is pretty rich tasting. I highly recommend their chicken shwarma sandwich, it&#39;s yummy and a comfort food for me. Their platters come out on small dishes, but it&#39;s definitely A LOT of food. Their pita is freshly baked and the baklava is wonderfully decadent!<br><br>If you like middle eastern food, this place will not disappoint!",

Each time I&#39;ve been to this location I&#39;ve never really experienced a wait. <br><br>The mango roll here is one of my favorites since I don&#39;t think it&#39;s available at Niban.

"reviewcomment":"This place is the best Indian/Himalayan restaurant in SoCal! I used to live in LA/OC and now SD, so I feel pretty strongly about that statement. <br><br>Ambience - simple, not too fancy, just right<br><br>Food - The food is the main story here! It&#39;s is delicious, all of it! First things first, they give everyone a bowl of daal to start which is delicious. Really a home made taste, just like my mom makes. Their main dishes are all good. This isn&#39;t like any other place, because they have unique flavors that are different from other Indian restaurant. That himalayan touch really makes a huge different. My favorite is the paneer tikka masala (note: I&#39;m vegetarian). It&#39;s creamy but balanced and appropriately spicy if you ask for it. And you have to get the garlic naan with it. But I also love the momos. They are really unique, light, and flavorful. Similar to dumplings. My husband loves the Chicken Makhani and the Goat when they have it. <br><br>Price - really reasonable. It makes for an affordable night out with big portions.",

And at around $10 for a typical huge entree portion, it really is a steal.<br><br>Cesar was helping us, and was sure to get us a box for leftovers when my SO asked. I had the chicken kabob entree &amp; it is the best in san diego, hands down. The lady had a chicken bowl entree and loved it. This is an affordable &amp; healthy lunch/dinner option. I wish there were more central locations, there is nothing in the PB/Clairemont/UTC type area. I make do with Daphne&#39;s, but Luna is much better and bigger portions. <br><br>I really appreciate businesses that take social media seriously.

Kind of disappointing because I LOVE pad thai. <br><br>I am a vegetarian so I am still stoked about the menu and will be back to try something other than the pad thai. Service was great though! .",

But when I do...yumm!<br><br>I actually love the salad dressings at their very well put together salad bar too. And I&#39;m uber picky about dressings. I like almost all of theirs, especially the sesame ginger. <br><br>And oh the goddess bars!! It&#39;s like all these seeds and chocolate chips stuck together in a brownie style way. Freakin&#39; delicious! And did you know that if you like something that they make there and you don&#39;t see it, you can order as much or as little as you like and they will have it ready for you in 1-2 days? That&#39;s what I call service! <br><br>Parking can suck, but I know they are buying or already did buy the house next door and are going to make more parking.

"reviewcomment":"This place has always been on my bucket list because it looks so cute from the outside! Last week I finally got around to checking it out. <br><br>This place is located in la jolla and it is about a 5 minute drive from the beautiful windansea beach. There is not much parking in the front of the restaurant but they have a very nice sized parking lot in the back! I was very impressed because I thought it would be a measly teeny tiny parking lot but it is actually a fair size. This shop looks like a cute little diner and you can tell that most of it&#39;s customers were regulars. There are booths, tables, and even counter top dining. The diner is a little dim which gives it it&#39;s vintage look. This restaurant has been around for a long time so you can tell that they are trying to preserve the look which I absolutely love. <br><br>I ordered the corned beef hash because that is my absolutely favorite go-to breakfast meal. I really liked their corned beef hash because they make it very crispy which gave it a lot of texture. If you&#39;re a corned beef hash maniac like I am you will be pleased with theirs. The corned beef hash comes with toast, hash brows, and eggs. It is a very good sized meal and I couldn&#39;t even finish it all which is saying a lot considering I normally finish my corned beef hash meals. I also ordered the expresso milkshake which me and my boyfriend shared. Now of course if you&#39;re lactose like me you will definitely need a lactaid pill before drinking this!! It has a lot of dairy so beware fellow lactose friends. Anyways, this drink was VERY unique! It almost taste like avocado to me? But my boyfriend said I was trippin. This milkshake is very strong with expresso and the banana is strongly influenced within the drink. It is a very thick texture so it&#39;s a little hard to get through the straw at first. Although it wasn&#39;t my favorite drink I think it was definitely very interesting and a fun experience. <br><br>I would come to this cute little coffee shop again. It is a nice place to start off the day especially if you&#39;re going to be hanging out in beautiful la jolla!",

Just a heads up, these are really really thick and fat noodles. The noodles themselves are very filling. The soup is very flavorful and comes out super hot. Beef and tendon are really tender and perfectly cooked. The beef rolls are an item that everyone should try. Other noteworthy items include their stewed tofu, the wontons in chili oil, and the dan dan noodles. <br><br>Service her can be lacking at times. Waters won&#39;t get refilled and you will have to flag down a waiter if you need anything. It&#39;s an Asian place so I&#39;m not too shocked at he lack of service. This place cranks out some serious eats though so thats why I gave it 4 stars",

"reviewcomment":"This place is the best Indian/Himalayan restaurant in SoCal! I used to live in LA/OC and now SD, so I feel pretty strongly about that statement. <br><br>Ambience - simple, not too fancy, just right<br><br>Food - The food is the main story here! It&#39;s is delicious, all of it! First things first, they give everyone a bowl of daal to start which is delicious. Really a home made taste, just like my mom makes. Their main dishes are all good. This isn&#39;t like any other place, because they have unique flavors that are different from other Indian restaurant. That himalayan touch really makes a huge different. My favorite is the paneer tikka masala (note: I&#39;m vegetarian). It&#39;s creamy but balanced and appropriately spicy if you ask for it. And you have to get the garlic naan with it. But I also love the momos. They are really unique, light, and flavorful. Similar to dumplings. My husband loves the Chicken Makhani and the Goat when they have it. <br><br>Price - really reasonable. It makes for an affordable night out with big portions.",

"reviewcomment":"I had been craving pupusas for months...maybe close to a year when I last visited El Salvadoreno. Why did I wait so long? I have no clue....maybe because I didnt want to put on my bullet proof vest. The neighborhood isn&#39;t the most inviting but the restaurant itself is clean and welcoming. I have to say that it was well worth the wait. <br><br>I obviously went with the purpose to devour multiple tasty pupusas....which i did. But I was also drawn to the tamales for some reason and they looked good on the menu.  The pork tamale was absolutely perfect, filled with moist marinated pork, potatoes and chilies. So good that I even ordered more to take home.  These little banana leaf wrapped El Salvadorian tamales are culinary gift to the world or at least to my taste buds. <br><br>The pupusas were exactly what I was expecting......awesomeness! I ordered the revueltas and loaded them with curtido and salsa. What a great experience I had especially because I waited soooo long to visit. Service is good, prices are even better and the food....well you already know.  Anyone wanting to try to change things up a bit and not be disappointed need to try this little gem out.",

When we arrived, there were groups of people standing around outside waiting for their names to be called, but the wait is quick (10-15 minutes) and worth it. There are booths available, but most patrons are seated up at the counter, which makes for the best experience. <br><br>For breakfast I ordered The Combo, which is two eggs any style, a choice of either 2 slices of bacon or 2 sausages, and pancakes. A few bucks more upgrades your pancakes to any of the other pancake selections noted on the menu; I ordered a nice stack of chocolate chip pancakes. <br><br>Clayton&#39;s also has non-breakfast items as well. They&#39;re supposedly known for their pies that have large &#34;dome&#34; tops. Their caramel apples that sit upon the countertop also look tempting. <br><br>Service here is wonderful and quick for being such a busy breakfast spot.",

I used to live in LA/OC and now SD, so I feel pretty strongly about that statement. <br><br>Ambience - simple, not too fancy, just right<br><br>Food - The food is the main story here! It&#39;s is delicious, all of it! First things first, they give everyone a bowl of daal to start which is delicious. Really a home made taste, just like my mom makes. Their main dishes are all good. This isn&#39;t like any other place, because they have unique flavors that are different from other Indian restaurant. That himalayan touch really makes a huge different. My favorite is the paneer tikka masala (note: I&#39;m vegetarian). It&#39;s creamy but balanced and appropriately spicy if you ask for it. And you have to get the garlic naan with it. But I also love the momos. They are really unique, light, and flavorful. Similar to dumplings. My husband loves the Chicken Makhani and the Goat when they have it. <br><br>Price - really reasonable. It makes for an affordable night out with big portions.",

The mix of onions,cheese and steak definitely hit the spot and with that warm toasty outside and soft inside of the bun it made it all that much better. i choose the buffalo sandwich it was delicious as well but I pretty much regretted not getting the cheesesteak after trying my gfs sandwich but it was still good.<br><br>We also had the garlic cheez fries which were delicious only thing is make sure you have a mint or gum for afterwards but the garlic breath would still be worth it hahah.

"reviewcomment":"Had a groupon for this place and I am so glad that I tried this restaurant. Bf and I went for a day early Vday dinner since we knew that it was going to be packed the next day, and also, the groupon stated that it wasnt valid for Vday, but I sure did not mind! <br><br>We were served with complimentary bread, chimichurri, some type of herb butter and olive stuff which i didnt like, but oh my! their chimichurri was AWESOME! I guess it was supposed to be for the steak, but i used it for my bread and it was delicious!<br><br>Our main dish was Parrillada &#34;El Conventillo&#34; for $44. It had short ribs, skirt steak, flap meat steak, chorizo sausage, blood sausage and sweetbreads served on a sizziling platter. It was alot of food for two people, but everything was yummy in the exception of the blood sausage. For some reason, I did not like the taste of it. It was my first time trying blood sausage and I like pork/beef blood dishes, but the taste of the blood sausage didnt appeal to my palate. <br><br>Service was good. Wish the server interacted more, but he was nice. I will be coming back to this place for sure.",

"reviewcomment":"&#34;YEAHHHH MEATTTT!&#34; screamed my inner testosterone.<br><br>I came here for dinner and was pleasantly surprised to see the hustle, bustle, and bellows of orders amongst the staff. The aroma of Godly cajun spice was trapped in the restaurant, and it enveloped me completely. Man, this is gonna be good. I wasn&#39;t disappointed.<br><br>1 Hamburger, All the Way (see their menu, it&#39;s all the toppings in the color &#39;black&#39;). 1 Little Cajun fries. 1 regular drink.<br><br>Ok, here is the breakdown. On my burger, the &#34;all the way&#34; option gives you everything a burger from Five Guys requires to give you maximum satisfaction. There is an additional row of ingredients you can toss on (in the color &#39;red&#39;), I chose relish. The burger itself is INCREDIBLY juicy, and the juices that snuck onto my jeans reminded me of one of those model chicks in the Carls Jr commercial except.. I&#39;m a dude.. and I don&#39;t have a &#34;bossom&#34; like that.. moving on..<br><br>My &#34;little&#34; cajun fries order turned out out to be a HEARTY (that means, g&#39;damn) scoop of fries! I&#39;d say equivalent to the order size of my friends who ordered a combined &#34;Regular&#34; and &#34;Little&#34;! AWESOME! Their scented cajun powers overwhelmed my nostrils but my taste buds oozed happiness.<br><br>The regular drink is just a drink but their MACHINE .. oh boy .. the MACHINE was AWESOME! Click on a soda button thinking, &#34;meh, sure I&#39;ll take that&#34; and then say, &#34;what?! there&#39;s MORE?!&#34; Yup. There is. #muchchoice #suchhappy #wow.<br>Examples include: Coca-Cola becoming; Vanilla Coke, Cherry Coke, Cocaine, Etc Coke. Or Root Beer showing; Vanilla Root Beer, Regular. WOW.<br><br>All in all, AWESOME! Loved it! :D",

"reviewcomment":"I came by here on a Saturday evening, 1.5 week ago with my husband. We read all of the high rated reviews (at the time of this review, overall rating is 4 stars) and decided we would dine here. <br><br>We came in here around 7:45 pm and this place was packed (this place is kind of on the small side though) and no tables available. The hostess asked if we had a reservation. Since we didn&#39;t, she offered us to either dine at the bar (as there no one was sitting there, there is about 6 or so seats available) immediately or wait for a table (but it was uncertain how long the wait would be). We opted for the bar seating. The bartender who was taking care of us was nice and attentive. After we placed our order, the hostess came up to us and said there was a table available but since we had attentive service from the bartender, we decided to stay. Anyways, this is what we ordered:<br><br>Pollo Marsala- For this dish, you can choose to have this chicken entree made with the following style: marsala, piccata, or parmigiana. This entree was more than enough for actual feed 2 people, but since I loved how incredibly tender the chicken was and the sauce that I ate the whole thing myself (well I did share some w/ my husband). The mashed potatoes that comes w/ this entree went excellent with the marsala sauce. I also really liked the vegetables that came with this dish (assorted vegetables that includes carrots, mushrooms &amp; aparagus). Overall, this dish was an excellent decision and I would order this again (perhaps next time I can just eat half and save the other half for another meal). <br><br>Brasato- Incredibly fall off the bone tender (boneless) short ribs. The sauce was just perfect with the meal and mashed potatoes as well. The vegetables (bell pepper slices, green beans, carrots) were made perfectly and complemented the dish. Loved the balance of the entire dish, as nothing overpowered anything and left a memorable impression on my taste buds. Recommend this dish and would order this again as well. <br><br>We also were given a basket of complementary warm sliced bread with olive oil and balsamic vinegar and added seasonings to dip it in. Since we were pretty hungry, we just dug right in (forgot to take a photo of that, hunger before photo... next time).<br><br>Overall, service was excellent and food was impeccable. Granted pricing is rather pricey, but the portions are generous and this is fine dining at it&#39;s best. By the way, this restaurant is located in the same plaza as Von&#39;s, specifically a few doors down from Golden Coast Bagel (where you can poach off their, unprotected, wifi during your dinner since this place doesn&#39;t have wifi). Also thought I would mention that there is plenty of parking as well.",

"reviewcomment":"Hafa Dai? Shoot, it&#39;ll take me half a day to get rid of the sluggish feeling I get after gorging myself in red rice and kelaguen. But in all seriousness...<br><br>The food is good. It&#39;s filling, and it&#39;s a step away from all the local &#34;Hawaiian&#34; grinds out there (IE: the Hawaiian chains that dot every city). Quite honestly, this is the food I grew up with, but in the Filipino sense and it&#39;s comforting. But enough about that. Let&#39;s get into the deets.<br><br>THE DIGS:<br><br>Short and simple: it&#39;s small, cozy and well... nothing too spectacular. Situated in a plaza of other shops, it&#39;s like any other mom and pop shop just trying to crank out good food to its loyal customers.<br><br>THE GRINDS:<br><br>Considering much of  the food is the standard barbeque plate lunch, I&#39;ll highlight two Chamorro Dishes that sets this aside from Hawaiian restaurants.<br><br>Kadun Pika: My favorite dish thus far! The nice, tender pieces of leg meat soak up the spicy coconut broth beautifully, and the extra bit of sauce makes the red rice ten times more enjoyable (although the rice is fine as is =D). Add a douse of finadene (shoyu-like sauce with peppers and onions) and you&#39;re set. If you dig a kick, this simplistically comfortable dish is for you.<br><br>Chicken Kelaguen: This tart, tangy dish is the pulutan of all pulutans, if you know what I mean. Just crack open a beer and you&#39;re set. The meat is never dried out and the green onions mixed in help to cut the sourness. <br><br>Overall, it&#39;s a pretty good joint. I&#39;d give it about 3.8-3.9 for the food, and 4.0 for the service. If you&#39;ve never had Chamorro food but you enjoy Hawaiian/local food, you&#39;ll enjoy this place.",

I used to live in LA/OC and now SD, so I feel pretty strongly about that statement. <br><br>Ambience - simple, not too fancy, just right<br><br>Food - The food is the main story here! It&#39;s is delicious, all of it! First things first, they give everyone a bowl of daal to start which is delicious. Really a home made taste, just like my mom makes. Their main dishes are all good. This isn&#39;t like any other place, because they have unique flavors that are different from other Indian restaurant. That himalayan touch really makes a huge different. My favorite is the paneer tikka masala (note: I&#39;m vegetarian). It&#39;s creamy but balanced and appropriately spicy if you ask for it. And you have to get the garlic naan with it. But I also love the momos. They are really unique, light, and flavorful. Similar to dumplings. My husband loves the Chicken Makhani and the Goat when they have it. <br><br>Price - really reasonable. It makes for an affordable night out with big portions.",

This place is pretty big and spacious. I always come in the evening/late night assuming that it would be busy, but it usually isn&#39;t. There&#39;s plenty of tables and seats available. <br><br>Recently, I came for Taco Tuesday. They had $2 tacos, $4 patron shots, BOGO free Jell-O shots and a special on Mexican beers that I can&#39;t seem to recall. My group and I started off with free samples of daiquiris. Bob Marley, 4-Play, Miss America and True Blood are my favorites! This night, I settled for True Blood. Though it was Taco Tuesday, there was also a check-in offer on yelp that offered 20% off my entree with an order of daiquiri, so I ordered the Drunken Chicken Sandwich. Everything about this meal was amaaaaazing. The mini bulgogi burgers are delicious as well.<br><br>I love this place and the friendly atmosphere. It&#39;s a great place to hang out and grab icy drinks with a group of friends. They usually have daily specials, so definitely check this place out if you haven&#39;t yet!",

"reviewcomment":"This is my favorite restaurant in San Diego! And I love exploring food, flavors, and natural goodness so I promise my taste buds aren&#39;t lame! <br><br> I usually go with the special of the night. My fiancé ordered the chicken, hesitantly, because who orders chicken when dining out?! But it is the best chicken ever- juicy with amazing flavors. It is so tender if falls off the bone. <br> My favorite special was the filet grilled medium rare with the blue cheese crumbles melted on top. It came with a delicious polenta cake. Portions are nice size. There&#39;s room for appetizer or dessert which is always fun. <br> The staff is also very friendly.",

"reviewcomment":"The ocean views from this restaurant are fantastic. <br><br>We had a difficult time deciding what to order and our server was happy to assist us with our choices. She was spot on. <br><br>The Mac &amp; Cheese is wonderful. Made with Gouda Cheese it was very smooth and creamy YUM. One of the best I&#39;ve ever had.  Next, we enjoyed the pork belly sliders. Another awesome choice. Then had the Diego Chicken Sandwich. Seasoned chicken breast on ciabatta bread, with roasted red pepper, chipotle aioli, sauteed onions and pepperjack cheese. Whoa very good. <br><br>The bar service was great too. My Martini was perfect, cold and dry. <br><br>If you are in the La Jolla area and looking for a very reasonable priced meal with a great view check this place out.",

"reviewcomment":"This place is just like fiesta cantina in hillcrest,  which is my all time favorite bar. So drink and food specials are the same at this location with the exception that once happy hour is done at 12am, this bar closes.. yup, that&#39;s right, they CLOSE. That&#39;s why I took off one star. You are forced to leave right at 12 and take your business elsewhere,  which makes no sense to me from a business perspective because they are losing money. But anyway, good spot to hit up for cheap drinks (2 for 1) if you are in the area. <br><br>There are tables and booths inside and a few small tables on the outside as well. One bar. And a shitload of people during HH on the weekend.. you will have to fight your way to the bar so beware. <br><br>NO COVER! :)",

Service was decent, no complaints... <br><br>The name Valentinos makes me think Italian.. But actually they serve Japanese!... Looking over the menu, it does appear a bit pricey for a neighborhood spot... But their Happy Hour menu is awesome. Plenty of options to choose from for $5, $6, or $7!... A friend of mine who&#39;s Japanese says their sushi rolls aren&#39;t quite &#34;authentic&#34;, but that they&#39;re still pretty good.  I did try their California roll, and i enjoyed it! Their crispy chicken sliders were good as well... The Kobe beef sliders were okay, but lacked a little flavor in my opinion. Tasted much better once I put some ketchup on it! Nothing wrong with their veggie tempura either.. You get a large serving of it! (Yum!) check out my pics and u be the judge!<br><br>The atmosphere is a bit loud.. It was a little difficult hearing my friends sitting right across from me. But seems like a nice place to meet up with friends. Okay for kids during HH.",

"reviewcomment":"Had brunch at Monello last Saturday with a party of 14. Friendly service right off the bat despite us being a little late for our 10:45 reservation. Relaxed atmosphere, not too crowded, and huge windows give plenty of natural light and views of the street. <br><br>We ordered bread for the table as well as drinks to start. I went with a Bloody Mary (which I&#39;m usually not a fan of, but I was battling a hangover) and was pleasantly surprised. It was spicy and refreshing, with seasoned &#34;monello&#34; salt around the rim. Extra cool points for the mini caprese salad garnish. Then the bread came. Fresh, warm, sliced focaccia with a dipping sauce that completely changed the game. Not exactly sure what it was. Some kind of olive oil/butter/herb/Parmesan sauce but it was nothing short of amazing. So good that my headache disappeared as fast as the focaccia did. The bread and the Bloody Mary brought me back to life. <br><br>I ordered the Monello Benedict with a side of fruit. It was on the smaller side, but arguably one of the best Benedicts I&#39;ve ever had. Crunchy bread, thick cut ham with a nice char, and PESTO hollandaise. I ate it so fast I didn&#39;t even get a picture of it. I did get a shot of the fruit, which had a nice assortment unlike most places that serve you 80% bland cantaloupe/honeydew. How often do you get kiwi when you order a side of fruit? Tried a lot of other dishes around the table. The brunch pizza is definitely worth mentioning: spinach, bacon, and eggs on a pizza big enough for two. <br><br>Met the owner, Guido (?) and he was very gracious and accommodating. Servers brought us a few extra desserts than what we ordered, and gelato for my cousin and me as we were celebrating my graduation and his birthday. <br><br>Great food, reasonable prices, and the dinner menu is also available during brunch hours. Hope to come back soon!",

"reviewcomment":"This place is the best Indian/Himalayan restaurant in SoCal! I used to live in LA/OC and now SD, so I feel pretty strongly about that statement. <br><br>Ambience - simple, not too fancy, just right<br><br>Food - The food is the main story here! It&#39;s is delicious, all of it! First things first, they give everyone a bowl of daal to start which is delicious. Really a home made taste, just like my mom makes. Their main dishes are all good. This isn&#39;t like any other place, because they have unique flavors that are different from other Indian restaurant. That himalayan touch really makes a huge different. My favorite is the paneer tikka masala (note: I&#39;m vegetarian). It&#39;s creamy but balanced and appropriately spicy if you ask for it. And you have to get the garlic naan with it. But I also love the momos. They are really unique, light, and flavorful. Similar to dumplings. My husband loves the Chicken Makhani and the Goat when they have it. <br><br>Price - really reasonable. It makes for an affordable night out with big portions.",

"reviewcomment":"I ate at Toscana after attending the RnR San Diego Health Expo for brunch. Overall I loved the food and service was good (after the fact. I will explain). I would go back and try another dish when I am back in San Diego.<br><br>The wait was about 10 minutes during Saturday brunch time (not bad). We were seated in the back patio, becuase I wanted to be outside but not in the sun. Unfortunately (i think) since we were in the back patio and the busy brunch hour, we waited for a while before our server came to take our order. Once we got over that waiting period, everything else was great. We weren&#39;t in a hurry so the waiting wasn&#39;t too bad for my bf and I. The server was very aware for making us wait and comp our drinks.<br><br>We ordered the Florentine Omelet (recommended by the server, b/c So California Omelet wasn&#39;t available) and Italian Salmon Carpaccio. Both great delicious dishes!!! The food was great, but service seems to be a common thing that needs to be worked on.",

"reviewcomment":"This place is the best Indian/Himalayan restaurant in SoCal! I used to live in LA/OC and now SD, so I feel pretty strongly about that statement. <br><br>Ambience - simple, not too fancy, just right<br><br>Food - The food is the main story here! It&#39;s is delicious, all of it! First things first, they give everyone a bowl of daal to start which is delicious. Really a home made taste, just like my mom makes. Their main dishes are all good. This isn&#39;t like any other place, because they have unique flavors that are different from other Indian restaurant. That himalayan touch really makes a huge different. My favorite is the paneer tikka masala (note: I&#39;m vegetarian). It&#39;s creamy but balanced and appropriately spicy if you ask for it. And you have to get the garlic naan with it. But I also love the momos. They are really unique, light, and flavorful. Similar to dumplings. My husband loves the Chicken Makhani and the Goat when they have it. <br><br>Price - really reasonable. It makes for an affordable night out with big portions.",

"reviewcomment":"This is a great little restaurant.  I see a lot of people complaining about the cost of the meats.  Sure, the portions are kind of small, but it is clearly of a high quality.  People should realize that restaurants need to keep certain margins on their food in order to keep the business running and profitable.  You really cant compare it to what you would pay at a grocery store.<br><br>The vegetable soup is extremely reasonable at $6; it was more than enough for two people.  The Kobe style short ribs are intensely marbled and grilled up very nicely.  We also enjoyed the bi bim bap which you can get in a stone bowl.  This may have been the best dish of the three.   <br><br>Overall we had a great experience at this restaurant.  The servers are very thorough and attentive.  People who enjoy cooking will especially like this place.",

"reviewcomment":"We had a very good lunch at Elijah&#39;s.  It was the middle of the week, around 1:30.  They have a large menu, but ultimately, both of us decided on the lunch special:  any of Elijah&#39;s 4 Rueben choices plus a side for $9.95.  I chose a Rueben with pastrami instead of corned beef.  I know this isn&#39;t traditional, but I am a sucker for pastrami and typically like it over corned beef.  <br><br>The sandwich was hearty, bigger than I was expecting given that it was on a lunch special.  The rye bread was griddled to PERFECTION.  It had a crispy exterior, but retained was still soft.  Also, it held the ingredients in well; didn&#39;t fall apart.  This can be an issue with Ruebens, since the ingredients have a lot of moisture.  They aren&#39;t shy with the sauerkraut, which is the way I like it.  This was a really good sandwich, one I&#39;ll order again.<br><br>My dining companion had a traditional Rueben, so I got to try some corned beef.  This was solid corned beef, like the pastrami.  The beef had some fat and was sliced thin.  I still liked the pastrami better, but this was very good corned beef.<br><br>I had the potato salad on the side.  The potatoes were cooked well, and they were diced small. There is a good amount of seasoning and ingredients, it&#39;s not just mustard and some salt/pepper and that&#39;s it.  I&#39;ll also order the potato salad again.<br><br>We checked out the pastry counter, and although we didn&#39;t try one a lot of things looked good.  Also, very cool grocery section with a lot of international products.  Couple this with a comfy, spacious indoors, plus a nice outdoor seating area, and you&#39;ve got yourself a fantastic deli.  We&#39;ll be back, I definitely want to give breakfast a shot...",

"reviewcomment":"Went in for lunch and ordered the spring rolls filled with pork, the rare steak and well done brisket pho, and a strawberry green tea drink. The spring rolls were really nice - very crispy without being burnt, not too oily, and nicely filled. The pho here is really tasty as well. Although the meat is good, I would&#39;ve liked to have a bit more. I&#39;ll also definitely be back to try more of their tea and boba flavors. So refreshing during the summer!<br><br>So happy to find such a good pho place nearby :)",

"reviewcomment":"This place is the best Indian/Himalayan restaurant in SoCal! I used to live in LA/OC and now SD, so I feel pretty strongly about that statement. <br><br>Ambience - simple, not too fancy, just right<br><br>Food - The food is the main story here! It&#39;s is delicious, all of it! First things first, they give everyone a bowl of daal to start which is delicious. Really a home made taste, just like my mom makes. Their main dishes are all good. This isn&#39;t like any other place, because they have unique flavors that are different from other Indian restaurant. That himalayan touch really makes a huge different. My favorite is the paneer tikka masala (note: I&#39;m vegetarian). It&#39;s creamy but balanced and appropriately spicy if you ask for it. And you have to get the garlic naan with it. But I also love the momos. They are really unique, light, and flavorful. Similar to dumplings. My husband loves the Chicken Makhani and the Goat when they have it. <br><br>Price - really reasonable. It makes for an affordable night out with big portions.",

"reviewcomment":"It&#39;s been at least 8-9 years since I&#39;ve been to this location.  Since then they have expanded their square footage by adding an additional building in the back of the main building on 3rd street.   They have pool tables, arcade games, a bar, and bigger tables with a &#34;game parlor&#34; feel about it. <br><br>It&#39;s decent pizza. Good pizza really.  The cheese they use is better than most pizza places.  Always heavy handed when they top their dishes, and melted to perfection.  It&#39;s got that thick, gooey, buttery type of mozzarella which I like.   They have a very good hot and cold sandwich selection.  I like the Hot Ham &amp; Cheese. <br><br>Everyone in South Bay San Diego has been one time or another.  It&#39;s definitely a Chula Vista favorite and a fondly nostalgic place to get together for beer and pizza.<br><br>I&#39;ll keep coming back here as long as I&#39;m in the area, and might have a beer or two from their decent craft beer selection as well.",

First off, the employees seem to really enjoy being there and genuinely care about the quality of their food, Everyone there asked how everything was and if i needed anything.  the customer service was on point.  I lived in texas for a while, and visit often to see family and here in San Diego, this is as close as it gets to real Texas BBQ. The guy at the counter told me they even had the smoker they use imported from Texas. Texas is known for the bold BBQ flavor, and this place has that! Just what i was craving!<br>I found out about this spot thru a groupon i purchased. I will definitely be a return customer!<br><br>Cheers guys! keep up the outstanding work!",

Even though it wasnt in my meal plan, sometimes i would have a craving for carna asada fries so i would HAVE TO get it. I have always been ordering the same thing but when i want to change it up a little i order their real mexican food. Always with a cup of horchata and a lot of homemade hot sauce. <br><br>Throughout the years i have been going they have renovated the place with a new music player and new TVs. So it looks a little bit more modern but u can tell that its still its own place. They opened another location i think in El Cajon because this store was doing so well, which is great to see. <br><br>This is actually the first mexican place i introduced to my sister cause she wanted to try carna asada fries. She loved it and every time i go i send her a picture of what i ordered and she gets mad. :D <br><br>I will have to say this is my 2nd favorite mexican joint in San Diego. But because it is so close to home and the food is pretty good, i will always be going here. :)",

"reviewcomment":"It&#39;s pretty funny to see the low rating for Edgewater based on Yelpers&#39; insistence it is an overpriced tourist trap. Here is my question for these reviewers: Where is a person supposed to eat - if they want to dine on San Diego&#39;s waterfront - that is NOT considered by you all as a tourist trap? Part of the fun of living in SD is dining out on the water. And personally, I&#39;m not going to feel guilty about it because so many hack reviewers need daily excuses to write in clichés (aka &#34;tourist trap&#34;).<br><br>Edgewater is a perfect example. Yes, it&#39;s in Seaport Village, which is synonymous with overpriced and very tourist-centric merchandise and activities. But does that mean I shouldn&#39;t pay the couple extra bucks to get a decent meal (and view) from Edgewater? No.<br><br>Yes, Edgewater&#39;s menu is priced beyond the quality. In other news, we live in CALIFORNIA, where EVERYTHING is marked up beyond reason. So, I&#39;m over the pricing. The fact is, there are some tasty, tasty menu items here, and you are missing them because you&#39;ve been had by the Yelp court of public elitism. For example, the crab bruschetta appetizer is my favorite appetizer I&#39;ve ever had in SD. I love it, I&#39;m addicted to it, and I apologize for nothing. <br><br>Also, I ate a few different salads and enjoyed them thoroughly. Poached egg in a salad. I was skeptical, but it was a home run. We also loved the ambiance and décor here. Having eaten at a couple divey restaurants in this vicinity (tourist trap or no, they sucked regardless), we found Edgewater a pleasant surprise. We&#39;ll be back another time to try the seafood entrees and pizzas. Oh, and I recommend making a reservation to get the best seating/views.",

"reviewcomment":"This place is the best Indian/Himalayan restaurant in SoCal! I used to live in LA/OC and now SD, so I feel pretty strongly about that statement. <br><br>Ambience - simple, not too fancy, just right<br><br>Food - The food is the main story here! It&#39;s is delicious, all of it! First things first, they give everyone a bowl of daal to start which is delicious. Really a home made taste, just like my mom makes. Their main dishes are all good. This isn&#39;t like any other place, because they have unique flavors that are different from other Indian restaurant. That himalayan touch really makes a huge different. My favorite is the paneer tikka masala (note: I&#39;m vegetarian). It&#39;s creamy but balanced and appropriately spicy if you ask for it. And you have to get the garlic naan with it. But I also love the momos. They are really unique, light, and flavorful. Similar to dumplings. My husband loves the Chicken Makhani and the Goat when they have it. <br><br>Price - really reasonable. It makes for an affordable night out with big portions.",

No matter when I go, everyone is very nice and the food is delicious.<br><br>I had an enchilada with rice n beans which was clarified by the waiter that I didn&#39;t want the plate I accidentally pointed at. He was accommodating and helpful! It was entertaining to see them figure out the drink we wanted....just a tequila n pineapple. They seemed to confuse it with a margarita somehow but made up for the confusion by giving us am extra side if guac they ended up with! Lol they were great and the food is just as much so.",

"reviewcomment":"Awesome place! We bought a Travel Zoo deal for $25 which included 2 entrees, 2 cups of coffee, and 2 bottomless mimosas or cocktails. It was quiet when we got there at 11am and we selected a patio seat in the corner. We ordered build your own omelettes and both were delicious--good sized and full of ingredients we requested. The potatoes were more like hash browns and also tasty. The fruit was a bit disappointing because it was chopped pretty small and I like larger cuts of fruit for a fuller taste. But that was the only thing that wasn&#39;t great! Boyfriend had jameson and coke, I had 5 mimosas (whoops), and the best was the pear and white cranberry. So yummy! <br><br>The staff were all very friendly and the atmosphere was fun. I will definitely be coming back and getting some bottomless mimosas and delicious brunch! So happy I bought that deal!",

But I&#39;ve always had a fine experience there, so I decided to give it another shot. <br><br>And I&#39;m glad I did! The food was good. We got the Ropa Vieja &amp; pollo ala plancha combo plate and the pork 2 ways. The Ropa Vieja was our favorite out of everything. The pork 2 ways dish was a tad dry, and could have used some kind of sauce. Each dish was around $15. We had a bogo coupon. <br><br>Other reviewers mentioned poor service but the service was fine, it not a bit informal. This is a family place. We were also there early in the evening so there weren&#39;t too many people ahead of us.<br><br>I wouldn&#39;t go back without a coupon. Prices are too high for the tired decor. $15 entrees deserve a place that is a tad more upscale looking. As someone else mentioned in another review, there was a cloth flower bundle on the wall right next to my face that was absolutely covered in thick dust and grime--so gross. If they just got rid of the fake flowers, the wood paneling, and got some new light fixtures, they&#39;d be halfway there. Just spruce it up and you can justify the higher price tag.<br><br>Anyway, there aren&#39;t that many places where you can find good Cuban/Latin food in San Diego. This is a pretty tasty option.",

For all of the classic dishes such as pad thai, drunken noodles, tom yum soup, etc, they&#39;re all prepared from scratch on site. Dishes do take a while to come out but its well worth it, everything comes out hot and fresh. Noodles don&#39;t taste frozen or overcooked. Tom yum soup is bold with the blend of spicy and sweet.<br>When ordering any of the chicken combos, you get you choice of 2 sauces, love their peanut and sweet pepper sauce. <br>A unique element of the menu is the addition of low carb and heathy items on the menu (or as I look at it, guilt free)<br>Lastly, next door to the restaurant is their take-out chicken place. One thing I really like about that menu is their picnic basket option. You get a whole chicken, a combo of egg and spring rolls, 2 different salads, rice, and a bunch of dipping sauces. Its enough to feed 3-4 people and comes in a awesome little disposable picnic basket.<br>Can&#39;t wait to come back again to Saffron!",

Once they cleaned off the table- the fan above us them started dripping some weird black liquid onto the table! Look out for that! We moved tables- after that was all good. <br>Food was really good- the salad was great and only 7 bucks!! <br>We also split the philly cheese steak sandwiches with tater tots!!! Yes amazing tator tots!! <br>Which was only like 11 bucks<br>The place is pretty cool tho<br>With a tons of flat screens and all sports playing. Fun loud environment",

Service was very good and so was the food. Everyone in our party ate their entire plate of food. We had the swordfish tacos, blackened mahi mahi, chicken picatta, crab-stuffed bacon wraped jumbo prawns and crab and shrimp fondue. <br><br>Could&#39;ve had more options for sides, and the seasonal veggies that were supposed to be carrots, green beans and squash came out just green beans. <br><br>Nice atmosphere and one of the larger places on the island.

"reviewcomment":"This place is the best Indian/Himalayan restaurant in SoCal! I used to live in LA/OC and now SD, so I feel pretty strongly about that statement. <br><br>Ambience - simple, not too fancy, just right<br><br>Food - The food is the main story here! It&#39;s is delicious, all of it! First things first, they give everyone a bowl of daal to start which is delicious. Really a home made taste, just like my mom makes. Their main dishes are all good. This isn&#39;t like any other place, because they have unique flavors that are different from other Indian restaurant. That himalayan touch really makes a huge different. My favorite is the paneer tikka masala (note: I&#39;m vegetarian). It&#39;s creamy but balanced and appropriately spicy if you ask for it. And you have to get the garlic naan with it. But I also love the momos. They are really unique, light, and flavorful. Similar to dumplings. My husband loves the Chicken Makhani and the Goat when they have it. <br><br>Price - really reasonable. It makes for an affordable night out with big portions.",

Their meat speaks for itself..it&#39;s so tender and full of flavor, you really need minimal (if any) extra BBQ sauce for dipping. LOVE their rib tips aka rib chunks! I was amazed how huge they were. Obviously these other joints have been skimping on the amount of rib tips they&#39;re giving. Their wedding beans! Wow! Super good! The tri tip and the pork ribs...I can&#39;t even explain, you just need to try it! 4 cheese mac and cheese..what?! Jalapeño cornbread is delicious! The portions here are ridiculous! Come hungry because it&#39;s a lot of food. <br><br>our server ROURKE was theeeee best! True definition of what customer service is all about. Thank you for all your recommendations and conversation! <br><br>We are most definitely coming back here for more! Can&#39;t wait to try their tri tip cheesesteak, the pulled pork mac n cheese sandwich and the tailgaters feast.",

"reviewcomment":"My experience from beginning to end at the Cosmopolitan Hotel was definitely one that I can say I will always remember as this was a location/venue that my family chose to have our Dad&#39;s surprise birthday at. <br><br>The room that my family rented out was certainly big enough to occupy 66 guests that showed up for the event. This room was separated in 3 sections... First main section was the seating &#34;dining&#34; area for most of the guests as well as the area where the birthday cakes were placed for everyone to see. In the 2nd section (middle) were extra seating tables where the children sat and the 3rd section was utilized for the foods as there were 5-6 heated buffet trays lined across the table that contained some delicious and delectable items.<br><br>Upon arriving, we entered the room which reminded me of an old saloon. The theme that was chosen for our Dad&#39;s party was that of a &#34;Las Vegas/Poker&#34; theme as tables were decorated with red and green floral arrangements and small giveaways like custom made poker chips and cards that had our Dad&#39;s picture and birthday script labeled on them. The host/hostess and servers were all very attentive and very helpful with our guests. We had an open bar from 11-3PM which was great and kept our guests happy. Once our Dad arrived, the host played his part well and secretly led him along with other members of our family to the main dining room where we all yelled aloud &#34;SURPRISE!!!&#34; and the look on our Dad&#39;s face was that of pure joy! The whole act was well played and he was very surprised as he could not believe that we all were able to put together something of that magnitude without him finding out. <br><br>As soon as he arrived, that&#39;s when the party began and everyone was certainly having a great time. The food was delicious, the drinks were well made and the servers were on top of their game. The location was easy to find, however parking may be a bit of difficult if you don&#39;t arrive early. We didn&#39;t have any issues with that as we decided to park next to the golf course where we paid $5 and received 2 free vouchers for meals at a local restaurant which was worth it. My family settled on this location for the party as a friend of ours had their wedding and reception here and had nothing but great things to say about it. <br><br>Overall, we had a wonderful time. Good atmosphere, food and space. The party ended exactly as scheduled and our Dad was one happy man.",

"reviewcomment":"We eat here every once in awhile for weekend brunch when we crave Indian food.  It&#39;s definitely one of our favorites because of the lunch buffet - very reasonably priced at $9.95 and an excellent assortment of dishes.  I particularly like the lentil soup, the saag paneer, the veggie korma, and the chicken tikka masala.  Today there was a mock duck vegetarian dish that was excellent as well.  The desserts are perfectly portioned so you can try more than one - mango mousse, rice pudding, and gulab jamun - very tasty.  I think it&#39;s also a nice touch that they always serve a fresh and hot order of naan bread with your meal rather than leaving it on the buffet.<br><br>Of course, I must always mention that they are very dog-friendly on their outdoor patio and always welcome us with a bowl of ice water for our pooches.",

"reviewcomment":"Good golly this was a great dinner!<br><br>We stopped in after deciding that a restaurant nearby (initials E.V.) just didn&#39;t seem to really want our patronage last night. We were greeted by a lovely, patient, and all around welcoming hostess. We opted for the restaurant level. There were three levels, and this one had the most interesting menu. <br><br>The place looked modern, elegant, and serene. And of course the view was not too shabby; overlooking La Jolla Cove. We sat at the most comfy and colorful table in the house, the one with the purple couches. Perfect for when I go into food coma. <br><br>We ordered the Grilled Octopus, Red Wine Braised Prime Shortrib, and California Lamb. While we waited for our food, we snacked on these amazing rustic sourdough slices of goodness. They practically defied the laws of physics--well at least some kind of baking law. The crust was blistering from being toasted. It was so crunchy (but not tooth breaking hard) with some chew to it, yet inside was so pillowy soft. There was obviously some gluten goodness happening in there, giving it a wonderful bounce. We had two baskets. Too bad they can&#39;t take credit since the bread is actually from Bread and Cie. <br><br>The octopus was cooked to tender perfection. I don&#39;t know how they did it, but this was the most tender octopus I have ever tasted. Other than the charred bits to show proof that they were indeed grilled, they melted in my mouth. It came with guacamole, tiny purple and yellow potatoes, and other herbs. The only room for improvement would have been on the presentation. It could have been a more pretty and photogenic plate. Instead it was just gobs of stuff spread out on the plate. However, the fact that the pieces of octopus showed how future octopi should behave in my mouth made up for it. <br><br>Let&#39;s get to the shortrib. Yes, damn delicious. The sauce was rich and paired nicely with the juicy and tender meat. It sat atop a creamy cheesy polenta that was also a delectable accompaniment to the dish. My only complaint would be the dry veggies. The leafy stuff must have been dry roasted or something. Strange and not too pleasing, but there wasn&#39;t much of it, so it didn&#39;t impact how much I enjoyed the dish. The carrots were just okay. It could have been prepared better. Even with the minor blemishes, I could have licked the plate when I finished. <br><br>Now to the lamb. This must have been Mary&#39;s good little lamb, cause it was crazy how tender it was. It must have gotten sweet little massages at night to get the meat so soft. My BF ordered it halfway between medium and medium rare. He proclaimed that it was the best lamb he ever had. After having a few bites, I&#39;m inclined to agree with him. I have never had lamb that basically melted in my mouth before this. The mushrooms it came with were also pretty good. <br><br>Although on the spendy side, our dinner exhibited quality ingredients and taste. Definitely a nice dinner to treat yourself and loved one/s to once in a while. I can&#39;t wait to come back for their tasting menu!<br><br>If you noticed, I used the word tender to describe all their meats. So if you are into tender lovin&#39; action, you should give this place a try.",

I always order the garlic bird because i LOVE GARLIC. but I have been willing to try new things recently and the fire bird is MUCHO CALIENTE! hahaha. <br>I love how everyday they have a different special and they also have game nights. There is a reason why people come back to this place over and over again. and it is because of their great quality fresh food, great happy hours, good beers on tap and tentative servers. <br><br>You can also get a coupon, for every 5 dollars you spend, you get a stamp on your card and when you get a certain amount of stamps you get a 10 dollar gift card for the place that you can use whenever you want. <br>I LOVE WHEN I SAVE :)",

"reviewcomment":"I do not know why it  has taken me so long to write a review of this place, better late than never :)<br><br>This mom-and-pop, family style Italian treasure is not be missed. <br><br>The decor: cheesy, old-school, 70&#39;s charm, with just a hint of chinziness.<br><br>The location: hole-in-the-wall, with minimal parking (park next door in the Squidco parking lot after-hours--fyi: they close on Sunday).<br><br>The service: friendly, but typically slow--due to the frequent long wait (people love this place!) and your meal being made to order, it can sometimes take awhile for your order to come out...enjoy the bread...have a glass of wine...and be patient knowing that it will be worth the wait :) <br><br>The food: legit! Their marinara is amazing (meat sauce is so-so), rich and full of garlic wonderment. My favorite dish is their Grilled Mixed Seafood--pan fried calamari, shrimp &amp; scallops--served with pasta (I prefer angel hair) tossed with olive oil and heaps of garlicky goodness. This dish is so amazing that not only am I salivating as I type this, but I&#39;m fantasizing of the next time I get to eat here. The lasagna is on point, as is the chicken parm and chicken marsala.<br><br>Tip: Order to go. If you&#39;re not up for the wait, call in your order and enjoy in the comforts of your home :)<br><br>Do yourself a favor and try this homestyle Italian mom and pop...you can thank me later.",

"reviewcomment":"Close to work, this restaurant is reliable in that I can drag anyone coworker off to lunch at Ranchos and everyone has been very satisfied with the food. The menu is far ranging. My brother, who&#39;s vegan, loves to have so many options and has enjoyed each meal he&#39;s made.  People at work haven&#39;t really caught onto it yet in large numbers, so if I have to have a discreet (gossipy) lunch, it&#39;s dependable for that reason too. <br><br>Anyway...back to the chow.  The portions are generous and delicious.  I don&#39;t know why, but the salmon Cesar salad is tastier than that served by the North Park Ranchos, but I haven&#39;t noticed a difference in any other meals - all have been excellent but the cheese enchiladas are my favorite. The rustic Frieda Kahlo-inspired decor is charming. Although it&#39;s difficult to find lousy Mexican food in the town I&#39;ve called home for 30+ years, including the inexpensive &#34;-ertos&#34; on every corner, Ranchos is among the very best.<br><br>Others have complained that the servers lack charm. I&#39;ve not encountered that problem. The people who work there are friendly and smile and joke more than I do.  They hover with refills without being  I also don&#39;t love it when waitstaff introduce themselves to me when they take my order, so unless someone is rude, I&#39;m happy.  Getting the check after a meal can be a slow process, which is only a small bother when I&#39;m in a rush, but I believe that&#39;s on purpose - they make an effort to not rush their customers. And in this day and age, that&#39;s another great trait.<br><br>Almost forgot to mention the small patio. It doesn&#39;t seat many but it&#39;s covered with plants and muffles the noise from Sunset Cliffs Blvd. It&#39;s cozy and pretty...another attraction.",

I used to live in LA/OC and now SD, so I feel pretty strongly about that statement. <br><br>Ambience - simple, not too fancy, just right<br><br>Food - The food is the main story here! It&#39;s is delicious, all of it! First things first, they give everyone a bowl of daal to start which is delicious. Really a home made taste, just like my mom makes. Their main dishes are all good. This isn&#39;t like any other place, because they have unique flavors that are different from other Indian restaurant. That himalayan touch really makes a huge different. My favorite is the paneer tikka masala (note: I&#39;m vegetarian). It&#39;s creamy but balanced and appropriately spicy if you ask for it. And you have to get the garlic naan with it. But I also love the momos. They are really unique, light, and flavorful. Similar to dumplings. My husband loves the Chicken Makhani and the Goat when they have it. <br><br>Price - really reasonable. It makes for an affordable night out with big portions.",

Follow that with a yummy salad and finish with Sea Bass, Risotto and Asparagus?<br><br>Good choice for a night out in the Gaslamp. Shout House with dueling pianos and singing at the top of your voice is only 3 or 4 blocks away! So much fun to create a full night downtown.",

Being that it was my first time, I had tons of questions and he answered all of them with grace and tons of patience. What a nice guy! <br><br>He sold me on the Godfather and I feel as if I owe him my firstborn child. Seriously I think that is one of the top 3 best sandwiches I have ever had- and like I said earlier, I&#39;m a total sandwich snob. My friend ordered the off the wall, and while it was just GOOD- I would recommend something else because I know this place has better options. Namely the Godfather. Told ya I&#39;m obsessed ;) <br><br>They have a pretty fun selection of Snapple, which always earns extra points in my book. They also offer beer on tap and have happy hour...

She called them to see if she could come back and get the right one and was immediately told that they would deliver her salad to her at no charge. Sure enough, they showed up and gave her a full size salad (she had only ordered a half) and complementary garlic knots. <br><br>This is the perfect example of a business going out of their way for exceptional customer service.

"reviewcomment":"One of my favorite Indian places in SD!<br><br>Unlike the common Indian food you see around SD, ie: Punjabi Tandoor, Royal India, etc., this joint is quite different. It is purely vegetarian friendly and mainly serves more snacks and light meals. Disclaimer: You won&#39;t find chicken tikka masala, etc here. My two favorite things to order are the Delhi Chaat and the Pav Bhaji. I&#39;m a light eater and these two dishes get me stuffed! <br><br>The Delhi Chaat is just to die for! It&#39;s basically  a dish with wheat crackers and chickpeas drenched in yogurt, spices, and different sauces (I can tell tamarind and the mint sauces are in there). When you eat it all at once the flavors just blend and melt together--amazing. All the complementing flavors and the various textures (crunchy from the wheat crackers and soft from the chickpeas) just make it so damn good. Just describing this is making my mouth water! It is a tiny bit spicy, but definitely tolerable for all spicy lightweights. A MUST ORDER!<br><br>My other favorite is the Pav Bhaji. This is a plate of 4 hamburger patties with butter on them and the main dish is this mix vegetable slurry (probably has some lentils in it). With a dash of lime and freshly chopped onions, this dish is the bomb! I love this dish because I love the flavors. It may not look like  fine dining, but believe me it is delicious. The first time I ever had this, I had no idea how to eat it so I kind of approached it as if I was eating Ethiopian food (the slurry flavors itself kind of reminded me of it as well), thus I just dipped the bread into the slurry. Didn&#39;t even know if I was eating right! O well, it doesn&#39;t matter as long as it gets into my tummy! <br><br>If you want another type of Indian food to try, go here!",

I used to live in LA/OC and now SD, so I feel pretty strongly about that statement. <br><br>Ambience - simple, not too fancy, just right<br><br>Food - The food is the main story here! It&#39;s is delicious, all of it! First things first, they give everyone a bowl of daal to start which is delicious. Really a home made taste, just like my mom makes. Their main dishes are all good. This isn&#39;t like any other place, because they have unique flavors that are different from other Indian restaurant. That himalayan touch really makes a huge different. My favorite is the paneer tikka masala (note: I&#39;m vegetarian). It&#39;s creamy but balanced and appropriately spicy if you ask for it. And you have to get the garlic naan with it. But I also love the momos. They are really unique, light, and flavorful. Similar to dumplings. My husband loves the Chicken Makhani and the Goat when they have it. <br><br>Price - really reasonable.

I&#39;m always happy with the caesar salad, grilled shrimp, meatballs, bruschetta, tortilla espanola, and of course the hot bread is delicious. Keep it simple, enjoy the good wine prices and the atmosphere, and read the part of the menu where it explains that it&#39;s a slow service establishment: it&#39;s supposed to be reminiscent of European cafes where everyone is relaxing over multiple shared plates, not freaking out over how quickly and in what order their food will arrive. Come here to hang out, listen to some music, and get drunk.

"reviewcomment":"After eating cheesesteaks in Philly, I had to try one back home. This place is no Geno&#39;s, but it&#39;s a good sandwhich. The meat was really good, not over seasoned or salted. The cheese was ordinary, but not bad. It&#39;s down fall was the bread. It was good bread, but not for the cheese steak. It was too dense or tough; it needed to be softer. I loved the casual set up of the restaurant,  but it&#39;s did not seem to have A/C.<br><br>I have been here a few times and they keep updating it.

I thought the lobster grilled cheese missed on some flavor and only had a few pieces of lobster. I wasn&#39;t expecting a full lobster but 3 or 4 small pieces just doesn&#39;t cut it. Maybe it was a one time thing, but I&#39;m willing to order another one next time and maybe I can change my review on this.

"reviewcomment":"My Turkey in the Garden sandwich for $7.45 was impressive and tender from the first bite. So, how can a sandwich with turkey breast, jack cheese, alfalfa sprouts, avocado, red onion and spinach seem tender? Maybe it&#39;s the very fresh Hunter&#39;s Grain bread. Is it the creamy fresh avocado? The cheese &amp; the mayo? The freshness of the veggies? I dunno, but this Turkey sandwich was scrumptious, with a perfect texture!<br><br>I split my turkey sandwich with a yelper friend, who shared his Curried Chicken sandwich with me. I actually preferred my Turkey in the Garden sammy, but it&#39;s fun to try 2 different sandwiches. His sandwich had chicken, apples, cashews and curry on Hawaiian sweet egg bread for $6.95. The sandwiches are stuffed generously, so I was actually full after eating half of my Turkey, and taking only a couple bites out of the Curried Chicken sandwich. My Yelper dining companion ate both halves of his share, and he said he&#39;d definitely return!<br><br>We ate inside this little deli in Hillcrest, and I had to ask for another pickle as they accidentally only gave us 1 pickle. They cheerfully gave us extra pickles, so we ended up with 2 yummy crunchy pickles each.<br><br>Will I be back? Oh, definitely! This deli is also well located for taking sandwiches to go to Balboa Park for a picnic lunch. They have several parking spots of their own for customers, but the spots were all full when we arrived, so we had to circle the block and find a parking meter nearby.<br><br>Thanks to Yelp and the excellent review by Jeanette S, I know where to find great sandwiches for a good price in Hillcrest!",

"reviewcomment":"I want to open up a shop on Convoy RIGHT next to this place.  It&#39;ll be a store that sells only beds and baths and it&#39;ll be called Beyond.  Why?  So I can have people say they&#39;re going to infinite and beyond to get tea and then buy bed bath at beyond.  Har har har...<br><br>Enough REALLY bad joking.  Infini-Tea is a typical Taiwan Tea place that has ok tea drinks and a really good milk slush with Coffee jelly.  I mean, REALLY good.  At least I like it.  It&#39;s their signature drink and it&#39;s on their menu front and center (to the left).  If you look at the options and things like red bean or pudding don&#39;t float your boat, you can ask for double Coffee Jelly instead.  I suggest doing this so you get more coffee jelly and less other stuff that will detract from the coffee goodness.  <br><br>Why is it so good?  The jelly is strong coffee flavor and it&#39;s soft.  Not like Cosby Jell-O soft, even softer!  That mixed with the sweetness of the jelly and the milk slush makes a great, cool, refreshing  drink.  <br><br>Last time we went here, a few of us played Monopoly Deal for about an hour.  No pressure to leave and no urgency on the check.  They weren&#39;t packed but all the tables were full.  This was nice.  I&#39;d have felt pressure and left if there were people waiting.  The odd thing is that we weren&#39;t even there the longest.  One cool thing about their Monopoly Deal copy is that it&#39;s got Hong Kong locations!  Odd considering a Taiwanese store has HK cards.  <br><br>One minor tick mark against them is their fried foods.  I don&#39;t know if they sell stinky tofu but if they don&#39;t I&#39;m scared.  We ordered an order of popcorn chicken which had a good seasoning on it.  The problem is that it smelled and had a waft of stinky tofu.  Which means they use the same oil as stinky tofu OR their oil is just funky in general.  This makes it IMPOSSIBLE to give them a 5 star rating.  <br><br>If you DO go here, make sure you get their punch card.  Assuming you go back, it&#39;s nice to be able to earn a free drink.<br><br>TL:DR - Coffee Milk Slush is good.  Get it.",

I used to live in LA/OC and now SD, so I feel pretty strongly about that statement. <br><br>Ambience - simple, not too fancy, just right<br><br>Food - The food is the main story here! It&#39;s is delicious, all of it! First things first, they give everyone a bowl of daal to start which is delicious. Really a home made taste, just like my mom makes. Their main dishes are all good. This isn&#39;t like any other place, because they have unique flavors that are different from other Indian restaurant. That himalayan touch really makes a huge different. My favorite is the paneer tikka masala (note: I&#39;m vegetarian). It&#39;s creamy but balanced and appropriately spicy if you ask for it. And you have to get the garlic naan with it. But I also love the momos. They are really unique, light, and flavorful. Similar to dumplings. My husband loves the Chicken Makhani and the Goat when they have it. <br><br>Price - really reasonable.

The Mrs. had the MOST perfectly cooked piece of white fish I&#39;ve ever seen and my boyfriends father had the lamb, which had quite an extravagant presentation. <br><br>We were surprised to see soooo many gluten free options (we had a celiac in our group) and service was incredibly accommodating.

"reviewcomment":"Alexi&#39;s is a hidden gem among the upscale restaurants that surround it and is as unpretentious as it comes. If you&#39;re looking for a ton of food for cheap, look no further. The servers are amazingly friendly and the amount of food that you get is unbelievable! The dinner plates come with soup, salad, rice, French fries, AND pita, in addition to the meat or vegetarian option you ordered, all for less than $10. None of us even came close to finishing our food, and our to-go boxes were packed full. The decor and staff are both shamelessly Greek, which only add to the charm of the place. <br><br>If you have a group of friends that all have different food preferences, don&#39;t worry- they&#39;ll all find something they like on the menu. Vegetarian, gluten-free, low-carb, no worries- there are plenty of choices to satisfy picky or restricted eaters. Seriously, give this place a try.",

"reviewcomment":"Although I have the hardest time remembering how to pronounce the name of this restaurant, I love everything about it. The food, the service, the dog friendliness...all amazing!<br><br>I stopped into Sbicca for date night a couple of weekends ago. My date and I had spent the past couple of hours at dog beach with my two pups and we were looking for a dog friendly restaurant to continue the date. We arrived at Sbicca around 9 PM on a Friday night and the restaurant wasn&#39;t too crowded. We sat outside and on a warm evening, it&#39;s quite pleasant. I imagine it&#39;s extra nice if you&#39;re there around sunset.<br><br>In lieu of entrees, we decided to split a few appetizers and selected the Korean Beef Lettuce Wraps, Lobster Mac and Cheese and Truffle Fries. Everything was delicious! <br><br>The Beef Lettuce Wraps, despite sounding like an odd combination of ingredients (marinated steak, cucumbers, strawberries and mint), were super good (at least, after I took out the cucumber as I can&#39;t stand cucumber). The steak was tender and so flavorful and oddly paired well with the mint. <br><br>The Lobster Mac and Cheese was creamy and cheesy and perfect. I admit to being a lobster virgin but my date convinced me to give it a try and I decided that the flavor was okay but I wasn&#39;t a fan of the chewy texture. The mac and cheese part was spot on though and I&#39;m sure that lobster lovers will adore this dish.<br><br>Truffle Fries are one of my favorite things on Earth and these fries were so good! Definitely lived up to my expectation.<br><br>We finished the night with a scoop of salted caramel gelato. Mmmm!<br><br>I love restaurants that are dog friendly as my pups mean the world to me. Sbicca earns big points for being so welcoming to my pups. Not only did they bring out a water bowl, but they also refilled it once my thirsty dogs licked the bowl dry.",

I used to live in LA/OC and now SD, so I feel pretty strongly about that statement. <br><br>Ambience - simple, not too fancy, just right<br><br>Food - The food is the main story here! It&#39;s is delicious, all of it! First things first, they give everyone a bowl of daal to start which is delicious. Really a home made taste, just like my mom makes. Their main dishes are all good. This isn&#39;t like any other place, because they have unique flavors that are different from other Indian restaurant. That himalayan touch really makes a huge different. My favorite is the paneer tikka masala (note: I&#39;m vegetarian). It&#39;s creamy but balanced and appropriately spicy if you ask for it. And you have to get the garlic naan with it. But I also love the momos. They are really unique, light, and flavorful. Similar to dumplings. My husband loves the Chicken Makhani and the Goat when they have it. <br><br>Price - really reasonable. It makes for an affordable night out with big portions.",

When I went inside everyone looked at me with surprised confused faces. No one said anything until finally the blonde hair host that was twirling her hair with her fingers said in a irritated voice,&#34; Yeah...um...we aren&#39;t open right now...not till 11..&#34;<br>She wasn&#39;t friendly and she wasn&#39;t polite enough to tell me they would gladly take me once they were open. So I decided to try Domo which was my first visit there.<br><br>The host was extremely friendly! She lets know that take out was 40% off of normal sushi rolls and special rolls 20% everyday. I ordered a dragon roll to go an it was extremely good! So glad Takku were jokes so I ended up in Domo instead.",

Granted we went on a Monday evening, not a typical rush hour. <br><br>I ordered a vegetarian pizza and my friend ordered the prosciutto pizza. DELICIOUS!! Definitely underrated. The crust is thin, but not cracker crispy thin. Thin enough but it&#39;s still soft inside. My veggies were fresh and juicy. I&#39;d come back!!",

Their fish tacos are bomb (they also have chipotle fish tacos if you&#39;d like, which is good as well), the California burrito and carne asada fries are delicious, the surf and turf is huge and awesome. Everything I have tried so far has been amazing. One thing I have learned throughout my time coming here is to call ahead to put in your order because it does tend to get very busy at times (especially at night)... Unless you don&#39;t mind waiting, but I know the first time I came here the wait for my food was probably around 20ish mins but I have patience and it was very busy so I wasn&#39;t upset or anything unlike other people around me. But yeah, I&#39;ve learned it&#39;s just easier to call ahead. All the times I&#39;ve called ahead my food has been ready by the time I&#39;ve got there.  <br><br>Love this place because it&#39;s 24 hours as well!",

It was only a few blocks away and so glad I stopped into the Creperie. <br><br>I ordered an espresso 16oz (ermawgawd- SO GOOD. I dunno what kind of coffee they use, but dang that&#39;s tasty.) and the Healthy Breakfast Crepe (added Bacon).  All in all a delicious meal.  It came with a small fruit bowl and slice of watermelon. Very cute and I was stuffed! With Tax and tip I spent $20 on myself, but sometimes ya gotta splurge a ill bit.  <br><br>This is located on the edge of Little Italy and beginning of the financial district.  Worth a stop in my opinion. :)",

"reviewcomment":"With so many french places to chose from in San Diego this is by far my favorite french restaurant. The food, the service, prices, and portion sizes are a 10!! This is not a fancy french place so you don&#39;t need to dress up. It also has a patio where dogs are allowed. <br><br>Came here on a Tuesday night for their Tuesday night special. $22.95 for 3 courses including an appetizer, entree, and dessert. Many times for these pre- set 3 course dinners the portion sizes are small and the menu items aren&#39;t appetizing. However, not the case at Au Revoir. <br><br>Bread: Pretty standard french loaf but it comes with a dijon mustard butter. <br><br>We also tried a small order of their mussels for $8.00. This is such a steal since their small portion gives you about 25 mussels. We ordered the campagnardes mussels - creme fraiche and white wine sauce with a hint of dijon mustard. Also came with chunks of pancetta and mushrooms. The mussels tasted very fresh and not rubbery at all. <br><br>Started out with the French onion soup. Ooey gooey cheese melted on top of large crispy crouton. They don&#39;t skimp on the cheese. The broth wasn&#39;t overly salty and had tons of onions in it. We also got the escargot topped with puff pastry.  You get 6 snails that are soaked in buttery parsley goodness. The butter was so good that I even dipped my bread into it. <br><br>Entree: <br>I decided to get the beef bourguingnon. Normally this is priced at $18.00 on their regular menu. The beef wasn&#39;t as tender as I expected it to be, but it was still very flavorful. 4 large chunks of beef simmered in a red wine sauce. The carrots and potatoes absorbed all the herbs and spices I couldn&#39;t stop eating them. <br><br>Also tried the seafood pappardelle. Normally $17.00 on menu.  Wow! Tons of seafood. Came with 4 large shrimp, about 9 mussels, 2 large chunks of salmon and 3 pieces of lobster claw meat. None of the seafood was overcooked at all.  It came with a creme fraiche sauce, almost like an alfredo sauce but more on the lighter side. The pasta was cooked al dente and had a perfect consistency. <br><br>Dessert: <br>The creme brulee was the only let down of the meal. I thought that it had this odd paste consistency. Also ordered the poached pear in red wine sauce. It came with 2 gigantic scoops of vanilla bean ice cream. The poached pear was sweet and took on the flavor of the sweet red wine they used. <br><br>Service: <br>Water was always refilled and both our waiter and waitress were extremely friendly. They came to check on us after each dish came out. <br><br>Come back again? For sure!! They seem to have a great happy hour too with appetizers including mussels, frog legs, and calamari  for around $5.00",

I used to live in LA/OC and now SD, so I feel pretty strongly about that statement. <br><br>Ambience - simple, not too fancy, just right<br><br>Food - The food is the main story here! It&#39;s is delicious, all of it! First things first, they give everyone a bowl of daal to start which is delicious. Really a home made taste, just like my mom makes. Their main dishes are all good. This isn&#39;t like any other place, because they have unique flavors that are different from other Indian restaurant. That himalayan touch really makes a huge different. My favorite is the paneer tikka masala (note: I&#39;m vegetarian). It&#39;s creamy but balanced and appropriately spicy if you ask for it. And you have to get the garlic naan with it. But I also love the momos. They are really unique, light, and flavorful. Similar to dumplings. My husband loves the Chicken Makhani and the Goat when they have it. <br><br>Price - really reasonable. It makes for an affordable night out with big portions.",

Heard a rumor from patient that there is a place just around the corner of UCSD hospital where all the doctors, nurses, and staff members go eat. Well certainly no lie there, after we sat down three nurses, staff member and two doctors come in. <br><br>Came in and checked out and noticed they have lunch combos. Order the combo #5 came with a Gyro (stuff with tons of meat! Not like other places you are eating and there is only like 2-3 strips if meat, this was stuff). If also came with either fries season with their salty n spices seasoning or basmati rice mixed with herbs (I got the rice), along with a Greek salad with a free canned soda! <br><br>It was very tasty! The gyro I couldn&#39;t put down highly recommended.<br><br>The rice was hot off the place good along with a fresh Greek salad with feta cheese crumbles! Yum!<br><br>The restaurant it self is bigger than how it looks. It&#39;s very nice décor. A lot of windows, flat screen tv, and fountain. If you check In on yelp you get $2 off your bill!!<br><br>Good place for lunch! Will return again! :)",

The Calamari was not that crispy and little chewy.  The marinara sauce was sweet, acidic, and flavorful.  The 6 Raviolis were covered with three sauces making up the Italian flag: Pesto, Alfredo, and Marinara. But by the end, it was just a delicious orange-ish sauce. The Lasagna was a piece of veggie lasagna draped with Meat sauce.  Overall, it was pretty good but the sauce was a little overcooked.",

Their toasted subs give you the perfect crunch filled with warm soft, cheesy, meaty  pure happy bliss of a lifetime- no lie.<br><br>One of my favorite things about this restaurant, besides their pretty much always friendly staff is the fact they have Kool-Aide! Prior to eating there for the first time, that day I had an intense craving for grape Kool-Aide, hadn&#39;t had one for years. And what do you know, they freakin had it! <br><br>Check this place out- help put Quiznos and Subway out of the game!",

"reviewcomment":"First off I want to say with full confidence that you wont find a better Sicilian slice anywhere in Southern California. Sicilian is not the standard though so with that said, the thin crust is phenomenal, and very high up there in regards to best Thin Crust in SD!!<br><br>4.5 rounded because of their delivery. I agree with most people about the delivery pizza not showing up in the same way you get at the shop. But that is in some regards, pretty standard for delivery. The reason for the 4 is because I&#39;ve asked them to cook the Za well done on numerous occasions and the Za is still flappy floppy. Still tastes great but not the same crispiness that you get at the pizza shop. <br><br>Anyway, when I&#39;m craving a slice there is no other place I&#39;ll go. Zaaaaaaa!!!",

"reviewcomment":"Just finished my lunch of eggplant parmigiana leftover from Sunday dinner at Osteria Romantica. Even microwaved, best ever. That was my first time there and I can hardly wait to go back.<br><br>     Since there would be 10 in our party (my Italian in-laws), a reservation was phoned in a few hours ahead of time; we were seated immediately upon arriving. Service was great, but then no one in our group is high maintenance. The service was unobtrusive but we always had water, extra bread and dipping sauce, the dishes came out at a good pace, dessert was offered and the check came when it was time for the check to come -- magical. If you like a lot of attention from the staff when you dine out, this probably isn&#39;t a good fit for you. If you like the company at your table, it&#39;s perfect. <br><br>     As far as taste and quality, everyone loved what they&#39;d ordered. Perhaps some of these reviewers are looking for more creativity? My family repeatedly commented that this or that dish had been prepared and tasted like the familiar, traditional dish was &#34;supposed&#34; to. Here&#39;s a quick rundown of some other dishes that our party enjoyed: Artichoke appetizer, grilled salmon with polenta, lobster ravioli, fettucine piemonte, salmon ravioli, halibut, lamb pappardelle, some calamari dish. <br><br>     My birthday is coming up and I look forward to returning for their mushroom ravioli! <br><br>Salute!",

It&#39;s fun, has a great relaxed vibe. You don&#39;t have to feel like everyone else is an elitist here... it&#39;s got the democratizing effect of a good sports bar- people don&#39;t care who you are or your background- just who you cheer for. I came here to watch some march madness basketball, and it was pretty awesome. They even had awesome raffle games and other sorts of contests related to the games with awesome prizes. <br><br>The beer selection? Wondrous. Lots of taps, lots of local brews. <br><br>The Food? Ginormous. I had their burger. It was divinely heart-attack-inducing. The bun was wonderful, they had a double patty. The fries were awesome. My friend had chicken and waffles and scarfed it down with joy. The waitress was fun and bantered back and forth with us, making the experience even better. <br><br>If I&#39;m in the area and I need to watch a game, I know that this is a great place for me to do it at!",

However, no matter how long you wait for your order, those burgers and fries are sooo worth it. <br><br>Never forget to ask for extra spread! And I love how they have the chillies out for you to get yourself now. If only they had a pump dispenser of the spread right next to the ketchup one..<br><br>Advice on what to order: Double Double Animal styled with chillies, well done fries and a Dr. Pepper to go with it.<br><br>Damn.. probably gonna head over there right now and order that..",

"reviewcomment":"This place is the best Indian/Himalayan restaurant in SoCal! I used to live in LA/OC and now SD, so I feel pretty strongly about that statement. <br><br>Ambience - simple, not too fancy, just right<br><br>Food - The food is the main story here! It&#39;s is delicious, all of it! First things first, they give everyone a bowl of daal to start which is delicious. Really a home made taste, just like my mom makes. Their main dishes are all good. This isn&#39;t like any other place, because they have unique flavors that are different from other Indian restaurant. That himalayan touch really makes a huge different. My favorite is the paneer tikka masala (note: I&#39;m vegetarian). It&#39;s creamy but balanced and appropriately spicy if you ask for it. And you have to get the garlic naan with it. But I also love the momos. They are really unique, light, and flavorful. Similar to dumplings. My husband loves the Chicken Makhani and the Goat when they have it. <br><br>Price - really reasonable. It makes for an affordable night out with big portions.",

"reviewcomment":"My boyfriend said, &#34;Lets go to [another seafood place] for dinner tonight.&#34; Coming from my east county history of that chain and this one, I knew I had to introduce him to the delicious-ness that is the BRIG.  I had never been to this location, but I was just as impressed!<br><br>Upon first spoonful of the chowder, it was an instant win for him. (A big &#34;woo!&#34; for me who suggested this...)  We also munched on the calamari which had a great dipping sauce.  From there, he had the seafood sampler (fried seafood... how could you go wrong?!) but also the potato salad is <a href='/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Famaze.com&amp;s=8ac205a7b04bc939378faf05495b72d194317158668902471dff1388888eb84d' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>amaze.com</a>.  I had the Seafood Louie, which I should have gotten the dressing tossed in.  The salad is much too large to conquer mixing the dressing in which all the toppings!  I&#39;d even try maybe a lighter dressing with it next time and probably love it even more.<br><br>During past visits, I had the fish tacos, which are hands down incredible.  Try them!<br><br>Seriously everything is amazing. If you are considering somewhere else for seafood, just STOP and come here (or the one in East County).  I have never been let down by this place.",

"reviewcomment":"It was a naked Sunday !! You know what I mean ! Craving for a good late lunch and Naked Cafe came to mind !!!<br><br>Had no clue they were closing at 2pm on a Sunday, but luckily we got there just in the nick of time.<br><br>This location is different from the one in Solana Beach (not overlooking the beach), but it still has the same beachy theme vibe.<br><br>Great service !!<br><br>Staff was welcoming and made us grab any seat. It was definitely empty, but figured it was Easter Sunday and it was 15 minute &#39;til closing and they still served us and didn&#39;t rush us at all. Very cool ! <br><br>Food was delish !<br><br>I did the build your own wrap with:<br><br>Sesame Ginger Tofu, Spinach Wrapper, Dijon Mustard and Organic Salad on the side. You can have fun and design your own sandwiches and/or wraps and accessorize it. I love how you can change it up to your liking. Although the wrap was delish, I wish there were more chunks of tofu and less wrapper. I also think the orgainc salad could use a little more flavor. It was pretty basic and the dressing was just a simple balsamic vinaigrette. I&#39;m a salad guru so this was boring to me.<br><br>Bf got the usual Artichoke scramble. Eggs, artichoke hearts, cheese, green onions &amp; tomatoes served w/ herb potatoes &amp; toast. Generous portion and he said for some reason this tasted better than the one in Solana Beach. Hmm..maybe he was hungrier ? haha <br><br>He also enjoyed a cup of coffee and raved about it. I&#39;m not a coffee drinker so I&#39;ll just take his word for it. haha. <br><br>Overall, the service and food were decent. I liked how you can customize your order and veganize items as well. Definitely can satisfy all diets. I also can tell that the staff enjoyed working here.  I&#39;d probably go to the one in Solana Beach since it&#39;s closer to home and by the water, but if I ever find myself in this area, I&#39;d definitely come back to try out other items. I hear the Green Transcendence Wrap is vegan and a popular pick !!!<br><br>3.5 STARS !!!",

"reviewcomment":"I was in town to visit family and my sister suggested this place, as one of her favorites.  I had not tried it before, but I do like Afghani food so was up for the dinner.<br><br>Parking is a little tight in this part of Hillcrest but not a deal breaker.  We parked a little over a block away.<br><br>The restaurant ambiance is a little retro-metro-techno which does not exactly fit the cultural background, but not an issue for me-but just thought I would mention it here.  The front door stayed open, and traffic noise was annoying, as was the drone of mechanical equipment noise from the HVAC and kitchen hood systems.<br><br>These noise issues made conversation difficult inside the restaurant.<br><br>I am more familiar with Persian/Iranian food-which shares some commonality with Afghani food-so I was pleased to see some of the similar dishes, including the spinach dishes which I love.  What was outstanding is that this restaurant does not cook the life out of the spinach as some Persian restaurants do and the spinach dish I had retained much of its green freshness.  <br><br>The owner/manager made some suggestions to my order and was quite willing to make changes and substitutions to the side dishes.  Great friendly guy, and we felt like we were in his home by the way he treated us.  He suggested that I try several different and varied rices side dishes since I commented that they all looked good.  Service timing was very good and all the staff were friendly.<br><br>I ordered the grilled Salmon-which was moist and done just right- and the different accompanying rice side dishes that I ordered with it were just outstanding- I had an even half dozen, some familiar, some not, and the cherry rice that i tried is like a sweet dessert.  I have never been much of a fan of rice pudding or other sweet rice desserts, and although this cherry rice is not exactly a dessert, it is just delicious as all get out!  For my taste, all items that I had were fresh and tasty as if just prepared-which I am assuming they were.  <br><br>The baba ganoush was the best I have had in a long time, and at our table as an appetizer it disappeared almost immediately, as the family grabbed it fast.<br><br>Pricing is a bit on the high side, but the location in Hillcrest tends to push up the cost in any food  venue in this area, and just know that going in.<br><br>I will be back for the food, but I will not give five stars until they have their air conditioning systems checked for noise issues and close the damn front door.",

"reviewcomment":"I came here on the suggestion of a friend the first time and have been back again since then.<br><br>I have only tried their deep dish pizzas, but my husband had their top sirloin as well. The deep dish pizzas are DIVINE; that&#39;s the truth! On the other hand, their prices and the attitudes of the waitresses are the exact opposite.<br><br>THE GOOD: Yes, the deep dish pizzas are to die for. They are baked to perfection with large amounts of toppings and the crust gets to the perfect crispy goodness.<br><br>THE BAD: Expect to pay $14 for a personal pizza and upwards of $20+ for a small, mediocre piece of steak.<br><br>THE OTHER BAD: The service and attitudes of the waitresses were crummy both times that I&#39;ve been here. I understand that you&#39;re busy and don&#39;t really care about me, but if I ask you what&#39;s your favorite dish between my two picks or I ask you how your day has been going, please don&#39;t roll your eyes or huff and puff because I&#39;m asking your opinion or just making small talk. I also understand that people have off days and some days just plain suck, but until the person who waits us is not in a standoff mood, I&#39;m leaving my review as three stars.<br><br>Chances are, I&#39;ll continue to come back to BJ&#39;s regardless of the wait staff and the price... Those deep dish pizzas are worth it.<br><br>**TIP: Last time we came in, they offered us a rewards card. Kind of like Red Robin&#39;s reward program, each dollar you spend at BJ&#39;s you earn 1 point. They culminate until you have a certain amount and you can get a % off your ticket, free dessert, etc, etc, etc. Worth it if you go here more than two times probably. **",

"reviewcomment":"Love this place! <br><br>They make a really tasty California, my FAVORITE burrito there -- I also really like the cheese and beef enchiladas, chimichangas (so good!) and their rice is top of the line!<br><br>It&#39;s a super friendly staff--I&#39;ve placed all sorts of unusual requests (like a rice, egg, and cheese burrito), and they&#39;ve been fine making it...and it was amazing. Plus they have daily specials that are seriously great deals, like Monday monster burritos (these HUGE, double tortilla burritos, are like $6). Great salsa bar too - you&#39;ve gotta try the tomatillo salsa!<br><br>They also have a great environment -- always something good to watch on the TV (and they just got another TV, too!) and just a nice, friendly atmosphere. I used to go there to get schoolwork done all the time. Plus, outdoor seating, which is so nice on sunny days.<br><br>As a UCSD student, I really appreciate the location so close to campus and also the affordable price. I see a lot of UCSD students when I&#39;m there, so I know it&#39;s well-liked by other students, too!<br><br>It&#39;s the only place like it for a good 5-10 miles.  A great find!",

"reviewcomment":"I don&#39;t know the difference between good and bad sushi because I only eat the veggie kind, but I can tell you that I liked the ramen a lot--particularly since they have a broth choice to make it vegetarian. THANK YOU! You can also add tofu to the soup (it isn&#39;t listed on the menu, however). I was pretty pleased with the amount of veggie options on the menu--and thanks for having TWO veggie broth choices.<br><br>So, I&#39;d say the veggie options are worth the money and tasty. My husband liked his fish rolls (not sure what he got, sorry), and said they were about on par with other, similarly priced sushi.<br><br>The service at this restaurant is 5 stars. The waitress knew EVERYTHING about the menu: what was vegan, veg, how to make something veg, whether something was worth the time or not, and even pointed out that instead of getting a large jug of sake, my husband and I should just check in on Yelp to receive two smalls for free. I wish I knew my waitress&#39; name, because she was amazing. She adds a ton of value to Dragon&#39;s Den.<br><br>FYI: The sushi closes up at 10 pm, but the hot/cold food kitchen stays open for the duration of the night.",

"reviewcomment":"I infrequently eat at Greek restaurants even though I like flavors from all over the Mediterranean region. I tend to make my own grilled veggies, spanikopita and hummus but have been to Appolina three times with clients or parties. My husband&#39;s holiday party was held at Appolina this year. For starters we had hummus, grape leaves and flat bread which was followed with a Greek salad and meat kabobs, salmon or veggie entrees. We also had some sort of rich dessert pastries.<br><br>The hummus tasted fresh and had a nice visual display with a bit of oil and garbanzo beans on top, it was a great starter with some flat bread. I am not a fan of stuffed grape leaves but they were vegetarian and I tasted one. The cold, ricey, vinegary flavor was not for me. Greek salad on the other hand was right up my alley. Feta cheese, Greek olives, lettuce and onions gave this salad life, but the December the tomatoes were hard.<br><br>I really wanted the saganaki but could not figure out how to order a flaming cheese plate without attracting too much attention. This decadent cheese dish covered with lemon and brandy is really the number one reason that I  would go Greek. The devious side of me wanted to order one but that would have attracted way too much attention,  my husband has only been with this company 6 months and I have never met any of his colleagues. It was torturous to know that Saganaki was so close but yet so far away.  <br><br>My plate was salmon, It seems like all fixed menus with fish have salmon, which is coincidentally my least favorite type of fish. It was prepared correctly and has some really nice veggies and rice to compliment it. The dessert looked nice, they served us some baklava and another decadent pastry and my husband had no trouble eating all of them.<br><br>Our server offered us drinks and filled my wine when it got empty and everything was served hot.  Appolina was a good location for a holiday party, I may be back and if so I will get that flaming saganaki.",

The lunch special is great, it&#39;s perfect size and comes with your choice of entree with rice, salad, and a few spring rolls and fried dumpling things. <br><br>I try to make it here a couple times a month. For dinner I usually get a bowl of veggie soup (or a hot pot if I&#39;m with 2+ other people) and a curry. They ask you how spicy on a scale of 1-10 and it usually comes out pretty true to the number. I also enjoy the pad Thai. <br><br>Good portion sizes mean I usually leave with left overs for lunch the next day :)",

"reviewcomment":"This place is the best Indian/Himalayan restaurant in SoCal! I used to live in LA/OC and now SD, so I feel pretty strongly about that statement. <br><br>Ambience - simple, not too fancy, just right<br><br>Food - The food is the main story here! It&#39;s is delicious, all of it! First things first, they give everyone a bowl of daal to start which is delicious. Really a home made taste, just like my mom makes. Their main dishes are all good. This isn&#39;t like any other place, because they have unique flavors that are different from other Indian restaurant. That himalayan touch really makes a huge different. My favorite is the paneer tikka masala (note: I&#39;m vegetarian). It&#39;s creamy but balanced and appropriately spicy if you ask for it. And you have to get the garlic naan with it. But I also love the momos. They are really unique, light, and flavorful. Similar to dumplings. My husband loves the Chicken Makhani and the Goat when they have it. <br><br>Price - really reasonable. It makes for an affordable night out with big portions.",

We also tried the spinach dip which was very fresh and prepared perfectly . <br><br>We actually ended up here the following day to try some of the other menu items and were very impressed .

I was surprised how much sushi you can get for their price, about $6-8 bucks for about 10-12 pieces of sushi. <br><br>Their sushi is pretty good too and I&#39;ve never had a problem after I order getting my food on time, even when it&#39;s busy there. Depending on the week, they have sushi specials located on the whiteboard at the back of their restaurant for about $5. Me and my boyfriend usually end up getting the fire roll to feed the spice we need in our lives, along with the crunchy roll because it&#39;s my favorite or to just tame down the heat from the fire roll! They serve your crunchy roll warm because that&#39;s how you know it has fresh tempura in it! Also there is a bar. <br><br>Downside is that at night there is always a lot of people, but you can always call in for take out and pick it up. The place is kind of small. Sometimes it takes a while to get seated if you&#39;re lucky. Depending if it&#39;s really busy it can be hard to catch the server&#39;s attention.",

"reviewcomment":"This place is the best Indian/Himalayan restaurant in SoCal! I used to live in LA/OC and now SD, so I feel pretty strongly about that statement. <br><br>Ambience - simple, not too fancy, just right<br><br>Food - The food is the main story here! It&#39;s is delicious, all of it! First things first, they give everyone a bowl of daal to start which is delicious. Really a home made taste, just like my mom makes. Their main dishes are all good. This isn&#39;t like any other place, because they have unique flavors that are different from other Indian restaurant. That himalayan touch really makes a huge different. My favorite is the paneer tikka masala (note: I&#39;m vegetarian). It&#39;s creamy but balanced and appropriately spicy if you ask for it. And you have to get the garlic naan with it. But I also love the momos. They are really unique, light, and flavorful. Similar to dumplings. My husband loves the Chicken Makhani and the Goat when they have it. <br><br>Price - really reasonable. It makes for an affordable night out with big portions.",

I still think Asti has it. It was just as amazing, if not more, than I remember. <br><br>My husband had the Ossobuco alla Milanese, and I had the Agnolotti d&#39;Aragosta.

This was our first time here and based on the reviews it seemed like a hit or miss. For us it was definitely a hit. Food looked the way it tasted. Prime Rib pretty much melted in your mouth, everything that was fried was yummy. There was so much of the food I liked that I wasn&#39;t able to try everything because I became full too fast. <br><br>Pros: <br>Good food selection<br>Pretty fast service considering we went on a holiday and had 8 people in our party.  <br>Price was decent $15 per person.<br><br>Cons: <br>Seating is close to the table next to you if you&#39;re in a big party",

I&#39;m impressed that they do a lot of marketing events, such as wine (sometimes beer) dinner, cooking class, and have different regional menus at every month. This is why I keep coming back because I can always get to try new dishes! ;p<br><br>Also, what I really like about this place is it fits pretty much any occasions.  I go with my family and friends a lot, and also with my boyfriend for dinner, it&#39;s casual yet romantic.  I heard they&#39;re postponing the renovation, but I can&#39;t wait to see the new Il Fornaio Del Mar soon.  It&#39;s always clean and still looks good enough, but would be much better with new decor and interior design.",

It was rich and delicious, and my red cabbage bacon side helped cut through the creamy cheesey goodness.  My gf got the mac and cheese they use kerry gold irish white cheddar and had a decent amount of bangers in it. It was good and had her craving it the next day. <br><br>Ambience is dark, and has a pretty good sports bar area.  The only reason I&#39;m giving them 4 is because the hostess was a little weird.  I&#39;d definitely go back next time I&#39;m in the area.",

"reviewcomment":"This restaurant has been my go-to thai food ever since moving down here in San Diego. My wife introduced me to the place and ever since then we became regulars. I&#39;ve visited and tried other thai restaurants at downtown, north park, and national city but my favorite so far has been antique thai. The curry from this place makes me want to visit thailand so I can get my hands on authentic fhai curry recipe.<br><br>My favorite curry from this restaurant has been yellow amd paneng curry. I love the slight sweetness of the palm sugar they put in paneng and how rich the taste is. It is well cooked and they serve a decent serving. Other thai places I&#39;ve been to fills the whole bowl with tons of onion and over here they arw pretty generous. With the yellow curry, they serve it with a meat of your choice, potatoes, and onions (just enough for flavoring). The masaman beef curry is also good. Served in sizzling pot and the way they plate it is amazing. It just looks too good to eat. Other than the appearance of the dish, the taste is exquisite too. The beef is tender and the flavoring is perfect. The aroma of the currys is great too. I want to know what type of spices they add with their dishes. They have a spiciness scale from 1/10 and 5/10 makes me sweat bullets already. The creaminess of the curry makes the spiciness worth eating though.<br><br>Their fried rice is also delicious. The crab fried rice is filled with many flavors and the portion is generous too. Another one is the pineapple fried rice which is served in a pineapple cut in half that includes shrimp or w.e. choice of meat you chose and cashew nuts. It is terrific and the fried rice comes out great. Unlike other restaurants where the rice comes out mushy. Over here they cook it perfectly.<br><br>Dessert is good too! Mango sticky rice has become one of my favorite dessert and it makes me want to come back for more. The chef made some decorations with the plating and my wife was really happy about it. Thanks chef :)<br><br>The place is under new management and the restaurant is understaffed. The owner is the chef and waitress so we can only imagine how tough that is and what she is going through. There were some problems with the other staff members before so they had to be cut (rude, uncivilized people) and now they need people to apply over there and keep the place running and our stomachs full and happy. This place is worth it and if we wait for them to hire good, kind people to work, this will be one of the best thai restaurant in point loma, maybe even San Diego. <br><br>Overall my experience here has been wonderful and the new owner is a great addition to the team. I will continue coming here with more family and friends.",

"reviewcomment":"This place is the best Indian/Himalayan restaurant in SoCal! I used to live in LA/OC and now SD, so I feel pretty strongly about that statement. <br><br>Ambience - simple, not too fancy, just right<br><br>Food - The food is the main story here! It&#39;s is delicious, all of it! First things first, they give everyone a bowl of daal to start which is delicious. Really a home made taste, just like my mom makes. Their main dishes are all good. This isn&#39;t like any other place, because they have unique flavors that are different from other Indian restaurant. That himalayan touch really makes a huge different. My favorite is the paneer tikka masala (note: I&#39;m vegetarian). It&#39;s creamy but balanced and appropriately spicy if you ask for it. And you have to get the garlic naan with it. But I also love the momos. They are really unique, light, and flavorful. Similar to dumplings. My husband loves the Chicken Makhani and the Goat when they have it. <br><br>Price - really reasonable. It makes for an affordable night out with big portions.",

When my friend brought me here I didn&#39;t really have high expectations because my bar was set so high. The restaurant itself was quite small but in a cozy way. There seems to be only one server which made sense since it wasn&#39;t packed. We seated ourselves and the server was prompt and extremely nice. We ordered the yellow curry noodle and the pad see ewe. First off I was pleasantly surprised to see that yellow curry noodle existed since I had never seen it before. When it came out I was even more pleased by how it tasted. I&#39;ve always been more of the pan fried noodles fan like pad kee mao or drunken noodles or even pad see ewe but I was kind of blown away by this dish. The pad see ewe was only okay compared to the curry noodle. <br><br>I&#39;ve gone back quite a few times and have tried a few other dishes. The fresh rolls are excellent with a nice herby flavor. The house curry noodle is another great curry noodle fusion that holds its own next the yellow curry noodle. The drunken noodle is also quite excellent and is a perfect substitute for the pad kee mao I&#39;ve been missing from Davis. I look forward to going back and trying even more dishes. Love this place!!",

They offered us full portions of the food options and it was a difficult decision! We booked them right off the bat it was so good! They were very accommodating, even creating a menu option for a guest of ours that could not have casein (milk protein). While people were inside the venue during cocktail hour eating the yummy apps, we were outside having photos taken. Miho staff made sure that we got at least 4 boxes of the Truffle Fries and another appetizer while we were waiting! Best service ever! We chose Truffle Fries, prosciutto wrapped asparagus, chicken skewers for appetizers. Pulled pork sammy, chicken biscuit, Burger and portobello mushroom burger for our main courses. Potato salad and fresh green salad for sides. Everyone raved about the food and are still telling us about it a week after the wedding! Friendly staff and delicious, amazing fresh food! We highly recommend Miho Gastrotruck for any event, or any time you see their truck! Thank you Miho!",

"reviewcomment":"This place is the best Indian/Himalayan restaurant in SoCal! I used to live in LA/OC and now SD, so I feel pretty strongly about that statement. <br><br>Ambience - simple, not too fancy, just right<br><br>Food - The food is the main story here! It&#39;s is delicious, all of it! First things first, they give everyone a bowl of daal to start which is delicious. Really a home made taste, just like my mom makes. Their main dishes are all good. This isn&#39;t like any other place, because they have unique flavors that are different from other Indian restaurant. That himalayan touch really makes a huge different. My favorite is the paneer tikka masala (note: I&#39;m vegetarian). It&#39;s creamy but balanced and appropriately spicy if you ask for it. And you have to get the garlic naan with it. But I also love the momos. They are really unique, light, and flavorful. Similar to dumplings. My husband loves the Chicken Makhani and the Goat when they have it. <br><br>Price - really reasonable. It makes for an affordable night out with big portions.",

"reviewcomment":"I came here on a Saturday night to meet some friends because I was supposed to go to F6ix but the line there was way too long.  This Rooftop bar used to be pretty good years ago and it had a cover, but neither are true anymore.<br><br>The reason I still give this place a high rating is because even though it&#39;s not as happening of a place anymore, I always love a spot that does not charge cover.  Another plus is that they had a pretty good DJ.  Mainly top 40 hip hop and EDM music.  So I had fun singing and dancing along.  The dance floor is not very big, but it was full, the entire rooftop is pretty big, and a large proportion of the people danced wherever they were at, dance floor or not.  This place also has a great view facing all of south downtown San Diego. <br><br>Management and staff will take decent care of you here.  Some drunk girl stumbled through my friends table area and took out all of the mixers.  Management generously provided a complimentary second bottle of tequila.<br><br>The downsides are first, that the drinks at the bar were pricey.  I bought a Sailor Jerry&#39;s and Diet Coke, and a soda water and lime for $15.  And I assume the soda water and lime was a free drink because it is at every other bar I go.  Second, the crowd is not nearly as good looking as it used to be here.  But you will find some hot people sprinkled here and there in this place.  <br><br>Ultimately, I recommend checking this place out if you are looking for a fun place to dance to top 40 music without paying cover.  But you get what you pay for.",

Generally strip mall locations don&#39;t typically bode well for any type of food up here, let alone Mexican.<br><br>Ranas is excellent, however, and ended up being my favorite restaurant that my wife and I ate at during our recent trip to SoCal. The food is spicy, flavorful, and made with care we Pacific Northwesterners just don&#39;t get from our local Azteca or Las Margaritas.<br><br>The service is extremely friendly and they are more than able to help out with menu choices if you feel overwhelmed by your options. Basically, if you are looking for a simple burrito or enchiladas (though they are on the menu, they&#39;re far from typical) , you&#39;re likely better off looking elsewhere. This place seems to specialize in regional Mexican cuisine not typically offered by your usual Mexican hotspots.<br><br>I could eat here every day and still likely find something new and amazing on the menu.

"reviewcomment":"Devour the addicting Cubano sandwich for $5.95! Sip your Cafe con Leche with a pinch of salt and a dab of butter. Inhale the buttery sweet pineapple air. Feel the lazy slow thrumming beat of the Caribbean music.  Want it more mellow? Order a Sangria, sweet and sexy.<br><br>The slow roasted pork takes up to 12 hours to marinate and then roast slowly in the oven. The bread is buttered and the Cubano sandwich is served panini style. This is the best Cubano sandwich I&#39;ve tried, and one of the best paninis in town for $5.95. It has marinated slow roasted pulled pork, ham, melty Swiss cheese &amp; pickles on buttered and toasted Cuban bread with a mayo mustard spread. It&#39;s the perfect panini!<br><br>When I&#39;m at home, I crave Embargo Grill&#39;s  cafe con leche with a pinch of salt and a dab of butter. So rich and strong! Love it! <br><br>This 5 star review is specifically for this Cubano sandwich and the cafe con leche with salt and butter, which are the 2 best items I&#39;ve tried at Embargo Grill in my 4 visits. Highly recommended!<br><br>If the staff is slow to notice your arrival, get up and find Carl, who proudly designed the menu. Believe me, once they notice you and wait on you, you will get plenty of attention. Embargo Grill is in a strip mall, and it&#39;s well worth seeking out.",

It&#39;s fabulous, dahhhling.<br><br>Lil B&#39;s has an extensive menu with everything from chicken and waffles to spicy enchilada soup. I got the chicken and waffles. Delicious. The waffle was doughy and good. The plate, which was the size of a hubcap, came with lots of extra goodies - soup, vegetable, and rice. All of it was yummy. <br><br>My kids got hamburgers and fries. The bucket of fries was disproportionately large in comparison with the hamburger, which was basically a slider with two patties on it. One of my kids ate it up easily. The other couldn&#39;t get her mouth around it because it was too high. I wish they had a regular sized burger.

"reviewcomment":"Sooo I&#39;ve never eaten lobster in Boston *but* this is the BEST lobster roll I&#39;ve had outside of Maine!  Is it expensive?  Sorta-ish.  Is it worth it?  ABSOLUTELY!<br><br>What can I say that hasn&#39;t already been said...huge chunks of lobster, lightly dressed with mayo on a lightly toasted buttered bun.  It&#39;s the things dreams are made of.  AND, if that&#39;s not enough - it&#39;s customizable!  Don&#39;t want useless foul celery messing up your tasty lobster?  No problem!  <br><br>I had the large roll because my eyes were bigger than my stomach and I didn&#39;t comprehend that there could be such thing as too much lobster.  Lucky for me I had some bisque leftover and dropped the extra pieces of the happiest meat on earth into my take-home soup.  Also, there were no pieces in my soup to begin with.  Was that a one-off?  C&#39;mon, who doesn&#39;t love some knuckle meat in their bisque.  Am I just getting greedy?  Maybe.<br><br>Was here at about 3 on a Sunday.  We were the only people in the place.  No lines - score!  Now I&#39;m going to dream about lobster all day.  Great.",

"reviewcomment":"This place is the best Indian/Himalayan restaurant in SoCal! I used to live in LA/OC and now SD, so I feel pretty strongly about that statement. <br><br>Ambience - simple, not too fancy, just right<br><br>Food - The food is the main story here! It&#39;s is delicious, all of it! First things first, they give everyone a bowl of daal to start which is delicious. Really a home made taste, just like my mom makes. Their main dishes are all good. This isn&#39;t like any other place, because they have unique flavors that are different from other Indian restaurant. That himalayan touch really makes a huge different. My favorite is the paneer tikka masala (note: I&#39;m vegetarian). It&#39;s creamy but balanced and appropriately spicy if you ask for it. And you have to get the garlic naan with it. But I also love the momos. They are really unique, light, and flavorful. Similar to dumplings. My husband loves the Chicken Makhani and the Goat when they have it. <br><br>Price - really reasonable. It makes for an affordable night out with big portions.",

Would definitely return despite the prices b/c I love Peking duck so much. doesn&#39;t compare to the stuff you eat in HK or Asia but still pretty good. Salt &amp; pepper shrimp is bomb too. Eat it with the shell on with the peppers and the fried little bits on the side. So good!<br><br>Also, we went on a Saturday night to celebrate my birthday.

"reviewcomment":"This place is the best Indian/Himalayan restaurant in SoCal! I used to live in LA/OC and now SD, so I feel pretty strongly about that statement. <br><br>Ambience - simple, not too fancy, just right<br><br>Food - The food is the main story here! It&#39;s is delicious, all of it! First things first, they give everyone a bowl of daal to start which is delicious. Really a home made taste, just like my mom makes. Their main dishes are all good. This isn&#39;t like any other place, because they have unique flavors that are different from other Indian restaurant. That himalayan touch really makes a huge different. My favorite is the paneer tikka masala (note: I&#39;m vegetarian). It&#39;s creamy but balanced and appropriately spicy if you ask for it. And you have to get the garlic naan with it. But I also love the momos. They are really unique, light, and flavorful. Similar to dumplings. My husband loves the Chicken Makhani and the Goat when they have it. <br><br>Price - really reasonable. It makes for an affordable night out with big portions.",

"reviewcomment":"I can literally walk to Champagne Bakery from my apartment and have strolled by it numerous times before finally stopping in for lunch with a friend a couple of weeks ago. I&#39;m so happy that I gave it a chance!<br><br>While there are several hot sandwiches on the menu that sound tasty (the Chicken Pesto, Garlic Chicken Panini and French Dip), it was a hot day so I went for the Turkey, Swiss and Bacon minus the bacon and avocado. The cashier looked at me like I was crazy when I asked to remove those two popular items from my sandwich but I don&#39;t eat pig and I don&#39;t like avocado (I know, that&#39;s practically unheard of in San Diego). After paying, I suddenly realized that my pug would actually enjoy the bacon and I asked for it to be served on the side, which they thankfully obliged. Make my pug happy, make me happy! :) <br><br>The sandwich, which came with a dijon mustard, was wonderful. My only slight complaint is that the baguette is very hard and can wreck havoc on the roof of your mouth. I&#39;m pleased to report, however, that the bread softens up on day two and the sandwich makes me a great leftover lunch. The fries, which are one of the side options, were good but the restaurant doesn&#39;t carry ranch dressing, which is my addiction. <br><br>In addition to bringing my pug the plate of bacon, they also found a water bowl for her. Any restaurant that goes out of their way to be dog friendly earns major points in my book. :)",

I&#39;m soooooo happy to say we&#39;ve come home!<br><br>Sabuku sushi is sooo sooo delicious.<br><br>The man&#39;s absolute favorite is the stuffed tunato inside it has seared scallops in a spicy sesame ginger aioli that is all wrapped up in yummy tuna and topped with re tempura crunchies, scallions, kuro goma &amp; a dash of sriracha.<br><br>A bit if a differentiator that Sabuku offers is their bacon menu. It seemed weird at first like a novelty, but it&#39;s actually rather delicious. My favorite is the BTA.  Inside it has 2 slices of bacon, spicy tuna &amp; your choice of either: avocado or asparagus (I reco the Avo) sauce, yuzu wasabi bin, bacon garlic aioli &amp; sriracha then they top it with tempura crunchies, scallions &amp; kuro goma. <br><br>They make you feel very welcome here. I read another review that talked about the owner being very rude. I can&#39;t speak to that experience but I can say that the owner has never been anything but warm and welcoming to us. I absolutely love it here and if you&#39;re looking for some delicious sushi this is your new favorite place.",

I didn&#39;t check bottle selection; as what&#39;s the point of that when out? Crowd on Thursday night wasn&#39;t to rowdy, but definitely looking for fun. <br><br>The waitresses wear some pretty skimpy outfits. Nice for a group of guys, but maybe not for a date.

Our server, Eric, was extremely knowledgeable and spoiled us with impeccable service. He was even able to tell me which of the Chardonnays were un-oaked! <br>We started with the most delicious crab cake I&#39;ve ever had. The lemon beurre blanc that accompanied it was simply unreal. We literally (not really lol) licked the plate clean.<br>I had the filet mignon which was pure perfection. The mashed potatoes were to die for. <br>My boyfriend ordered the seared yellowtail and it was so good that I don&#39;t think he even stopped to breathe. Luckily he let me try a bite and OMG the flavors!! Everything complements each other amazingly and leaves you salivating for more!<br>My favorite desert was the Key Lime Pie which I don&#39;t normally go for. I heard the table nearby raving about how it took them back to Key West so I had to try. Seriously the best pie I&#39;ve ever had! <br>The views are spectacular!

"reviewcomment":"Lots of the reviews are spot on, so to sum it up: Food is awesome, service was fair, but I&#39;ll explain. For some reason, it was full when we got there on a Tuesday night, near closing, and the staff were running around with their heads cut off in the most figurative sense. Being that my wife and I were shabu virgins, we were hoping to get some help with what to do. The staff was too busy, but we got our cues from everyone else who ordered similar to what we ordered (the sukiyaki), and proceeded to swish like pros. Ladles? Who needs ladles when you have a nice soup spoon and chopsticks. <br><br>I&#39;ve given the full 5 because the server waived the sharing charge. Now THAT is customer service and for me, that counts for much. I&#39;ll be back even if they charge me double next time -- yes, the food was that good. I left happy and full.

You&#39;re given one choice here, and it&#39;s the ice cream scoop delivered on top of all the other stuff, it&#39;s a refreshing treat to enjoy whether you mix the ice cream with the other ingredients, or eat it from top to bottom, either way just dig in, it&#39;s great.",

"reviewcomment":"This place is the best Indian/Himalayan restaurant in SoCal! I used to live in LA/OC and now SD, so I feel pretty strongly about that statement. <br><br>Ambience - simple, not too fancy, just right<br><br>Food - The food is the main story here! It&#39;s is delicious, all of it! First things first, they give everyone a bowl of daal to start which is delicious. Really a home made taste, just like my mom makes. Their main dishes are all good. This isn&#39;t like any other place, because they have unique flavors that are different from other Indian restaurant. That himalayan touch really makes a huge different. My favorite is the paneer tikka masala (note: I&#39;m vegetarian). It&#39;s creamy but balanced and appropriately spicy if you ask for it. And you have to get the garlic naan with it. But I also love the momos. They are really unique, light, and flavorful. Similar to dumplings. My husband loves the Chicken Makhani and the Goat when they have it. <br><br>Price - really reasonable. It makes for an affordable night out with big portions.",

Very flavorful chili oil that melds with all of the ingredients like magic.<br><br>I ordered Kung Poa Chicken, House Fried a Rice (large succulent shrimp included), braised green beans, some kind of spicy beef dish, and Spicey Cold Noodle. I did this for two reasons: so I could find a dish that I was fond of, and so I could enjoy the diversity of Asian Spiced Delights for days as left overs. I will now have trouble each time I go to this wonderful little spot as I am so happy with all of these dishes, that I will have trouble deciding and will likely end up with another large order. Soooo Pleased! <br><br>The last time I was this Happy with Chinese Food I was in the Los Angeles Asian Hood. They have heavy competition in the Asian Communities for outstanding recipes.<br><br>Limited parking at peek hours. Very small seating. They pack the to go food nicely, CAUTION as the oils and sauces can wreak havoc on your carpet or upholstery.<br><br>On a final note I should have known the place was going to deliver the second I walked in as I was hit with indescribable aromas of sizzling shrimp and peanuts, ginger, chicken, veggies, etc. all at once. The torture is having to wait 15 minutes til the food finally arrives. Veggies were perfectly crisp and loaded with flavor!<br><br>She gave me a small discount for paying cash.",

"reviewcomment":"The hubby discovered this place on Yelp, and we are happy to report that the tacos were muy delicioso! We checked out El Paisa on a Sunday afternoon for lunch. After we parked in the small parking lot adjacent to the restaurant, we walked up to the small counter, which was stacked full of a variety of agua fresca. The restaurant looks rundown, and there is nothing particularly charming about it. There are a couple of booths inside and a handful of tables outside in front. We ordered 7 tacos between the 2 of us--adobada, birria, carne asada, and lengua. Shortly after we sat down, they bring you a basket of tortilla chips and an amazing spread of salsas, marinated carrots and jalapeños, cucumber slices, limes, and thin slivers of radishes--on the house!<br><br>The food is brought to your table by one of the nice ladies working there. You can dress up your tacos to your heart&#39;s content with the salsa spread, but you really don&#39;t need much to enjoy the tacos. The birria was tender and quite good. The lengua, just braised and not masked by much seasoning, was simple and delicious. The carne asada was not our favorite, forgettable in comparison to the other tacos. Our favorite was definitely the adobada, which is like al pastor minus the pineapple. The meat was flavorful and had great texture from being roasted on a spit. We devoured all 7 tacos, and the hubby even ordered 2 more! I also ordered an horchata, which was pretty good but nothing to write home about. <br><br>If you want some of the best adobada tacos this side of the border, check out El Paisa Inc (don&#39;t get it twisted with the plain ol&#39; El Paisa in town). And cash only!",

The craft beer selection rivals the big chain store Bev-Mo, but you get a much more personal service. Great wine selection with many white and sparking chilled. Tons of spirits also available. <br><br>4 stars for the restaurant....Great service, the food is just OK. A lot of heavy choices.",

"reviewcomment":"This place is the best Indian/Himalayan restaurant in SoCal! I used to live in LA/OC and now SD, so I feel pretty strongly about that statement. <br><br>Ambience - simple, not too fancy, just right<br><br>Food - The food is the main story here! It&#39;s is delicious, all of it! First things first, they give everyone a bowl of daal to start which is delicious. Really a home made taste, just like my mom makes. Their main dishes are all good. This isn&#39;t like any other place, because they have unique flavors that are different from other Indian restaurant. That himalayan touch really makes a huge different. My favorite is the paneer tikka masala (note: I&#39;m vegetarian). It&#39;s creamy but balanced and appropriately spicy if you ask for it. And you have to get the garlic naan with it. But I also love the momos. They are really unique, light, and flavorful. Similar to dumplings. My husband loves the Chicken Makhani and the Goat when they have it. <br><br>Price - really reasonable. It makes for an affordable night out with big portions.",

Turns out, our server Eric (made sure to remember his name specifically for this review) hand made the margaritas with fresh jalapeños just for us. <br>The food was delicious too. Between the three of us, we had the fish ceviche, lobster enchilada, chile relleno, tortilla soup and a beef taco. Plates were practically licked clean - everything was perfect.<br>All in all it was a great meal and the best service I&#39;ve received in a while.  <br>We will definitely be back and ask for Eric to make is his tasty jalapeño margaritas again and then maybe again....",

"reviewcomment":"We caught them at a horrible time around lunch and service ended up being horrendous.<br><br>But lets forget that and review the food and drinks:<br><br>I ordered a soup, salad, chocolate shake and a Reuben.<br><br>The soup was mediocre, and served warm rather then hot. I would&#39;ve preferred it very hot, which could have improved my opinions on the soup from the start.<br><br>The salad was surprisingly good. It was a very basic prepackaged salad mix with iceberg lettuce and carrots, but it seemed to be very fresh and as a result i thought the salad was very good. **Funny how easy it is to make a decent salad, just need fresh ingredients! :D<br><br>The chocolate shake was not my favorite. It was delivered too runny and almost seemed like chocolate milk, but the flavor was alright. I really like my shakes to be a good thick flavorful drink. It should be slightly difficult to drink it through a straw rather then be like your drinking chocolate milk.<br><br>The Reuben - The reuben was filled corned beef, swiss, and sauerkraut. The sandwich was flavorful and good to the very last bite. This sandwich saved the review. It wasn&#39;t the best reuben i&#39;ve eaten, but it was a good one that i&#39;d eat again given the opportunity.",

This milkshake had a fair amount of bacon too, My shake was sweet, salty, smooth and crunchy=YUMMY4MYTUMMY<br><br>My first Sonic stop and I was reeled in hook, line and sinker. Just throw a milkshake my way that has bacon in it. LOL<br><br>Add in the rollerskates. Corn dogs and tater tots.<br><br>This place holds many simple joys. A corn dog on a stick, tater tots that have chili and cheese. Milkshakes of multiple flavors. Service on rollerskates and the coin changed that is so old school.<br><br>I like how they have the old fashion way of being able to sit in your car at the drive in and eat. Place your order from your car. When I was a kid, going to the local A&amp;W to get food delivered to your window was a BIG DEAL. Coming to Sonic is like a throwback to my childhood.<br><br>The high tech way of ordering if  you not in your car was a bit of an adventure. Push the button to speak into the mouthbox. Order you food and if you want pay with your credit card right there. I did this and it worked. The only down side is that I didn&#39;t have any cash on my so I couldn&#39;t tip my rollerskating friend who served me food and my milkshake. Brought me extra napkins and condiments. Sorry Josh with the #100 bracelet on. You totally rocked in service but I didn&#39;t have cash on me to tip you...an the mouthbox that you order from doesn&#39;t give the option to tip when you pay by credit card.",

"reviewcomment":"This place is the best Indian/Himalayan restaurant in SoCal! I used to live in LA/OC and now SD, so I feel pretty strongly about that statement. <br><br>Ambience - simple, not too fancy, just right<br><br>Food - The food is the main story here! It&#39;s is delicious, all of it! First things first, they give everyone a bowl of daal to start which is delicious. Really a home made taste, just like my mom makes. Their main dishes are all good. This isn&#39;t like any other place, because they have unique flavors that are different from other Indian restaurant. That himalayan touch really makes a huge different. My favorite is the paneer tikka masala (note: I&#39;m vegetarian). It&#39;s creamy but balanced and appropriately spicy if you ask for it. And you have to get the garlic naan with it. But I also love the momos. They are really unique, light, and flavorful. Similar to dumplings. My husband loves the Chicken Makhani and the Goat when they have it. <br><br>Price - really reasonable. It makes for an affordable night out with big portions.",

"reviewcomment":"I had my wedding here last weekend and was so pleased with the venue and staff! I worked with catering &amp; sales manager, Amber, and she was absolutely fantastic in helping plan my wedding. Amber was very easy going, and answered any and all questions I had throughout the entire planning process. <br><br>I stayed at the Catamaran in one of the bay front suits a few days prior to the wedding and had a terrific view of the bay. Our room was right on the grass, so we were able to walk right out the patio and on the beach. As the Catamaran has it&#39;s own beach, were took advantage of the beach chairs and umbrellas out front, and brought out cocktails from the bar to relax. We also rented the motorized raft and enjoyed that out on the water for an hour. <br><br>The Catamaran is a perfect location that makes you feel like you&#39;re not in San Diego, with the Koi pond and waterfall when you walk in, and the birds just outside the doors heading to your room. It is also a great area to go for a run, and then walk across the street to either Mission or Pacific Beach- Pacific Beach Ale house has great happy hour! <br><br>There were also plenty of events going on the grass, whether it was Sunday brunch, weddings, or even graduation events; there is always something going on. The Catamaran staff definitely know how to set up and break down events. My mom was even able to get tables and chairs for my bridal shower the day before the wedding; all thanks to Amber! <br><br>We definitely plan to come back for our anniversary next year!",

I enjoyed all the food and wine I ordered, the short rib stack for the appetizer and cucumber salad were both good ones and for the Entrée I went with the Oreganata Chicken. You get two good sized pieces of chicken with it. My friend and I both liked it. My other friend went with the seafood dish with half the oceans sea creatures in it, for those seafood lovers out there. We definitely left satisfied and I also went home with the second piece of chicken for lunch the next day. Glad I finally got to try this place.<br><br>Let the food journey continue!

"reviewcomment":"This may be my favorite BBQ in town. Just found out about this place yesterday, and already went back today to try more items!<br><br>Cornbread: that sweet style of cornbread that I love so much. Incredibly delicious and a great counter for the end of the meal. <br><br>Sauce: not a sweet sauce! Thank god it isn&#39;t that disgusting Phil&#39;s style sauce that everyone in San Diego seems to love. I swear most places (Phil&#39;s, lightning jacks) just put sugar in ketchup and call it a day. My only qualm is a lack of heat in the sauce but that is a personal preference. I can always add my own heat if the flavor is right, and their flavor is right. <br><br>Meat: chopped up right in front of you, and delicious with or without sauce. I just reheated some brisket in the microwave and it was still incredibly delicious. <br><br>Tea: sweet. <br><br>Pulled pork sandwich: delicious and surprisingly filling. I am a pretty big guy and I eat quite a bit but one pulled pork sandwich was enough for me to feel very satiated. <br><br>Onion rings: I love this style of onion rings. It isn&#39;t the kind that rips your mouth up, they chomp real nice and easy and don&#39;t come all out on a single bite. Pro tip: put them on your pulled pork sandwich. <br><br>French fries: tasty but I like mine salty. Thankfully I can add as much salt as my heart can take! They are the thicker non wedge fries. Delicious. <br><br>My only negative part is the meat portions. I wish there was a bit more, but that is probably me being greedy. It is just so good I want to eat my own weight in it. <br><br>Overall a great little BBQ place that I would recommend to anyone in the area. <br><br>Nice people, great food. Thank you!",

"reviewcomment":"Preface: my review is solely based on my weekend brunch experience.<br><br>My family and I went to Searsucker for lunch after church on a Sunday, around 1:30pm. We were surprised to find they had no lunch menu, just brunch consisting mainly of eggs and breakfast items minus a couple random (random as in not typically found on lunch menus) lunch items. I had checked their brunch and lunch menus online prior to arriving at the restaurant, but the menu we were presented with differed significantly from what was listed online. To our dismay, the only sandwich they offered was the BLT, so we were forced to opt for other items. <br><br>My brother got some sort of pulled pork bowl with a sriracha-hollandaise sauce mixed with rice, my mother got the shrimp &amp; grits, and I got the Albacore tuna salad. My salad was great, the dressing was fresh and the tuna was seared just right. My mother&#39;s shrimps were juicy and delicate, but the sauce itself was a bit too thick/buttery for her liking. My brother enjoyed his bowl, but it was a bit dry as he had to ask for more Sriracha. <br><br>Overall, the food was a 7.5 out of 10. However, the reasoning for my 4/5 stars is their superior service. Our waiter was very polite and impressionable, as was the bus boy. I ordered a bottomless mimosa ($15), and when I asked for a heavier pour on the champagne, our waiter did not hesitate to bring over the bottle champagne for an additional pour. Additionally, my mother and I were looking to get an appetizer to share but there was nothing on the menu that we could munch on. Upon asking our waiter if he could kindly check with the kitchen, a few minutes later out he came with three different types of chips and salsa, on the house. Might I add, the green salsa was spectacular. <br><br>The food at Searsucker is quite overpriced for what it is worth, but the ambiance (we sat in the patio in the back adjacent to a Koi pond) and service was worth the money. It is unfortunate that the food choices are quite limited, and the chefs are not allowed to stray from the set menus according to the day.",

Kind of a bummer since I rely on it to flavor my pho as I always order the chicken one which isn&#39;t too flavorful on its own. The waitress also spoke really poor English, she misunderstood basic requests a couple times, but she was very nice so I actually just felt bad for confusing her. Overall I&#39;ll def go back.",

I used to live in LA/OC and now SD, so I feel pretty strongly about that statement. <br><br>Ambience - simple, not too fancy, just right<br><br>Food - The food is the main story here! It&#39;s is delicious, all of it! First things first, they give everyone a bowl of daal to start which is delicious. Really a home made taste, just like my mom makes. Their main dishes are all good. This isn&#39;t like any other place, because they have unique flavors that are different from other Indian restaurant. That himalayan touch really makes a huge different. My favorite is the paneer tikka masala (note: I&#39;m vegetarian). It&#39;s creamy but balanced and appropriately spicy if you ask for it. And you have to get the garlic naan with it. But I also love the momos. They are really unique, light, and flavorful. Similar to dumplings. My husband loves the Chicken Makhani and the Goat when they have it. <br><br>Price - really reasonable. It makes for an affordable night out with big portions.",

Portions are beyond satisfying at considerably low prices. <br>The best sandwiches range $5-$7.  Simpler ones around $4. Other options like $2.50 slice of pizza or $1.99 cup of soup. Breakfast burritos around $4. Cray cray chip selection. Actually, cray cray everything selection because you have the whole store to walk around while your order is being made and you pick up things like cookies, a Snickers, magazine, a long can of iced tea and the morning-after pill because of last night. Oops! TMI! Last week&#39;s order.. sorry<br><br>Sandwiches:<br>Are soooo good. They are GENEROUS here. Fricking Lumberjack status!!! Not just size, but every bite is consistent with the ingredients inside. Not, some tomato here, huge lettuce bite here.. NO. I have to give a shout-out to Fidel behind the counter. Brother, you are a sandwich artist. Forget Subway!<br><br>I will not suggest any particular sandwiches and let you have the fun picking. Add-ons such as sun-dried tomato, bacon, avocado, sprouts are all awesome. <br><br>For the bread heads, their French Rolls are baked daily, so soft yet hearty (like my biceps) and I feel they are the way to go. If not, you still have a variety to choose from. Don&#39;t expect fancy bread like the gourmet shops or bakeries like Bread&amp;Cie, Rubicon, Con Pane. (all bomMmb too)<br><br>On top of sandwiches, their Chicken Tortilla Soup, the Buffalo Chicken Pizza w/cilantro or their Sausage Mushroom Pizza and also Breakfast Burritos have all been delicious. No seating here, but having your meal at Balboa Park is better anyways. Parking and the wait during the lunch rush can suck sometimes but as with any place that serves bomMmb food, you deal with it because it&#39;s worth it.",

But what they do offer is a variety of healthy salad options, soul-warming soups, good ole Southern comfort foods like baked potatoes, humble focaccia bread, and simple soft serve dessert. <br><br>I actually haven&#39;t been to this particular Souplantation for a while, but they&#39;ve upgraded little things that seem to make dining, and I&#39;m assuming table bussing easier. Their plates and bowls are no longer stoneware - it&#39;s this lightweight, re-useable material that&#39;s biodegradable, and won&#39;t break if dropped. (Sorry, I had looked up the brand on the bottoms of these dishes, but now I don&#39;t remember the company&#39;s name). What&#39;s great is the fact that they hold smaller portion sizes, which makes it much harder for customers to waste food. <br><br>Like most places, their pre-dressed salads (Asian wonton and Caesar) are always a little heavier on the dressing side. But fear not - an entire salad bar remains ahead for me (and you) to add additional salads and ingredients.<br><br>Overall, average taste, fair prices, caters to all age groups, and you can still call it a relatively healthy meal.",

I&#39;ve been coming here on and off since 1998 and this last visit had me walking away pretty happy!<br><br>Of course I had their Swiss Mushroom Burger on wheat with sweet potato fries! I love how the bun is not engulfing the meat and it falls apart while you eat it. Their Ruby&#39;s sauce is to die for, which makes this burger special.<br><br>I shared a banana chocolate milkshake with my lovely wife, which was one of the best shakes I&#39;ve had in a long time.<br><br>Coupled by the fact that they just renovated the joint and their service was very attentive, Ruby&#39;s has lots to offer being right smack in the middle of the mall.<br><br>Don&#39;t hesitate next time, even if there is a line! I&#39;d also recommend their tuna melt!<br><br>Oh, I&#39;m glad they got rid of their old uniforms. YUCK!",

We ordered the seafood ceviche and a steak dish. I loved them both! They had really quality cuts of protein and the flavor combinations were delicious. <br><br>The seafood ceviche&#39;s tart, citrus dressing was amazing! <br>The steak dish with tomato (it&#39;s one of their specialties) came with rice and half ways through eating it I started to get a very nolstalgic feeling that I was eating an asian dish I loved from somewhere. .<br><br>Thank you for an amazing B Day Dinner -- it was the best one I had this year :)",

"reviewcomment":"Ashoka the Great catered our wedding. We asked for some relatively special requests like a specific salad that my mother likes to make as well as doing the entire event for 200 guests family style. <br><br>We originally were working with one gentleman for a good 6 months on planning and suddenly he dropped off as the one handling our wedding. However, the owners stepped in and told us not to worry -- that they would be running the event themselves and bringing in multiple tents with Tandoors to the Spanish Village in Balboa Park. <br><br>With the help of <a href='/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FPartyStaff.com&amp;s=6ec8d6284426003b26478dcb4f43b828f3234ccef77c2c6a5bf68c3db60848a8' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>PartyStaff.com</a>, these guys successfully catered some AMAZING appetizers (bhajis, samosas, mango lassi shooters). People were raving about this so much that guests were taking trays of Samosas to the photobooth. <br><br>Dinner was promptly served with our salad, which unfortunately was underdressed -- but I think making mass quantities of this specific dish was inevitable and not their forte so I won&#39;t hold it against them. The Tandoori chicken smelled fantastic and was very succulent. We were also served Saag Paneer, amazing Naan and Onion Kulcha and some Kerala style Biryani which was pretty good.  I was walking around with guests so I did not get to try the Rogan Josh but I heard it was pretty good! To top it off, these guys served Masala Chai and Coffee piping hot to the guests in the evening.<br><br>All in all, I would recommend Ashoka for any big parties and events you have where there is the need for some traditional Indian fare!",

"reviewcomment":"This place is the best Indian/Himalayan restaurant in SoCal! I used to live in LA/OC and now SD, so I feel pretty strongly about that statement. <br><br>Ambience - simple, not too fancy, just right<br><br>Food - The food is the main story here! It&#39;s is delicious, all of it! First things first, they give everyone a bowl of daal to start which is delicious. Really a home made taste, just like my mom makes. Their main dishes are all good. This isn&#39;t like any other place, because they have unique flavors that are different from other Indian restaurant. That himalayan touch really makes a huge different. My favorite is the paneer tikka masala (note: I&#39;m vegetarian). It&#39;s creamy but balanced and appropriately spicy if you ask for it. And you have to get the garlic naan with it. But I also love the momos. They are really unique, light, and flavorful. Similar to dumplings. My husband loves the Chicken Makhani and the Goat when they have it. <br><br>Price - really reasonable. It makes for an affordable night out with big portions.",

"reviewcomment":"This is a more commercialized sports bar. It&#39;s a cool place for groups and it&#39;s pretty big. They have a variety of food not just wings and fries but the food is just ok. They can get crazy busy on game days and one thing I don&#39;t like is that they won&#39;t tell you the wait time on game days which sucks but I guess it&#39;s to cover them. People don&#39;t usually leave after they eat on big game days. <br><br>We went for the first play off game of the heat and the spurs. Go heat! We first waited over an hour to be seated. Then when we were seated finally, we waited a hour and thirty minutes for food. By that time it&#39;s like there&#39;s no way you&#39;re leaving. The good part was we had a super fab waiter named Nick he made the wait a lot easier plus our food was free due to the wait so I guess bw3 really made up for their long wait on food. I&#39;m not sure what the major delay was, maybe they needed more cooks. At any rate, Nick was freaking awesome and I will sooo be looking for him every time I&#39;m there.",

"reviewcomment":"Probably my favorite Vietnamese place!  It&#39;s clean, the service is good, and the food is fresh and non-greasy.<br><br>Recommendations: Nem Nuong Cuon and Banh Xeo.<br><br>Nem Nuong Cuon is a spring roll with a pork paste sausage and a super delish crispy egg roll wrapper.  It&#39;s light and easy to eat and doesn&#39;t make you feel gross afterwards.  The sauce it comes with is also incredible.  I&#39;m not really sure what it&#39;s made with but man, it is good!<br><br>Their banh xeo is huge and also incredibly not oily!  A lot of times, you get these at other restaurants and it&#39;s kind of greasy.  This one is fresh and tasty.  They do a good job with the pancake.  The insides could use more meat/shrimp.<br><br>Everything else from vermicelli noodles to pho to the drinks are also very good.  Definitely a place to go!",

"reviewcomment":"Got to try the lamb lollipops for a snack and knew I want to come back ASAP to try more. The menu features ingredients that are flavorful and freshly made, with a kitchen you can see into as they prepare your food. It&#39;s a very small place located in a strip mall next to a liquor convenience store, so nothing special in ambience but the food is so tasty! <br>The lamb lollipops were perfectly cooked with a crispy char on the outside and juicy meat on the inside, amazing marinade and hoisin sauce on top, served with coconut jalapeño rice as a perfect side. Although it was listed as an appetizer it would make for a perfect meal. The other menu options that were recommended by the hostess for next time were the burgers, and the chicken Caesar salad! They serve beer and wine too, and the Belgian white ale(can&#39;t remember the exact name now) was the perfect drink to accompany the dish! <br>My friends that saw my snapchat of the lollipops were drooling and couldn&#39;t wait to try it themselves! I highly recommend this food. Afterwards take a 7 min stroll down to Windansea beach to watch the surfers and crashing waves on the rocks!!!!",

I used to live in LA/OC and now SD, so I feel pretty strongly about that statement. <br><br>Ambience - simple, not too fancy, just right<br><br>Food - The food is the main story here! It&#39;s is delicious, all of it! First things first, they give everyone a bowl of daal to start which is delicious. Really a home made taste, just like my mom makes. Their main dishes are all good. This isn&#39;t like any other place, because they have unique flavors that are different from other Indian restaurant. That himalayan touch really makes a huge different. My favorite is the paneer tikka masala (note: I&#39;m vegetarian). It&#39;s creamy but balanced and appropriately spicy if you ask for it. And you have to get the garlic naan with it. But I also love the momos. They are really unique, light, and flavorful. Similar to dumplings. My husband loves the Chicken Makhani and the Goat when they have it. <br><br>Price - really reasonable. It makes for an affordable night out with big portions.",

The open kitchen is beautiful and Its fun seeing the chefs at work. Our server was friendly and very knowledgeable with the menu. He answered any question I had and made great recommendations.<br><br>The food was presented beautifully and each course came our at an appropriate time. Ordered the biscuit to start with and it was light, warm, fluffy. Basically whatever you imagine a perfect biscuit to be, I felt it was that. My family and I ordered a little bit of everything in he menu. We had one pork dish, chicken dish, 2 pasta dishes. All beautifully cooked and all equally delicious. Everything that came out of the kitchen it was always that moment when you say &#34;omg that looks so good I should&#39;ve ordered that too&#34; <br><br>My family and I had a great time and it was fabulous dining experience. Well done Richard and thanks for stopping by our table to chat with us for a little!",

"reviewcomment":"I&#39;d been here a couple of times over the last couple of years, more as a meeting location than to dine, so when my hubby and I were in the mood for breakfast-for-dinner and didn&#39;t want to hit up our local mexican joint, we thought we&#39;d try SD Home Cooking. <br>We arrived around 5pm and the place was fairly quiet. We were the youngest in the place by about 30 years, which wasn&#39;t a bad thing at all!<br>We were so kindly greeted at the door and shown to a window booth immediately.<br>We perused the vast menu (really anything you could think of is on there from biscuits and gravy, to spaghetti, breakfast burritos, french toast, and more). <br><br>Unfortunately the reviews about the service are spot on. For being so slow and having at least 4-5 waitresses (we counted at once on the floor) the service was LAGGING! From the time it took to order our water, then order our food and have it in front of us, it was about 35-40min. The staff was really kind and still accommodating, but make sure you have a good hour+ to dine here.<br><br>The food portions are really large and while the food is bland, it&#39;s still good. <br><br>We were really hoping this could be a place we could bring our little guy - a casual, laid back atmosphere with decent food that&#39;s not too crowded. It meets all those qualifications, the amount of time it took to order and get our food would never work for kids! It&#39;s just too long.",

"reviewcomment":"EDIT: A couple of weeks after writing this review, I went in to pick up lunch for my coworkers. The manager, Kristen, came out to personally apologize to me for the experience I had at Jose&#39;s that caused me to write the review below. I was surprised that she knew who I was, but my coworkers and I have a very specific and unusual order. She explained that the new worker misunderstood the training. The personal apology from the manager was enough, but she proceeded to tell me that the order I was picking up would be on the house to make up for my previous poor experience there. I take everything back I said about their customer service; Kristen went above and beyond to prove that Jose&#39;s Court Room truly cares about their customers! I am on my way to pick up lunch for my coworkers and me again right now! :) <br><br>I&#39;m really not one of those complainy customers, I swear. I pick up lunch here maybe twice a week and order the same thing: 2 sides of refried beans that come with free chips and salsa... or so I thought. Today I ordered exactly the same thing I have been ordering for months, and Ryan behind the bar gives me my receipt, which included a $3 charge for the chips and salsa. I explained that this has never happened, said I dont want to pay for it, and he just said &#34;Sorry, but thats how much they cost.&#34; He made no attempt to help me out or find someone who could help me understand this apparent mix up. Didnt even offer to take back the food and give me a new receipt. I left very dissatisfied and he showed no sign of concern.<br><br>It just seemed too unlikely that every other server who has helped me with this exact same order for the past six months has made a mistake and not charged me. I later find out from a coworker that this guy Ryan is new behind the bar and had been messing up orders unapologetically when she went in hours later. <br><br>As a customer service employee, I expect others in the same position (especially in the affluent area of La Jolla) to hold themselves to high standards of service. Unfortunately, this place just doesnt cut it. I&#39;m really disappointed.<br><br>Their food is decent tasting but overpriced. The only reason I eat here is because I work across the street.",

"reviewcomment":"I love this place! <br>I&#39;ve been 5-6 times and the food is always amazing. <br>Normally I have a friend or two with me that hasn&#39;t tried Ethiopian so we&#39;ll split the vegetarian combo and the meat combo.<br>Grab a veggie or meat Samosa or two for an appetizer they&#39;re great and the sauce served with them is simply incredible. <br><br>I&#39;ve read a few of the reviews stating that the service was terrible, however, I have never received less than 5 star service. The servers are always prompt in seating us and always check up every few minutes to see if we need more water or injera. <br><br>The only bad thing I can say about Asmara is that every time I come here they are out of their Honey Wine so I haven&#39;t been able to try it yet. Other than that, 5 stars all around.",

"reviewcomment":"We moved here a year ago and Italian is our favorite food to dine out.<br><br>I will keep it simple: this is the best we have had in San Diego. It rivals Chicago&#39;s Rosebud Little Italy. Having said that, we have not been everywhere Italian in SD yet.<br><br>The service was outstanding. The ambiance was perfect for an intimate dinner. Great background music (a harpist was playing, but they also have a baby grand piano in the main dining room). The menu is not too large but not too small. <br><br>She had spaghetti and I had the Papa Sisto. Both excellent. The Papa sisto is a sausage and fettuccine dish and most places you will just get that cut up bratwurst type sausage. Not here. This was HOME MADE goodness.<br><br>Of course it is pricier, but for a date night, or a nice dinner out with friends...Check out Salvatore&#39;s.<br><br>We will be back.",
