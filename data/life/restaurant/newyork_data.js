"reviewcomment":"The sandwiches! The donuts! The coffee with soy or almond milk! I wish Cinnamon Snail and my work locations could coincide more often. I love trying their specials but all of the mainstays are also great. The Thanksgiving sandoo made me weak in the knees.<br><br>Weirdly, I still haven&#39;t tried their bourbon creme brulee donut. I usually get too excited for the maple coconut or apple cider. I usually steer toward the super-moist cake doughnuts, as I did have a slightly lackluster strawberry-frosted yeast donut here once.<br><br>Foursquare users, take note that their loyalty special is amazing. On your 4th checkin, you get half off your whole meal. Everything. All of it. Half off. I nabbed $14 worth of sandwich, drink, and doughnut for $7. It&#39;ll happen again on my 8th, so I&#39;m hoping to track them down more often in the warmer months.",

"reviewcomment":"My Holy Grail.  Truly a 3-star Michelin Experience.<br><br>Through the help of my boyfriend&#39;s friend who works at Per Se, we were fortunate enough to have reservations for lunch this past Sunday and boy was it a memorable experience!  We were seated without a doubt at the best table in the dining room, right next to the main window overlooking Columbus Circle and Central Park.  The view was breathtaking!<br><br>We were promptly offered some delicious French Champagne and then greeted by our server (who btw was dressed in a very nice suit) and told that we had a choice between three different tastings: a 5 course, a 7 course and a 10 course Chef&#39;s tasting.  Since there really isn&#39;t too many opportunities for either of us to dine at Per Se since we both don&#39;t live in NYC, we decided the 10 course was the only way to go.  Our meal totaled to 13 Courses not including the amuse bouche, thanks to a few courses complimented by the kitchen :)  Our meal went as follows:<br><br>1. Savory Profiteroles: Yummy melted gruyere cheese puff.  light and savory<br><br>2. Smoked Salmon Cone: A Thomas Keller Classic.  Smoked Salmon with creme fraiche inside a light savory cone.  I do not enjoy eating raw fish or smoked fish, but this was delightful.  The salmon and the creme fraiche worked very well together and the crispy wafer-like sesame? cone was delicious.<br><br>3.  Forest Mushroom Soup: I loooooveee mushrooms, and this soup was like pure mushroom and cream puree.  It was so so good.  And the serving size was like a full sized portion of soup.  <br><br>4.  &#34;Oysters and Pearls&#34;:  The signature.  I was really tempted to opt out of oyster items and caviar items when we were asked to mention any food-items we did not care for in the reservation, but I&#39;m so glad I took a risk. The presentation was beautiful, with two oysters sitting atop of tapioca and this wonderfully creamy looking sauce, right next to the oysters was a canelle of sterling white sturgeon caviar.  All of the food items I do not wish to eat on a plate.  Mind blown.  This dish was amazing.  The oysters were almost sweet and combined with the tapioca, cream sauce and caviar, the flavor was just phenomenal.  Can not recommend this dish enough.<br><br>5.  White Truffle Infused Custard: This was served inside a cracked egg shell.  Decadent with more black truffle sauce topping the white truffle egg custard.  I could eat a whole flat&#39;s worth of these custard eggs. (There are 36 eggs in a flat).<br><br>6.  Cauliflower Salad: After several extremely rich and creamy courses, this was a welcoming palate cleanser.  Fresh, with notes of citrus and aged balsamic vinegar.<br><br>Bread intermission: Sourdough, multi-grain and Baguette.  Served with two types of butter.  One butter from Vermont (unsalted) and the other salted from California.<br><br>7. Atlantic Monk fish: This I was told, was a full filet of Monk fish served on top of lentils and pearl onions.  I&#39;ve never had monk fish before and I can tell you it was an interesting experience.  The texture is extremely firm for a fish, and the flavor is mild like a white fish.  It wasn&#39;t my favorite, but tasty for something I&#39;ve never had before.<br><br>8. Brussels Sprout Encrusted Main Sea Scallops: These were just melt in your mouth.  Definitely the best scallop preparation I&#39;ve ever had.  These were served with applewood bacon, brussels sprouts over a brown butter sauce.  <br><br>9. Cuisse De Poularde: This was a slice of I believe chicken thigh stuffed with mousse and served atop a curry sauce and dates.  A very middle-eastern/ India inspired dish.  The flavors were unlike any of the previous dishes we had tasted and provided a nice contrast from the courses before.<br><br>10.  Elysian Field&#39;s Lamb: Okay.  This is where I am a little confused as I had specifically requested no lamb, yet I was served lamb.. Oops? Haha.  I do not like the gaminess of lamb, but the lamb served at Per Se was probably the least gamey with very little gamey taste at all.  Honestly if it didn&#39;t look like a rack of lamb, I wouldn&#39;t have even known.  The meat was very tender and well executed with artichokes and ricotta gnocchi.<br><br>11.  Cheese Course: The cheese was raw sheep cheese served with a homemade sour cherry newton and roasted nuts.  Delicious.<br><br>12. Tropical Fruit Cup: Pineapple cubes, Passionfruit puree and White tea foam.  The white tea was bitter but worked moderately well with the tropical fruits.  I think this dish would have been better had the fruits been even sweeter and less sour.<br><br>13. Okinawan Brown Sugar Ice Cream: Delicious (got to cut this review short running out of review space lol)<br><br>14. Maralumi Chocolate: Like a home made Aero Bar, with genoise cake and marshmallow topping<br><br>15. Assorted Chocolates, Nougats and Macarons. <br><br>Toured the kitchen and found out it was the 10th Anniversary of Per Se.  Left full, happy, and with a goody bag filled with chocolates, cookies and a French Laundry Cookbook signed by Thomas Keller(courtesy of the bf).  I&#39;m so spoiled.",

Surprise is the big element here.  I don&#39;t want to ruin your experience so I won&#39;t tell you about the food. Don&#39;t read lots of reviews because surprise is half of the fun.

"reviewcomment":"It&#39;s like dinner theatre.  There&#39;s an open kitchen with 18 people sitting around it.  After eating here, I wondered why couldn&#39;t all restaurants do this?  It felt so natural.  The atmosphere wasn&#39;t stuffy at all (as I would have expected from a 3-Michelin star place).  Part of this was probably due to the background music, which consisted mostly of the Doors that night, making the ambiance casual.  Also, despite the close proximity of diners to each other, people weren&#39;t afraid to converse during the dinner.  <br>The service was so fantastic.  It was a perfectly choreographed show involving all of the servers. Someone went around collecting the utensils after each course, the hostess in the middle collected the dishes.  The chefs plated each course in a line.  It was so fascinating to watch the efficiency of it all.<br><br>The food, of course, was amazing and beautiful.  The starting courses were my favorite of the night.  There was this uni dish that was probably my favorite.  (I don&#39;t even like uni normally!!)  A good number of the dishes had freshly shaved truffle on them.  One of the desserts was a truffle-flavored ice cream with truffle shaving!!  Chef Ramirez started with a huge truffle at the beginning of the night, and by the end it was shaved down to almost nothing.  Oh man, every time he went at it with the truffle, I felt like a star-struck teen at a Bieber concert.  <br><br>My partner and I shared the wine pairing (since neither of us are big drinkers).  I&#39;m not sure if it added much to the meal, except for the sheep&#39;s milk cheese which was paired *amazingly* with a sweet wine.<br><br>Overall a FANTASTIC experience.",

"reviewcomment":"I always see Wafels and Dinges parked in Cooper Square and have been a few times now. IT is pretty tough to resist the urge to stop when you can small the freshly made waffels fro ma block down the street, sometimes accompanied by the smell of delicious bacon.<br><br>The first time I went I had the bacon maple wafel and it was out of this world. Just as you would expect, bacon makes everything better, including the classic waffel and syrup combo. The salty sweet combo is perfect, and they don&#39;t overdo either one.<br><br>The next time I went I was looking for something purely sweet, and also somewhat refreshing. I ended up on the wafel ice cream sandwich, with dulce de leche on top. It was amazeballs! Two piping hot, hand-sized wafels placed around a ginormous serving of home-made (truck-made?) ice cream, with a generous helping of dulce de leche on top. It was too big to eat as a classic sandwich so I had to attack it middle-school stle and lick the ice-cream from the sides until I could squeeze it enough for a full bite. Very rich, very decadent, but refreshing from the cold ice cream, I loved it, even in winter.<br><br>I will try to resist the urge to stop here on a daily basis for more deliciousness, but will probably  fail :/",

"reviewcomment":"What I learned as I slurped down bivalves at Upstate: <br>Every oyster I have had in my life prior to this moment has been absolute shit.<br><br>The famed happy hour: $12 for 1 draft + 6 oysters of your choice (only from the bolded options on the list). Drafts are otherwise $6 and comprise an interesting variety of craft beers, most of which are oyster-compatible (in my view, light-colored and very hoppy). <br><br>The oysters are completely delightful. You mark your choices right on the list, which I LOVE, and you get the paper back with your chosen oysters arranged in order, clockwise, from the lemon wedges. I&#39;m a bad listener when food is in front of me, so this is extremely thoughtful in terms of reminding people of what they&#39;re eating. <br><br>Karry L refused to add anything to his oysters, but the mignonette was fucking delicious.<br><br>The bartender was super friendly and attentive, and answered all my dumb questions about these lovely bottomfeeders. They had some Vancouver (Royal Miyagi) oysters when we visited, and he encouraged us to take advantage since West Coast oysters don&#39;t often make their way onto the happy hour list.<br><br>Before 6:30pm the intimate space is still tolerably empty, but don&#39;t dawdle. I&#39;ve been here once before and was told they weren&#39;t taking any more people that night (granted, it was Valentine&#39;s Day). I&#39;m not even going to do the Yelp cliche of &#34;this awesome place is terrible, don&#39;t try it so it stays unknown enough for me to continue going&#34; - Go, we&#39;re all friends, you&#39;ll adore it, this little spot is something special.",

Someone went around collecting the utensils after each course, the hostess in the middle collected the dishes.  The chefs plated each course in a line.  It was so fascinating to watch the efficiency of it all.<br><br>The food, of course, was amazing and beautiful.  The starting courses were my favorite of the night.  There was this uni dish that was probably my favorite.  (I don&#39;t even like uni normally!!)  A good number of the dishes had freshly shaved truffle on them.  One of the desserts was a truffle-flavored ice cream with truffle shaving!!  Chef Ramirez started with a huge truffle at the beginning of the night, and by the end it was shaved down to almost nothing.  Oh man, every time he went at it with the truffle, I felt like a star-struck teen at a Bieber concert.  <br><br>My partner and I shared the wine pairing (since neither of us are big drinkers).  I&#39;m not sure if it added much to the meal, except for the sheep&#39;s milk cheese which was paired *amazingly* with a sweet wine.<br><br>Overall a FANTASTIC experience.",

"reviewcomment":"Cozy little place right down the street from the Stomp theater. Food was excellent and the service was right on! Our &#34;true Italian&#34; waitress was friendly and ever so helpful. We ordered the Caprese and the Rucola salads both were very tasty and fresh, even the tomatoes for winter time! For dinner we had the Margherita and Arrabbita pizza which were delish for a pizza. Cooked to perfection in a wood burning stove. And for dessert our waitress suggested the Nutella pizza, well we finished every bite! But I did suggest to the owner that it needs a scoop of vanilla ice cream with it...he said the next time we come in!!! Prices we reasonable. <br><br>My only complaint was the cold air that come in every time the door opened! They need to extend the entry with two doors to stop the draft. Otherwise I highly recommend and will be going back!",

"reviewcomment":"The gem of all gems in the East Village. Russo&#39;s is not a restaurant, but an Italian market specializing in two things: homemade pasta and cheese. WIN.<br><br>Walking into Russo&#39;s felt like I was back in Italy. Established in 1894, Russo&#39;s is the real deal and the closest to authentic Italian you are gonna get in NY. It&#39;s a tiny place right next to Venieros on 1st and 11th, with a few large refrigerators housing lots of cheese, and fresh pasta. They have an entire fridge devoted to fresh ravioli with fillings including sausage, goat cheese, spinach, mushroom, butternut squash, lobster and pumpkin. They have a large variety of different pastas, gnocchi, and even whole wheat options. <br><br>Russo&#39;s also has imported olive oils, marinated olives, as well as pepperoni, sausage and anchovies behind the counter. And just like authentic markets in Italy, they have a small menu of sandwiches. The Italiano or Caprese are a crowd favorite.<br><br>For my first Russo&#39;s trip, I bought fresh pasta (only used half of it tonight), a 1/4 pound of ricotta, and 1/4 pound of their house blend of grated cheese made with parmesan, asiago and pecorino. All for $9. I made an arugula-basil pesto for dinner with their pasta, and topped it with pine nuts, fresh arugula and dollops of their ricotta cheese, which was so fresh, flavorful and outrageously delicious. Ricotta takes any pasta dish to the next level.<br><br>Next trip I&#39;m trying their ravioli and bufala mozzarella. While I usually go to Eataly for fresh pasta and cheeses, Russo&#39;s is my new go-to. It is even more authentic, feels Italy, and is half the price.",

"reviewcomment":"This place is an amazing gem hidden on the side streets of Williamsburg. <br><br>When you walk in there are cases of so many different raviolis and fresh cut pasta.  The day I went , my boyfriend and I really wanted some spaghetti and didn&#39;t see it in the cases.  All we did was ask and the man went in the back and cut fresh sheets of pasta into spaghetti for us.   Yesterday when I went and it was pretty empty in there, I asked the owner if it would be ok if i came in the back and watched her cut the pasta and she let me and talked to me about the shop.  A wonderful experience!<br><br>But most importantly, the pasta is AWESOME! I made it with a home made marinara the other day and let the pasta finish cooking in a little but of sauce and it really soaked up the sauce. It cooked to a beautiful consistency and you can really tell the difference between fresh pasta and the kind in the box.  <br><br>I love this place!",

I come here regularly for their coffee beans (not always the freshest though...), cheese, cured meats and random goodies. The spices they sell are of good quality and Parrot Coffee&#39;s prices are competitive. If you think the paprika powder you got at a regular supermarket works just fine, that is because you haven&#39;t tried the Hungarian ones they sell here.<br><br>The staff here are always very pleasant and never give me weird looks for lurking around, reading the labels off every ethnic goods they have on the shelves. Or peeking into other people&#39;s purchases, because that&#39;s what any normal person would do when he/she is in a store that sells products not of his/her ethnicity, right?<br><br>They are open until 10pm and accepts credit cards, with a minimum of $5.",

We also liked the BYOB and affordable corking fee of $20. <br><br>Upon arrival, the restaurant was quiet on a Wednesday evening around 8:30PM. The place is quite modest, but very intimate and warm. We scanned the menu and the first think of note was the Fillet Mignon topped with truffle and foie gras - just delicious. For appetizers, we ordered the baked brie and the white wine garlic mussels. <br><br>Overall, I think the chocolate dessert was the best - I don&#39;t recall the exact name, but it was one of the best I have ever had in my life!",

"reviewcomment":"This is review is for the lunch tasting menu<br><br>I had high expectations coming in and Bouley&#39;s luncheon tasting menu absolutely blew my mind. Yes, it did end up being $100 for lunch (including wine) but I wouldn&#39;t think twice before forking over another $100 to come back. Make sure you have a good 3 hrs to spend though!<br><br>Bouley is the perfect blend of sophistication, simplicity and beautiful flavors. If you&#39;re a fan a truffle, you&#39;re in for a treat since pretty much every dish is elevated with truffle. <br><br>Big Eye Tuna - prepared as a tuna tartare on foam. The tuna was fresh but I was more impressed by the foam. It had a beautiful texture and actually added to the dish instead of most places that just put foam on to make stuff seem more fancy-pants. <br><br>Forager&#39;s Treasure of Wild Mushroom VS. Porcini Flan - I had a hard time debating between these two options so I shared with a friend. These two are both amazing dishes and I still can&#39;t decide which one I like better. It just depends on your mood. The Flan is more rich with decadent flavors. The mushrooms had a wonderful earthy taste that you don&#39;t get in most mushrooms. They tasted like they were plucked fresh from a magical forest...both amazing dishes<br><br>Slow Braised Kobe Style Beef Cheeks - the beef just melts so no knife required. It also comes with a nice small side of mashed potatoes that was nice to dip the beef in<br><br>Dessert - I actually had to run to a meeting so I missed dessert <br><br>Wine - the Cote du Rhone was really reasonably priced, went well with the tasting menu, and most importantly, delicious--low tannins, nice acidity, great soft finish. <br><br>And they also have a super fun bread cart that they push around with about 20 different types of bread. I&#39;ve never seen such a crazy selection. <br><br>Overall, great, great value for lunch!",

I felt like I was transported out of NYC and placed in an austrian bar. <br><br>The service was on point the entire time we were there. From the waitress to the supposed owner who came to greet us and made sure everything is good. Everyone in our group felt a warmth that many restaurants don&#39;t really possess anymore.<br><br>The food was very good. We had the sausage sampler with dumplings and sauerkraut, and it was more then enough food for everyone. The pretzel was good too, but the portion size for that was a little lacking. Our dessert consisted of chocolate cake and apple strudel. I personally liked the apple strudel more but some of my friends felt otherwise.<br><br>I definitely will be returning to the spot as it left me feeling at home and something a lot of new york restaurants have long forgotten to do.",

"reviewcomment":"Hands down, one of the best restaurants I&#39;ve been to in a while.  Gotham Bar and Grill definitely lives up to its hype, even during Restaurant Week.  TIP: Book early - this place&#39;s slots for RW fill up really quickly.<br><br>Atmosphere - business casual/casual, at least for RW.  Love the decor and natural lighting.  Open, high ceilings - doesn&#39;t make you feel claustrophobic at all.<br><br>Service - This was okay.  Maybe it was because it was RW and all, but our waiter didn&#39;t seem all that friendly and seemed to have to force/fake his smile.  Our food did always come out at the same time and they always had multiple people come out and serve our food, so they all landed on the table at the same time - good stuff!<br><br>FOOD - $25 prix fixe lunch - Winter 2014 -<br><br>1. Wild Striped Bass Sashimi - asian pear, watermelon radish, cucumber, yuzu ginger emulsion avocado wasabi purée - ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS.  The best appetizer I&#39;ve had out of all the restaurants I&#39;ve been for RW and this dish definitely made everything worth it.  All the flavors and textures came together for a delicious combination.  The sauce on the sashimi made it almost ceviche-like.<br><br>2. Pappardelle With Braised Short Rib Ragu - swiss chard, winter squash, aged pecorino - The short rib was tender and the fresh pappardelle (long, fat pasta) was served al dente and to perfection.  The dish was seasoned very well.<br><br>3. Gotham Chocolate Cake - served warm with salted almond ice cream - I&#39;m not really a huge fan of chocolate desserts, but since this was THE chocolate cake, I had to get it.  I just now learned that it was flour less, which would explain the almost mousse-like texture it had.  My favorite part was actually the salted almond ice cream with almond chunks in it - I could probably eat a whole pint of this.<br><br>I would definitely come back and dish out the cash for their actual lunch and dinner menu.",

With some freaking amazing quality sandwiches. Good bread, great meats, and quickly made.<br>There&#39;s a somewhat daunting list of options when you first walk in....but seriously, every sandwich is pretty awesome. The Tuna with Prosciutto is great, so is the Egg Ham, Cheese and Tomato on Ciabatta. And don&#39;t forget to pick up one of their Prosciutto Bread loafs.<br><br>Seriously, this place is a breath of fresh air, with some amazing food and a fun atmosphere, go grab a sandwich. Important fact though: There&#39;s no seating here, so head to the park to chow down!",

"reviewcomment":"Small, intimate place, great service, even better food. This place is BYOB so make sure you have that bottle of wine ready to go! <br><br>The way that this place works (at least on a Friday night) is that you get a selection of a 3 course meal, 4 course meal, or 5 course meal with each item the size a little bigger than an appetizer but smaller than a full meal. The final course is always dessert. <br><br>So my lady and I went out to Cafe Matisse with a bottle of wine - we decided to celebrate me my successful move to the great state of New Jersey! The place was intimately lit, and the person that greeted us (Larry) was able to take our bottle while we hang up our coats. Very nice and personable host. I made reservations ahead of time and the wait before getting to our table was about 5 minutes. Contrary to yelpers&#39; belief, this place is definitely still a hidden gem, as there was no line and you could tell that the diners were either locals or the moderately well-off. <br><br>Anyway, so we got our sparkling water, they poured us the wine and we ordered the food. My love got herself the lobster bisque and it was amazing - it was in a white bean sauce but you could barely tell that there were beans in it. It was definitely larger than your average soup appetizer portion. I can&#39;t say I remember what I got for my meal, so we&#39;ll just move on! The 2nd course was stuffed (and cooked) oysters - she fell in love with those. She swore that when we return that 2 of her courses are just going to be those oysters. LOL Her third course was the swordfish and it was exquisite. Very soft, flakey, delicious. And for dessert, she ate the peanut butter cheesecake brownie. That was a rich brownie. <br><br>Other items to note - between each meal the service wiped our table clean, gave us brand new utensils, poured more wine and water for us. I believe there is outside seating but since it was too cold and the winter was just hell, that was closed off. I&#39;m sure it will open back up this Spring. Every meal was artistically displayed - I&#39;m saying if you were to paint a picture on a canvas looking like each course, the paintings would be worth thousands. <br><br>So my advice for the couple or family looking to dine out - pick this place if you&#39;re looking to spend a pretty penny and looking to receive top notch quality food and service. We will be back for sure to try more selections!",

We ordered two pies as we were advised that is a good amount for a party of two. It was just the right amount. We were satisfied and not super stuffed. We had the:<br>- Cherry Jones: An amazing blend of sweet and salty at the same time. Makes your mouth explode. If you are not a huge cherry fan, don&#39;t worry, you won&#39;t even realize they are cherries. The prosciutto and mozarella cheese had a great contrast and complement to the bing cherries. A MUST HAVE!!!<br>- Hellboy: One of their staples! You can&#39;t not come here and not have this pie either. Fair warning, it&#39;s got quite the spicy kick to it. HONEY ON TOP? Who would have thought? It provides a surprising and delicious complement to the spiciness of this pie. The spicy isn&#39;t overwhelming but it does linger on. The sopresatta is delicious and you will not be disappointed with this pie. <br><br>SERVICE: <br>Very attentive and sort of Brooklyn trendy as well. Can be a bit rushed at times to bring dishes but don&#39;t take it the wrong way, they are just busy sometimes. We came at 5:15 PM and it wasn&#39;t too busy. If we had got there at 6 PM there would have been a 30 min wait. Paulie Gee walks around and greets you and gets your feedback so it&#39;s nice to see the owner care for his business like that. He did promise me a drink that he never followed up on, so that was a little disheartening, but all good. No harm, no foul. <br><br>ATMOSPHERE:<br>Has a industrial, wine cellar vibe. I love seeing the oven in the far back and all the furniture and fixtures similar but nothing is exactly the same. The place has a very dim lighting and can seat small or large parties. They have a bar seating area as you come in and a decent amount of space for people who are waiting. I would recommend coming at 5-6PM as the wait can get long when the weather gets warm.<br><br>SUMMARY:<br>GREAT place for some of Brooklyn&#39;s finest pizza. I would definitely come back and bring friends to try. I would suggest two of the finest signature dishes in the Hellboy and the Cherry Jones. If you are near Greenpoint, this is a must have!",

"reviewcomment":"I&#39;m preaching to the choir here, but these sponge cakes really are some of the fluffiest, moistest sponge cakes I&#39;ve had in Chinatown. <br><br>I checked out New Kam Hing since I had 20 minutes to kill before returning to jury duty. The shop is a little hole-in-the-wall north of Canal street. When I walked in, I was surprised to see the lack of sponge cakes in the front display. Where were all the delicious cakes people kept raving about?? <br><br>Then I looked up and towards the back. HELLO plastic storage boxes stacked upon storage boxes of freshly made sponge cake! I tried one of each flavor - original, green tea, and chocolate. The cakes were lightly sweetened and you got the essence of green tea without too much bitterness. The chocolate cake had tiny bits of chocolate chip baked in - yum.<br><br>I also ordered their Vietnamese Iced Coffee for $2.50 since I figured a little caffeine kick to get through the afternoon wasn&#39;t such a bad idea. The girl behind the counter warned me that the drink would be super strong, but the strong coffee was nicely balanced out by the gallons (I exaggerate, but you get the point) of condensed milk mixed into the coffee. Did it wake me up? Sadly caffeine never has that extreme of an effect on me, but I did have a nice drink to sip on as I walked back to the courthouse.",

"reviewcomment":"So finally after many years of saying I would, I finally made my way over to Ba Xuyen. It&#39;s a little out of the way to get there as it&#39;s not really close to anything or anywhere that I go to. But oh man was it ever worth the trip. Hands down the best banh mi I have had so far.<br><br>I didn&#39;t want to make the trip alone so I convinced my coworker to come with me for lunch today. I ordered the #1: Banh Mi Pate Thit Nguoi (the regular pork banh mi at most places) while my coworker had the #9: Banh Mi Ga Nuong (grilled chicken). My sandwich came stuffed to the brim with huge amounts of delicious meat and pickled vegetables. Ordering it spicy came with just the perfect amount of jalapenos and sriracha so that it wasn&#39;t overpowering at all. The bread was so good too. Just the perfect amount of crustiness on the outside and a soft chewy center. Yum!<br><br>I didn&#39;t try the grilled chicken but my coworker kept making sounds of pleasure and claiming it was the best he&#39;s ever had. Now to complete the picture, imaging that he was sticking copious amounts of meat in his mouth. Oh baby!<br><br>The space is fairly large and has a good amounts of seats to eat in. There&#39;s also a bunch of other foods that they make as well so those are worth giving a shot. The ladies are very nice and they seem to be fluent in Chinese, Vietnamese, and English. It is a CASH ONLY spot and no banks in the relative vicinity so make sure you&#39;ve got money.",

"reviewcomment":"***I wanted to preface this with saying that the location is directly down the street from the 33rd St 7 Train stop. Literally on the first block, on the right hand side, after you cross the West bound side of Queens Boulevard. ***<br><br>Sweet &amp; Sara has long been one of my favorite vegan indulgences. I ordered a bunch of goodies online for my boyfriend for Halloween (hello, Halloween-themed bats and ghosts!) and went to pick them up. I set my appointment for Wednesday on Monday morning but had an opening in my schedule to pick them up earlier, which they happily arranged for. That was really sweet of them.<br><br>Then I got there, and everyone was so nice! I&#39;ve come to the factory before and met Sara and didn&#39;t expect anything but sweetness. It&#39;s a family affair here, folks. Makes me want to start a family business. They were so pleasant and funny. Added bonus: Everything there smells like marshmallows.<br><br>As if it isn&#39;t clear, I love the product, admire the people, and love it when I have time to pick them up at the factory instead of grabbing some from Duane Reade*. <br><br>*Who else is super excited they can get these delicious bits of heaven at the city&#39;s most common drug store? Between the number of Starbucks and Duane Reades per block, I can now pick up marshmallows for the hot cocoa I get down the street at Starbucks. :)",

"reviewcomment":"I had been dreaming about trying this falafel so I couldn&#39;t wait for lunch time to come around.  To my chagrin I had to wait in a 25 person line.  But it moved pretty quickly and within about 15 min I was placing my order.  <br><br>Here&#39;s the lowdown:<br>-Falafel Sandwich (green falafel + hummus + Israeli salad + green cabbage + tahini sauce + everything (S&#39;rug traditional Yemeni hot sauce with cilantro, chili, garlic and olive oil, amba picked mango chutney &amp; pickles Israeli style): maybe I was just hungry out of my mind but this falafel was one of the best I have ever had.  The whole wheat pita was so soft and yummy and held the falafel sandwich together very well AND never got soggy.  The falafel was so fresh and was the right type of spicy.  The sauces are at the very top and as you keep going through the falafel sandwich you leave most of the sauces and head into the hummus portion which is not as creamy as most--which I loved.  It mixed so well and didn&#39;t overpower anything.  The sandwich was also extremely filling.  <br><br>-Date-Lime-Banana Smoothie (3 Dates, 1 Banana,  1/2 cup soy milk and 1 freshly squeezed lime): Just like everyone said, it tasted just like a banana smoothie.  But in my experience with smoothies that have bananas in them, they all taste like that.  I did like the chunks of dates that would come up through my straw from time to time but it wasn&#39;t something I&#39;d ever order again.<br><br>FINAL VERDICT: I&#39;ll be looking out for this truck more often as the wait is worth it :)",

From the food and service to the little details.<br><br>Upon our arrival we were escorted to the bar, where we tried their well blended and delicious cocktails. Our table was ready and when we were seated at our corner booth, with a view of the entire establishment, my cocktail from the bar was already there. They gave us the best table in the place and that was a very pleasant gesture. <br><br>We chose the Le Bernardin Tasting Menu with Wine Pairing. The food was orally orgasmic and the wine enhanced the flavors of every element in the dish. When remembering the night I can still taste some of the foods I have tried.<br><br>The service was impeccable! As one waiter took away dishes and utensils, the next waiter was ready with out next set. We were very pleased with how pleasant our team of waiters made our experience.<br><br>There is a reason Le Bernardin is and has been the #1 Zagat rated restaurant in NYC. The 3 Michelin star rating explains that although not cheap, this is a must have culinary experience.",

"reviewcomment":"I don&#39;t know anything about soba. So...I&#39;ll just give it 5 stars because I&#39;m nice like that! Plus it was pretty darn good.   <br><br>This place is tiny but very zen like I would say. Got here just before they locked the door to close up for the 6pm dinner rush. Staff was very friendly and gave great recommendations. I had the Stamina dip soba and was clueless on how to eat it. The waitress was really nice on showing me the noodles, dip, eat process. Sorry...I&#39;m  a noobie. I was going to eat the noodles first then sip on the soup haha. She even told me how to eat after I finished the noodles by pouring a separate broth into the soup stirring then drink. Pretty awesome. I learned something while I ate. (I&#39;m not &#34;special&#34; btw). <br><br>Anyway, I would definitely come back on a cold day to get warmed up by some really delicious soba.",

"reviewcomment":"Sushi Azabu has been on my &#34;to eat&#34; list for maybe one and a half years. I finally was able to pencil in some time, make the trek and come out to Tribeca for a nice Valentine&#39;s dinner with my honey pie. Best sushi I&#39;ve had since Sushi Yasuda which was a year ago.<br><br>ATMOSPHERE:<br>It&#39;s a little confusing as Azabu is combined with Greenwich Grill in terms of the ground floor being Greenwich grill and the basement being Sushi Azabu. They are both obviously owned by the same owner but if one did not know that, it could be hard to find as you go through Greenwich to get to Sushi Azabu. Sushi Azabu has wood veneer, very small space which makes for intimacy, however you can get sort of cozy with your neighbor. It is definitely for a party of 2 and I would not recommend coming with any larger. Date place for sure. We did not get to sit at the bar but that is the route I would recommend if you can get that seat. <br><br>SERVICE:<br>Very cordial and nice. You can&#39;t go wrong if you have a small space to service. <br><br>FOOD:<br>We were here for the Valentine&#39;s prefix but the Omakase is very good I hear. I&#39;d imagine the Valentine&#39;s is very similar to that. The sushi was so tender and literally melted in your mouth. Wow. Some of our favorites included the Uni appetizer and their black sesame dessert which was to die for. As for sushi/sashimi, I would recommend the shrimp, uni, fatty tuna and bbq eel. They were the most delicious, flavorful and I could not stop salivating to eat them as we saved them for last. The black sesame dessert was VERY good as well and I inhaled it like no tomorrow. <br><br>SUMMARY:<br>Want a nice date night in Tribeca and craving sushi? Then look no further. Perfect place to go and don&#39;t forget to get the shrimp/uni/fatty tuna and the black sesame dessert. Greenwich Grill up top looks like a great alternative if you can&#39;t get reservations and don&#39;t mind Japanese fusion. I&#39;m sure it&#39;s just as mind blowing.",

"reviewcomment":"Kyo Ya is Japanese fine dining at its very best. With its location blending into the heart of the East Village, the feel of exclusivity and self-importance upon arrival will permeate the senses. The (almost entirely) wooden interior offers a feeling of tranquility and simply clears out any type of sensory overload that you might come in with in the first place.  What is left is simply the delightful service, amazing food, and the person(s) you are here to enjoy a meal with. Do yourself a favor, and just silence that cellphone for a meal that you would want to appreciate.<br><br>While I have only been able to dine here à la carte, the experience is no less grand. It is a sophisticated menu which Japanese food aficionados salivate for.  Whether it is flavor, texture, or presentation, you can just taste the efforts that go into each plate. Personal favorites include Ebi Shinjo, Chawanmushi, Kani Goma Tofu Gratin, and the Seasonal Kamadaki Rice which takes 45 minutes to prepare. And those are only cooked dishes. The  Kaiseki menu is the crown jewel experience that ranks as a can&#39;t miss and needs to be booked one day in advance.<br><br>Kyo Ya is an experience that is truth worth your time, attention, and every penny spent.",

Part of the allure definitely lies in the level of secrecy that comes with Bohemian. Then once you get past the private reservation line, the experience will most likely live up to expectations. The ambiance and exclusivity is fantastic, and the small space only enhances that vibe. The menu is truly special.<br><br>The tasting menu is ideal for first-time goers to get a sense of what they like and what they will want each time they visit subsequently.  Personal highlights are the pan-roasted branzino, uni croquette, mac-n-cheese, and foie gras soba.  You can&#39;t really go wrong with anything on the menu, and fans of washu beef will leave Bohemian very happy.<br><br>Bohemian is an experience very similar to that of Sakagura, maybe just a bit more intimate.

The guy is very polite &amp; friendly! He will make the food anyway you like so don&#39;t hesitate to ask him if you don&#39;t want this, that or if you to add this or that. If you don&#39;t want to wait, you can order by phone, &amp; just come to pick up the food. Oh &amp; the hot sauce here is HOT HOT HOT! SPICY! <br><br>-The Bad: <br>Highly addictive!! Prepare to gain some weight! If you can&#39;t handle spicy food, skip the hot sauce, it&#39;s very spicy! <br><br>-The Ugly: <br>We probably gained some weight from eating this more than once...<br><br>We would&#39;ve given 6 stars for this halal cart if we could. We love the food &amp; the service. Another thing we love about this halal cart, they&#39;re located minutes away from our place! There is no need to go to the city for some delicious halal food. <br><br>Highly recommended!",

"reviewcomment":"Chayhana Salom had the disadvantage of being the second stop on a Sheepshead Bay double-header with Cafe Glechik across the street. I was trying to make the long journey out to these parts worthwhile, but the net result was that I wound up stuck in a chair for nearly an hour after the meal, trying to decipher Uzbek pop videos, stomach bulging out of my mid-section while attempting to digest copious about amounts of meat.<br><br>None of this Chayana&#39;s fault, except for that the unusually large menu of Central Asian choices left far too much temptation to over-order. Uzbek cuisine, if not exactly on every corner, is pretty well represented in southern and eastern Brooklyn, enough that there&#39;s room to make comparisons on the individual offerings of the restaurant rather than the cuisine itself. <br><br>We focused partially on food not easily found elsewhere in the city. We started with a mash-up of a soup, the chuchvara in laghman sauce. As the name suggests, the red oily accompaniment for the ubiquitous noodle dish of the Steppe was used here as a slightly sour base for small dumplings. These chuchvara were slightly smaller than the average pelmeni and tasted roughly the same. The soup isn&#39;t as spicy when served over pasta and had a flavor not too dissimilar from solyanka, a workaday soup popular in Greater Russia.<br><br>We also nibbled on a chicken samsa, a common dish here filled with an uncommon protein, and also some pretty straightforward manti. Everything was done well and there were a wide variety of dishes available - not a guarantee at a small family run establishment like this. <br><br>Let me dial that praise up a bit - I think this is the best Uzbek restaurant in the City at the moment. I&#39;m ready, after just one visit, to hand over the crown from the long-time champion, Cafe Kashkar. With plenty of options for the both the first-time and long-time Central Asian dinner, and the friendly staff and wonderful English menu, this place should be the first stop for those interested in the cuisine of Tashkent.",

"reviewcomment":"THIS PLACE IS CASH ONLY.<br><br>Now that that tidbit is out of the way, let me state that this place is my absolute favorite place in NYC. I&#39;m not sure whether I should be upset or happy that I don&#39;t live closer to it.<br><br>LOCATION<br>It&#39;s located in a tiny place on the second floor. Limited seating and it&#39;s always crowded on weekends. Expect to wait anywhere from 1h - 2.5h during peak period.<br><br>FOOD<br>While most people come here for the desserts, you have to try their prix-fixe sets as well. Cha-an have only two prix-fixe menu:<br>Kayu: Rice porridge + 5 toppings + 1 side dish + dessert<br>Kago: Rice + tea smoked salmon + soup + salad + 2 side dishes + dessert<br>The side dishes for the sets is seasonal. However, if it&#39;s you haven&#39;t tried the tea-smoked salmon yet, you have to order that. It&#39;s fantastic - soft, salty, umami - the flavor combination is especially good with rice/porridge and is very comforting.<br><br>DESSERT<br>Every dessert in Cha-An is rocking but I&#39;m a big fan of their black sesame creme brulee and ice cream. The black sesame flavor is intense and just explodes in your mouth. Cha-An&#39;s desserts are quite sweet. So for the best experience, pair their desserts with one of their fantastic teas.<br><br>TEAS<br>Oh my, where should I start? I absolutely love their tea selection. They have the usuals (Earl Grey, Darjeeling etc...) but they also have some tea selections that are hard to find served anywhere else (Pu-Erh, Uji Kabusecha etc...). If you have the chance, I do advise you to order one of their green tea selections, especially those that you&#39;ve never heard before. Each member in your party should select a different tea and have an impromptu tea tasting session. I have had similar sessions with my friends and we frequently ended up swapping teas when we found that we liked the other person&#39;s better.<br><br>OVERALL<br>BRING CASH. Come early or at odd hours for minimal wait times. Be prepared to wait. Come hungry and get both food and dessert. Slightly pricey but so worth it for the quality of the food and service.",

And I do. I also love their carnitas torta. Piled high with juicy pork, it was a very, very good sandwich on its own. With a ladleful of the homemade hot sauce they keep behind the counter?

I ask the concierge if he can find us anything and he looks at me like, its 3pm on a Saturday and you want reservations at a place you need to call in advance, and replies we can check. I had heard about Daniel and am a fan of the chef so we tried and sure enough there was a table available, knowing this isn&#39;t the norm we took it, after all it was meant to be. <br><br>We each ordered the Fixed price option and my wife had a glass of wine while I tried one of the non-alcohol specialty drinks, Palombaggia (or so it says on the bill). The wine paired great with the food my wife had ordered and I was in heaven with this drink.<br><br>The food was good, the atmosphere was elegant, the service was top notch and the experience was unforgettable.<br><br>I could not have asked for a more unforgettable experience for an unforgettable celebration.

"reviewcomment":"I first learned of Annisa prior to moving to the city, when a good friend of mine raved about the foie gras soup dumplings he&#39;d eaten here. Fast forward to almost a year later: after multiple attempts and subsequent delays, I was able to make a dinner reservation for two on a Sunday evening. Granted, it was a month in advance, but with the small size of the dining room and the current popularity Annisa holds, planning ahead should have been a no-brainer.<br><br>Annisa&#39;s history is worth a mention; several years ago, a fire burned down the original venue, and the second time around, Chef Lo enlisted the help of a feng-shui expert in its redesign. The result is a modest, yet elegant, dining area that seats only 20 or so patrons at a time. The tables are set in one open dining area, but are spaced so that you can hold a conversation without interruption. We were shown to our table, had our glasses filled with water, and were presented with the menu for the night. To note - you will not find pages and pages of options at Annisa. The options barely span across two sheets, but each is as tempting as the prior. For those feeling slightly more adventurous, Annisa also offers a five and seven course tasting menu at fairly reasonable prices.<br><br>Although we had initially planned to go for the tasting menu, I was pretty much won over by the a la carte options, and we each decided on our own appetizers and entrees. Once our orders were taken, we were given sourdough rolls and a serving of, perhaps, the most elegantly presented butter I have seen. Melded into a flower-like pattern, it seemed to be a shame to have to cut into it with a knife. At the same time, we were also given an amuse bouche, which I had to pass onto my friend as it included raw fish. (My propensity towards seafood, especially raw, is still a work in progress.)<br><br>Our appetizers soon made their way over, and I was delighted to see the plate of foie gras dumplings in front of me. Three dumplings are laid out in a triangular ring, each topped off with a decadent piece of foie gras and drizzled with a dark vinegar reduction. I was presented with a soup spoon and chopsticks and upon seeing my confusion, my server explained how to properly eat them. Carefully placing my first dumpling onto the soup spoon, I bit into the corner and had my first taste of the broth; earthy and rich, with a hint of gamey-ness, it was the perfect introduction to the actual dumpling filling - a soft, not-too-thick foie mousse accented with pieces of jicama for a little crunch. It wasn&#39;t until I managed to get a piece of the seared foie gras on top that the experience was complete.<br><br>It&#39;s hard to imagine that a following dish could even come close to these dumplings, but at the recommendation of the manager (&#34;My wife orders this dish every time and loves it,&#34; he assured me) I had decided on the Pan-Roasted Chicken. Annisa&#39;s rendition of this pedestrian dish involves a plump chicken breast, the skin delightfully crisped, stuffed with a filling consisting of pig&#39;s foot and accented with white truffles. The chicken is moist and flavorful, the filling rich and gelatinous, and the pairing with the wine-reduced gravy around the plate absolutely spot-on. The flavors were subtly layered, and it was impossible not to discover a new delight with each passing bite. I was also happy that the portion size was fairly generous, especially given the fact that the dish as a whole was very filling.<br><br>And dessert was, perhaps, not as strong as the earlier dishes. Although, in theory, the Tower of Caramelized Banana and Peanut Butter and Coconut Sauce was a good idea, the dessert was far too dainty for its components. Layers of a crisp cookie serve as the &#34;floor&#34; to the structure, supporting swirls of peanut butter. We clumsily tried to use our spoons to break it without making a mess, but to no avail. Nonetheless, the combination of banana, peanut butter, and coconut was a fail-safe, and one that brought us a fair amount of entertainment throughout its consumption.<br><br>In the end, all I can say is this: Come here for the best. It is at Annisa where you will find an ambiance optimal not only for dining, but for enjoying the time spent with your companions; where the staff truly value their clientele and want to ensure the ideal dining experience; and where the food is on point in both conceptualization and execution. There is no doubt in my mind that Annisa deserves its Michelin Star, and I&#39;m sure it will continue to receive praises in the years to come.",

"reviewcomment":"WOW! <br><br>I am so happy I found this lovely cafe in Bayonne. I am also sad that I didn&#39;t learn about it sooner. Talya is truly a neighborhood gem. And I will be proudly supporting this local business. <br><br>Have you ever had an omelet made with pure love? Fluffy eggs, fresh mushrooms, lightly buttered. It&#39;s heaven in your mouth. You can even have it without the cheese! It is that good. I cannot wait to try the French toast. The owner really takes care when cooking, so be warned, your food will take time to be made. <br><br>I have not had Turkish coffee since I have last visited my friends Turkish mom. When I called, distraught that I could not find parking in the neighborhood because of snow, Suzie was going to make an exception to the no Turkish coffee to go rule for me. That was so sweet. Luckily, when I came around the block to pick it up, I found a spot. What a great cup of coffee! It had that kick to it and was just the right strength. Perfect pick me up in the morning. <br><br>If you are looking for a breakfast or brunch spot in town where your food is cooked to perfection, this is your spot. I know I will return again! You should come out and give them a try too. This is an amazing spot! <br><br>Some things you should know: parking in this area is tough, especially now with all of the snow. Take a jitney bus that runs along Kennedy Blvd. or the Light Rail to 45th street. <br><br>If you are ordering to go, call ahead and they will have your food ready for you so you can run in. <br><br>Suzie is a real sweetheart and genuinely loves Talya and Bayonne!",

"reviewcomment":"So I&#39;m a lucky girl. A lucky food blogger, really, because my friends always know such good places to eat. Maybe they should be the ones blogging instead. Anyway, for this one; full credit goes to Lynn Lim, perhaps the most impressive foodie I know. The last time we headed out in her direction for a good meal, she lead us to Bunker Vietnamese, which is still a memorable meal in my book and has apparently blown up big time. The girl really knows her stuff.<br><br>So last night, we hopped on the L train to the Halsey stop, and about a ten minute walk into the desolate streets of far Bushwick / Ridgewood, down a side street that could only be described as creepy, and we were there. If you don&#39;t catch the tiny sign on a framed piece of printer paper, you&#39;ll walk right past it and into the abyss.<br><br>What we walked into was one of the best atmosphere&#39;s I&#39;ve seen in a restaurant in a while. A totally open floor plan, it&#39;s easy to see everything that&#39;s happening in the kitchen (both of them), and there&#39;s tons of room to spread out at any number of their large-sized dining tables. The owners, Italians, are not only gracious, but very fun to talk to. The place has been open for two months and even with the far location, I have a feeling will be untouchable before you can say Abra-Cadabra. It&#39;s got a similar vibe to Roberta&#39;s, but I think a little nicer, the food a little better, and the experience a little more Italian.<br><br>The food is incredible. One thing that the very hilarious duo at the table next to us ordered that we did not (to my great sadness), was the meat plate. The thing was enormous. The people at that table were cracking me up; one man in a tophat and with a handlebar mustache, and the other just your average Joe, but with a random Mac keyboard, and a hilarious set of things to say. &#34;On a scale from 1 to 10, YUM. You can quote me on that.&#34; <br><br>They make their own burrata in house; which I could have eaten four of and called it a day. With the basil and olive oil, it was heavenly. The only thing that broke my heart was the lack of bread to scoop up the leftover bits of olive oil and cream on the plate.<br><br>The pizzas are available in an extensive number of options, including a plain that you can add any toppings to, so essentially anything goes. We opted for the Guido BK, a broccoli rabe and sausage (classic combo), and then the Habanero, which was a cured spicy pork loin and habanero peppers. That was our favorite, and was so good that we ordered two of them.<br><br>The best part, besides the incredible food? BYOB. Which means that five people dove into three pies, a huge bottle of wine, and a burrata appetizer. The total bill after 20% tip? $13 each. I&#39;ll be back tomorrow.",

Granted I had no idea that it was a vegetarian restaurant when I first visited.  And I&#39;m glad that I didn&#39;t know, because in all honesty it probably would have prevented me from trying their version of the Bahn Mi.  This sandwich is truly spectacular and, I cannot believe I&#39;m saying this, crushes all other comers in the category despite bringing tofu to what is almost exclusively a meat fight. This played out sandwhich is anything but at Pickle Shack. I&#39;m not going to try and describe it in detail, but you should take my word for it and give it a test drive.<br><br>On the merits of the Bahn Mi and the stellar selection of Dogfish Head brews I have returned to Pickle Shack several times and found the other dishes to exist on the same plain.  I thought about docking them a star for the sometimes varied level of service, but they are still pretty new and I&#39;m starting to see the few weak links fall by the wayside in favor those more dependable and attentive.",

"reviewcomment":"My Holy Grail.  Truly a 3-star Michelin Experience.<br><br>Through the help of my boyfriend&#39;s friend who works at Per Se, we were fortunate enough to have reservations for lunch this past Sunday and boy was it a memorable experience!  We were seated without a doubt at the best table in the dining room, right next to the main window overlooking Columbus Circle and Central Park.  The view was breathtaking!<br><br>We were promptly offered some delicious French Champagne and then greeted by our server (who btw was dressed in a very nice suit) and told that we had a choice between three different tastings: a 5 course, a 7 course and a 10 course Chef&#39;s tasting.  Since there really isn&#39;t too many opportunities for either of us to dine at Per Se since we both don&#39;t live in NYC, we decided the 10 course was the only way to go.  Our meal totaled to 13 Courses not including the amuse bouche, thanks to a few courses complimented by the kitchen :)  Our meal went as follows:<br><br>1. Savory Profiteroles: Yummy melted gruyere cheese puff.  light and savory<br><br>2. Smoked Salmon Cone: A Thomas Keller Classic.  Smoked Salmon with creme fraiche inside a light savory cone.  I do not enjoy eating raw fish or smoked fish, but this was delightful.  The salmon and the creme fraiche worked very well together and the crispy wafer-like sesame? cone was delicious.<br><br>3.  Forest Mushroom Soup: I loooooveee mushrooms, and this soup was like pure mushroom and cream puree.  It was so so good.  And the serving size was like a full sized portion of soup.  <br><br>4.  &#34;Oysters and Pearls&#34;:  The signature.  I was really tempted to opt out of oyster items and caviar items when we were asked to mention any food-items we did not care for in the reservation, but I&#39;m so glad I took a risk. The presentation was beautiful, with two oysters sitting atop of tapioca and this wonderfully creamy looking sauce, right next to the oysters was a canelle of sterling white sturgeon caviar.  All of the food items I do not wish to eat on a plate.  Mind blown.  This dish was amazing.  The oysters were almost sweet and combined with the tapioca, cream sauce and caviar, the flavor was just phenomenal.  Can not recommend this dish enough.<br><br>5.  White Truffle Infused Custard: This was served inside a cracked egg shell.  Decadent with more black truffle sauce topping the white truffle egg custard.  I could eat a whole flat&#39;s worth of these custard eggs. (There are 36 eggs in a flat).<br><br>6.  Cauliflower Salad: After several extremely rich and creamy courses, this was a welcoming palate cleanser.  Fresh, with notes of citrus and aged balsamic vinegar.<br><br>Bread intermission: Sourdough, multi-grain and Baguette.  Served with two types of butter.  One butter from Vermont (unsalted) and the other salted from California.<br><br>7. Atlantic Monk fish: This I was told, was a full filet of Monk fish served on top of lentils and pearl onions.  I&#39;ve never had monk fish before and I can tell you it was an interesting experience.  The texture is extremely firm for a fish, and the flavor is mild like a white fish.  It wasn&#39;t my favorite, but tasty for something I&#39;ve never had before.<br><br>8. Brussels Sprout Encrusted Main Sea Scallops: These were just melt in your mouth.  Definitely the best scallop preparation I&#39;ve ever had.  These were served with applewood bacon, brussels sprouts over a brown butter sauce.  <br><br>9. Cuisse De Poularde: This was a slice of I believe chicken thigh stuffed with mousse and served atop a curry sauce and dates.  A very middle-eastern/ India inspired dish.  The flavors were unlike any of the previous dishes we had tasted and provided a nice contrast from the courses before.<br><br>10.  Elysian Field&#39;s Lamb: Okay.  This is where I am a little confused as I had specifically requested no lamb, yet I was served lamb.. Oops? Haha.  I do not like the gaminess of lamb, but the lamb served at Per Se was probably the least gamey with very little gamey taste at all.  Honestly if it didn&#39;t look like a rack of lamb, I wouldn&#39;t have even known.  The meat was very tender and well executed with artichokes and ricotta gnocchi.<br><br>11.  Cheese Course: The cheese was raw sheep cheese served with a homemade sour cherry newton and roasted nuts.  Delicious.<br><br>12. Tropical Fruit Cup: Pineapple cubes, Passionfruit puree and White tea foam.  The white tea was bitter but worked moderately well with the tropical fruits.  I think this dish would have been better had the fruits been even sweeter and less sour.<br><br>13. Okinawan Brown Sugar Ice Cream: Delicious (got to cut this review short running out of review space lol)<br><br>14. Maralumi Chocolate: Like a home made Aero Bar, with genoise cake and marshmallow topping<br><br>15. Assorted Chocolates, Nougats and Macarons. <br><br>Toured the kitchen and found out it was the 10th Anniversary of Per Se.  Left full, happy, and with a goody bag filled with chocolates, cookies and a French Laundry Cookbook signed by Thomas Keller(courtesy of the bf).  I&#39;m so spoiled.",

Simon Kim&#39;s wait staff was professional and they even wrote &#34;Happy Birthday&#34; and my name on the menu! <br><br>We ordered the Monkey Bread (which comes with amazing condiments), Market Vegetables, Barbequed Octopus, Bucatini, Suckling Pig. We were full at the end.<br><br>The Market Vegetables were the best dish. He uses a lot of baby vegetables and that enables you to get very complex bites of flavour. The vegetables are also very rich, which was a pleasant surprise. Bucatini was a close second. This was delicious. Monkey bread was incredibly fluffy with delicious spreads (can&#39;t decide which was better). <br><br>The octopus was a tad too charred for my taste and the pig was slightly dry for pork belly.<br><br>Our waiter also gave us a free dish! Beets with frozen goat cheese. This was incredible.<br><br>For dessert we had this s&#39;mores dish which was a great end to the meal. Happy birthday was written on it in delicious melted chocolate.<br><br>On our way out Simon Kim waved goodbye to us and said &#34;Happy Birthday Eddie&#34;.<br><br>TLDR: <br>Food is wonderful, price is reasonable. The service was on another level. It was one of the most personable restaurant experiences I have ever had. Obviously, it was my birthday, but they made me feel special and that&#39;s important. <br><br>They had an extremely non-pretentious atmosphere despite the level of service they had going. There aren&#39;t many restaurants that can blend the two. I noticed Simon giving hand signals every now and again to covertly guide the staff to run things smoothly without breaking flow.",

(I get distracted easily, I guess)<br>But I am absolutely thrilled I finally made it.<br><br>Semi-dark and intimate, but not to the point there you cannot see other people or menu. Several tables situated on a podium, along comfy bench seating. (There is a decent size bar area, too!) Scenic lighting, moving fans along the bar, and upbeat music all come together perfectly. It is eclectic at the best of it.<br><br>Cocktails are creative, strong and made well. Honeycomb Pisco Sour was a treat - to drink and to look at, honey amber goodness in a glass. There are also several liquors to choose from, and beers (they have Estrella!)<br><br>To start, there is popcorn. Yes, popcorn - how fun is that to start your evening? (Just don&#39;t throw it at your date - they get upset for some reason...)<br><br>OK, so Happy Hour goes Tuesday to Friday, 6-8, and all day Sunday &amp; Monday. Special on drinks, and $1 oysters - market selection. Fresh! Madeleine and Duck Island were two selections for the night. I could not resist - you would not, either! Ginger shallot relish is simply genius. <br><br>Now, the star of the show here are ceviches. Perfect to share, and absolutely amazing. <br>We started with Ceviche De Salmon - fresh wild salmon is always a win, but plated with shaved almonds, chili oil, oranges and tamarind sauce, it is truly foodgasmic (yea, I said it again!). It is torch-seared table side, and not only it adds to the show, the delicious creme-brullesque crust makes the flavor incredible. <br>Followed up with Tiradito De Atun, a spin on classic, with crispy potato crunch toppings, jalapeños, onions and truffle yuzu glaze. Sooo good...<br><br>Our server, Ella, was absolutely the best - helped with all the selections and recommendations, making sure everything came out alright.

The tomatoes used to make the pizza sauce are imported from Italy. This attention to detail and pride in the product earns this place 5 stars from me. <br><br>The owner is friendly and very outgoing in New Yorker kinda way. It&#39;s nice to have an Italian style pizza shop with real Italians working in the joint. No disrespect to anyone else but if I&#39;m in a Dominican spot I want there to be Dominicans in there, same with Chinese or whatever, it def adds to the authenticity.  Just looking inside Corleones  it&#39;s obvious that time and care was invested in upgrading this place from the generic pizzeria that once existed in this space.<br><br>The east Harlem neighborhood is changing rapidly but this was def a good change.

With some freaking amazing quality sandwiches. Good bread, great meats, and quickly made.<br>There&#39;s a somewhat daunting list of options when you first walk in....but seriously, every sandwich is pretty awesome. The Tuna with Prosciutto is great, so is the Egg Ham, Cheese and Tomato on Ciabatta. And don&#39;t forget to pick up one of their Prosciutto Bread loafs.<br><br>Seriously, this place is a breath of fresh air, with some amazing food and a fun atmosphere, go grab a sandwich. Important fact though: There&#39;s no seating here, so head to the park to chow down!",

Luckily snagged the coveted couch, but really, any of the tables here are nice and cozy. I&#39;ve been here  another time since writing the draft of this review, and both times staff were extremely helpful and friendly. Recommendations include green tea with almond milk + okinawa syrup (Japanese mineral that provides a sweet, healthier alternative to sugar, not to mention so delectable I ordered it both times), as well as black tea with caramel flavor. <br><br>Two words: souffle cheesecake... can almost guarantee it will go perfectly with any tea that you order :)<br><br>You might be confused by the 4 types of tea or overwhelmed by all the possible combinations of syrup and flavor, but whatever you choose, will most likely be awesome. Don&#39;t be afraid to ask for suggestions, the staff is more than happy to help.",

I love my pals at WS, but The Cobra Club is steadily winning me over, for a few reasons: (1) There is actually room to spread out and work if you want to sit for awhile with nice WiFi. (2) They are a dog-friendly business and I can bring my Boston Terrier in to wait with me while I order my morning coffee (so much better than tying him outside in the cold!!). (3) The coffee is delicious. The coffee at other area coffeeshops can be bitter. The staff at the Cobra Club takes their time making drinks, so if you don&#39;t mind the wait you will be rewarded with delicious, nutty, non-bitter coffee that is a revelation.  Best coffee on the Jefferson Stop, and the staff is super super nice.",

Get the Beef Roll and scallion pancake!! <br><br>It was really yummy! You see my wife is Taiwanese so kinda knows a thing or two about Taiwanese food. My wife and I and the kids really enjoyed the food. <br>It has a great blend of the flaky goodness, Taiwanese style beef and yummy sauce.<br><br>The staff was great and they were cool to listen to some of my wives&#39; suggestions.....so we are hoping for Stinky Tofu next time hehehee...<br><br>Taiwanese Food on the go...what a great concept!<br><br>So if you do go to Smorgasburg, u have to stop by here!  =)<br><br>~mike",

"reviewcomment":"I would give Xixa 6 stars if I could. This is by far the best  $40 chef tasting menu I&#39;ve had - bar none. <br><br>I made a last minute reso here with 4 other friends and after much debate, we decided to opt for the 9 course tasting menu. 9 courses.... Hah! I counted no less than 17 dishes. Granted a few of them were amuse bouche and sides but it was so much food that I had trouble getting up when I was done eating. Funny thing is we were actually uncertain whether we should get the tasting menu or not because we thought it may not be enough food. <br><br>Anyway... enough small talk. Here is the list of the food that we were served:<br><br>1. Root chips &amp; salsa<br>2. Mexico-city style sauteed edamame, arbol chile, lime, toasted garlic*<br>3. Shrimp ceviche<br>4. Chicken sope: braised leg pibil, chopped liver, tomatillo, pickled onion<br>5. Nacho with honey tamarind sauce<br>6. Grilled carrots &#34;elote,&#34; honey butter, lime crema, coriander, feta, dill*<br>7. Braised duck lettuce wraps, mushrooms, picadillo, raisins, peanuts, roasted banana<br>8. &#34;Steak tacos:&#34; chilmole tortillas, roasted bone marrow, steak tartare, pepper marmalade*<br>9. Fried calamari<br>10. Albondigas: roasted lamb meatballs, crushed avocado &#34;hummus,&#34; feta, masa flatbread  *              <br>11. Braised goat sliders with fries*<br>12. Braised short ribs with cron peanuts and pomegranate sauce<br>13. Fundido of taleggio &amp; chihuahua, Italian chorizo, tomato pico, basil-parm tortillas, morita salsa*<br>14. Churros*                    <br>15. Flan and grapefruit sorbet<br>16. Banana ice cream with bananas &amp; sliced strawberries*<br>17. Mezcal chocolate with caramel &amp; chili<br><br>Impressive eh? Like I said - amazing value for $40. I put a * next  to the ones I really liked but I gotta say there wasn&#39;t anything that I didn&#39;t like and overall most of the dishes had a good balance of spice sour, sweet and seasoning. They also have a pretty extensive drink menu. I had two kinds of mezcal drinks during the meal and they were both good.<br><br>FYI, I&#39;ve been to Traif as well and I love both places but I am completely taken by Xixa. A must try in my books",

"reviewcomment":"I don&#39;t know what took me so long to come here.  I went working a couple blocks from it for months without even knowing about it, to now I usually stop by at least once a week.  Dollar for dollar this is currently my best value lunch in midtown.  $4-$5 for a pita and $7-$8 for the platters is tough to be beat, except for different halal carts around and they cannot match the quality of the stuff here.  <br><br>I always go with the pita sandwiches, which is enough for me, but I know the platters are always popular as well.  A sandwich stuffed with either falafel/shawarma, the vegetables and choice of sauces.  Half of the time I come here wanting a falafel pita ($4), but then after you see the shawarma ($5) cooking in the corner of the grill away I end up going with that option.  While waiting in line (just about every day there will be a line), they offer you a free falafel ball to try, which may be my favorite little touch from the place.  Yes, one falafel ball is a small expense, but this is not some high end restaurant, you can only make so much money on a $4 sandwich and all of that free falafel adds up quick.  You will notice the falafel have a different shape, they are oval instead of the traditional sphere, but that just means even more room for awesome flavor.  The shawarma is freshly carved too, not just some random meat that sits on a griddle all day like some carts.  The hot sauce is good as well, not nearly as hot as the 53rd and 6th cart, but still has a good kick.  <br><br>I usually try to plan out days when I know the weather is bad to head over, because I know the lines will not be that bad, but I thoroughly suggest anybody walking by here to take the time and try this place.  This really is one of midtown&#39;s great lunch options.  I still can&#39;t wait until I finally head over to queens to try the original place and hopefully meet the famous Freddy (owner of the carts).",

"reviewcomment":"Old School Italian Butcher Shop<br>Delicious Homemade Chili<br><br>Take a trip back in time, and visit Italy when you&#39;re on the Upper East Side.  Walking down the street one fine afternoon, I couldn&#39;t help but notice a &#34;Delicious Homemade Chili&#34; sign, which tugged at my taste buds. With high hopes, i decided to venture in and grab a bowl. Two chicken fingers, one container of chili, and a mixed green salad later, I found myself sitting on their bench watching people walk by. <br><br>The chili was DELICIOUS!! Not too thick - hearty. The roasted red peppers balanced out the flavor perfectly. Their chicken strips, are entirely too addicting. Thin and long, the strips have a nice consistency. They are fairly thick and have a crunchy texture, with just the right amount of saltiness. If you like chicken strips, this could become a regular addiction. The green salad was decent, thankfully it did not have iceberg lettuce.<br><br>The food here is served cold, and available for pick up / delivery. If you ask nicely, the guys will gladly heat up your soup, and there is a bench outside. As this is a butcher shop there is no seating, their drink selections are limited.  I had visited Ottomanelli many years ago, and was glad to re-discover it again. <br><br>Great job guys!! <br>Thank you for being so sweet - I&#39;ll definitely be back.<br><br>The Scene: Traditional, Italian<br>Destination Rating: 5<br>Date Rating: N/A   (Perfect for ordering in)<br>Hob Nob Potential: 4<br><br>Strong Suggestion: Try the chili - it&#39;s delicious!",

They have rescued many a last-minute barbecue.<br><br>Also, they have the most extensive selection of pre-packaged German goods in the neighborhood (cookies, bread, soda, candy, jars of condiments, etc., etc., etc.).<br><br>And finally, the Zum Stammtisch Pork Store is in glorious GLENDALE! (not Middle Village, not Ridgewood, not Forest Hills, not Woodhaven, not Flushing fer cryin&#39; out loud!)

"reviewcomment":"Absolutely wonderful sushi and the BYOB make this place a great casual and reasonably priced option! My friend picked up a few big cans of Sapporo from the corner store nearby and we headed to the restaurant for the first seating of the night. <br><br>The place is tiny with just about 12 seats and it almost feels like you are sitting in someone&#39;s home. We were assigned seats by the door at the corner of the sushi bar (the only type of seating they have, no individual tables) and at first we were a bit disappointed to be so close to the door since it was freezing out. We then realized that it was prime seating since we were both able to watch the sushi chefs work and since there are just three seatings, there really is no foot traffic coming in and out during the meal. Score!<br><br>There were ice bins at each of our stations and we were able to keep our Sapporo on ice and refill our glasses at our leisure. We also received water as well to cleanse our palates at each bite. <br><br>We started with the uni sampler and the scallop and both were amazing. The uni from California is way better than the Japanese one, but it was great to try a side by side comparison. The scallop was super fresh and a nice sized portion as well. <br><br>We then got the Omakase and I love how the sushi rice is served just over room temperature. There was a buttery richness to many of the pieces and my favorites were the ones served at the beginning of the meal. (That might be because I was getting fuller and fuller as the meal progressed.)<br><br>To end the meal we got the most perfect bowl of miso soup. It was a wonderful meal and I definitely left satisfied. I will be sure to come back if I can snag another reservation for sure! My new favorite place (tied with Sasabune) for Omakase in the city!",

"reviewcomment":"So first off: BIG shout out to Louis and I always forget the young lady (business owner&#39;s name) but to her as well... they ALWAYS take care of me...<br><br>So I walked in on a limb last year and Louis was the first person that greeted me. He gave me the rundown of each flavor of Gelato they were serving. He was very patient and very nice about giving out samples (6 of them at a time). They have a ridiculous amount of flavors to choose from (there&#39;s something for everyone, I promise). Their menu, I THINK, is pretty extensive for a cafe and it&#39;s reasonably priced. They decor inside is very chic and stylish. Great colors. I particularly enjoy their lounge area in the back with the French doors. <br><br>The location of the Cafe is something that I appreciate. It&#39;s only 7 minutes from my house. Parking is pretty good provided you get there at a decent time (still figuring that out). I go there to study every Sunday and can usually find parking in front of the Cafe. I&#39;ll be a regular there as much as I can. So my favs so far:<br><br>Gelato: Definitely the berries w/ lavender. It&#39;s very floral and clean tasting.<br>Food: Their meatballs with pasta was pretty good for a Cafe. I was expecting less than par but the meatballs were a nice size and seasoned well. <br>Drink: I love their raspberry white hot chocolate. So bad for you, but SOO good. <br><br>I can&#39;t wait to see what Louis and the crew have in store this summer. So CHEERS to your first year. I&#39;m so happy for you guys. Congratulations are in order... <br><br>-Alvin",

The food is super fresh and the servings are average (not too small, not too large) and remind me of the chain, Chipotle.<br><br>Overall, the place and food make me think of a long-time, favorite spot in Park Slope, Taqueria, that closed a year or two ago.

There are high tables/stools, booths and just all around spacious to hang. We came on a Saturday night and on a Thursday night. Both nights were busy-ish, but not overly crowded. Very laid back bartenders.<br><br>Now the winner of this place is..... their extensive list of cocktail/craft beer and whiskey. I had a couple of beer the first night, while the fiance had whiskey and the next time we were here, I had a couple of cocktails and he had different whiskey. It&#39;s like whiskey heaven for anyone who likes whiskey...Prices are reasonable, not too expensive.<br><br>I guess we finally found a place we can say &#34;this is our neighborhood bar&#34;<br><br>:)",

"reviewcomment":"Well, I did. I walked over here and got myself a big hungry man sandwich. I&#39;m rarely in Bed Stuy this often, so I knew I would regret it if I didn&#39;t.<br><br>As a NYC native, this place is very &#34;New York&#34; to me. An appropriately fast-talking, straight-shooting but friendly guy behind the register took my order, as an overly aggressive woman stood practically in the kitchen waiting for her sandwich, and a massive dude walked up to the counter holding a plate of fries. &#34;Forgot somethin? The CHEESE?&#34; While the Fast-talking Friendly hollered in the back about adding cheese to his fries, we all silently considered that he would have been better off without it. <br><br>I had looked at the menu beforehand and couldn&#39;t decide between the brisket and the pastrami, so I got the combo sandwich with both, on a hero (I don&#39;t like mushy bread, it&#39;s a thing) with swiss, lettuce, mayo and mustard. I&#39;d read good things about the potato salad so I got that too. As Fast-talking Friendly handed me the sandwich he said &#34;It&#39;s bad. It&#39;s really big. The swiss and the lettuce made it worse.&#34; I appreciated his concern. I knew he thought I couldn&#39;t handle it, that I was in way over my head. <br><br>He was wrong.<br><br>This was probably the best pastrami sandwich I&#39;ve ever had. If I went back again, I would get it without the brisket; not because the brisket was bad, but because the pastrami was so flavorful and perfect that I literally couldn&#39;t taste the brisket at all. I know the custom is to get it on rye, but I liked that I had the option to go off the beaten path and make a sub if I wanted to. The sandwich WAS big - I had half for lunch and the other half for dinner. The potato salad was good but a little too creamy for my taste. (I still ate it all.)<br><br>For me -- personal preference -- this beats Katz. Can&#39;t wait to come back.",

"reviewcomment":"Oh, Brooklyn Bagel, we love you. and by &#34;we&#34; I mean, Astoria. <br><br>New York City Bagels are iconic... and it&#39;s because of places like Brooklyn Bagel, bottom line. This place is always packed with good reason(s): the superb quality of the bagels, freshness of the MULTIPLE cream cheeses, piping hot coffee, speedy precise service, the several convenient locations... the list goes on and on. <br><br>However, here is what kicks this place up a notch (as if what I just listed wasn&#39;t all you&#39;d want from a bagel shop). Each week they have a &#34;cream cheese flavor of the week&#34; and they really let their imaginations run wild. I think I saw a red velvet flavor, a nutella flavor... I mean come on. It&#39;s like they know me.<br><br>Then, let&#39;s take this a bit farther why don&#39;t we. They have SPELT bagels for a healthier option, did they read my mind? No, they just know what people care about in their neighborhood. They also have tofu cream cheese that also come in unique flavors. <br><br>Just yesterday, I had a spelt bagel with tofu cinnamon, walnut, raisin cream cheese. It was decadent and delicious, without all the guilt of me scarfing down a regular bagel. Thanks, guys. You make me so happy.<br><br>Also, the coffee (however you like it) will impress. And that&#39;s all you really want to wash that bagel down with, right? Well even if you don&#39;t... they have a great juice selection including freshly squeezed orange. Awesome!<br><br>Breakfast sandwiches are also a popular option here. My husband&#39;s favorite is the bacon, egg, and cheese on a croissant. And why wouldn&#39;t it be... it&#39;s bacon, eggs, and cheese on a CROISSANT.<br><br>A++ for Brooklyn Bagel.",

I started with A&amp;A. <br><br>On a nippy Saturday morning there was a line, a long one, but I  didn&#39;t care. I spent 8 hours in a car to get here and a line was not going to stop me. <br><br>What I got? My usual for breakfast; bake and saltfish. It was heaven. The bake was crisp on the outside and piping hit goodness on the inside. The saltfish was well seasoned and the pepper that I had added gave it an extra kick. <br><br>My cousin got an aloo pie. The aloo pie was crisp and the chana was seasoned to perfection. Topped with pepper and tamarind and you have greatness. <br><br>Thanks to A&amp;A I am already dreading returning to Norfolk.",

Two other gentlemen helped me, bacon, egg, and cheese on a roll please. While I was there a handful of folks walked in, two older guys who clearly have been going for years. They had a cheery conversation about the upcoming thanksgiving holiday and about the football game that was starting in 10 minutes. Two younger guys, one schooling the other on the best sandwiches they have and a woman coming to pick up some preordered meats.<br><br>There were lots of meats.<br><br>The sandwich was amazing!

Hurray!   GF surprised me on a &#34;date night&#34; here, and wow, perfect place for a date.  And with that, I emphasize that this place is no bueno for large groups.  There&#39;s only about 20 seats (think sushi-bar style) so unless you want to be awkwardly talking to your friends in an &#34;L&#34; shape, avoid it.  Instead, take that special someone who appreciates the meticulous details and presentation of small bites done Spanish style, all while watching the chefs prepare and create the dishes in front of your eyes.  I dare you not to smile when you watch the chefs torch and caramelize those lovely Torrejas (french toast but I call it more of a bread pudding).<br><br>We didn&#39;t opt for the tasting menu (realized that it featured the same items from the menu a-la-carte (and there isn&#39;t that many anyways). Ask the friendly staffs for recommendation; they make you feel welcome.<br><br>The menu changes seasonally so it wouldn&#39;t make sense to pinpoint a particular dish.  However, I can point out that each vegetable/ meat dish was cooked perfectly, seasoned well, yet still retained its natural flavor.   My favorite was the fascination of seeing so many different ingredients complimenting and enhancing a dish.  What the dishes lacked in portion, it made up for it in quality (and presentation).  Quality over quantity, my friends and in life, you pay for what you get: a kick ass meal.",

The hostess took my number, and we stepped outside to walk around while we waited.<br><br>Once you&#39;re called in for your table, the hostess walks you down a hallway toward he dining room, and upon announcing your arrival to the dining room and kitchen staff, everyone greets you in Japanese.<br><br>If you&#39;re a small party, or even a moderate sized one, you&#39;ll likely be seated with other folks. You basically take a seat where ever they put you, and get off your high horse if you think this is weird, because this place won&#39;t be changing its customs any time soon.<br><br>I ordered the classic ramen and my sister ordered to Umami. Both were incredible. The broth stuck to the noodles and the dishes weren&#39;t salty at all. The noodles were fresh, as were the rest of the ingredients, and the service was fast! Which is impressive considering how long the wait was to get in.<br><br>One of the best parts is the glass looking into he kitchen.

"reviewcomment":"I&#39;ve passed this place a number of times before, and never thought to step foot inside until a good friend suggested we stop here to catch up. It was a good suggestion, and it&#39;s become a bit of a regular spot ever since.<br><br>It&#39;s a very cozy location, and my experience with whoever is behind the counter has always been pleasant. What&#39;s really worth the repeat visits is the food, of course. The chai I had there was aromatic and delicious, and the menu selections are good enough that my friend and I can order different items just to mix &amp; match. I&#39;m particularly fond of the smoked turkey and pesto panini, as well as the prosciutto and mozzarella variety. It&#39;s nice to be able to get a panini from someplace that hasn&#39;t had the thing sitting in a refrigerator for hours waiting to be reheated.<br><br>If you happen to come in when they have the tomato soup with sour cream, do yourself a favor and have it. On a cold winter day (and we&#39;ve had a lot of those lately), it really hits the spot. Ditto for their chocolate brownie. <br><br>I really enjoy the cafe atmosphere. That is, you go and order your food, and they pretty much leave you to your own devices until you&#39;re ready to go. You can have a nice, leisurely meal or snack and not worry about how long you&#39;ve been there. <br><br>I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll be out here several more times before winter is out.

"reviewcomment":"I celebrated my birthday at Bosie Tea Parlor with several girl friends (+2 boys)! Bosie is an absolutely darling tea parlor nestled in the west village, and we all traipsed in dressed in our summer dresses (on a cold winter afternoon) for the occasion. <br><br>I ordered the Bosie Tea Service for 2, which comes with the following per person:<br><br>- 2-cup pot of tea (includes most teas on the menu)<br>- 2 mini scones with clotted cream and jam<br>- 3 portions of tea sandwiches<br>- 2 mini tea cakes<br>- Choice of two macarons<br><br>When you order tea service for 2, the food comes out on this adorable 3-tiered serving platter.  It might not sound like a lot of food but my boyfriend and I were actually stuffed by the end. <br><br>The cucumber sandwiches were yummy, along with my jasmine and rose macarons. I just love how delicate and dainty tea sandwiches look. The tea cakes were dense and moist, with green tea being my favorite. Since I usually order savory items for brunch, the sweet pastries became a little overwhelming towards the end.<br><br>Tea service is a bit on the expensive side ($29 for one, $55 for two), but very comparable to other tea parlors I&#39;ve been to in the city like Lady Mendl&#39;s Tea Saloon. If you&#39;re not in the mood for tea they also have a great brunch menu. I tried a friend&#39;s lorraine quiche - absolutely delicious! If I come back I&#39;m definitely trying the brunch menu.",

"reviewcomment":"They have go max go bars here! I bought one of each and ate all of them right after eating 3 cones - coffee, my usual, chocolate mint and pistachio. There were more chocolate options but it&#39;s quite pricey and they only take cash. =[ My total came out to be $40. Next up is the fakin&#39; bacon chocolate bar!! Yum yum. More cardio...<br><br>FYI - if you never tried real pistachio and chocolate mint ice cream...this is the place! Not the fake green ones...<br><br>I sampled the new flavors - black licorice, peanut butter crunch, vanilla with brownies and raspberry swirl, all very interesting but a tad too strong in taste. <br><br>I LOVE THIS PLACE. <br><br>The only negative is the amount of days they are open! Who is going to satisfy my cravings the rest of the week?! <br><br>BTW - get your stamp cards! <br><br>I LOVE THIS PLACE.",

"reviewcomment":"Made the trek out to Sunset Park w/ my boyfriend to try out this little cafe on 5th Avenue. The owner/server/chef was very charming and kind- and his food was equally amazing. We tried the lentil soup (probably one of the best I&#39;ve ever had), the turkish coban (pronounced shoh-bahn) salad, and the mixed platter for apps and entrees. The platter could&#39;ve had a bit more meat in there but when paired w/ the salad it was just enough to fill our stomachs and leave room for the plat de resistance: the almond pudding! E and I paired it with cups of traditional turkish tea and we fought each other for the last bite (the only time I&#39;ve ever seen my bf fight me over dessert). All in all, the meal cost around $37 for both of us including tax and tip. Sooo good.<br><br>Extra star earned for playing Anggun&#39;s Snow on the Sahara. Yesss.",

Light, fluffy, flavorful unlike most gluten free bread products.   <br>I get so frustrated when we go somewhere that serves GF bread that is crumbly, tasteless, thick and nasty- I tell them about Everybody Eats. My husband and love Astoria&#39;s Sandwich Bar and sometimes he gets a GF one to so we can split our sandwiches. He loves Everybody Eats bread especially the baguette. This place is like no other gf bread. If you haven&#39;t tested it I urge you to run and get some! G-FreeNYC offers it as well as many other locations. I actually haven&#39;t tested the bagels or cookies but have heard all good things. I would love it if Brooklyn Coffee shops in Astoria carried there bagels so we could enjoy the coffee house. This company needs to be in all Astoria restaurants now days!! Wish more natural/health food shops in Astoria had it stocked- maybe someday soon!<br>If your a restaurant owner this is a must have product line- have it stocked! Gf/CD is not going anywhere. The demand for gf product is not to have just anything it&#39;s to have the highest quality gf product as possible. If you have not had Everybody Eats you have to get some today!<br><br>Tips: If you just got diagnosed as CD or need to live a GF lifestyle you will love this company!",

"reviewcomment":"It&#39;s not a store you&#39;d easily find, even on the most known Brooklyn Asian street. It&#39;s located right off the corner of 48th street and 8th Ave and is the best dumpling house I know there so far. Other dumpling houses generally serves food by the waves or batches, but this place - it chucks out fresh dumplings by the HORDES. They have 3 wok pan-frying stations. <br><br>Dumplings here have the best skin consistency - it&#39;s thin, yet just enough to fill you. At one dollar per four dumplings, this place is heaven. If you&#39;ve even been to Vanessa&#39;s, Prosperity&#39;s or T-Spot dumpling houses in Manhattan, this place is comparable to those, if not sometimes better (depends on how fresh off the wok it is). If you order $5 or more, they sometimes throw an extra 4-6 dumplings in there for the heck of it. Neat, huh? <br><br>Besides dumplings, this place also has amazing noodles (northern Chinese style - the thick white kind, not the more southern, skinny yellow egg noodles), scallion pancakes, and wonton soups. Scallion pancakes here are also amazing and one of my favorites. The Wonton soup here is also quite delicious (albeit simplistic) with a strong taste of black pepper in the hot soup - perfect for cold weather. Almost everything is a dollar or two on the menu and it&#39;s guaranteed to fill you up for cheap. <br><br>My only complaint with the place is that it isn&#39;t the cleanest. Granted, all dumpling houses aren&#39;t clean if you think about it - you&#39;re wrapping grounded meat inside a dough wrapping by hand, which are then frozen, only to be defrosted and fried for you to eat. This place also looks quite run-down. Bathroom sucks, drink selection is rather bad, but this is Yelp - and we review food, not restaurant looks (although I do hope this place gets a make-over soon).<br><br>One more last thing I like about this place - They provide separate bottles of soy sauce, vinegar, and sriracha sauce. Most place mix together certain sauces to be cheap, but you get to customize the vinegar level to tailor your own taste. Customizability is a plus on my book.",

"reviewcomment":"$5 for beer, shot and pizza. Uh, doesn&#39;t get any better than that does it? To elaborate, you get a beer (Miller High Life bottle), shot (well whiskey or tequila) and a pizza (personal pan not just a slice) for $5. And you can add toppings for $1 each, which is worth it. While the pizza isn&#39;t fantastic, it&#39;s big enough to get full off of. I highly recommend adding a topping or two since it highly increases the tastiness to the somewhat plain pizza. You can add pepperoni, bacon, sausage, onion, garlic, etc.<br><br>Atmosphere varies depending on the night but it&#39;s always pretty dark in there and somewhat noisy - i mean cheap MGDs and shots, what do you expect? Last time, there were some punk bands playing, which was cool, drew a different crowd. Other nights, they have trivia and when you shout out the right answer, there are free drinks along the way - WAHOO!<br><br>Great for a starting spot to get the night going in a hurry. Yeah it&#39;s dingy and gets crowded, but with good reason. Bartenders have all been really great: not super super friendly, but they get you what you want in a hurry. And that&#39;s all you can ask for.",

If you find yourself veering toward Starbucks across the street, STOP! Slap yourself on the wrist, turn around, and go to Blue Spoon.<br><br>Their prices are pretty standard for coffee in the city, but you get a waaaaaay better product than any of the giant chains and they have some pretty decent little snacks too. I&#39;ve yet to try any of their sando&#39;s/ bigger plates, so I&#39;ll write a follow-up review for that.<br><br>Otherwise: great product (latte- two thumbs up), tasty pastries, cute &amp; simple decor, and friendly service. The only downside is that the place is a little too small (line can easily build-up out the door).<br><br>Final vote: top 3 coffee places in FiDi.",

We had an order of tacos, and quesadillas, with horchata for refreshments.<br><br>I don&#39;t claim to be an expert in Mexican food, but at this little resto it was incredibly flavorful and fresh. Tacos had a good 6-7 ingredients, all perfectly balanced in flavour and size. The quesadillas only had cheese (at the insistence of my son), but no matter: the oxacatan cheese was def homemade - really stringy and squeaky. Awesome!",

"reviewcomment":"This is the ideal restaurant for an intimate, speak-easy dining experience for lovers of Japanese cuisine. Part of the allure definitely lies in the level of secrecy that comes with Bohemian. Then once you get past the private reservation line, the experience will most likely live up to expectations. The ambiance and exclusivity is fantastic, and the small space only enhances that vibe. The menu is truly special.<br><br>The tasting menu is ideal for first-time goers to get a sense of what they like and what they will want each time they visit subsequently.  Personal highlights are the pan-roasted branzino, uni croquette, mac-n-cheese, and foie gras soba.  You can&#39;t really go wrong with anything on the menu, and fans of washu beef will leave Bohemian very happy.<br><br>Bohemian is an experience very similar to that of Sakagura, maybe just a bit more intimate. It is simply the perfect place for celebrating any occassion.",

They have different specialties each day, so when time allows it&#39;s nice to stop in and scope out the days selection. With that said, I&#39;m so glad to see that they&#39;ve finally given in and added delivery services. When I called to place my order (I wanted to see if they had a few off menu items, like the beets and yogurts...yum!) the woman who I spoke with was so nice and appreciative of my order. She even called back to verify what my cross streets where, and since I didn&#39;t answer, left the sweetest voicemail apologizing for the slight delay and added in some extra beets to make up for the wait. Even with the added &#34;wait&#34;, I received my food in under 45 minutes (the delivery estimate was 45-60 minutes). So in sum, great food, great customer services... my roommate and I have found our new go to delivery joint. Thanks, Anthi!<br><br>Go to orders: Stuffed eggplant, spanakopita, beets with yogurt, greek yogurt... (and pretty much everything else).",

Plenty of parking (come after 7 for no meter parking on the street). Nice gentleman sat us down right away. Place was almost full with many people having a great time eating.<br><br>As many other reviews have stated, this is not the place you go for fancy atmosphere.<br><br>What you do come here for is possibly the best Italian food in the city.<br>The food in this place is unbelievable.<br>My friends &amp; I were amazed at how hot &amp; fresh the dishes came out from the kitchen.<br>Large menu on the wall with a good selection of dishes.<br><br>Having been recommend to this place by a friend, and reading other yelp reviews, I came prepared on what to order, and basically ordered for the whole table.<br><br>Our waiter was very nice and attentive. The whole service team was great- bread &amp; water refilled almost instantly. The chef (old man, I think his name is John?) came by and spent a minute with us to make sure we were satisfied (which omg we were)!<br><br>Now, down to the important stuff- The food.<br><br>We did a double order of baked clams- wow- unbelievable. <br>Also stuffed mushrooms and fried peppers- I&#39;m getting hungry just thinking about it.<br>Be careful- dipping the bread in the sauce of all these dishes can fill you up quick (its hard not to, the sauce/gravy of all these dishes are ridiculous).<br>Next we went on to Linguini with White Clam Sauce (1 1/2 order as recommended by the waiter, which he was right- perfect for 3 people). This may have been the best linguini with clam sauce i ever had, and my friends also claimed this was their favorite dish of the night.<br>Finally, we each had our own entree- my friends had the shrimp marinara and the seafood marinara (both right on point).<br>I went with the Veal Don Peppe- WOW- what a dish- this was by far my favorite dish of the night- crispy breaded veal cutlets, moist on the inside, so tender that the server cut them with a spoon!!! The veal cutlets are covered with a diced tomato/onion salad (bruschetta) that made this a dish to brag about. i am definitely going to be having this dish again.<br><br>Barely had room for espresso coffee.<br><br>What a great experience.<br>This is truly one of the best restaurants i have ever been to.<br>Just writing this review is driving me crazy with craving.<br>I will see you there TONIGHT!!!!<br><br>;)",

Their beans are from Stumptown, but unfortunately it seems like they&#39;ve stopped selling the beans because of lack of demand.  <br><br>I chose to go with what looked like their best seller, the café con leche. The café con leche is much more than the Spanish translation, coffee with milk. It&#39;s creamy and foamy with a pinch of butter and salt, which makes it sound kind of gross, but it&#39;s actually quite wonderful! I had a sip of my friend&#39;s Cuban espresso, and it was also really good. The consistency of the drink was creamy and it had a sweet, smoky taste. <br><br>They serve you at a window, but there&#39;s seating inside and outside. I will definitely be coming back to try the other drinks on the menu.",

Since it&#39;s a small restaurant, I like how they focus on the small details to stand out. For example, everyday they place fresh new flowers in a little glass on each table. Completely unnecessary, but I noticed it :)<br><br>The food is simply amazing. The only other Thai restaurant I like as much is Pure, but Enthaice is probably a little better in presentation and flavor, whereas Pure is all about spicy.

"reviewcomment":"Soooo fresh. I stopped by on a whim (well actually Yelpers were having a Soho Square v. Artichoke pizza contest) and grabbed a Margherita slice.  Sooo good.  It&#39;s a thinner crust but the crust is not overly charred nor was it undercooked.  It was sturdy enough to support the fresh tomato sauce, delicious mozzarella and basil on top.  At $3.95 a slice, it&#39;s not really sustainable for me to eat as a full meal because I&#39;d probably have to get two but...as a snack or special treat, I&#39;d definitely stop by here for a soho square. <br><br>On a sunny day, it&#39;s relaxing to eat slowly at the counter and stare at the pictures of famous people that have been here.  I also love that after eating my slice I didn&#39;t feel icky like a lot of other pizza places make you feel.  My mouth, brain, and stomach were all satisfied. Yay! :)",

Came here on a Wednesday night with a reservation, was promptly seated on the dot at 7:30. Upon sitting down, I stared at the immaculate setup before me....plate, chopsticks, wet napkin...it all felt so zen-like and organized, like a general getting his troops ready for war. A war on delicious sushi.<br><br>Ordered the omakase...and while I was shell shocked at the price tag (around $450 for 2 people), it was worth the price. Course after course of delicious, fresh fish kept arriving in front of me, with no visible end in sight. Just when we thought we were done, more fish kept showing up. The favorites of the night were the uni, the two types of eel, the two types of mackerel, and the fatty tuna maki roll. Everything was top notch, the service excellent, and the ambiance made me feel like for a few hours, that I was actually in Japan.<br><br>Run, sprint, fly, whatever you do, don&#39;t just walk here. Find a way to get here and experience the most delicious sushi you will ever have outside of Japan!",

"reviewcomment":"If you are what you eat,  I am a disturbing amount of hummus. So one could imagine that I set the bar pretty high for Mediterranean fare. I&#39;d heard from friends that Mahzen had some seriously great delivery, but I&#39;m not the type to seamless my life away, so I decided to grab a few friends and try this place out.<br><br>Upon first entering, things were not looking too good. No one seemed to be working, and the fire alarm was going off. Uh-oh. Hungry as funk, we stalled a few minutes to admire the awesome photography and paintings on the walls. All of a sudden, the owner Adam came out from the back, and apologized profusely. Apparently there was a scheduling snafu, and he was forced to play host, waiter, chef, and bartender while he waited for his team to show. We were nervous, but we let him seat us and figured we&#39;d give it a shot.<br><br>WOAH, WOW, YAY. Best decision we made all day.<br><br>We ordered like fiends - getting the hummus trio, spinach dip, cacik, calamari, falafel, the sigara boregi. All were delicious!<br><br>The hummus was by far the best hummus I&#39;ve ever had! <br><br>...yes, I said it. And I MEANT it. <br><br>The spinach dip was another favorite - perfectly creamy and delicous with toasted bread. The sigara boregi was amazing - it was a crispy dough filled with feta and spices. Yummmm. Adam was super friendly and nice, and even hooked us up with the zucchini pancakes fo&#39; free to apologize for the lack of staff.  Lightly fried, crispy, &amp; amazing!<br><br>The bottom line - don&#39;t just order out, head in and experience the food for yourself. You&#39;ll see me there again soon!!",

The dish was very well compiled.<br><br>Fresh Mozzarella - It was a very nice portion that they gave us. The red wine vinegar marinated portobello mushrooms had just the right amount to not over power the dish. I felt the olive oil could of <br><br>For entree my cousin and I shared the porter house for two (cooked medium) and it was close to being cook perfectly. The cut that we had I thought was good, well portioned. Cutting thru the steak was pretty easy but not like butter.<br><br>My friends got the Ribeye and T-Bone. Both of them felt like quality of the cut of meat that they had (which I tried) wasnt as good as other steakhouses. The T-Bone was seemed like the steak was cooked and left out for pickup for a while. While the steaks rested they cooked more than it should have. The ribeye was a bit tough even tho it was cooked at medium.<br><br>For sides we shared baked potato w/ butter, cream of spinach, mash potato, and sauteed mushrooms and spinach. It seems to me a lot of steakhouses tend to fall thru in this category. I didnt care too much for the sides but if i had t pick one of the few that we got was the baked potato but that&#39;s the skill in preparing a baked potato is very minimal. The others felt that sauteed mushrooms and spinach was the best choice in this case.",

"reviewcomment":"What can I say this place was just 5 stars and more. You must make a reservation and try this little sweet old Tuscan rustic style wood burning in the fireplace restaurant. Nice date night spot or even just come with good friends who love great wine and food with it. The workers were excellent and very attentive and professional but also were down to earth which was a plus! <br><br>Started off with:<br><br>Fried calamari with tiger shrimp that came with a lemon aioli dressed and a roasted pepper aioli which both were sweet but really good and just changed the whole concept of fried calamari and marinara sauce.<br>Pizetta which was so good, soft thin crust pizza with fresh mozzarella, basil and these great tomatoes on top.<br>Grilled octopus which came over a bed of nice argula salad which was grilled perfect.<br><br>Entrees: <br>Bucatini all&#39;amatriciana which was hard to pronounce but the waiter understood and it was this amazing fresh home made soft noodles with this arugula, prosciutto. and so good truffle oil I could not get enough and it was just the perfect size, I loved it, just delish!<br>Pork Tenderloin you could not go wrong with such a nice cooked portion of the best meat around to me, it was not greasy or fat as you think it was and it had cooked figs on top which just made it taste so great together, the boyfriend of course could not get enough haha! WINNER! It was really delicious and even with with mash potatoes underneath. <br><br>Dessert:<br>Nutella gelato! Which right there you should know how creamy delicious that is and I loved it.<br><br>Wine:<br>Stag&#39;s Leap Wine Cellars &#34;hands of time&#34; Napa Valley you can&#39;t go wrong with it and goes down smoothly and taste great with your entree! <br><br>The truffle oil here you will not want to stop adding it and dipping it on all your food and I just loved that roasted pepper and lemon aioli sauces too.<br><br>I will for sure be back to this pretty little place in the heart of Brooklyn and check out there BRUNCH menu which i hear is AYCD!! That right there is my kind of appetite ! From the pictures the food looks so delicious and I would love to have it all just in one bite! <br><br>We shall meet again my little truffle oil fantastico restaurant !",

"reviewcomment":"Oh how terribly cute and French this place is. I have now been here multiple times.  Everyone there really known their wines, and will take the time to work with you to find the perfect selection.  I am a particular fan of their wine flights- it gives me a chance to taste a handful of things before I settle on my final glass.  The bread is excellent- I always swear I wont have any until I eat the whole basket. I do recommend the cheese platters. I think it is not uncommon to see people who are actually from France frequenting the place, which only makes it better.

"reviewcomment":"Today&#39;s my first time being here. I&#39;m not sure how long this place has been here. But the service is very friendly &amp; welcoming. I was taken care by a lovely young lady.<br><br>This place can hold up to 22 people. There are 5 tables with 4 chairs each. Plus one small table with just two chairs.<br><br>In terms of the food, I ordered the white clam sauce pasta and salad pizza, which came up to $11.20. It took 15 minutes for it to be made, which is fine since I&#39;m very patience. Heads up for those who aren&#39;t, you may want to call in advance. <br><br>The food was delicious and if I&#39;m ever in the neighborhood again, I would consider coming back.",

"reviewcomment":"Wow! Although I am about 90% vegetarian, I LOVE red meat; especially after visiting Fernandes. Humans were made to eat raw meat and this restaurant was made for humans. The rodizio is incredible! The ambiance is perfect, the sangria was very good. The only drawback is their no doggie bag policy for the rodizio :-(  But I understand why they do it. I wanted to take half a bull home!!!!  <br><br>Personally, I was very happy and satisfied. However, one member of my party (who is both part Spanish and Portuguese) was very disappointed with the paella. I tend to agree on that point. The rice did look soppy and all the vegetables and seafood looked way, way, way overcooked. I was very happy with my meal, so when my friend offered me a piece of lobster I politely said &#34;no gracias.&#34; He is not one to complain, so I&#39;m doing it on his behalf. Stick to rodizio, Mr. Fernandes! Or learn how to not overcook seafood! :-) Great restaurant overall!  It was worth the trip from the city. I will definitely be back.",
