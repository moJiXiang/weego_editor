"reviewcomment":"Ippudo is its name; ramen is its game. <br><br>And ramen it does quite well indeed. We lucked out to get the last seats before the line was out the door. Was tempted to get the salmon ikura rice (because the picture looked good... rookie mistake I know) but was quickly corrected by my friend that I should get ramen so ramen I got. Ordering the Akamaru Shinaji, I enjoyed their take on &#34;modern ramen&#34; because it originates with the traditional tonkotsu broth but adds elements like garlic oil, black fungus, and a special miso paste. The broth is wonderfully rich and flavorful and the noodles had great spring-back texture too. Paired with a tall glass of beer, I was a happy camper. <br><br>Despite being a busy eatery, the staff are still really attentive as they churn out bowl after bowl of ramen to hungry patrons. Afore mentioned line did grow but the wait isn&#39;t that bad so don&#39;t let that stop you from trying Ippudo.",

Kampong Bahru Road seems to be the area to go with a couple of good coffee shops, at least according to Yelp&#39;s reviews. <br><br>There was no lines when we arrived around 10:30 am and got seated right away.

The baby marsh mellow served on the side was just too cute. She also enjoyed her Apricot muffin ($4.50) which was moist and loaded with the fresh fruit.<br><br>Too bad Ryan is not in the house, it would have been fun to see him in action. <br><br>Strangers&#39; Reunion has this rustic European vibe.

"reviewcomment":"The baristas&#39; skill at creating elaborate designs out of milk foam is testament to how seriously the owner of Patisserie G takes her craft. Ms Gwen Lim identifies her target consumers as &#34;a niche group of people who understand French pastry and are discerning about good-quality French products&#34;, namely the &#34;well-travelled&#34; Singaporean. Mm not the humblest way to plug her pâtisserie, but must say she really knows how to appeal to the yuppie psyche.<br><br>Lemon Cheesecake, $9.00 - One forkful of the cheesecake should be enough to convince you that these cakes are worth good money. The filling is zesty and creamy without being too heavy on the palate, and flecked with crushed vanilla beans. The biscuit crust is actually crispy (!!) and tastes slightly singed, but went pretty well with the citrus filling and the strip of candied lemon peel. There&#39;s this thin gelatinous cover on the cake which I find odd, but its mostly tasteless and adds glossiness to the cake so meh, I&#39;ll live with it.<br><br>Triomphe, $8.50 - Named after a historical monument, the Triomphe sported a lustrous toffee-brown coat that made it resemble a giant piece of Werther&#39;s candy. This baby was calling out my name so I decided I had to eat him. The caramel mousse was malty, ever-so-slightly burnt and, to sum it up: just divine. Within the cake there are a couple layers of soft hazelnut sponge, but the mousse was the friggin&#39; star of the show. If it were up to me, I&#39;d add a praline base or something crunchy at the bottom to provide some contrast in texture, but I&#39;m sure the chef is better than I am at knowing which ingredients go together. In any case, the magical mousse is reason enough to justify repeated visits to Patisserie G.<br><br>Flat White, $5.50 - The coffee selection here is proof that Patisserie G isn&#39;t going to bend over backwards for pedestrian crowds. Our respective requests for a mocha and a skinny latte were met with an apologetic &#34;We don&#39;t do those here.&#34; from the waitress taking our orders at the counter. Embarrassed by my wimpyness, I manned up and got a flat white. <br><br>Patisserie G gets its blends from artisan roasters Liberty Coffee (specifically the Speakeasy brew), which should please coffee aficionados. My flat white was nutty and robust.<br><br>I watched in slack-jawed wonder as one of the baristas artfully crafted the smiling face of a bear on another customer&#39;s latte, then scowled in displeasure at the very unelaborate heart on the surface of my flat white. I&#39;ll be back, and I&#39;ll be sure to request for a bear on my coffee.",

"reviewcomment":"When you live abroad and are away from family, being able to conveniently place online orders for cakes and have them delivered on special occasions like Mother&#39;s Day, Father&#39;s Day, and birthdays is a godsend.<br><br>In comes, The Patissier. I&#39;ve ordered cakes from this place 3 times now for my in-laws in Singapore with a different cake flavor each time from their website- Pistachio Symphony, Jade Mirror and the Father&#39;s Day special Majesty. For each order, my in-laws commented on how delicious the cakes were. My MIL told me that when she first cut into the Jade Mirror, she had cut an additional slice for her husband but because it was so good, she ended up eating the second slice by herself. When they&#39;re happy, my husband and I are happy. <br><br>In addition to that, what impresses me most is the customer service of The Patissier. On two separate occasions, I needed the cake to be delivered before the earliest date that could be delivered as stated on the website when I was completing the online purchase. After I completed the order online, I emailed The Patissier to asked if it was possible to have the cake delivered before the earliest date given on their website. They gladly agreed to it with no additional fee. <br><br>I look forward to ordering more cakes from The Patissier!",

Which is why each bun you pick up is bound to be a little warm, a little crispy, and very good. I&#39;m a huge fan of their garlic bread, as long as you&#39;re not going for an interview after that. Well, it isn&#39;t that garlicky, just that I get fairly conscious about it.

During that time I could even queue to buy the Lao Ban beancurd just next door.

We lined up for about 10 minutes which irked me a bit. But the person I was with promised me it was worth it. Perhaps the line wasn&#39;t such a bad thing because I couldn&#39;t decide what flavor I wanted. And I am not a indecisive person - it is just that ALL of the flavors looked amazing. <br><br>The vibe of the shop was super fun. Loud dance music and the servers were dancing, throwing up ice cream in the air and throwing it into cups. FUN! <br><br>I ordered the dark chocolate ice cream with oreos, peanut butter and peanuts.

As they baked in batches to allow the bread to taste its best (given the high humidity level in Singapore, the crust gets softened pretty fast), luck plays a big part in determining if I manage to bring one home today. It was far better than striking lottery, to me.<br><br>Today, I am not in my lady luck - I missed the batch of croissants. The fella who has gotten the last piece, must be gloating now. Not feeling worst, I have still have other consolations to pick from.<br><br>Recalling what I had on my last two visits, I chose an array of sweet bread which tasted almost new to me.<br><br>Pain Aux Pommes - The bun had a very faint sweetness arising from the honey. Its shell was undeniably crusty with a chewy dough. It was visibly filled with large apple chunks, stodgy and a tad sour. The walnut adds a good nutty flavor to the rustic bun.<br><br>The Orange - Not sure if I read the tag correctly at the counter, &#34;earl grey with orange peels&#34;. I sniffed none of the earl grey scent but the bread was baked using dark rye flour - nutty and doughy. I have always been attracted to chewy European-styled bread; this was the show stopper among all, which I bagged today. Generous amount of orange peels were seen everywhere, candied but still contained its natural citrus flavor. Marvelous!<br><br>Pain Aux Yuzu - Didn&#39;t know that I had this yuzu bun until I read my previous blog! So this was my second attempt? And it had the same consistency! I adored the crumble yet the center was soft. The sweetness in the dough was prominent but natural. The yuzu peels were seen scattered evenly which gave a good lemony taste. I am still loving it.",

"reviewcomment":"Outram Park in Singapore has become a mini coffee hub recently, with at least 4 cafes (Nylon, Highlander, Oriole and Strangers Reunion) serving artisan coffee. Highlander was one of the first (if not the first) third wave cafes to open in Singapore, and is still roasting and serving interesting blends of coffee on Kampong Bahru road.<br><br>The espresso shot that I ordered came with a light brown crema, and the volume was spot on - a good single shot should not fill up an espresso mug. It had a interesting acidic taste - not tart, but the right amount of bitterness. The biscotti which come with all coffees in Highlander are sweet, and balance out the acidity.<br><br>The house blend in Highlander is a combination of beans from Brazil, Ethiopia and Sumatra, which is a good combination for lattes, cappuccinos etc. The stronger, lasting aftertaste ensures that there is still a definite taste of coffee, and that the steamed milk does not mask any flavour. Highlander house blend uses a specific ratio of beans from these different countries to ensure a very specific taste. <br><br>There is a retails space also, with coffee accessories available, such as grinders, filters, aeropresses and vacumn packs to store ground beans. Pricing is good - consistent with other cafes, beans are slightly cheaper. well worth visiting for well executed coffees and some very good shots.",

"reviewcomment":"It must have been years since I last visited Katong Shopping Centre, and when I did I had to try what is arguably one of the top few chicken rice stalls in Singapore.<br>The price of the chicken rice here is slightly above average but the queue is still very long, so there must be something that they&#39;re doing right.<br>Anyway, I managed to get my chicken rice after a bit of queuing, and suffice to say that I was indeed blown away by the chicken rice here. The rice here is really smooth and fragrant, and the chicken is oh so tender. I ordered the roast chicken and the skin was very flavorful. Another thing was that the serving size here also seemed to be larger than at other places (in terms of the quantity of meat and the rice), so perhaps this is to compensate for their slightly higher prices. The chili complemented the chicken perfectly as well.<br>Overall, I would definitely rate the chicken rice here among the top 5 in Singapore.",

"reviewcomment":"I&#39;d probably say this is one of the better &#39;European&#39; dining I&#39;ve had in Singapore.. the menu largely consists of small plates (good for sharing between four) and about 6-8 main dishes to share from. We mainly stuck to the shared plates and budgeted about 1.5 plates per person. <br><br>The great dishes? <br>The chilli and prawn pizza - great base and  good hit of spice<br>The tuna tartar (although no taste of wasabi that was promised on the menu...)<br>The portabello mushrooms - fresh and tasty<br>The squid ink rice with squid and prawns - liked the egg yolk on top, nice touch<br>The salt and pepper squid - not as peppery as i&#39;d like but plenty of squid<br><br>So-so?<br>Ceviche (I&#39;ve had some pretty good ceviche in my time and felt this was lacking in flavour and spice)<br>The gyoza (kinda felt like it was a fried pancake with gyoza hidden at the bottom... didn&#39;t do it for me)<br>Quinoa salad... just meh. <br><br>Very limited beer menu (2 choices) and desserts, boo. The lava cake with icream is tasty and good value, but don&#39;t do the apple and carrot icecream as one of our fellow diners did... feels like you&#39;re detoxing at dessert. <br><br>Felt like the restaurant has good ambience and although it feels like it&#39;s in the middle of nowhere, it&#39;s actually very close to bugis. The view is nicer as it gets dark so you only have the view of lights on water rather than a drain and a dirty river! Alfresco style on the 2nd floor but doesn&#39;t get hot with the river breeze and fans keeping the humidit at bay. <br><br>Service is really efficient and helpful without being overbearing. They were able to split the bill three ways which I appreciate. We spent $55 per person and were well stuffed by the end of it. <br><br>The most similar restaurant I&#39;ve been to is Artichoke for its tapas-share style menu and I felt this restaurant was MUCH better than artichoke (despite the more limited wine and dessert menu!). <br><br>I would definitely go back with friends. <br><br>Recommend.",

In fact, I would go so far to say that this humble place is one of my favorites in Singapore. <br><br>I usually get the egg and onion prata and a lime juice. <br><br>Special mention goes to the lime juice here. It&#39;s real calamansi limes, sugar, ice and water. It&#39;s not that fake neon stuff common in Singapore now that burns your throat going down, it&#39;s the real deal. (Please, don&#39;t ever change it guys.)<br><br>I guess I should also mention this isn&#39;t healthy food. But it is real food. A couple times a year won&#39;t kill you. It&#39;s also a great place to bring out of towners for an authentic Singapore meal away from the CBD. Unless they&#39;re snobs they&#39;ll probably dig it.",

The Durian Ice-Cream I had was rich in flavor and the ice-cream does not melt as fast compared to other ice-cream outlets. <br><br>I recommend the $5.80 Special of Ice-Cream with Waffles. The waffles are fragrant and the taste is just nice to go with any ice-cream, they are not too bland and not too sweet. The chocolate syrup complements the Waffles very well. <br><br>If you are looking for a place to hang out and chill out after a Hard Day&#39;s Work or Long School Day, this is the place just for you.",

And even then it was a sporadic affair, I could probably count on one hand how many times I tried Hainanese curry rice before I found out about this place. <br><br>I was totally blown away with the curry rice at this stall. The crispy pork chop was to die for. I probably like it heaps as it was so crispy I could not taste any meat at all. Hah. <br><br>The must have on my list<br>- crispy pork chop<br>- sunny side up egg (drizzled with dark soya sauce)<br>- chap chye (braised cabbage)<br><br>Extras:<br>- meat patty (no porky smell/taste)<br>- deep fried prawns<br>- squid (some has egg or something in it)<br>- long beans<br><br>And if you love gravy on your rice, I would recommend not to order in dishes but have the dishes on your rice itself, plus the 3 gravies (curry, chap chye and lor) poured over the rice.<br><br>Somehow when you have the dishes on separate plates, it just does not taste as good. Maybe because of the additional sauce?<br><br>The rice portion is quite big for takeaway, so you could probably do 2 meals in it. And you could also do a fried rice with the leftovers. Delicious!<br><br>This is one stall I will actually travel to just to satisfy my Hainanese curry rice craving.

From $1 for a glass of beancurd drink to $3.80 for their XXL fried chicken, it&#39;s definitely an affordable dessert/snack place for you to pop by and chill with your friends. <br><br>However do take note to sit outside as inside can get quite stuffy sometimes. But then again, what you pay for ($1.80 for cold beancurd with pearls ) is what you get so no complaints there with the ambiance. Their beancurd are always a welcome dessert whenever I am in the area as it&#39;s silky smooth and sweet.. just the way I like it... the pearls is always something I like to throw in so I can chew on something. Seating always seems to be enough regardless of how crowded the shop looks.. I don&#39;t know how they do it but always there&#39;s enough space for everyone.

And so far I don&#39;t think it&#39;s to my taste. <br><br>The roast just seems too light to me. If the coffee isn&#39;t coming through the milk strongly in a double shot piccolo latte then there&#39;s basically no point serving it in a milk beverage. Maybe my palate is that messed up from years of smoking but unfortunately it&#39;s the only palate I have.<br><br>Otherwise I&#39;m a fan of Flock, primarily for its quaint neighbourhood vibe and friendly service. As other reviewers have noted, staff are Singaporean (as opposed to 40 Hands) and while I have no problem with Filipino service, I do appreciate an outlet that will pay more for inexperienced locals who actually care about what they&#39;re doing. The staff at 40 Hands have never seemed particularly interested to me.<br><br>The proprietor seemed like a very nice lady who cared enough to serve &amp; speak to customers with a smile. And again, unlike 40 Hands, there was no smug &#39;we-are-so-successful&#39; vibe about the place. Plus I hate the 40 Hands coffee so this is a step up.<br><br>While I like their famous pork cheek, it usually feels a bit too heavy for me to take as a first meal of the day. I plump for the prawn &amp; avocado sandwich. I am particularly amused by the Turkish bread they use because it makes me feel like I&#39;m in Melbourne circa 2002. Remember when Turkish bread was a thing, guys?",

I have definitely come here for a peaceful solitary lunch on more than a few occasions. My favorite is the sausages with caramelized onions on crispy ciabatta bread. Its delicious. I always get the half sandwich because the portion is huge. My mother is a fan of their chocolate cakes.",

"reviewcomment":"Believe it or not, there is a coffee culture in Singapore. That, or I have a strange ability to befriend people and find a job where people are obsessed about their coffee... And it&#39;s creeping up on me too, damnit!<br><br>I&#39;ve heard so many things about this place and I was always curious to try it out. One day, after a nice lunch around Keong Saik Road, my colleagues asked if I wanted some coffee. They probably mentioned where we were going, but I pulled a Barney Stinson and kind of zoned out. Once we approached this HDB flat, I was thinking, &#34;Where the hell are we going??&#34; And then we landed at Nylon. And I was like, OH.<br><br>If I recall correctly, Nylon&#39;s story goes a little something like this: they started out as a roaster and distributed coffee to different shops. Then they decided to open their shop to people and start serving coffee. And every now and then they&#39;ll shut the shop down for an uncertain amount of time to travel to places, find and buy coffee beans, then roast them in Singapore.<br><br>So when you come in, order, and see them do cool things like weigh grinds for each drink, you know that your cuppa&#39;s gonna be a good one. And most recently, they bought the space next door to them, so now they opened it up and added a long table for you to enjoy your that cuppa even more! The prices put Starbucks to shame.

"reviewcomment":"It&#39;s been awhile since my last visit to Flor Patisserie but that doesn&#39;t mean I can&#39;t write a review about it based on my previous few trips and unique experiences. <br><br>Let&#39;s start with the food, or in this case, pastries. <br><br>Cakes! Tarts! Cookies! This place is a haven for all with a sweet tooth. Not only will you be able to satisfy your dessert craving here (minus ice-cream though, you&#39;ll have to go to a Cold Stone or a 7-11 for that), you&#39;ll be getting your money&#39;s worth for the quality of each heavenly delight you put into your mouth. Why? Simple, if you&#39;ve been to Japan, you&#39;ll know that their pastries are to die for and lo and behold! Flor Patisserie is a Japanese-styled patisserie serving authentic Japanese inspired French pastry and that&#39;s a mathematical combination that every living, breathing person would know the answer to. <br><br>Personal favourites for me would be the Earl Grey Choco ($6.95), Marron Pie ($4.50), Madeleine ($2.15/pc, any flavour) &amp; of course, Flor&#39;s signature Ice Cheese Tarts ($3.40/pc, 9 flavours to choose from -  for all cheese lovers, its frozen cheese on a tart, heaven! )<br><br>According to the description on the website, the Earl Grey Choco is a &#34;Delicate earl grey cream piped onto swiss roll of dark chocolate meringue and sweet banana&#34; - it&#39;s pretty much that except this written description doesn&#39;t exactly give you the idea of how soft and airy the texture is, despite having a meringue casing around it. The Earl Grey cream is not too rich which makes it easier to go with the candied bananas. I actually raved about this one slice so much that my friends got me a whole roll for my birthday one of the years, much to my delight - we should all embrace getting a year older with some good cake! <br><br>The Marron Pie (it&#39;s muffin sized)  was an interesting surprise for me personally. I&#39;m not much of a chestnut fan so when I first discovered that there was a chestnut in the heart of this, I pretty much passed on the idea. But my friend, who introduced the place to me, kept raving about it and described how she would savour this (nibbling on it for hours apparently), I thought I&#39;d give it a go and if i didn&#39;t like it, my late-mother was a fan of chestnuts so she could have it. Unfortunately for her, it never made it home. <br>&#34;&#34;Description: Buttery fragrant almond cream baked in crunchy puff pastry cup with sweetened japanese chestnut center.&#34; Damn right, it&#39;s as tasty as that! But don&#39;t let the word &#39;buttery&#39; fool ya, it&#39;s not overwhelming, unlike some other baked goods I&#39;ve tried. Instead, the butter is more like a coat over the crunchiness of the puff pastry and the almond cream which combined together, does a good number on your taste buds, that just leaves you yearning for more. Not fantastic for the waistline because this thing is HUGE but if you have a little fat girl inside you somewhere, you should be nice and treat her to a something every now and then &amp; I highly recommend this to be it. <br><br>Madeleine. This brings me to my unique experience as well but first,  these are not at all dry and the chocolate ones are moist, almost similar to a brownie or a chocolate lava cake minus the lava. Back to the story, at one point,  they were selling the Madeleines in the shape of bears, individually wrapped which was adorable and so, I decided to buy some back. That same evening, I discovered mold on one of the bear&#39;s ear and decided to let them know about it. I wasn&#39;t expecting anything but I just thought I&#39;d let them know of my find. I called the very next day and to my surprise, I got a tonne of sincerely apologetic replies back, it almost made me feel bad for making the call. They offered to give me something for free on my next visit but I wasn&#39;t gonna be going back anytime within that week so I just left it. On my next visit however, the Madeleines were back to being the shell shaped ones and so I briefly mentioned the bears and that I found mold on one of them once. THAT immediately sparked an wave of acknowledgment around the room and after discussing amongst themselves, the lady serving me apologized and gave me another Madeleine free to make up for it, shortly after, the chef himself came out from the kitchen to apologize and explained that it was an error on their part for not sealing the packaging properly, resulting in the air to enter the pack and thus, mold. I thought that that was VERY professional of them to acknowledge this and to even have the chef himself come out personally. Needless to say, as with all Japanese service staff, everyone (including the chef), saw me out of the cafe before resuming their respective duties. <br><br>Like I said, it has been awhile since I&#39;ve been back there &amp; i do believe the prices have increased a little. However, after writing about it and reliving all these amazing  memories about the pastries and the place, I&#39;m pretty sure i&#39;ll be back there soon, this time with a good book, to chill, enjoy some cake, have a good cuppa tea......and then hit the gym after.",

"reviewcomment":"OK, as far as the roast quality and barista-ship goes, I&#39;m a fan of Papa Palheta. I think the coffee here is probably the best in Singapore. That&#39;s where it ends for Chye Seng Huat however. I get that it&#39;s trendy &amp; cool, with the pseudo-industrial layout and the name that harks back to Singapore&#39;s roots. I&#39;m down with all that. But the place on weekends is a madhouse. <br><br>No table service means long queues to order coffee. I&#39;ve sometimes had to wait 15 minutes in queue just to get an order in. Hell if they were serving $1 kopitiam stuff I&#39;d probably be fine with that but considering the prices here, a bit of table service wouldn&#39;t be too much to ask. But if people are willing to queue then table service would probably be bad business.<br><br>Similarly, I assume, comfortable seating with ample space would be bad business. Why give people space &amp; comfort when you can pack them in &amp; contort them like sardines? Turn those covers! Good business, Papa. Good business.<br><br>Related side-note: I once saw two rather portly gentlemen and one very large lady try to squeeze themselves onto their bar-stools. It was... uncomfortable to watch. I actually had to look away.<br><br>I&#39;m also not a huge fan of the food, which is 90% misses with very few hits. I frequent this joint reasonably often as it&#39;s near where I live. On my last visit I ordered a benedict. The eggs were overcooked and the ham... my God the ham. It was that radioactive pink colour. I&#39;m not even sure that it was technically &#34;ham&#34;. Well maybe technically but it sure didn&#39;t taste like it.<br><br>So what&#39;s a four star rating doing accompanying a review that sounds this bad? The coffee is that good, guys.",

So off they went to Beach Road Prawn Noodle House. And that never ends well... for my wallet.<br><br>As the name suggests, they are specialists, and their prawn broth is SO ROCKSTAR. I always get the dry noodles with pork ribs - I feel the noodles don&#39;t get as soggy and soup-laden (not that it&#39;s a bad thing), and I get to drink the soup separately, apart from the chili and what nots that find their way into the bowl.<br><br>My only beef (okay not beef, but you get it) is that prices have gone UP. Now this is how it looks:<br>small - $5.80<br>medium - $8.80<br>large - $10.80<br><br>I understand prawns and pork ribs aren&#39;t cheap... but this is pretty mad.

"reviewcomment":"Chai Ho is another example of why Singaporeans can be justifiably proud of our hawker culture.  This is a family business.  This business only deals with a single product (ok...maybe two if you consider that they also sell bak kwa and meat floss).  The legendary lines in front of Chai Ho are certainly there because of the satay, which is what this review will be about.  For the time that they&#39;ve been Chai Ho and have been a business, they&#39;ve had time to tweak their product till you get what you get today.  Honestly, it hasn&#39;t changed much, the quality and the taste of Chai Ho satay has remained essentially unchanged.  It was good then, it is good now and if they continue to run things, will continue to be good.  Like all successful family hawker businesses that form the foundation of Singapore food, they know not to screw with the recipe, with what works.  The enemy of good after all is better.  It&#39;s when a cook gets a faraway look and the worm of an idea starts to sow its corruption, that good, solid, respectable food becomes so much merde.  <br><br>Chai Ho is an institution because they understand the process and are confident enough in their product not to change what works and what&#39;s been bringing those lines back day after day after day.  <br><br>I recommend the chicken satay, my favorite, and which usually runs out first.  The pork would be my next choice and if hungover, likely my first choice because as other reviewers have alluded to, there is belly fat...ohhh so good for a hangover.  The peanut sauce is thick and clingy, just the way I like it.  You can power it up by adding a dollop of Skippy Chunky Peanut Butter and stirring it into the hot peanut sauce.  I do this occasionally when I get Chai Ho to go.  Guests are always wondering how the peanut sauce gets so rich??!",

"reviewcomment":"Stepped out for a morning coffee run, and ended up with prawn mee with pork ribs. Can&#39;t explain how it happens, but you know me... and you know Singapore. There&#39;s always something awesome around the corner.<br><br>So I meant to grab a coffee with some folks at Penny University, but our friends who&#39;d got there before us decided that hunger pangs needed to be dealt with first. So off they went to Beach Road Prawn Noodle House. And that never ends well... for my wallet.<br><br>As the name suggests, they are specialists, and their prawn broth is SO ROCKSTAR. I always get the dry noodles with pork ribs - I feel the noodles don&#39;t get as soggy and soup-laden (not that it&#39;s a bad thing), and I get to drink the soup separately, apart from the chili and what nots that find their way into the bowl.<br><br>My only beef (okay not beef, but you get it) is that prices have gone UP. Now this is how it looks:<br>small - $5.80<br>medium - $8.80<br>large - $10.80<br><br>I understand prawns and pork ribs aren&#39;t cheap... but this is pretty mad. So do your wallet, and your cholesterol level a favour, and ration out your visits. After all, the worst thing you could do to yourself is get sick of great food.",

We were speaking to Ms. Oon&#39;s son, and his grandfather asked where the best spot for beef kway teow is nowadays. We were recommended here, and since it&#39;s not too far from our place, we decided to check it out.<br><br>My husband walked up to the stall, and I believe the conversation went something like this:<br><br>Hubby: &#34;Do you have a menu?&#34;<br>Employee: &#34;Nope.&#34;<br>Hubby: &#34;Alright, we&#39;ll just have beef kway teow.&#34;<br>Employee: &#34;Would you like vegetables or fried chicken?&#34;<br><br>Luckily my husband chose the CORRECT choice, which would be fried chicken.

God damn...&#34; Did you see my pictures? Beautiful chicken that was fried perfectly, putting KFC to shame.

I wanted to take the leftovers home, but there were none by the time we were done!<br><br>Awesome meal for $16.

When I dine here with the Manfriend, here are the things I typically order,<br><br>1. Pandan Chicken<br>2. Green Curry<br>3. Pad Thai<br>4. Tom Yum Soup<br>5. Pineapple Fried Rice<br>6. BBQ Salted Sea Bass<br>7. Shrimp Paste Kang Kong<br><br>I think that&#39;s all? The total bill is usually around $60 so I feel like I&#39;m missing one or two dishes..HMMMMMM.....<br><br>Hey, we&#39;re pigs. And, we&#39;re NOT ashamed! Okay..maybe a little bit? Nah...!",

"reviewcomment":"1. cheese toasties <br>- poached eggs &amp; marmite <br>- the poach egges were perfect! the soughdough was awesome too! toasted to perfection. <br>- the cheese (not sure what type they used) were unfortunately it was way too salty for me :( <br><br>2. turkish eggs<br>- 2 poach eggs with whipped yogurt &amp; hot chili butter served with soughdough<br>- interesting dish but probably would not order again. it tasted like a spicy sour cream dip with poached eggs. interesting, edible but not my favorite thing. (even though the staff recommend this. hm.) maybe I am not a turkish breakfast person. just a simple american breakfast person. <br><br>3. cafe latte (7 ounce, double shot) <br>- strong! <br>- we initially asked for an extra shot because the staff told us 7 ounce will be &#34;diluted with milk&#34; and we wanted to start the day with a good coffee. I guess 2 shot was overkill? the kind of bitter only diehard coffee lovers can love. I am more a mainstream coffee person. <br><br>4. smore tart <br>- THE BEST!!! seriously, based on this item alone the place is worth a visit. the chocolate melts in your mouth! <br><br>Total: $27<br><br>Ambiance: nice vintage coffee joint :) great selection of magazines and books to read too (which is the perfect place to catchup on some reading on a lazy afternoon or during the late evenings when there aren&#39;t too many people. mornings tend to get crowded.) <br><br>Cons: <br>(which could have, but did not, make me give them 3 star. i believe in this place!!! it&#39;s definitely a raising start despite a few initial shortcomings... :) <br>- cash payment only. <br>- limited selection of brunch food (basically toast and eggs? both of which they do very well but I need something more substantial to start the day) I heard they are working on more dishes soon? can&#39;t wait to see what&#39;s installed. if it&#39;s anything like their perfect poached eggs and sourdough toast then it could potentially be a 5 star joint!",

"reviewcomment":"Stepping into the historic kopi tiam, you see people from all ages and all sorts of attire, drinking kopi, playing iPhone while waiting for the kaya toast to be served.<br>I must have forgotten about the crowd as I came here on one of the busiest day-National Day.<br><br>Don&#39;t be alarm if the auntie ignores you. Just be on an eagle-eye to catch the next empty table. We managed to squeeze into a corner table, stuffy but at least that saves up the extra charges for air-con.<br><br> &#34;自己拿啊、自己拿啊＂,chirped the Hainanese old auntie, who left after clearing the bowls from earlier visitors. &#34;Wah! So good ar! &#34; What if anyone take extra and not pay?&#34; Well, this boils down to trust and honesty, I guessed. Grab a plate and pick your own pastries. No need to wait for the aunties to come......just start feeding yourself because the drinks, eggs and toasts take time to cook.<br><br>Each pastry on display sits on a paper lining, which the auntie did not even bother to count after everything. We had 6 pieces at first; 4 egg tarts, 1 plain and 1 almond cupcake. <br><br>And ooh...these egg tarts are SUPER delicious. I have been deceived Nth times by numerous tasty-looking egg tarts which ended up with pliable tarts. But not this time. The dark brown shell is thicker-than-usual, but crumbly and fragrant.<br><br>Call them cupcakes but do not compare them with those popular cupcakes on the street nowadays. Not moist, greasy nor very sweet. You might find it dry but these are how they should be.<br><br>Being just fresh out of the oven, I popped one carelessly into my mouth, forgetting that they are meant to be shared.  Every now and then, a fresh tray of baked items out from the kitchen draws me to see what&#39;s out there. Though they were not the golden cream horns and custard puff, I took another 2 cupcakes with chocolate icing.<br><br>The much awaited open faced toast buns ($1 each) were spread with green kaya. I did mention previously that my family usually prefer brown to green, but this is an exception. The kaya spread was aromatic and sweet, but just nice. Nonetheless, I would prefer thin-sliced kaya toasts.  There was no need for the butter knife to spread the butter evenly. Just slam the other side down and chow through the lukewarm bun like a burger.<br><br> Kopi? Milo? Or Teh? We had all of them. Though their beans are roasted traditionally in their kitchen, the coffee was diluted. The milo was not spared too.   You won&#39;t have time to laze around and chill out with your friends compared to many hipster cafes (be prepared to receive glares by people who are queuing.... some people were hogging tables while playing iphones after their meal) <br><br>I enjoy it this no frills kopitiam. <br>Chop chop.

"reviewcomment":"I like the passion of the person of who served me, it was pretty infectious and you could really feel the energy emanating from him. I am not sure if he is the owner or just an employee, but it does not matter. Everyone should have a passion for what they do. Because of him and his zeal for the food, I actually bought more than I initially wanted.<br><br>I went in wanting to buy the gula melaka kaya jam. I love kaya and gula melaka, combine them together and it seemed like heaven. It does taste very nice too, a softer sweetness from the gula melaka. <br><br>The cakes caught my attention and I decided to have a slice of cake with coffee. Again, the guy was so into his stuff that he paired my drink with the cake. Latte with hokkaido roll (green tea with red bean flavor). The cake was light and not very sweet but it was enough to complement the smoothness of the latte which was not too acidic. I usually doctored my coffee liberally with milk and sugar. He told me to try it without any sugar, and it was fine. <br><br>I also bought a tiramisu to go. That was very rich and creamy. <br><br>The place is small with just a couple of small tables. Definitely not a place for big groups of people to chill, but it is cozy enough for 1 or 2 persons for a cuppa and slice of cake. <br><br>I would love to try the sandwiches and sourdough bread and the signature cake - Chocolate Trovana which needs advance order. <br><br>If the location is more convenient to me, I think I will be a regular at Chef Icon. <br><br>Yelp Feb 2014 Challenge: 26/28",

"reviewcomment":"I had always heard Salad Stop was a great place for well..salads but I&#39;d never had a chance to go there myself until this week.<br><br>Everything sounded so delicious, and I knew I didn&#39;t want to go with the standard Hail Caesar since there were so many other innovative choices. I decided on the Oh Crab Lah! on a whole meal wrap which lured me with its Singapore Chili Crab Dressing. Not as spicy as I had hoped for but so flavourful and yummy! The wrap was massive and extremely filling. I didn&#39;t feel like I was eating just lettuce which tends to happen in poorly made Salads &amp; Wraps. They did an excellent job of tossing the ingredients together and making sure there was enough of everything.<br><br>This outlet at Suntec is on the smaller side, and they&#39;ve really packed in as many tables as physically possible. There is always a line out the door but it does move quite quickly. Recommended for a healthy, grab and go lunch on a busy work day!",

Stocked with brewing kits and standard ingredients such as yeast, sugars, and hops/malt for newbies, amateurs, and so-called-home-brewing-professionals alike, iBrew is part of a small and rare group that provides access to one of civilization&#39;s oldest - and in my humble opinion, the best - hobbies of all time. (I did a quick search and found only two other places in Singapore that carry such awesome toys.)<br><br>Of course, I took the opportunity to chat up owner Raymond Lee and got to know more about his passion, services, and products. I also asked if he had his own craft beers on sale, which I would have bought without hesitation (as most individuals I&#39;ve come across in the US who sell these kits usually brew and make exceptional beers for a quarter the price). I was definitely bummed to hear that Singapore doesn&#39;t allow that practice (though for good reasons I&#39;m sure).<br><br>Most of the home brewers I know in the US consist primarily of enthusiasts and a few *broke* beer &#34;keg-swallow-ers&#34; since beer on average is ridiculously cheap (for example, US$5 - 6 for a pint of good American *craft* beer at a restaurant). Yet, I&#39;m surprised to find out from Raymond that home brewing isn&#39;t popular in Singapore. Come on...with beer prices here 2-3 times more than the US on average (and a killer jump in hard liquors)...why wouldn&#39;t anyone want to brew their own almighty keg of sweet juice?<br><br>I don&#39;t know but I&#39;m definitely looking forward to getting a kit and have a craft-brewtastic-2013!<br><br>Happy New Year to ALL!<br><br>Yelp 100: 1/100",

As fellow reviewer Mark D. said, it&#39;s quite pristine! The store is a well lit, organized meat heaven. When you walk in, you are greeted with a ton of beef, chicken, and pork to choose from- steaks, sausages, burger patties, you name it. I also like how the employees who work the counters are always attentive and willing to help. I&#39;ve bought their Australian steaks twice and enjoyed them both times. <br><br>Outside of the meat, the rest of the store caters to Western tastes. They have a small section for veggies/herbs, a decent selection of cheese, along with bottled beers and other condiments. <br><br>The bistro is outside, so al fresco dining is your only option. My husband and I ordered their burger with gruyere and caramelized onions. To be honest, we thought it was just okay. We actually think Go-Go Bambini (also in Dempsey) has the better burger. <br><br>If you feel you&#39;ve eaten some &#34;misteaks&#34; in Singapore, then stop by here; you won&#39;t be disappointed! :)",

"reviewcomment":"I live close by so I come here often. A little too often... <br><br>For such high quality fresh fish, the prices are very reasonable. Don&#39;t get me wrong though -  if you want to spend a lot, that&#39;s easily accomplished here too.  <br><br>The general concept of the restaurant is omakase style - the chef&#39;s recommendations are presented in this glorious case in front of the restaurant tucked in the back of a Japanese mart.  I get so excited walking in and picking out exactly what I want to eat. The selection varies day to day (as it should) and they will have all sorts of things on display: uni, ankimo, tai, miso marinated salmon, fresh horseradish, yellowtail jaw, tako, etc.   If you like your fish sliced on the thinner side, like me, be sure to let your server know. Like it thicker? Tell your server. It&#39;s your call.  You can of course order any sort of regular Japanese fare a la carte.  <br><br>Highly Recommend: <br>-Anything from the case (totally obvious, I know)<br>-Salmon - one of the best salmon sashimi I&#39;ve ever had and is consistently excellent<br>-Grilled yellowtail fin - gets a little messy getting the tender fish meat out but totally worth the work<br>-Any whole grilled fish<br>-Ankimo (monkfish liver) - appropriately served with a zippy ponzu sauce, thinly sliced scallions, and grated radish.  I ask for smaller cut pieces because it&#39;s so rich<br>Kaiso seaweed salad - awesome side to be nibbling throughout the meal. love the different crunch each seaweed has to offer. <br>-Cold sesame tofu - I usually get the organic one (it&#39;s only 1.50 more, you end up paying 4.50). Lusciously creamy and soft. The nutty sesame dressing is divine. Yes, I know it&#39;s the bottled stuff that they sell in the store, but who cares?<br>-Grilled squid - so crispy as if it was fried,  but it&#39;s charred perfectly on the grill with a touch of salt, so simple and yummy<br>-Kaisen Futomaki - I don&#39;t tend to order rolls, but honestly the ones we&#39;ve tried are all quite good.  Ratio of rice is just right, rice is not overcooked and mushy, and are neatly and tightly rolled.  <br><br>I am not a big fan of their fried items, sorry! The chicken karage was not as good as expected.  I love that they use chicken thighs and it is indeed crispy and tender, but I felt it lacked seasoning.  A while back we ordered the Wakasagi Karage (fried shishamo/smelt) and another fried seafood item which I don&#39;t recall right now because I was successful in removing it from my memory. Both items tasted like it had been fried in rancid oil.  They handled it promptly when we complained and removed it from our bill.  Mad props for that :)<br><br>Service is above average. Generally very quick and straightforward service unless it&#39;s super busy; which is totally understandable.  I think it&#39;s always funny when the servers look surprised when I politely ask for more tea (it&#39;s 1.50 for free flow). Their ears perk up and their eyebrows raise like it&#39;s the first time they&#39;ve been asked that question!  It doesn&#39;t bother me at all, it just makes me chuckle a bit.  Or perhaps it&#39;s an indication that I&#39;ve been spending way too much time here....",

"reviewcomment":"Y&#39;know. I&#39;ve been coming to Sun Moulin since 2001, when the girl I was dating at the time introduced me to it.<br><br>Highschool loves come and go, but good bread is forever. 12 years later, and I&#39;m still eating the cheese and chocolate mochi, I&#39;m still in love with the Snow Chocolate bun, and there&#39;re still few other places I can find my croquette bun. The Snow Apple bun, which combines a crumbly cakey bread, custard, and apples, is another great item to try. I&#39;m also a fan of their curry bread, though it&#39;s really best fresh.<br><br>Sure, you have these shiny bakery chains springing up all over the place, but to me, none of them compare to Sun Moulin. You don&#39;t survive this long without being that good.",

"reviewcomment":"A hot day = no coffee or tea (unless iced). <br><br>The staff was fabulous. Polite, friendly and offered suggestions. Iced lemonade was recommended to combat the heat and when I just made a passing remark that I already had a lemon drink in the morning, the staff suggested I have a glass of iced water first while deciding on my beverage. That was nice and thoughtful. In the end I decided on iced lemon tea (freshly brewed with English Breakfast tea and topped with lemon slices) with a side of sugar syrup.<br><br>This place is great for those who can only take gluten free products. There are quite a good selection of gluten free cakes. <br><br>We had the flourless chocolate cake and the hummingbird cake. Somehow I was not enamored of the flourless chocolate cake. Maybe it was the last slice or something. The cake was a bit dry around the edges, only the center was moist. It tasted too bitter and the dryness caused the cake to fall apart every time I stabbed at it. <br><br>But the hummingbird was beautiful. I loved that! The generous cream cheese frosting was just screaming my name. Gorgeous. The cream cheese frosting went very well with the banana pineapple cake. Not overly sweet (we are talking 2 naturally sweet fruits) and I can see myself having that again but with a hot cup of tea some day. Just lovely. <br><br>It is a very small place with only 2 tables insides and a few tables outside. Oh, and they close at 7 pm so do go early if you want to snag some good cakes.",

"reviewcomment":"i love this place!<br><br>named after the famed street in london, it&#39;s cute, small, charming cafe located in the pretty hipster tanjong pagar area. been there 4 times, so far, and have never been disappointed. i quite like the upstairs, which has a cool courtyard and a really nice vibe. it also has a long communal table which can accommodate bigger groups of up to say, 8 people. they take reservations, which can be a boon if you don&#39;t want to spend your weekends waiting endless for a table at your favorite no-reservation brunch spot. <br><br>the coffee was decent ($4.50 for a long black), but the bunch didn&#39;t really blow me away. they do their own homemade baked beans, which their pair with most their egg dishes ($10-$14), but i found it way too sweet and wish they&#39;d gone with some good old-fashioned heinz. i&#39;d recommend sticking to the sandwiches, which were good and noticeably cheaper ($8).    <br><br>the real winner, for me, were the desserts. the chocolate tart ($4) was delicious and so were the &#34;pay as you wish&#34; muffins. yes, free muffins! though, i think most of us would be obliged to give something (...or not). anyway, tried the peanut butter one, which was divine. overall, if you&#39;re looking for a chill place for coffee/desserts and don&#39;t have high expectations for mains, definitely check it out.",

"reviewcomment":"Together with with 4 flavorful dumplings, the amount of noodles is pretty filling at $4. While some stalls are better at certain ingredients, say the char siew or noodles, Eng&#39;s version pays details to everything.<br><br>No dark or light soy sauce like Kok Kee, the version here looks just as white as the one from Nam Seng. However, all is not lost. The pork lard that is tossed with the firm egg noodles not only prevent then from clumping and injects another dimension of fragrance. The charsiew have great caramelization with bits of fats. <br><br>And the super spicy chilli lives up to its name as it is spicy, but in a different way. Because it is purely blended chilli, it tastes bitter. I did not really enjoyed it because it was not appetizing enough like Sambal chilli nor will it make you blow your nose or cause watery eyes like chilli padi. <br><br>The noodles are simply good without the chilli sauce but no one would stop you from dousing it liberally into the noodles, turning the dish into a sea of orangey yellow (compare this and the top picture). The sauce is definitely bearable for chilli-takers, but I find that the bitterness (not spiciness) robs the original taste of wanton mee when squeezed in excess. <br><br>We ordered extra wantons to share even though they were the same as those in the noodles. The pinkish pork filling were chewy and meaty. <br>  <br> I am glad that this wanton mee legend has continued in this era. If you haven&#39;t try it yet, please do.<br>  <br> It is something worth traveling all the way for, over and over again. A taste to remember",

The first visit was on a Sunday and it was closed (Sunday is their day off). <br><br>Next visit was on a Saturday afternoon and yay! It was open. But....not many cupcakes were left. Once the cupcakes are gone, they will close shop. How nice. It also means all the cupcakes are baked fresh daily.<br><br>I decided to try the Dark Chocolate since Triple Chocolate was already sold out when I got there at 3+pm. It was pretty good, especially if you are a chocolate lover. The frosting was generous with a thick layer of butter cream. The cake itself was like a cake - dense and moist with bits of melted chocolate inside. <br><br>I tried a bit of the Strawberry Chocolate frosting which my friend bought. That was a bit too buttery for me. The cake base was the same as the Dark Chocolate. <br><br>I would definitely return in future to try the other flavors.",

No matter if you&#39;re the weekend baker who&#39;s testing out cupcake recipes you found online, or the pastry chef churning out dozens of tiered cakes a day, they&#39;ve got fun stuff for you.<br><br>I know, there&#39;s a bunch of Phoon Huats around, but this one is pretty special. Once you get in, you&#39;ll know. I stepped in, and... Hello MOTHERLOAD. This place is HUGE, and always busy! We&#39;ve found 10kg blocks of butter, 1kg blocks of cream cheese, various kinds of nuts and sprinkles to add to any dessert, and there&#39;s also a wall of freezers for frozen fruit preserves. I saw a tub of cactus jam once. I&#39;d never know what to do with it, but they have it anyway.<br><br>If you need any form of packaging or cake decorating tool, they&#39;re likely to have what you need too. They&#39;ve dedicated a whole section to this, and my sister&#39;s found cake boards and boxes ranging from 7-12 inches, in gold or silver, square or round.<br><br>They&#39;ve got a classroom space at the back of the shop packed with industrial equipment, so you&#39;ll get to play with real toys if you take a class or two there. You can learn pretty much anything from ang ku kueh to... I dunno really, I think they teach a lot of stuff, and the classes are always well attended. And of course, you can buy the ingredients and necessary tools to replicate these items at home right in the shop. Ingenious marketing, I say.",

The crust was a whole piece of biscuit cookie and surprisingly thick when you look at the cross-section but it did compliment the light cheese flavour and soft texture of the filling well.

You can&#39;t tell it is fat free, it tastes just as indulgent as regular gelato. My favorites are the rum raisin (very nice and strong rum flavor) and the dark chocolate, which is very rich and not too sweet.

"reviewcomment":"Went looking for a place called Ganges at #3, as it was recommended in Lonely Planet. It is not there anymore, looks like the neighbours Koala took them over.<br><br>Figuring it was worth a try, the outside menu looked reasonable, so I popped in. It was a Sunday around 2pm, and not too packed - always a good thing.<br><br>The menu looks good, a lot of variety in the veg and non-veg selection. I decided to go for the mutton kulambu set for $7 (according to Google that means curry or gravy). Out comes a massive tray reminiscent of an airline meal with everything in neat sections. There was the mutton curry (very good but small portions), white rice, two sets of veg curry, beans, a papadam, yoghurt, a dessert and a couple more small random dishes.<br><br>Overall this was great, as I said, I would have preferred more of the mutton, but I left full anyhow. The staff saw I was sweating up a storm, so kindly provided more napkins. Thanks.",

"reviewcomment":"This is reminiscent of what a Hong Kong bakery is in my impression having visit Hong Kong countless times. Looking almost anachronistic with its old school kitsch signboard, it adds some authenticity to this old school bakery, bringing back low brow bakery favourites in spite of the emerging boutique bakeries serving European classics. Here, even the prices are rather low, with egg tarts at $1, Polo Buns at $1.20. They do not do pork, but that doesn&#39;t mean their honey chicken bun or chicken char siew is less than stellar. It is the gravy that wins my heart over, never mind the porky-less pastries. And there&#39;s two other pastries I haven&#39;t yet seen in Singapore; century egg with lotus paste and red bean paste with yam paste. These two are marriages that I love as a chinese growing up on steam buns and the various fillings. What I have to gush about is the awesome flavours of the century egg pastry that is sweet, with thin pieces of ginger rolled in with the sweet creamy lotus seed paste. <br>These inexpensive bites are so delectable and nostalgic, you have to try them to understand their attraction!",

"reviewcomment":"This was one of the first places I had eaten in Singapore and I kind of forgot about it. I didn&#39;t realize at the time just how good it is compared to the other Italian offerings in Singapore. The sauces are invariably outstanding and the portions of pasta are larger than I have had anywhere else on the island (::COUGH::DA PAOLO). It is like an actual Italian restaurant in Italy, with the expected higher price given the cost of ingredients and real estate here. The tiramisu is also the best I have had in this country. Despite having a little more sauce on the pasta than I prefer, they clearly care about the quality of their food and have a keen attention to detail.",

So at least the queue is moving and you&#39;re not stuck at the same position for more than 5 minutes. Their coffee is not too shabby, a good standard in terms of the local coffee. I like that they sell some snacks at the stall, like chocolate, dried peach, candies, and panadols even.

"reviewcomment":"Like gold or diamonds buried deep somewhere in African dirt, Brewer&#39;s Craft is one of those spots that you would have never found unless someone leads you to it (or you have been exploring this part of Clementi behind the mosque). Clyde B.&#39;s review of Brewer&#39;s Craft is similar to the person that stumbled upon a HUGE gold nugget while digging a well and caused a sudden horde of diggers to appear.<br><br>Let&#39;s put it this way: Brewer&#39;s Craft is a TINY store that does not even have an official banner outside that reveals it exists. However, that is no indication of the gems that they carry within for those of you who are beer enthusiasts. During my two week crawl around Clementi, it was continuously closed (perhaps for the holiday I thought). I gave up and emailed Meng-Chao (the owner) to inquire more about the hours as well as on tasting events. His prompt reply informed me that they are open again (after having closed the two weeks prior for vacation) and will be arranging tasting events whenever new stock arrives.<br><br>Clyde B. wasn&#39;t kidding at how small the place was. But in the short time I was there...I immediately noticed that they carried some LIMITED edition ales (those that are brewed 4 times a year) and some that I&#39;m sure are unlikely to be found anywhere else.<br><br>I got myself to immediately dive in to the deeper flavored brews such as the Rogue Yellow Snow IPA, Victory Yakima Glory, and the La Trappe QUADRUPEL as well as a few others including a glorious English Stout. I walked away with a &#34;mixed-6-pack&#34; and probably the widest smile a beer enthusiast had for some time.<br><br>Let&#39;s put it this way. If you&#39;re a beer enthusiast living in Singapore, this is one of few places that will be on your pilgrimage list.<br><br>So...<br><br>&#34;Stay thirsty my friend&#34; and sign up for the newsletter via the website to stay in the loop for planned tastings!<br><br>Yelp 100: 9/100",

Once you get in, you&#39;ll know. I stepped in, and... Hello MOTHERLOAD. This place is HUGE, and always busy! We&#39;ve found 10kg blocks of butter, 1kg blocks of cream cheese, various kinds of nuts and sprinkles to add to any dessert, and there&#39;s also a wall of freezers for frozen fruit preserves. I saw a tub of cactus jam once. I&#39;d never know what to do with it, but they have it anyway.<br><br>If you need any form of packaging or cake decorating tool, they&#39;re likely to have what you need too. They&#39;ve dedicated a whole section to this, and my sister&#39;s found cake boards and boxes ranging from 7-12 inches, in gold or silver, square or round.<br><br>They&#39;ve got a classroom space at the back of the shop packed with industrial equipment, so you&#39;ll get to play with real toys if you take a class or two there. You can learn pretty much anything from ang ku kueh to... I dunno really, I think they teach a lot of stuff, and the classes are always well attended.

I like it a lot. Fried Tofu has crispy skin and the smooth silky soft tofu inside, topped with some meat and diced cubed veggies, such as fishcake, mushroom, eggs, and cucumber. Kind of refreshing. And the Laksa is rich and flavorful. Good balance of the taste. You can taste the freshness of the prawns and clams in the soup. The rojak was very good too. I only have one other experience with the rojak years ago. The best thing was the price. All three items were good for feeding 3 adults with only S$12+. Definitely a good place for the local food.

"reviewcomment":"This is a roastery that seems to be bigger on the inside that it appears on the outside.  The use of space is clever - by placing most of the seating outside, Smitten can function as a roastery, retail space and full service cafe. <br><br>The espresso shot I ordered came with a dark brown crema, and the correct volume of liquid for a single shot. No surprises there - dark brown cremas are the product of beans which have been roasted recently. This was a nicely balanced shot, combining an underlying tempered robustness with tart notes. The astringency is fine, neither too bitter nor too overpowering, and the mouthfeel has more syrupy than watery characteristics. <br><br>The first thing that I noticed on the cappuccino was the latte art - there is a distinct contrast of light on dark, and very defined borders. The foam layer is fine - the thickness is ideal, remaining intact until the last drops of coffee are consumed. It seems like something small to single out, but i&#39;m surprised at how many cafe&#39;s get this wrong. The microbubbles in the foam added smoothness, and took the edge off the strong underlying espresso shot. The aftertaste does not linger, making this a &#34;clean&#34;, mellow drink - the coffee hit is in the first few seconds. It&#39;s a balanced, well executed cappuccino with no issues.<br><br>There are also alternatives available for people who prefer brewed or pourover coffees. V60 and Chemex brews are availble, with beans from Brazil, Ethiopia (Yirgacheffe) and Tanzania (Kilamanjaro).<br><br>There is a very specalised retail space, which is geared towards baristas - tampers, cone drippers, stovetop espresso makers, filter baskets, grinders, and knock boxes line the shelves - this is a good option for any aspiring home barista.",

True enough, the entire blogosphere started talking about the long queues and all that. <br><br>And I thought &#34;Meh... I already tried Laduree&#39;s in London anyway...&#34; <br><br>Then the boyfriend showed up one night after my dance class with a bag of macaroons. <br><br>I squealed with joy, then I wondered what the hell he did that he felt he had to surprise me with a bag of macaroons. But that&#39;s besides the point, I got a bag of macaroons!<br><br>Four. To be exact. <br><br>I ate the gold chocolate one first. Seriously, at $7 a piece.. it&#39;s like... just chocolate with gold dust. That&#39;s it. <br><br>The salted caramel was how I remembered it when I ate it in the sweltering London Summer heat. So was the other chocolate one and the lemon one. <br><br>I have tried Pierre Hermes&#39;s macaroons lovingly flown in from Paris by my stewardess bestie.. but it shrunk due to the air pressure, so I couldn&#39;t judge if it&#39;s the best in the world.. yet... <br><br>So until I fulfill my dream of eating BOTH Pierre Hermes&#39;s and Laduree&#39;s macaroons both at the same time...... I&#39;ll say Laduree&#39;s macaroons will be the best &#39;authentic&#39; Parisian macaroon in Singapore for now.",

"reviewcomment":"Together with with 4 flavorful dumplings, the amount of noodles is pretty filling at $4. While some stalls are better at certain ingredients, say the char siew or noodles, Eng&#39;s version pays details to everything.<br><br>No dark or light soy sauce like Kok Kee, the version here looks just as white as the one from Nam Seng. However, all is not lost. The pork lard that is tossed with the firm egg noodles not only prevent then from clumping and injects another dimension of fragrance. The charsiew have great caramelization with bits of fats. <br><br>And the super spicy chilli lives up to its name as it is spicy, but in a different way. Because it is purely blended chilli, it tastes bitter. I did not really enjoyed it because it was not appetizing enough like Sambal chilli nor will it make you blow your nose or cause watery eyes like chilli padi. <br><br>The noodles are simply good without the chilli sauce but no one would stop you from dousing it liberally into the noodles, turning the dish into a sea of orangey yellow (compare this and the top picture). The sauce is definitely bearable for chilli-takers, but I find that the bitterness (not spiciness) robs the original taste of wanton mee when squeezed in excess. <br><br>We ordered extra wantons to share even though they were the same as those in the noodles. The pinkish pork filling were chewy and meaty. <br>  <br> I am glad that this wanton mee legend has continued in this era. If you haven&#39;t try it yet, please do.<br>  <br> It is something worth traveling all the way for, over and over again. A taste to remember",

The first visit was on a Sunday and it was closed (Sunday is their day off). <br><br>Next visit was on a Saturday afternoon and yay! It was open. But....not many cupcakes were left. Once the cupcakes are gone, they will close shop. How nice. It also means all the cupcakes are baked fresh daily.<br><br>I decided to try the Dark Chocolate since Triple Chocolate was already sold out when I got there at 3+pm. It was pretty good, especially if you are a chocolate lover. The frosting was generous with a thick layer of butter cream. The cake itself was like a cake - dense and moist with bits of melted chocolate inside. <br><br>I tried a bit of the Strawberry Chocolate frosting which my friend bought. That was a bit too buttery for me. The cake base was the same as the Dark Chocolate. <br><br>I would definitely return in future to try the other flavors.",

But don&#39;t be misled by the storefront or signage, this place sells baking products! <br>Not just a few baking products like shermay&#39;s cooking school down the street, but this place sells all baking products you never knew existed. My friend has her own bakery and she says she always go shopping here because they have everything, the quality is superb and the price reasonable to cheap. (except if you want to order something like a kg of almond paste ofcourse). <br>Once you are inside the maze of shells full of baking products is pretty overwhelming, but just tell the staff what you are looking for and they will point you in the right direction. <br>Unexpected tip is to buy cheese here, a kg of mozarella and gouda only costs around 20 sing!",

What was really cool is that they have a Fresh Fruits and Juice section - and they will make any type of juice you want - and you can choose your own fruits, combine, etc. There are fresh fruits and preserved ones. There is quite a selection for cakes, bread, muffins, etc. My other fave part is the salad and cereal counter - pretty comprehensive, in terms of healthy salad, and cereal options. There&#39;s quite a few milk options too.<br><br>Their omelet section has someone attending to everyone&#39;s orders - and there is the usual bacon, hash and vegetables.

"reviewcomment":"It goes without saying, if you want to eat organic in Singapore, it&#39;ll cost you. However, this place is CHEAPER than Supernature just a few blocks down and has just as wide a selection of organic food and household products. I think where Supernature fails, BRP takes over. The store itself isn&#39;t exactly quaint per-se, but hey, it makes up for it with the products and the range of products they carry. They don&#39;t carry a wide selection of multivitamins and fresh/frozen produce, so that&#39;s where Supernature comes in. The selection of dry food is definitely better here, so I&#39;ll be coming to shop here more often for that. <br><br>Oh yea, THEY HAVE ZICO!! The Thai coconut water made easy. I haven&#39;t checked the price on that, but I can assume it won&#39;t be as cheap as I bought it back home in nyc for US$3 a carton.",

"reviewcomment":"This place has quite a few desserts that is worthy to try. One of it is the macaroons. I&#39;ve been in search for good macaroons ever since I step into Singapore. I love fruity taste macaroons so I tried strawberry, passion fruit and I forgot the other one. All of it are not that sweet which is good as I normally eat it in two bites without tea/coffee. The outside layer is crisp which is good. After eating the macaroons you will still have the flavour tangling on your tongue.<br><br>Another kind of pastry/ bread I would recommend is the mocha bread. The best is when you actually get it when it is fresh and bite straight into it. The top part is crispy and after biting, you will taste the mocha. I am not a fan of coffee but this is good and the price is reasonable.<br><br>This place is located at tower 3. Depending on where you park, you might need to walk more. Treat it exercise :) Enjoy. I hope that there will be more varieties of baked good soon!",

"reviewcomment":"This is a nice café with a very inviting décor located in Market Street. However, to be honest, it is a little hard to find this place even though it is right in the middle of Raffles Place. It&#39;s behind the M1 shop at Caltex House.<br>Dimbulah prides itself on bringing fine Australian coffee from the plantation straight to the consumer, and it shows: the coffee here is simply mindblowing. <br>They have a breakfast menu as well as a lunch menu. They also have cakes, tarts and muffins on display. However, it seems that most people were there for the coffee.<br>My friend had a triple deck roast chicken sandwich and a chicken pie. The chicken sandwich was nothing special, just three slices of wholemeal sandwich bread with roast chicken and the usual garnishing. The chicken pie was not bad. I had a tuna baguette which was also very normal, so food-wise, it&#39;s really not impressive. As I&#39;ve mentioned though, the  coffee was really good. It&#39;s not harsh and too acidic, and there is kind of an underlying richness which gives the coffee texture and body. Overall, this is a great place to chill. Recommended!",

"reviewcomment":"Yoshimaru is a very decent ramen joint. With so many ramen shops opening in Singapore in the last few years, I think that Yoshimaru serves up good ramen - a tasty (but not too salty) broth and thin and springy ramen noodles. My usual order is the all in ramen that has soft boiled eggs (yolk is nice and runny), seaweed, char siu, mentaiko, mushroom and some other ingredients. <br><br>My favourite thing about this restaurant is that they would give you a pestle and mortar to grind sesame seeds that you can add to your ramen. It gives you something fun to do while you are waiting for your food. Although this sounds vaguely juvenile but it is actually quite nice to know that you are doing something to add to your meal! =)",

Allpress coffee with a distinct flavour and reasonably priced, a simple yet varied menu, and great bread! So good we now buy the bread on a weekly basis, getting it sliced on the spot and freezing it at home... eggs bene and the chicken and bacon pastry roll from the cabinet hit the spot for his and her. <br><br>On this particular visit I did witness some mistakes being made by the cooking staff (open sandwiches not being toasted as advertised on the menu and being sent back on two separate occasions by different visitors), however the staff were very apologetic and polite (not sure why they repeated the mistake again though?). <br><br>Prefer this one to the Martin Road outlet - but convenience of Martin Road wins out in the end!",

We went, rather reluctant and ordered the sesame and almond paste, steam milk curd and a mango dessert. I must say, the milk curd was really smooth and rich, melting in the mouth with every spoon. Then the friend&#39;s order of almond paste was really fragrant and fresh, not to sweet but creamy. <br><br>While it isn&#39;t as famous and crowded as Ah Chew&#39;s down the road, i would actually say to have steam milk curd here instead.

"reviewcomment":"Tried the granola yogurt, fish tacos, fried chicken burger, butter biscuits, pancakes and steak and eggs. And they are all good. Good may sound a bit underwhelming but it is quite a feat to actually get all (at least the ones I tried) the dishes to be good. So they did a really great job on the food front. And I agree with some of the yelpers here who recommended the pancakes. They are very light and yummy indeed!<br>The service here is prompt and friendly.<br>I really like the fact that you don&#39;t have to queue and that all of the food that they serve are consistently good. I will definitely return here for brunch!",

"reviewcomment":"This is a roastery that seems to be bigger on the inside that it appears on the outside.  The use of space is clever - by placing most of the seating outside, Smitten can function as a roastery, retail space and full service cafe. <br><br>The espresso shot I ordered came with a dark brown crema, and the correct volume of liquid for a single shot. No surprises there - dark brown cremas are the product of beans which have been roasted recently. This was a nicely balanced shot, combining an underlying tempered robustness with tart notes. The astringency is fine, neither too bitter nor too overpowering, and the mouthfeel has more syrupy than watery characteristics. <br><br>The first thing that I noticed on the cappuccino was the latte art - there is a distinct contrast of light on dark, and very defined borders. The foam layer is fine - the thickness is ideal, remaining intact until the last drops of coffee are consumed. It seems like something small to single out, but i&#39;m surprised at how many cafe&#39;s get this wrong. The microbubbles in the foam added smoothness, and took the edge off the strong underlying espresso shot. The aftertaste does not linger, making this a &#34;clean&#34;, mellow drink - the coffee hit is in the first few seconds. It&#39;s a balanced, well executed cappuccino with no issues.<br><br>There are also alternatives available for people who prefer brewed or pourover coffees. V60 and Chemex brews are availble, with beans from Brazil, Ethiopia (Yirgacheffe) and Tanzania (Kilamanjaro).<br><br>There is a very specalised retail space, which is geared towards baristas - tampers, cone drippers, stovetop espresso makers, filter baskets, grinders, and knock boxes line the shelves - this is a good option for any aspiring home barista.",

"reviewcomment":"When I heard Laduree&#39;s opened in Singapore, I was like &#34;YAYYYYY...&#34; then I realised... Oh crap, that means the whole damn country is going to populate this place. True enough, the entire blogosphere started talking about the long queues and all that. <br><br>And I thought &#34;Meh... I already tried Laduree&#39;s in London anyway...&#34; <br><br>Then the boyfriend showed up one night after my dance class with a bag of macaroons. <br><br>I squealed with joy, then I wondered what the hell he did that he felt he had to surprise me with a bag of macaroons. But that&#39;s besides the point, I got a bag of macaroons!<br><br>Four. To be exact. <br><br>I ate the gold chocolate one first. Seriously, at $7 a piece.. it&#39;s like... just chocolate with gold dust. That&#39;s it. <br><br>The salted caramel was how I remembered it when I ate it in the sweltering London Summer heat. So was the other chocolate one and the lemon one. <br><br>I have tried Pierre Hermes&#39;s macaroons lovingly flown in from Paris by my stewardess bestie.. but it shrunk due to the air pressure, so I couldn&#39;t judge if it&#39;s the best in the world.. yet... <br><br>So until I fulfill my dream of eating BOTH Pierre Hermes&#39;s and Laduree&#39;s macaroons both at the same time...... I&#39;ll say Laduree&#39;s macaroons will be the best &#39;authentic&#39; Parisian macaroon in Singapore for now.",

"reviewcomment":"This is a review of a large takeout order from Spizza for a work-related team lunch.<br><br>I was not involved in the ordering process.  I was not involved in the pick-up process.<br><br>I can only comment on the pizza itself.  We ordered a wide range of pizzas.<br><br>Overall, they do provide numerous options that stray away from your typical pepperoni and mushroom pizzas.<br><br>Their pizza has a thin but flavourful crust.  They use fresh ingredients.  Overall their pizzas are higher quality than your average pizza shop.  But, in some ways, they are simply different from your traditional pizzas.  There are times I would just rather have a old school comfort style greasy pizza.  If this is what you are seeking, Spizza is not the place.  But, if you have a hankering for pizza, and want something that is a little lighter, then this may be the place for you.<br><br>Their pizzas did not travel particularly well though.  Because of the thin and harder crust, they do not maintain their warmth.  So, for take out, you will more than likely be eating cold (or at least room temperature) pizza.  I do not know if there is anything they could do in the packaging to improve this or not.  But, they might want to consider looking into it.<br><br>My second comment is on how they incorporate fresh basil.  They seem to add it very early in the cooking process.   This just destroys basil (visually and flavor-wise).  Pizza Margheritas should be red, white, and green, not red, white, and black.  I would suggest adding the basil later in the process.  This way it can maintain its colour, shape, and fresh flavour.<br><br>The overall impression from the team was that it was very good pizza.  It was certainly devoured pretty quickly.  <br><br>They also offer pizzas for a wide-range of dietary likes, needs and restrictions; no cheese, no pork, no sauce, vegetarian, etc.  <br><br>I would like to try their pizza dining in.  I think it would be much better hot out of the oven.<br><br>The Pizzas (an * marks my personal favorites):<br><br>*ISABELLA - Tomato, Mozzarella, Parma Ham, Rucola Salad<br><br><a href='/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Ftinyurl.com%2F8eh938q&amp;s=53d0873225915645599116659f71bb45fab248ce71d740556b799c136fb7e13e' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>tinyurl.com/8eh938q</a><br><br>CLAUDIA (without cheese) - Tomato, Bell Peppers, Zucchini, Eggplants, Artichokes, Mushrooms<br><br><a href='/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Ftinyurl.com%2F8ok9arj&amp;s=f71c483165708d79423983d9c82907c1ce7a9f06ec8c070c6d25a64b797c8804' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>tinyurl.com/8ok9arj</a><br><br>XANDRA - Tomato, Mozzarella, ground Beef, red Onions, Pineapple, Bell Pepper<br><br><a href='/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Ftinyurl.com%2F97fbybv&amp;s=90671b5d80dd440e8fed66be08d72270e7d136ac109bbb9b6dcbd66de49655eb' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>tinyurl.com/97fbybv</a><br><br>SOFIA - Tomato, Mozzarella, Shrimps, Mussels, Scallops, Calamari, fresh Basil<br><br><a href='/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Ftinyurl.com%2F9q9hhhm&amp;s=2d7b09ba6b507efa13fdfc147a562d5e8f69c8a5bd8d918378e468de0d74fea0' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>tinyurl.com/9q9hhhm</a><br><br>HELENA - Tomato, Mozzarella, grilled Chicken in Pesto sauce, Bell Peppers<br><br><a href='/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Ftinyurl.com%2F9cq4xt5&amp;s=b9374ca91d738cc6ca5caf7bdcc85d4f48de43fadfd368a19dc024b8685e8bb0' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>tinyurl.com/9cq4xt5</a><br><br>*QUINTA - Tomato, Mozzarella, Egg, Black Truffle paste<br><br><a href='/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Ftinyurl.com%2F8stdtgq&amp;s=52a029a0c99032fdbb0186d63f957eab9a6cbab2982f8548cb6d6f6823ff8a5e' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>tinyurl.com/8stdtgq</a><br><br>*TARA - Tomato, Mozzarella, Egg, Bacon, Button Mushrooms<br><br><a href='/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Ftinyurl.com%2F9olahw4&amp;s=845570964af3077476dd3c78db3b3c02a9a0a2400b569edfd60eba44dfd30036' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>tinyurl.com/9olahw4</a><br><br>MARGHERITA - Tomato, Buffalo Mozzarella, fresh Basil<br><br><a href='/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Ftinyurl.com%2F956fxg2&amp;s=82e6498e195cc229518a9319d94144589eb045c46958864500750424eb230104' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>tinyurl.com/956fxg2</a><br><br>URSULA - Tomato, Mascarpone, Spinach, smoked Salmon, Capers<br><br><a href='/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Ftinyurl.com%2F8txpvox&amp;s=94e086b4a9efe146421f412ca344a59b05bde902651274112659aac22bf30ad1' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>tinyurl.com/8txpvox</a><br><br>Overall, I think their pizza is probably best suited for dining in.  That being said, the team didn&#39;t seem to mind too much that the pizza wasn&#39;t exactly hot.  The creative options and fresh ingredients do provide a nice escape from the traditional heavier/more greasy pizzas.  For larger groups, it is also nice that they can cater to a wide range of dietary needs.",

It was $25 and REALLY mini! He also ordered tempura veggies, which we liked and highly recommend. <br><br>The service was very good. We came on a Saturday evening, and although they were a little busy, our orders came out very quickly and we weren&#39;t left waiting too long. Overall, a good choice for date night or for business. Next time I stop by, I&#39;ll be sure to explore their whisky offerings!",

"reviewcomment":"I only had scrambled eggs, smoked salmon, a cappuccino, a passion fruit tart, and an espresso. All were excellent and reasonably priced. The hours of this place are really weird, especially that most days they start serving breakfast at 11. It reminded me a lot of Jimmy Monkey, and the cappuccino in particular had almost identical flavor to theirs.<br><br>It&#39;s a little like they are trying too hard to be hipster, but I didn&#39;t really see anything to complain about, except the scrambled eggs were a little runnier than they are in America. I guess if you don&#39;t like your scrambled eggs runny, you should ask for them to be cooked more than usual. The food and coffee was great, especially the cappuccino and passion fruit tart.",

Guess it&#39;s about time to let people know what&#39;s good here -- even though im returning home in a couple weeks!<br><br>Luckily I live very close to MRT train station, but unlucky (and lucky at the same time, lol) I walk through a mall and pass by Gong Cha everyday on my way home...<br><br>&#34;should i get the tea? ....hmmm. no i don&#39;t need it!&#34; I never listen to myself! I&#39;m addicted to the milk tea here. I&#39;ve tried quite a number of places, but no one gets it right like Gong Cha. They are always busy busy- so I think the locals feel the same way. <br><br>They have a variety of tea and coffee drinks - but I stick to the milk tea. You have the option to choose your sugar level in percentage, but I always get no sugar because the combination of the milk and the tea has the perfect amount of flavor. I add pearls to the drink to add texture and a little hint of sweetness. Their pearls are also the best pearls I&#39;ve had! Somehow they cook them differently than anyone else, and the amount of chewy-ness is spot on! <br><br>It&#39;s more of a grab and go joint - there is no where to sit. But they do give you these little bags that make carrying your drink around more convenient. The customer service is so so, sometimes they are kinda nice, but most of the time they are stoic! Kind of weird , but I&#39;m used to it. Nothing can come in between me and my tea :D",

"reviewcomment":"I have to give major props to this ice cream shop. Competition for ice cream is fierce in the Upper Thomson area, with 4 or 5 ice cream/waffle shops all within a 5 minutes walk from each other. However, this place stands out so nicely because its 100% vegan, and they don&#39;t use processed/refined sugar, only a small amount unrefined cane sugar in their waffles and cane juice in their ice cream. I asked :) <br><br>Even their waffles are vegan, using no eggs or cows milk, and yet it was still delicious. I had 2 scoops of ice cream and a waffle, and by the end of finishing everything, I wasn&#39;t like super full or bloated, but I was definitely satisfied. Less guilt, and totally satisfied. That&#39;s a pretty good feeling coming out of an ice cream shop. <br><br>The service is also THE NICEST I have come across in Singapore, shocking to say since this is an ice cream shop. All smiles and super sweet. <br><br>They also serve free flow alkaline water with a high ph. I don&#39;t know any other ice cream shop, let alone restaurant that serves free flow alkaline water.

"reviewcomment":"With a series of wins in the Singapore barista championship, an annual latte art throwdown and a coffee roastery and retail business, Oriole is an established part of the Singapore coffee scene. It&#39;s also one cafe that I go back to on a regular basis. Starting with a flagship cafe, bar and restaurant in 313 Somerset, Oriole has expended to include a new roastery in Chinatown (Jiak Chuan road) and a cafe in Republic Plaza.<br><br>Espresso - golden brown crema, consistent with coffee beans which have been roasted recently - exactly what I would expect from an established coffee roastery. The initial impression was of citrusy and berry-like flavours, which were neither too tart nor astringent. This was complemented by a slightly viscous, syrupy mouthfeel, and the correct volume for an espresso shot. Each of the elements of a good shot were there, combining to create a shot that was so much more than a combination of ground beans and steam. <br><br>There are also some interesting combinations of caffeine and milk happening above Somerset station. The espresso shot mentioned above was paired with silky smooth microbubbles, resulting in a balanced drink, but a cappuccino which retained it&#39;s potency. The aftertaste lingered, with sweetness evident in the foam - this occurs when milk is steamed at the correct temperature, increasing the solubility of the lactose. Unlike a lot of cafes, I could also taste the citrus notes in the milk, a nice touch that I don&#39;t always see. <br><br>Piccolo lattes are also a speciality in Oriole. The piccolo that I tried was beautiful - built upon a foundation of a double ristretto, with potency tempered by smooth foam. Ristretto on the menu is always a good sign - think of it as an even more intense espresso, consisting of the first 10 seconds of extraction, unlike a regular espresso shot which extracts for 18 - 30 seconds. For coffee lovers, the presence of ristretto on the menu is a subtle indication that the level of coffee knowledge on the part of the staff is higher than average - it suggests an understanding of the effect of different extraction times for a shot.",

"reviewcomment":"I&#39;m not sure why it took months for EwF to grow on me. It&#39;s in a good location (first floor of Orchard Central) and the food is very affordable ($6-$8 for a burger.)  <br><br>Perhaps it was because we got off on the wrong foot. The first time I stopped by, I tried the sour cream and onion fries. They were pretty good, and big portioned, but that&#39;s about it. Then I tried their lamb burger, but I didn&#39;t think it was anything to Yelp about. I didn&#39;t notice any different flavors, and it was just okay.<br><br>However, after yesterday&#39;s discovery, they&#39;ve won me over. I finally followed the instructions of past Yelpers and ordered the HJK (har jeong kai burger) and the rest is history! What is the HJK? In western terms, it&#39;s a fried chicken burger with hints of shrimp. I know that sounds weird, but once you bite into it, the shrimp/prawn flavor is very subtle. I was surprised at how juicy and crispy it was! It&#39;s substantial and very messy, so I suggest grabbing a knife and fork to conquer it.<br><br>I was super hungry when I ordered the HJK and I ended up not finishing it. If you have problems finishing food, I recommend ordering one meal and splitting it with someone. Their set meal is a very good deal. It comes with a lot of fries and a small drink for only $9.90. <br><br>The only downsides I can think of is that they do run out of flavors for the fries. I stopped by late in the afternoon on Saturday and they ran out of 2 flavors. Also, the fries can have too much seasoning on them, so they might be too salty for some people.<br><br>Will I end up going here more than McDonald&#39;s? Only my Yelp check-ins will tell!",

"reviewcomment":"Location &amp; vibe-wise, was my type of cafe - quiet neighbourhood, ample parking, large outdoor patio, breezy, and not crowded. Food-wise was average... not bad but not spectacular.<br><br>Came here on a weekend morning and had the Full Melba Cooked Breakfast for $25:  2 eggs, pork sausages, bacon, roasted cherry tomatoes, baked beans, mushrooms, hash brown &amp; toast. I was pretty hungry and considered getting the Mega Melba Cooked Breakfast, an upsized version of the Full Melba, which was $36. The Mega Melba doubles the portions of everything but the eggs, and what I really wanted was more eggs, so I stuck with the Full Melba.<br><br>It says on the menu that you&#39;re not allowed to share the Mega Melba, or in their words &#34;can&#39;t be splitted&#34;. That&#39;s not very nice... I wonder if they would have a problem with their customers sharing any of the other dishes? Is the Mega Melba too good a deal? If anything it would make their pricing a little more decent as $25 veers on the side pricey for breakfast. They did however provide a glass bottle of water and cups without us having to ask which I thought was nice considering how many cafes these days won&#39;t even serve you tap water.<br><br>Overall, I can see myself coming back if I&#39;m in the area.

I&#39;ve only gone for the original so far, but this ain&#39;t gonna be the last Fry sees of me. Cheesy, decadent and heart attack inducing, you can *try* to be healthy by ordering a salad on the side. But let&#39;s face it. With your mac and cheese, you&#39;ll likely have Auntie Ang&#39;s Wings with the addictive belachan, and that glistening basket of truffle fries. And possibly a couple of glasses of mojito. And then followed by some other variation of alcohol. And then another. But I&#39;m not speaking from personal experience, now, am I. *cue shifty look* So. A salad. That&#39;s like ordering a table-ful of decadence and having a Coke Zero because &#34;I&#39;m watching my diet&#34;. <br><br>This is a tiny joint. So be prepared for tiny tables and strangely long waiting times. When I went, there was a power failure, which was a very strange affair.

Speaking of which, girly drinks galore. Mojito, yum. Long Island Tea, potent. Side Car, so so. <br><br>Also, I don&#39;t recommend heels for patronising this place.

"reviewcomment":"My 3rd visit so far. One of my go-to places for comfort food, HK style. Hidden in the bowels of B3 Ion. <br><br>Shanghainese xiaolongbao soup dumplings <br>My fav, even better than Din Tai Fung as the latter&#39;s quality is not there anymore. That&#39;s right, Imp Treasure has solid soup dumplings. Thin skin and flavorful juicy filling. <br><br>Turnip cake aka carrot cake<br>First time I had it and was impressed by generous pieces of carrot in the savory cake. Can&#39;t wait to order again. <br><br>Rice rolls with donut fritter filling <br>Crepes were silky thin and the filling was nice and crunchy. A bit too much soy sauce tho. Wish they offered it on the side. Will ask next time. <br><br>Noodles with shrimp roe<br>Fans of this Macanese dish, rejoice! I&#39;ve had the Sardinian variety and today&#39;s version was yum. Chewy egg noodles and roe that taste of the sea. Will attempt to recreate at home. <br><br>La mian: pork and shredded cabbage. <br>Best eaten right away as the noodles can lose their texture in hot soup<br><br>Hits<br>Solid dishes as listed above. Aunties serving you, kinda feels like home in a way<br><br>Misses <br>Ha gao shrimp dumplings - too mushy<br><br>411<br>Go because it&#39;s good food for decent prices. Another go to of mine. Their daily Signature HK style soups are solid as well.",

"reviewcomment":"Wasn&#39;t able to try their pasta mains as they&#39;re only available after 12pm (was there ard 11am) so I opted for the Tostini (roasted chicken breast, spinach, tomato and a poached egg on top sourdough bread accompanied with honey mustard sauce) - was average, nothing specky except I really liked the honey mustard sauce and egg was poached perfectly. Mum&#39;s choice was heaps better (I had secretly wanted to prefer that but wouldn&#39;t make sense for both of us to have the same mains). She had the New breakfast #1 (smoked duck breast on a bed of peas with potato croquettes and poached egg accompanied with honey mustard sauce) - it was yummm!! <br><br>You can be sure you&#39;ll get a good cuppa coffee here and the barista takes so much pride in preparing your cuppa with cool latte art! Had a Piccolo latte and Americano and left us happy as punch :)<br><br>I&#39;ll definitely return to try their pasta and for their coffee.",

"reviewcomment":"I once was sitting at the high table at the back of 3 Inch Sin with 5 girl friends when I noticed a red Kitchen Aid mixer sitting on a high stool. A lady who I think was Celine, the owner, came out of the small kitchen and was dusting off flour from the stool surface. Being the OCD person that I am and a Kenwood Chef user, I asked Celine why she was mixing stuff on a stool and how she felt about her ubiquitous mixer that has pretty much taken over most middle class kitchens. We had a geeky 5 minute conversation that made me realize I was talking to an equally if not more curious, certainly passionate, baker. <br><br>Celine&#39;s passion comes through in her fondants. They are perfectly baked with sponge-like rims and a rich, thick fudge or mousse-esque center. I work near Millenia Walk and have therefore tried almost all the flavor combinations in various permutations with the excellent ice cream on hand. You can draw your own conclusions about which flavor is the best, I like almost all. This is the kind of dessert you have on Friday at lunch or during your coffee break, when you&#39;re thinking FML-I-need-the-weekend-ooh-chocolate-come-to-mama! Eating something as rich and luscious as this (with real vanilla ice cream no less) makes you ponder the meaning of life and imagine a good read on the beach, while your colleague banters on about work over his gourmet cuppa.<br><br>You might balk at the prices but I think it&#39;s good money paid for good chocolate and baking. Try making a fondant at home. It is hard as heck to get it right. Also, considering how much we pay for Pat G, Tart Blanc and a coffee at Commune, this could actually be bang for your buck!",

"reviewcomment":"At this unassuming coffeeshop, there are not a whole lot of options, but there sure is a whole lot of people forming the lunch crowd. Perhaps all you can get is fishball noodles, but that is precisely the highlight here. Order the fishball noodle soup, especially with the rat&#39;s tail rice noodle ( mee tai mak). The simple flavours of the clear soup will make your eyes pop and bring you far away back to childhood days. At least it did for me. The fragrant oils perfumed by scallions and a bit of pork lard, a good soup base, boiled evidently for hours is rid of any sediments and impurity. Coupled with the handmade fishballs, there&#39;s very little to pick at the humble $3 bowl.",

You could always see the snaking lunch crowds and dinner queues.  <br><br>When the nearby wet market was redeveloped and the shophouses torn down, their stall moved to the 2nd level food centre above the new market. Fortunately, their standards have remained high despite the generations. And the snaking queues remain.<br><br>Theirs is the wet and gooey version of this perennial hawker favourite. I feel it brings out the full flavor of the stock, the prawns, the squids, the pork bellies, and of course the noodles.

"reviewcomment":"One of the best times to visit this bar/restaurant would be on days where there are fireworks! We all try to find hot spots to catch the fireworks during new year&#39;s and national day, but few will think of the Mint Museum of Toys. The Museum hides a rooftop open air bar that offers a perfect few of the fireworks area, as well as the Singapore skyline. <br><br>Located just 5 minutes away from CIty Hall Station (behind Raffles Hotel), the food served at the restaurant is slightly above average, with hot favourite dishes such as truffle fries, nachos, steaks and lambs. Commonly available alcoholic drinks are also available, but the view is why I rate this bar highly. There is both sheltered as well as alfresco seating - the alfresco area offered the best view, but were already taken up as we arrived late at about 11pm. Regardless, we still had a pretty unobstructed view, and settled in to wait. Staff were young and spontaneous, and were dressed up to ring in the new year with us! They also gave out party favours like party hats, poppers and silly string to patrons at 11.50pm to add to the cheer - a nice touch to the evening! <br><br>One gripe would be how uncomfortably small the place was, I had the nagging feeling they were squeezing in as many table and stools as they could in every nook and cranny to fill the bar. But can&#39;t complain, since we did get a seat! <br><br>Great place to spend a rowdy night out with friends!",

My aunt and I could not help downing the soup even though we were already stuffed, and we went home with bloated tummys. The soup was spicy and a really good appetizer, and had two fresh prawns in the thick, gooey soup along with bits of egg. My auntie even went so far as to return to the shop to compliment the auntie on her soup, while I made it a point to revisit this shop in future for their yummy dumplings as well. The skins of the dumplings are not thick and floury, and hence enjoyable. With soup in the dumpling and tender meat, these dumplings win the usual expensive dumplings we eat in shopping centres hands down. Opening hours: 11.30am-8pm.",

"reviewcomment":"I used to stay on the second floor of this block when I was a child and I used to frequent this uncle&#39;s store whenever I came down to play tamiya cars or collect beer bottle caps with the other kids living in the same block. My favourite dish last time was always his char kway teow. Little did I know how famous he was until now. <br><br>After moving away from Bukit Merah at the age of 6, occasionally, we&#39;ll go back to visit my grandparents&#39; old friends at the temple nearby and the char kway teow uncle (as I used to call him). Recently, my dad had a craving for his char kway teow and we went back to eat it. However, the uncle has slimmed down quite a fair bit due to his age and he doesn&#39;t recognize me now as it has been a good 10 years or so since I have ate his char kway teow. He does recall my grandparents though. <br><br>So this time, instead of being the bratty kid that I was who only wanted his char kway teow with eggs and no beansprout, lard and cockles (which he always used to prepare for me as a child) I ordered it without removing anything and with chili. I took a photo of it and went on Instagram and Twitter promote it as my childhood favourite dish.. and out of curiousity I decided to google his store&#39;s name. To my pleasant surprise, I found out that he was actually one of the last great char kway teow men (<a href='/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fieatishootipost.sg%2F2010%2F11%2Fsheng-cheng-char-kway-teow-last-of-char.html&amp;s=3a22897715d0e309e7bb6e2fb414d81cc94c38a2f8f3659207bbe6d9c3a546c2' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>ieatishootipost.sg/2010/…</a>). Only then I realised how important this plate is because well, in a melodramatic sense, you can&#39;t get good and nostalgic char kway teow like this anymore. So in a way, this is a heritage dish. So if you happen to be around Blk 132 Jalan Bukit Merah, do pop by this store and order a plate of his char kway teow.",

Possibly the healthiest option at Tanjong Pagar Market. <br><br>Thunder tea rice is a mix of rice (choice of brown or white), basil, peppermint leaves, leeks, peanuts, anchovies, pork floss, and among others, all paired with green tea sauce. The amount of water added to the sauce varies, but it ranges from a sauce like texture (think marinara) to soup (think broth). I prefer the former as I like to coat my mix rice with sauce to keep it from tasting like dry cardboard but avoiding the congee version as well. Sadly, this stall will be moving indefinitely to Chinatown Point once renovations start. <br><br>Come one, come all! You have until Feb. 28!",

The onglet beef, my main course, was fabulous. Very flavourful and tender beef well seasoned , accompanied by the most authentic and rough cut pommes frites, and a shallot confit of caramelized shallots.

"reviewcomment":"Not once but many, I wish the Michelin rating system could be extended to include not only the restaurants but to outlets, in any form, as long as they offer exceptionally good food. Of course, the Michelin reviewer has to abide by a set of standard when starring a restaurant in the renowned Red Guide. So, why couldn&#39;t we rate ours to include the nostalgia, often appeared without a fanciful facade/service but displaying superior culinary skill. I feared losing these established heritage that exist even in our great-grandfather times; a good way learning about the past and not losing our roots. <br><br>Lately, I went to Chinatown to have another round of comfort indulgence. The place never fail to evoke a sense of calamity. It just brought back tons of good childhood memories I had with my late parents, of which, I feel sore when I know those were the days and it&#39;s not going to happen any more.<br><br>As I walked passed the atrium, towards the nostalgic People&#39;s Park Cooked Food Centre - I could see Toh Kee waving at me on my right. I was contemplating between Toh Kee and Lee Kheong roasted delicacy, the tug of war was hard to beat. Today, Toh Kee won the battle! Why? - Lee Kheong is GONE; I feel sore - my 2nd in a day! The new stall with a glaring yellow stall signage that reads &#34;95 &#34; (translated as &#34;95 roasted delicacy&#34;) stood in front of me. This surely wasn&#39;t the usual famous roasted delicacy stall I used to know. Lee Kheong used to occupy the unit, wasn&#39;t it? (Later in the night, I Google to learn that they have moved to 531A Hong Lim Market &amp; Food Centre, #02-15, Upper Cross Street. Closed on Sunday) Without clarifying with anyone, I head straight to Toh Kee. Clearly, I needed just either of them.<br><br>Toh Kee is notorious for their roast-charred duck; gradation crisp skin from light to charcoal hues. It shimmers loudly at you! How could you pass up? They have been dishing out burning hot roasted delicacies for a good 4 decades and each was prepared at the stall where one could witness.<br><br>I ordered a meal for 2 which includes a fair portion of char siew and a quarter roast duck. Pairing it up with a double boiled old cucumber soup and topped with some plain rice. Calorie-laden? I took the plunge.<br><br>The double boiled soup was full of solace - sweet natural taste without MSG and grease. I love the massive pork (soft bones) for its non-harsh pork flavor and their fork-tender texture. <br><br>We wolf down the generous portion of roast pork, each with a dab of unadulterated dark soy sauce. Although it didn&#39;t  reminds me of my mum&#39;s unique super delicious homemade soy seasoning, still, it makes a good condiment - not overly salty. The chilli dip was sweet and has a vinegary taste. I liked the charred bits on the roasted pork, adding a light crunch to the tender meat. The meat has a good mixture of lean and tendon-fatty parts. The braised soybeans are not similar to those &#34;bloated &amp; marshy&#34; slow-cooked appetizer served in many Chinese restaurant. The beans had their chewy texture retained and a whiff of soy.<br><br>The roast duck was exceptionally good. Hardly found the same in the food court, you just have to visit the Chinatown to get a good piece of charcoal burned duck like this. Without, it will be regretful. The skin wasn&#39;t entirely crispy but it has a light crunch at some parts. Under the skin, revealed a thin layer of duck fats clad with moist and meaty duck flesh. The glittering skin has a nice honeyed BBQ touch, beyond words. Some people keep away from duck for its gamey taste, but you will adore Toh Kee&#39;s roasted duck as they charcoal them beautifully, making it tasty.  <br><br>If you are game for some snacks, Toh Kee&#39;s sister stall just next to it: Chop Hean Kuan (#01-1018), sells delicious huge pork bun and some mighty deep fried char siew yam balls, among others. Check them out.<br><br>The meal cost S$19.20 but Toh Kee is worthy of.",

"reviewcomment":"We reserved a table for 2 during restaurant week, not knowing what to expect. It was a pleasant surprise that the ambience here was so refreshing and inviting. With the ingenious &#34;hexagonal&#34; motifs, along with their cosy chairs, this is a perfect place to spend the afternoon, just savouring the food and chilling to the soothing background music. The staff are attentive, and extremely pleasant. <br><br>The food was definitely worth the price. The restaurant week menu comprised of lobster bisque for starters, beef ragout for mains ($35) and the nutella chocolate tart ($14) for dessert. The lobster bisque was most delightful, and lucky for me, I managed to get the last serving before they ran out. It just goes to show how popular that dish was. The beef was nicely done, and well complemented by the sauteed vegetables and mashed potatoes. Ah, the dessert was simply heavenly, with bursts of bitter chocolate, perfectly combined with that sweet hazelnut chocolate. <br><br>Definitely a place I will return to, especially since one can always pop over for drinks at the bar at Scarlet Hotel (where Our Korner is housed), or simply go for a post-meal stroll along the idyllic Ann Siang Road district which has many quirky stores.",

"reviewcomment":"Fish soup is such a comfort food for me, and I had to try the ABC market&#39;s resident fish soup. The queue was pretty long, and right in the shop there worked a feisty, skinny uncle. With one hand, throwing fresh fish and fish heads into old-school metallic pots that rested on flaming stoves, he took orders with gusto and energy. I had a good feeling this would be a good choice, and decided to go for their fish soup with chu mifen. The soup was milky and slightly sweet, exactly how I liked it. The fish was very fresh, and didn&#39;t crumble despite being in the soup for a while. The garnish really upped the flavour factor of the dish, and the amount of vegetables in the soup also made it healthier (and easier for my conscience to stomach). I&#39;d return to this stall in a heartbeat! The bowl cost me $3.50, which is quite cheap considering that the average price at shopping mall food courts can go up to $5 or $5.50. But most of all, it&#39;s the uncle&#39;s attitude to serving his customers that wins me over. Polite, patient, and willing to converse with customers.",

"reviewcomment":"Great, great desserts and a yummy place to get local and Indonesian specialities. Growing up with all the traditional Kueh - it&#39;s always nice to walk by and just grab a few - even if it&#39;s just one or 2 pieces. From Ondeh-Ondeh to modern cream cakes - this chain offers quite a selection.<br><br>What I Love: My fave ones are the traditional options - from Ondeh-Ondeh, Talam Ubi, Kueh Salat, Dodol, Kueh Bugis, Corn Kueh, Kueh Jongkong, Sago Melaka  to Pulut Inti - it&#39;s really a plethora of flavors. If you want something less traditional, you could get the famous Pandan Sponge Cake, Swissroll and a few other cakes. Prices are affordable - and they&#39;ll pack it really nicely for you - depending on whether you&#39;re taking some overseas or for a party. I brought quite a bit of Kueh to Australia - and they were totally fine!<br><br>What I Don&#39;t Love: The good ones or certain types finish pretty early - so good to buy in bulk or get down earlier in the day.",

I love the hideaway on the 2nd floor vibe. wood, art and comic panels tables. <br><br>You wouldn&#39;t ever call this slick. Instead the coffee is reliable and full-bodied, I&#39;ve actually had it several times before I cut this review. A good sized cup latte for $5. Skinny and fat what have you. They are very new and plan to add to the food options. But along this stretch there&#39;s a dearth of reliable coffee since Homebodies closed down next door. They do soy but they have a bit of problems getting a consistent supply. Talked to the barista and their preference is for soy to taste like soy and not one of those which is so clean tasting it could be milk. When they do have it, it makes a tasty drink and I feel like I&#39;m taking care of myself ;)<br><br>This is the daytime visage of the Spiffy Dapper. Madi is the barista behind the Rancilio. He was last at Chye Seng Huat, but I&#39;ll say the coffee I&#39;ve had here is more consistent than at CSH.<br><br>I&#39;ve had the sous vide eggs. They were perfectly done. Very wholesome...ask for worcestershire and hot sauce with yours (that&#39;s how I take mine). The ciabatta is tasty and the kaya has a nice caramel flavour to it, it&#39;s not just pure sugar like some places. I love sitting at the bar looking at the various bottles of gin on display :D<br><br>Menu is currently a very short list but I keep finding reasons to come back.",

"reviewcomment":"I used to be a fan of Crystal Jade char siew bo luo bao which is available at most outlets around Singapore. The standard is not consistent and sometimes it&#39;s really soggy. The search for quality bo luo bao ended at Imperial Treasures Bakery, which i stumbled upon at Triple One. This is like hitting the Bo Luo Bao jackpot. It&#39;s awesome when it&#39;s out fresh, crispy and crumbly bo luo top which has sugar granules in it. Then you split open that soft pillowy bun to taste that nice caramelized honey pork (done the Cantonese style). This texture has not been found in dimsum joints in Singapore yet. <br><br>The egg tart is also to die for and they taste as awesome even if you leave them overnight. Of course it&#39;s better fresh. The buttery shortcrust pastry crumbles and melts in your mouth while the wobbly egg custard is almost slurpable. It&#39;s a definite must try. <br><br>I believe this is the only bakery by Imperial Treasures but I&#39;m glad it is still staying that way so as to maintain the quality of the buns. Yums.",

"reviewcomment":"OMG! Step aside Breadtalk and Four Leaves or any of the major chain bakeries on our island. Baker Talent has seriously awesome buns. <br><br>I first chanced upon it a few weeks ago when I got off at the wrong bus stop. I was curious about it as there was a standee proclaiming $0.90 for the golden sand bun. Now...golden sand did not sound very appealing to me as it did not tell me what was in it, and I was not about to go to the bakery and inquire. <br><br>Fast forward a few days, a friend posted a picture of the golden sand on FB and it looked absolutely delicious. Golden sand = salted egg yolk custard aka liu sha bao. Now I just had to make my way to Baker Talent to try it. <br><br>I finally made it this morning and bought the Golden Sand bun and the original custard bun. <br><br>The Golden Sand bun is really to die for, especially if you are a big fan of salted egg yolk. The bun was not that warm when I bought it. It was still pillow soft and encased a generous amount of the salted egg yolk which could dribble out if you are not careful. The salty sweet was just amazing. For that I would rate it 5 stars, and the clincher was it only cost $0.90. In fact, all buns I saw was under a dollar. The lowest price was $0.60 for the butter boom (I presume it to be butter bun). <br><br>The original custard bun ($0.80) was equally good but paled to the Golden Sand. Creamy custard inside the soft bun. A bit of caramelized crust in the center gave it a bit of oomph. I tasted some tartness and I could not make out where that came from. No, the custard had not gone bad or turned sour. It was like lemon juice dotted in a few spots. <br><br>I would definitely return to try the other buns. And the cost of 2 buns here is less or equal to a bun in Breadtalk. A very good deal for breakfast or snack indeed. <br><br>NOTE: It is a corner shop just behind the bus stop.",

"reviewcomment":"I usually do not eat Western food in hawker centres because the quality&#39;s usually doubtful; either the fries are soggy or the chicken chop&#39;s tasteless. But this one took me by surprise: the plate of chicken chop doesn&#39;t look like much, but when you bite into it, the flavor of the homemade sauce really comes out. It goes very very well with the tender firmness of the chicken. The fries are crisply fried and not at all soggy; they&#39;re not as good as Mcdonald&#39;s fries but definitely no slouch at all. And all for a very reasonable price indeed. <br>Do take note that they&#39;re closed on Tuesdays, and they normally start operating from about 6pm onwards for dinner. I also tried their pork chop and chicken cutlet; while both weren&#39;t as nice as the chicken chop, they&#39;re still very decent.

"reviewcomment":"We reserved a table for 2 during restaurant week, not knowing what to expect. It was a pleasant surprise that the ambience here was so refreshing and inviting. With the ingenious &#34;hexagonal&#34; motifs, along with their cosy chairs, this is a perfect place to spend the afternoon, just savouring the food and chilling to the soothing background music. The staff are attentive, and extremely pleasant. <br><br>The food was definitely worth the price. The restaurant week menu comprised of lobster bisque for starters, beef ragout for mains ($35) and the nutella chocolate tart ($14) for dessert. The lobster bisque was most delightful, and lucky for me, I managed to get the last serving before they ran out. It just goes to show how popular that dish was. The beef was nicely done, and well complemented by the sauteed vegetables and mashed potatoes. Ah, the dessert was simply heavenly, with bursts of bitter chocolate, perfectly combined with that sweet hazelnut chocolate. <br><br>Definitely a place I will return to, especially since one can always pop over for drinks at the bar at Scarlet Hotel (where Our Korner is housed), or simply go for a post-meal stroll along the idyllic Ann Siang Road district which has many quirky stores.",

"reviewcomment":"Fish soup is such a comfort food for me, and I had to try the ABC market&#39;s resident fish soup. The queue was pretty long, and right in the shop there worked a feisty, skinny uncle. With one hand, throwing fresh fish and fish heads into old-school metallic pots that rested on flaming stoves, he took orders with gusto and energy. I had a good feeling this would be a good choice, and decided to go for their fish soup with chu mifen. The soup was milky and slightly sweet, exactly how I liked it. The fish was very fresh, and didn&#39;t crumble despite being in the soup for a while. The garnish really upped the flavour factor of the dish, and the amount of vegetables in the soup also made it healthier (and easier for my conscience to stomach). I&#39;d return to this stall in a heartbeat! The bowl cost me $3.50, which is quite cheap considering that the average price at shopping mall food courts can go up to $5 or $5.50. But most of all, it&#39;s the uncle&#39;s attitude to serving his customers that wins me over. Polite, patient, and willing to converse with customers.",

Instead the coffee is reliable and full-bodied, I&#39;ve actually had it several times before I cut this review. A good sized cup latte for $5. Skinny and fat what have you. They are very new and plan to add to the food options. But along this stretch there&#39;s a dearth of reliable coffee since Homebodies closed down next door. They do soy but they have a bit of problems getting a consistent supply.

When they do have it, it makes a tasty drink and I feel like I&#39;m taking care of myself ;)<br><br>This is the daytime visage of the Spiffy Dapper. Madi is the barista behind the Rancilio.

"reviewcomment":"I used to be a fan of Crystal Jade char siew bo luo bao which is available at most outlets around Singapore. The standard is not consistent and sometimes it&#39;s really soggy. The search for quality bo luo bao ended at Imperial Treasures Bakery, which i stumbled upon at Triple One. This is like hitting the Bo Luo Bao jackpot. It&#39;s awesome when it&#39;s out fresh, crispy and crumbly bo luo top which has sugar granules in it. Then you split open that soft pillowy bun to taste that nice caramelized honey pork (done the Cantonese style). This texture has not been found in dimsum joints in Singapore yet. <br><br>The egg tart is also to die for and they taste as awesome even if you leave them overnight. Of course it&#39;s better fresh. The buttery shortcrust pastry crumbles and melts in your mouth while the wobbly egg custard is almost slurpable. It&#39;s a definite must try. <br><br>I believe this is the only bakery by Imperial Treasures but I&#39;m glad it is still staying that way so as to maintain the quality of the buns. Yums.",

"reviewcomment":"I&#39;m going to give Fei Fei 4 stars for quality and the 5th star is borne out of my sense of achievement at actually getting to the end of the line!!  I was sure there is an element of Singaporean Line Syndrome at work producing the serpentine queue in front of Fei Fei Roasted Noodles.   Finally, all it took to renew my faith in Singaporeans was the first morsel of tender honeyed char siew ().   Singaporeans are discerning after all, not just joining a queue because its there, they compliantly queue for a good reason, and Fei Fei&#39;s char siew is as good a reason to stand in line as any.<br><br>The noodles are good and done to somewhere near al dente. They fight back just enough to clearly distinguish them from the utilitarian food court variety.  The wantons do an honest job of holding up their part in the play, but it is the char siew, apparently drab on a plate of color, that truly surprises.  <br><br>To my eye, char siew is usually an unholy shade of crimson not usually found anywhere in nature. When I see a strip of roast pork loin that is that color, my palate has already begun to anticipate the chewy, gnawy, experience of poorly prepared and dispassionately seasoned pig flesh.   This was the first thing that struck me about Fei Fei&#39;s char siew, it was drab.  There were muted tones of burgundy peeking through an eschar of crispy, carmelized fat and honey.  This was a whispered promise of something truly special.  I had to stay in the line and find out;  it (the char siew) did!    The crispy burnt bits were as I had imagined, sweet caramel, salty fat, crisped sinew.  The meat was almost fork tender, and if it had been, it would&#39;ve failed.  Char siew CANNOT be fork tender, which is why making char siew as good as Fei Fei&#39;s is an art, it shows that the si fu has the experience to know better and to be restrained in not only the seasoning but the roasting to produce tender but not fork tender, and flavor that permeates the very core of each piece of char siew.  There is no pigginess left, only absolute bliss.<br><br>I&#39;ve been coming here for a while, but have only recently found the words and the forum to share.  Thank you, Fei  Fei!  Thank you, Yelp!",

"reviewcomment":"Let me start off by saying that I am an egg whore. I love eggs in any way, shape, or form.  Put an egg on it, in it, with it, I don&#39;t care - I&#39;ll probably eat it. Judge me all you want, I&#39;m not ashamed. Just a heads up that this review may be a bit biased. Also worth mentioning - Chinese egg tarts (also known as dan tats) were my snack food equivalent of crack and largely contributed to my &#39;food is love&#39;, lonely fat kid days.<br><br>For a mere $1.30 you will be handed the world&#39;s most perfect snack. The custard portion is very lightly sweetened, delicate, and seriously smooth. It&#39;s served warm, breaks cleanly (see pic), and for lack of a better word, tastes nice and egg-y. A dan tat is slightly richer and denser and its&#39; custard filling will be distinctly golden in color and &#39;perfectly&#39; unblemished. In contrast, the Portuguese style egg tart is less sweet, lighter in texture, and is characterized by a beautifully caramelized surface.  Charred, browned eggs, you say? Oh, tis a good thing...<br><br>The buttery, flaky crust has just the right hint of salt and leans more towards an airy puff pastry then say, a shortbread type crust. I can&#39;t wrap my head around it, but the custard has that consistency of a steamed custard but the crust itself has that &#39;straight outta the oven&#39;, golden brown taste every single time! <br><br>Anyways, go get yourself an egg tart...you won&#39;t be disappointed.

This is where you go when you miss Australian candy (Allen&#39;s, a wider range of Arnott&#39;s biscuits), American candy bars (for the longest time the only source of Reese&#39;s), German chocolates, British candy, etc. I&#39;m not quite sure how stock works because not everything is available all the time (but the jellybeans never seem to go away), so part of the fun is to drop in to see what old favorite or new discovery there is in today. <br><br>There is also a large loose candy counter, so you can buy things by the piece to sample or share.",

There is both Chinese and Malay food offered here, and an air-conditioned room on the 2nd floor for those seeking comfort. I hadn&#39;t known about this place long, in fact I had only come to know of this place as a result of the coffeeshop art project, but I am glad we had been a part of the coffeeshop&#39;s closing and learnt a lot more about the state of coffeeshops in Singapore through their experience. Although the sign said muslims only, they gave us free food anyway including side dishes and drinks, a generous gesture on the eve of hari raya haji. The chicken rice was tasty as usual and the service friendly, making their last day a joyous affair. There is the possibility they might relocate in the future, which we really hope it does, but it will never be the same from its bustling location at Bugis.",

There were many stores selling similar snacks in the past, but they have all since faded away with this one standing survivor here in Singapore. <br><br>My favourite pretzel is the cinnamon pretzel, with additional caramel sauce to satisfy my huge sweet tooth. I&#39;m not sure if this is the right way to eat the thing, but I&#39;ve always bitten off the rounded ends, and dipped the straight ends into the sauce and biting it off with the other hand. It still tastes the greatest when eaten this way! <br>I love how their churros taste as well; they remind me of going to amusement parks!

The naans are chewy and fragrant and go very well with the oh-so tender chicken tikka, which is roasted to perfection and accompanied with ample cool minty sauce and veggies.

Then again, it&#39;s not a very &#39;exact&#39; comparison since MOS&#39; burgers are Japan-ized.<br><br>What sets MOS Burger apart from other chains IMO are the extra care &amp; love put on each dish. I feel that little quality is compromised, unlike those other more commercial ones.<br><br>Most of the burgers are great, but make sure you try the butterfly prawns too.

"reviewcomment":"This place has great carrot cake. You can choose either two varieties, black or white. I usually go for the black as that version as stronger taste due to the black sauce which they use.<br><br>A plate nowadays costs 2.50 which is still a very decent price for carrot cake compared to eating in a food court where you probably have to fork out 3.50 or more. However, as their business is so good, be prepared that the stall will sell out by around 8pm so don&#39;t come too late.",

"reviewcomment":"Da Dong and I go way back, to even before I was born. This is the place that my great grandfather used to bring his granddaughter, i.e. my mum for dim sum when she was a kid. So yeah, this place and I, we be homies yo. <br><br>It&#39;s since been acquired by the Fatty Weng group, which usually spells disaster for food quality. However, I was pleasantly surprised that the dim sum is still decent, and in my opinion, better than the likes of a drink tea establishment located just opposite. We swung by on a Tuesday afternoon, looking for lunch. Strangely enough, we were the only table of locals, and the other customers were all foreigners milling about Chinatown, ordering dishes of chilli crab and jugs of beer. *coughtouristscough*<br><br>Our orders: Big bao, har gao, fried carrot cake, fried bean curd skin and shrimp chee cheong fun. Big bao was so big, it had to be cut into quarters. Fluffy bread, soft juicy chunks of chicken and an inch of chinese sausage graced the interior. The chee cheong fun was silky and came tightly packed in a roll, rather than the limp flat thing that I&#39;m used to outside. Fried carrot cake was a smooshy goodness in a crisp fried exterior, and I gladly burnt my tongue in haste to stuff it into my eat hole. The har gao was of generous proportion, but a bit of a miss as the skin got dry and hard when left aside for too long. Fried bean curd skin was good, though the most ho hum of the lot. I haven&#39;t been here in ages, but am impressed that the standard hasn&#39;t dropped at all, and that everything seems to be made from scratch. <br><br>The bill cometh, and for five items, it set us back $22.85 - rather affordable in comparison to the likes of the drink tea establishment nearby. Need to return to Da Dong as soon as I can round up more dim sum kakis.",

"reviewcomment":"This place completely surprised me when I stumbled upon it, with its peaceful atmosphere and decent brunch. It&#39;s in a corner of the Alumni House, so I guess not many full-time students know about it.<br><br>The decor of the restaurant is actually quite bare-bones. There&#39;s nothing really warm or inviting about the place, and I didn&#39;t feel like it was very comfortable.<br><br>The hand-written chalk board menus on the walls added a dash of personality to the restaurant, but there&#39;s just one problem: that&#39;s all the menu you&#39;re going to get! They don&#39;t print out the menu on paper at all, and it becomes a pain to read scribbles on the wall after a while. I suggest newcomers to stand aside and digest the menu instead of holding up the queue.<br><br>The food, on the upside, didn&#39;t disappoint! I had the corn beef mash and it was absolutely fantastic. The wholemeal bread was toasted to perfection, and the runny eggs on top of mashed potatoes and beef almost brought me to heaven.<br><br>I didn&#39;t like the eggs benedict as much, though. It was strangely too sweet, I think they put some caramel in the sauce. The salmon was a bit on the fishy side, which I didn&#39;t like.<br><br>All in all a great dining experience, and a must-try if you&#39;re on campus!",

"reviewcomment":"I know you must be thinking, who doesn&#39;t know about Starbucks. But what&#39;s special about this Starbucks is its location. Most branches are situated in crowded or popular areas like shopping malls or famed shopping streets like Orchard Road or Bugis Street. Not this one. The outlet is hidden in an office building at Buona Vista, which means that its usually quite empty on a weekday morning or afternoon. <br><br>It is extremely accessible, just a short walk away from a few bus stops and the soon-to-come One North MRT station on the circle line. Do take note that it is also near to several schools like ACJC and Fairfield Secondary School, and may oget a little packed after school hours or during examination periods. If you plan to visit on a weekend, come early to secure a good seat, especially if you need a powerpoint. <br><br>It is one of the perfect spots to spend a quiet day alone regardless if it is to read a book, write, study or just watch the world go by. The staff is also extremely friendly and willing to go the extra mile to make your day. I&#39;ve seen on various accounts whereby staff members ask around for those willing to share a seat to help other customers that are looking for a seat to enjoy their beverage or food. Customer requests are also taken seriously, like heating up a muffin for only 5 seconds. These little acts are an excellent show of professional service levels, another reason why I keep coming back.",

The taste is also different - this is milky and quite &#34;heavy&#34; in taste - it&#39;s also less sweet - the matcha tempers the sweetness and adds this pleasant element of &#34;bitterness&#34;, and you really get the contrast.

Grass jelly over their special shaved ice, topped with sweet red beans, bubble tea pearls, and what can best be described as gnocchi... made of sweet potato and yam. Pretty phenomenal.<br>What&#39;s so special? That grass jelly has a stretchier consistency, which gives it a little more bite (yes, I know I&#39;m fine-dining-describing grass jelly), and that shaved ice isn&#39;t ordinary ice - it&#39;s ice made from grass jelly water, so your dessert is never watered down.

"reviewcomment":"Four Seasons Hotel in Singapore generally has very good dining establishments and One Ninety is no exception. I adore their Sunday brunch with its freshly shucked oysters and meat grilled to perfection, and its martini bar where the alcohol was poured into an ice sculpture where it traveled before reaching the glass so as to keep it chilled. I am not sure if this is a standard feature every Sunday or just that time. Pretty cool to watch even if you don&#39;t drink. Food is fresh and service is attentive. <br><br>I also love its lunches. It has become my new favorite place for a relaxing bite in the afternoon. Besides the a la carte dishes, you could do the mezze lunch - appetizers and dessert buffet (small but comprehensive) or with a choice of mains. The main portion is not huge so it is quite a good addition if you want more meat or seafood in your meal. The staff check on the buffet selection very often so it is replenished very quickly.<br><br>The Buffalo mozzarella with fresh tomatoes are awesome, likewise for the salmon dish (don&#39;t remember the name) where the salmon is so tender it can melt in your mouth. The cheese spread is equally good. <br><br>It is also a good location for a business lunch as it is not very noisy. <br><br>Yelp Feb 2014 Challenge: 5/28",

"reviewcomment":"This place has uber long queues on weekends and it comes as no surprise, really. Their chicken rice is so fragrant, and is infused with so much flavour. Love their chilli too, it has a hint of ginger and is really tantalising. If you&#39;re not sure what meat to go for - take my advice and choose the char siew over the roast chicken, or get both together. The char siew sauce (I bet there&#39;s some secret ingredient there) is both rich and sweet, the best kind IMHO. The servings are decent and start at 2.50. <br><br>Previously, they used to serve to patrons&#39; tables (if you were not tapaoing) but now I think the stall is one woman down (their daughter) and you need to self serve. But still, worth the queue and the wait. If you don&#39;t want to wait, either come after 2pm or before 11am.",

"reviewcomment":"The current &#34;king&#34; of Singapore (Nik) introduced me to this and what a wonderful find it was. I am glad I tried it. I hardly eat curry chicken noodles because<br><br>1. never a big fan of Chinese style chicken curry outside of home<br>2. &#34;it is fattening&#34; being ingrained in the mind by the media and others<br>3. those I tried before were lackluster and a total waste of the precious calories<br><br>This version totally blew the mind. I like the subtle smokiness of it and I believe it is from the chili on the side. Mix the chili into the noodles to get the maximum taste out of it. The chicken is very tender (white meat) and the taupok is thoroughly soaked with the gravy. The whole ensemble is just so good. Maybe I like spicy food but I do not think the gravy is particularly spicy. It is just nice to me.<br><br>I will definitely be back for this in future. Thanks Nik, for the recommendation.",

"reviewcomment":"Do you know what happens when a caterpillar moves from the lush greens of Raffles Place to the boon docks? It shrivels up and despairs over the lack of food options and $0.70/pc yong tau foo, cai peng that costs an arm and a leg (not that I eat cai peng to begin with) and soup spoon copies *ahem souperlicious*. Oh the horror the horror. <br><br>So what does a green bug do? Venture 10 minutes north to Raffles City for more palate-pleasing environs. Today, I decided to try the mix your own salad option at Sumo Salad, to get some good fibre &amp; all that jazz in my system. I ordered the 5 free toppings (which include &#39;premium&#39; items at other chains like walnuts and almonds), added some avocado for $1 and tandoori chicken for $2.50. On pricing, Sumo is relatively cheap for proteins and premium items and they are generous with the servings. And if you ask for the less common proteins like prawns, they&#39;ll cook it on the spot (at least they do that at Holland V). So +1 from this bug. Finally, I picked a de-seeded mustard dressing , though I wouldn&#39;t have minded at all if they left the seeds in to tickle my bellay.<br><br>How was the salad? Luscious. The lettuce was crisp, cold AND evenly chopped. Ingredients as I mentioned were generous and well-sized aka no teeny shreds like what you&#39;ll find at SaladStop these days. The dressing I had tasted like it was made from scratch, though I think the more common ones like caesar and ranch are from Ken&#39;s. My salad was also very well tossed so there wasn&#39;t clumpy gunk hanging off the leaves, which is what bugs me alot at Soup Spoon (corny pun intended). <br><br>I&#39;m definitely coming back regularly for my salad fix in the future. Massive props to the team at Raffles City and the Sumo Salad chain for maintaining standards.",

"reviewcomment":"I like bubble tea. I like bubble tea, like, A LOT, and I have to say this is my ultimate favourite. Most people like to call me an ah beng, which explains why I hang around Cineleisure a lot, which is where a Gong Cha outlet is at. I swear, everytime I go to Cineleisure which is about 3 times a week, I treat myself to a cup of bubble tea from there. <br><br>One thing I really like about it is that customers are allowed ot choose the level of sweetness we like our bubble tea to be, and being a really fussy customer, very few other bubble tea brands are able to cater to my picky palette. I do not like my bubble tea too sweet, and the 25% mark on this baby always hits the spot just nice. Moreover, not only are the pearls chewy, but they are so succulent and wonderfully sweet, which is a huge plus for me. I will probably be patronizing this outlet for as long as I keep going back to cineleisure.",

"reviewcomment":"What the Mid Autumn Festival a.k.a. Mooncake Festival spells for food reviewers is the endless supply of mooncakes that threatens the waistline and jawline. While i enjoyed the innovative variety of snowskin creations from the various hotels, i found myself craving for something different, something savory. My cravings must have been heard by the good people at Thye Moh Chan, who sent over some salty teochew mooncakes to neutralize all that sweetness. <br><br>I wouldn&#39;t call them mooncakes actually because they are more like the &#39;piah&#39; (chinese pastries) that i grew up eating. I love the salty tau sar piah (mung bean paste pastries) since young and hence i really enjoyed the savory mooncakes that Thye Moh Chan offered. <br><br>TMC has been handcrafting these ethereal-light flaky pastry skin with a selection of fillings laboriously by hand since 1943. My mama was raving about them when we walked past the store at Chinatown Point previously. Needless to say, my little old lady left the store with a huge bag of traditional biscuits. You could imagine her happiness when the mooncakes arrived. I didn&#39;t even get a chance to get a proper picture before she dug in. <br><br>Sweet or Salty tau sar (single yolk) Medium (4pc/box) - $24.80, Large (1pc/box) - $22.80<br>The sweet and savoury mung bean filling each enveloped a single salted egg yolk. The sweet rendition is topped with white sesame, while the savoury encompasses a blend of salty mung bean paste with fried shallots, white sesame and is seasoned with white pepper. They crumbled very easily and i found that it is easier to scoop each slice up with a spoon so that you can taste all the filling.<br><br>My favorite flavor was the Yuan Yang! Medium (4pc/box) - $24.80, Large (1pc/box) - $22.80<br>It is similar to the Salty tau sar but on top of that, there&#39;s spicy pork floss in them! ZOMG. I guess that&#39;s also some of the Breadtalk influence as they have been running under the Breadtalk brand for a while now. Not that i&#39;m complaining. The pork floss adds on that tinge of sweetness which gives this mooncake a more complex flavor. Super yums!<br><br>There&#39;s also the rare Durian flavored one during this MAF period. Limited quantities of this smooth D24 durian-infused bean paste and crispy pastry could be purchased only at Thye Moh Chan outlets for $35.20 for 4 medium sized mooncakes.",

The pizza is a bit on the dry side, but good. <br><br>This is really the place to come if you want to share a bottle of wine with your friends (or maybe just with yourself.)

Nobody dines alone here. <br><br>While there is such a wide array of dishes to pick from (yes, they all taste heavenly but you&#39;ll get a heart attack when you see the results in your next health check-up), I highly recommend their cheese and butter naan and chicken tikka.

The naans are chewy and fragrant and go very well with the oh-so tender chicken tikka, which is roasted to perfection and accompanied with ample cool minty sauce and veggies. It&#39;s finger licking good!

So yeah, this place and I, we be homies yo. <br><br>It&#39;s since been acquired by the Fatty Weng group, which usually spells disaster for food quality. However, I was pleasantly surprised that the dim sum is still decent, and in my opinion, better than the likes of a drink tea establishment located just opposite. We swung by on a Tuesday afternoon, looking for lunch. Strangely enough, we were the only table of locals, and the other customers were all foreigners milling about Chinatown, ordering dishes of chilli crab and jugs of beer. *coughtouristscough*<br><br>Our orders: Big bao, har gao, fried carrot cake, fried bean curd skin and shrimp chee cheong fun. Big bao was so big, it had to be cut into quarters. Fluffy bread, soft juicy chunks of chicken and an inch of chinese sausage graced the interior. The chee cheong fun was silky and came tightly packed in a roll, rather than the limp flat thing that I&#39;m used to outside. Fried carrot cake was a smooshy goodness in a crisp fried exterior, and I gladly burnt my tongue in haste to stuff it into my eat hole. The har gao was of generous proportion, but a bit of a miss as the skin got dry and hard when left aside for too long. Fried bean curd skin was good, though the most ho hum of the lot. I haven&#39;t been here in ages, but am impressed that the standard hasn&#39;t dropped at all, and that everything seems to be made from scratch. <br><br>The bill cometh, and for five items, it set us back $22.85 - rather affordable in comparison to the likes of the drink tea establishment nearby. Need to return to Da Dong as soon as I can round up more dim sum kakis.",

"reviewcomment":"This place completely surprised me when I stumbled upon it, with its peaceful atmosphere and decent brunch. It&#39;s in a corner of the Alumni House, so I guess not many full-time students know about it.<br><br>The decor of the restaurant is actually quite bare-bones. There&#39;s nothing really warm or inviting about the place, and I didn&#39;t feel like it was very comfortable.<br><br>The hand-written chalk board menus on the walls added a dash of personality to the restaurant, but there&#39;s just one problem: that&#39;s all the menu you&#39;re going to get! They don&#39;t print out the menu on paper at all, and it becomes a pain to read scribbles on the wall after a while. I suggest newcomers to stand aside and digest the menu instead of holding up the queue.<br><br>The food, on the upside, didn&#39;t disappoint! I had the corn beef mash and it was absolutely fantastic. The wholemeal bread was toasted to perfection, and the runny eggs on top of mashed potatoes and beef almost brought me to heaven.<br><br>I didn&#39;t like the eggs benedict as much, though. It was strangely too sweet, I think they put some caramel in the sauce. The salmon was a bit on the fishy side, which I didn&#39;t like.<br><br>All in all a great dining experience, and a must-try if you&#39;re on campus!",

"reviewcomment":"The Salted Caramel Bubble Tea at I Love Taimei may be one of the best drinks I have ever tasted...in my life...no joke!  I like to select 25% sweetness level, which enhances the rich and creamy flavor of the drink.<br><br>We enjoy indulging in the combo meals, which include your choice of chicken cutlet, side and any drink on the menu.  My favorite combo is probably the Ella (extra crispy) chicken cutlet with chili spice, the tofu fries with curry spice and the salted caramel bubble tea...truly a magnificent dining experience!<br><br>PARTING THOUGHT: The only downside is that the preparation can be a bit slow, so if the line is long, you may want to go do some shopping and check back later!",

If you like to cook, you will love it here. If you like interesting alcohol, come here. Buy an empty bottle in various sizes, do a tasting, fill your bottle.

"reviewcomment":"Jeremy H is right, this joint has been around a very long time. In fact I can remember when there was a very small car park out front where you could safely leave your car curbside forever without risking a ticket, which made this a great pit stop and place to just chill out.  It also made it accessible.  These days there&#39;s absolutely no need to risk a run in with the LTA since the Holland MRT exit is right on the doorstep of this grand old lady of a &#39;bucks. <br><br>The store has also recently been made over with a nice brightly-lit minimalist interior.  I have mixed feelings about the change from the cosy, slightly dingy and definitely kitschy, stuffed couch dimly lit HV &#39;bucks of yesteryear.  It always made me feel like I was hanging out at a cooky aunt&#39;s parlor. This looks like a proper coffee shop now. I&#39;m sure unencumbered by nostalgia, any visitor to Starbucks at Holland Village will feel welcome and be impressed by the shiny clean interior. <br><br>I still love coming here and you could do a lot worse than giving them some of your time and money to luxuriate in clean minimalist comfort whilst you plot your next Yelp check-in.",

"reviewcomment":"Before and after the renovation, this branch of Cold Storage was, is, and probably always will be my favourite branch.<br><br>There&#39;s a spectacular cheese selection, decent deli choices, plenty of vegetables and fresh herbs, including a organic veggies section, and many many many frozen foods.<br><br>There&#39;s just a good solid range of pantry filling foods to be found here, and it&#39;s my go-to place for aimless grocery shopping. I always find something.<br><br>To be fair, Fairprice IS cheaper, especially for vegetables, so if you have a quick need, that&#39;s usually cheaper, but for good looking veggies, harder to find stuff like different kinds of creme (double, thickened, whipping, fraiche, clotted), buttermilk, rice milk, hazelnut milk, you&#39;ll find all of that here.<br><br>Maybe it isn&#39;t such a great place if you&#39;re lactose intolerant, now that I reread what I&#39;ve wrote, but still.

"reviewcomment":"Well well, what can I say about this favourite supper place of mine? This is the best fishball noodles that I had. A regular bowl of noodles costs $3.50 and has three fishballs, one tau pok filled with fish paste and one fish dumpling. To add one more of everything (aka jia1 liao4), it will cost $5. I feel the serving size for $3.50 is kinda small. <br><br>After ordering, you will be given a number. You can choose to stand around awkwardly watching others savouring their noodles. Or you can go to the corner Muslim coffee shop and have a sup kambing (at least that&#39;s what I did. Lol.)<br><br>Do expect:<br>- Soft and bouncy fishballs<br>- Pork lard spammed springy mee pok (even better with chilli)<br>- Fish dumplings that are amazingly delicious<br>- A bowl of soup that is there for the sake of being there. <br>- Up to an hour of waiting time<br><br>My friends and I always head there around 9 odd at night for supper and the place is packed. But since I really like their noodles, I find 30-45 mins of waiting time still okay.",

"reviewcomment":"Cedele&#39;s has always been one of my favourite places to dine, be it a brunch or dinner. They have a great selection of food, from all day breakfast to pasta to burgers to cakes which all come with one promise - healthy food that tastes good.<br><br>I frequent this particular Cedele&#39;s a lot, as there is usually no need to queue to get a seat for two people. My favourites here are the Rose&#39;s Laksa Pasta which is a chicken curry-eqsue pasta that comes with tender bits of chicken and tastes like rendang, and also the Fish Pesto Garlic Pasta that comes with a huge serving of fish, with the pesto and garlic really complementing each other very well. The all day breakfast is also good, but the sausage tastes a bit too healthy for my liking.<br><br>If you&#39;re looking for something light, go for the soup and bread bar where you can just order one soup and get free flow bread (self service, of course). They have such a variety of bread that you&#39;ll definitely find something you like.<br><br>And for dessert, Cedele has an awesome range of cakes to choose from. My favourites are the carrot walnut cake and the chocolate truffle cake. The first is a hearty, creamy cake while the second has a rich, chocolatey taste.<br><br>I don&#39;t think you can really go wrong with Cedele&#39;s, and furthermore their prices are really decent seeing that they don&#39;t add on for GST and service charge.",

"reviewcomment":"pretty good cantonese dimsum at the cathay, and a good choice for fine-chinese-dining where there aren&#39;t many options in this category. I&#39;ve been here twice now, so it&#39;s definitely good enough to warrant a return visit, but I must say that the paradise chain does it much better for me (and with varying price points to suit your different moods as well, such a good thing) - the food here is pretty decent, though service can be very harried - they never really seem to have enough staff, though when they are tending to you they do a pretty good job. it&#39;s more of a bring-the-parents sort of place, rather than one for manic-scoffing-down-of-liu-sha-bao, as I&#39;m prone to crave.<br><br>it&#39;s a cosy little restaurant - any more packed and it&#39;ll start to feel a little too tight - with modern decoration and illustrations of days-gone-by female mandarin popstars mounted on the walls. the only windows here are on a rather dim side of the building, which means that even during the day time, most of the light isn&#39;t really streaming from outside and can feel a little claustrophobic, especially when it&#39;s packed to the rafters. kitschy, and modern, but with an old-school feel.<br><br>photos here: <a href='/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fandmorefood.wordpress.com%2F2013%2F02%2F22%2Fthe-cathay-restaurant-town%2F&amp;s=647619cf92bf1a8909580a0b31e4fe1d0dd2d7e6808b5598b4849a4d71333f80' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>andmorefood.wordpress.co…</a>",
